*music* Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Gregor O'Halloran and I'm a freelance writer at Resident Advisor. This week's guest is legendary British DJ Carl Cox, who I met recently to discuss his long career. The conversation explored his beginnings as a mobile DJ in the 70s. his involvement in the acid house explosion in the UK at the end of the 80s, all the way through to his long-established relationship with space in Ibiza. All of this was set against the background noise of the cicadas at Carl's Villa here on the island. Yeah, where I was born. This is always something which interests a lot of people based on that most people think I'm American. So I have to put that point across to say no, I'm British. Born in Manchester, Oldham. I was only there for, I would say, from birth, six months of my life. So I actually don't really know what it's like to live in Manchester or even anything to do with those sides. But on my passport, that's where I was born. My family, me and my two sisters, mum and dad, moved from Manchester to South London. where I grew up. We first went to a place called Tootingbeck and then from Tootingbeck we went to a place called Carshorton. Carshorton basically being just on the outskirts of South London. anywhere past that and then you'll start going into a place called Bancestead and Epsom Downs and then you start going on to the M25 and then if you keep going around the M25 then eventually you head yourself down to Brighton of where I actually live now. But growing up really I grew up in the late 60s in the streets of Carshorton. I went to an infant school there called Tweedow. And then I went from my secondary school was a place called Glastonbury High School for Boys, which was just on the other side of a place called Rose Hill, which is just about half a mile away from where I live. So I used to walk to school there and back every day. And for me, this was basically where I truly grew up, was in South London, just on the outskirts of Carshall. What was your musical heritage during this time? Well, the thing about my musical heritage was always about my exposure. My exposure was that my father would buy the records. He would go to HMV record stores in Sutton, Surrey, on Sutton High Street. and basically buy the 17 singles. And at the time it was Sam Cooke, it was Wilson Pickett, it was Isaac Hayes and early Diana Ross and all this kind of Tamela Motan sound and the R&B sound. My dad used to play these records at home. And then also because my family are from Barbados, my dad used to also play calypso and soca music. So I was exposed to hearing this music as well. But also my mum really enjoyed a little bit of country and western. So Dolly Parton, any Jim Reeves, Perry Como, that got thrown into the mix as well. So I really had an eclectic upbringing when it came to music. My dad would always enjoy playing the records he loved to hear. at parties dinner parties that used to have at the house and i mean i was like five or six years old so i would always be in bed by the time my mum and dad had friends and family around the house and all i would do is hear the music so it took me quite a while to get to sleep really uh based on the parties that my mum and dad used to throw not every night but the thing is about a barbadian family any any opportunity to have a party then my mum and dad would have one And that's what I basically grew up with, with my dad exposing me to a lot of music at the time. Who were the first big artists for you as a teenager then when you were growing up? The first big artist really was, I mean, David Cassidy, T-Rex, Mark Boland, Slade, Shiradi Wadi, Casey of the Sunshine Band, Lou Rolls, Dwayne Eddy, Elvis Presley, of course, the Jackson 5. The Osmonds. These are all the people that I grew up with in my teens, actually. You know, the Basie Tirola's been, wow, one of the biggest bands at the time. The Beatles, of course, are coming through. Elton John, I remember buying his album Saturday Nights Were Right For Fighting. I loved that album. With Betty Taupin, his co-writer at the time, he wrote some amazing songs. Grew up with Pink Floyd, listening to Dark Side of the Moon album, I wish he was here. Really, I kind of really got into listening to all types of music and growing up with all this type of sounds, because a lot of my friends also were Led Zeppelin fans. and I'll be on the other side listening to the OJs. For me, there was always this split divide between what I'd like to hear and what I would like to play. So, of course, I wouldn't play Led Zeppelin, but I would definitely play the OJs. When did you take the first steps to becoming a DJ or being interested in playing music yourself? Well, basically, when mum and dad were having parties at the house, at the time, I mean, this is the technology as we know it, we had a record player which had the ability to plug in also a mono tape recorder. And you had a switch that you could switch between phono and auxiliary or phono and tape. So what I used to do is to stack the records up. My dad basically said, you know, he caught me looking down the stairs to see what noise was about downstairs. And I would just be listening to the music downstairs. And then my dad one day caught me looking down the stairs and he said, look. You can either go to bed or you can come downstairs and put these records on because with 7-inch records, they only used to run for 3 minutes 15 seconds long. So a pile of 10 records used to go through it quite quickly and my dad was always happy to man the records and choose the ones he wanted to play and then keep going back after being the host for my family and friends. for mum and dad's family and friends. So he thought it'd be a really good idea if I did it. So this was your first gig? So my first real parties were at home, being a DJ, DJing to my mum and dad's family and friends. And I didn't know really what I was doing. All I knew is that these records made people dance and enjoy themselves. And then eventually what I did was to record some of the music so I can basically have an opportunity to keep the party going. So rather than going, right, well, here's 10 records. Now I have to take the 10 records off the spindle, put another 10 records in, and then play those 10 records. Well, that was all dead. time and dead air to me so I just used to then switch over to tape let the tape play the records the next set of records and I used to write them down what they were so I didn't play them twice and then load up the next lot of records and then switch from phone from tape to phono and then carried on the next selection of 10 records and for me that was my well I didn't really know what I was doing but what I did know I kept the party going so that was my early early initiation of mixing records together. As a result of this, Carl Cox Mobile DJ was born, is that right? Yeah, for sure. My career really did start as a mobile disco, and at the time it was called Astral Disco. And I've always been interested in the stars and the moon and all that sort of stuff. But what was quite funny was that I've got quite sensitive skin and the only cream that I could use at the time to keep my skin supple and soft was Astral Soap Cream. So I thought that would be a really good name for a mobile disco, Astral Disco. So I used to put the stars and stuff on the card. And then I had an opportunity to set up my own mobile disco unit. If I could show the Prince's Trust that I could have a thousand pounds worth of equipment, they would put a thousand pounds in for me to be able to create a small business. And that's how I started, was from the Prince's Trust. And with that, I opened up a bank account, I spent some money on the Yellow Pages, and I put money into advertising, of course, as a mobile DJ, because my dad had a really good selection of music anyway. I eventually went out and started buying the music that I wanted people to listen to and play anyway. And I just found myself, when I went to school, taking a record player to school, and the downtime that we had in the school hall, play records to my mates. So then my mates would be like, well, you know, if you can do this at school, can you carry around my ass and do my birthday party? And then already when I was 14, 15 years old, I really had a fan base of people who wanted to listen to Carl Cox play records. And then one day the school wanted some entertainment, so they asked me if I would... bring my stereo along and play records to the kids at the school and that's what I used to do. So I used to do all the school discos and then I had my big gig at a place called Carshall and Hall for about 500 kids and they said, oh, can you bring your disco along and perform? I said, yeah, no problem. So I got the biggest speakers I could find, took my mum and dad's speakers as well and amplifiers. All of this is home domestic stuff. It wasn't like the stuff that we hear that we're used to listening to today. So I plugged all these speakers in and made sure I had all the omid right and all the wattage rights for the amps and everything. But of course, when you put your sound system out of a... school hall or out of a bedroom or even out of a front room and he put it into a pretty big space my sound system was sounding like a set of headphones and after about an hour it blew up and no music for the rest of the night and I got booed And they were like, oh, you're rubbish. If you're going to do this, you're going to need to get yourself a sound system. So my mum used to run a catalogue, a mail-order service called Freeman's at the time. And inside there was a mobile disco unit called FAL, F-A-L, Future Acoustic Limited Systems or something like that. and it wasn't the very best sound system but at least everything was integral so he had two turntables, he had a mixer and he had an ability to put more sound and equipment on it and for me that was perfect It was £585, this system, and I wasn't really earning any money at the time. I was doing a milk round and a paper round. At the time, £2.50 or £3 a week I was earning from the paper round. That's a lot of money in those days. Yeah, it really was in the 70s. I was bringing it in, but I had to get up bloody early to do this paper round and really early to do the milk round. anything to do for me to earn some money just so I can basically say to my mum, you know, could the system cost for me to buy £2.50 a week? If I could pay £2.50 a week and then my mum would get the system. So I think it was for 52 weeks or something like that and then I was able to keep paying my mum and pay off for the equipment and therefore I... I then had the ability to then do the school discos, the house parties, and the school hall. And of course, I got the obligatory rope lights, the obligatory traffic lights, kind of sound-to-light traffic lights. And then I would get a smoke machine, all that sort of stuff. But when I got the Princess Trust grant, then I was able to spend a little bit of money on my mobile disco. And then within doing a mobile disco, I mean, I played... all types of music, all the pop music that was around at the time, Adam and the Ants and that sort of stuff. But at the back of it, I was always playing R&B and soul music. And for me, this was important because that's the music that I grew up with through my father. But that's also the music that I really enjoyed playing. And also... It was the music that made me feel very happy. So when I got to play that music in front of an audience, when I was listening to the OJs and Isaac Hayes and that, and they were dancing and really enjoying it, for me that was exactly where I wanted to be. So even though you were playing eclectic music and pop music and right across the board you still felt that your own sound was being developed at that time? Yeah, definitely. The thing was that I had an affinity with black dance music. I had an affinity with the urban sound of the time. I wasn't really into pop. music at all it's just that if other people wanted me to play pop music then I'll play it because that's the job as a DJ at that time but for me it was it was also important to have an identity based on the reason why I do what I do because I mean I at the time to obtain all this music the only way to really find out what was going on out there was to listen to if you could any of the American radio shows that were going on going on at the time Hot Mix 5 WBLS, anything to do with dance music or mixing music. I had friends that would go to America and record the shows and bring it back to me. And I would hear all these amazing hot tunes. And then we used to have Tommy Vance from Radio Luxembourg, Pirate Music Radio Station, which I used to... listen to at night and then also Radio London and Bobby Vincent I used to listen to him and Jeff Young of course and Craig Edwards at the time was at Capital Radio and he would be playing all the very best dance music from America so I used to you know wait for them to tell me what the record was, write it down, then I would go to the record shop and try and find those records. And that's what I did week in, week out, day in, day out. Before I went to sleep, I would stick on the headphones on and try and listen to Radio Luxembourg, Tommy Vance, and he'd be playing some amazing music that had just come out at a time in America. And for me, this was my basically schooling. This is how I... started to understand the artist's development and where people were making this music that was really heading for the dance floor, not just to be listened to. And for me, that is exactly what I was looking for. How did you make the development from being the mobile disco DJ in the late 70s to developing that into something more serious and professional? Well, there was two facets to me at the time. One side of it was to do with sound systems and the other side was to do with a DJ. And the thing is with the sound system, when I got my mobile disco unit, it was never good enough. So I built it. I went from having a sound system which had 500 watts to a sound system which had... 30,000 watts. And one of the reasons why it got so big was A, I went to college, Carsonwood College for electrical engineering and had another friend of mine called Leroy James. Between me and him, we would develop and make our own equalizers and make our own amplifiers and make our own speaker boxes. And with that, and Leroy's father was a chippy, so he would make all our scoop bins or W bins, according to the time, for our bass and our mid-range. And our top end was always a tweeter called Pizos. And he'd put them on the line, and then from the top end, clarity-wise, this sounded the best. So in the end, when I basically built the Colcox sound system... Any wedding that I used to do just used to rock because there was a bass line you could feel, a mid-range you could hear with the vocals, and a top end which gave the clarity. So in the end, I had the most undeniable mobile disco sound system you could ever get at a wedding reception. And for me, this is how I really got my name. based on, I mean, I used to DJ anyway with the sound system, but what was happening eventually was the sound system was getting more bookings than I was as a DJ. Eventually, when the whole rave scene started, and that's another story, I used to always ask for my sound system to be used first, and my DJing was always something that was seriously secondary. So I had to basically make the split divide to say, OK, I can only do one of the two here. I can either have the best sound system in the world or become a DJ, because that's where my calling was anyway. I sold off my sound system and then I carried on pursuing my life as a DJ. Tell us about your experiences of Acid House arriving in the UK and the Summer of Love in the UK. The arrival of Acid House for me was a great moment. But like anything, at the time, the music I was playing was R&B, soul and funk music, hip-hop. from the early 80s all the beats were 87 BPM, you know, if not slower. And anything above that was considered disco music. And I really enjoyed disco music and kind of enjoyed high energy music. That's where, for me, that I came into my own. That's the sound that I wanted people to really know Carl Cox for because that's the sound I was looking for. I mean, I enjoyed my funk and I enjoyed my soul and I enjoyed my hip hop, but it was time for me to move up a gear. and to really get people to move on the dance floor and to basically show out. And disco music and high energy at the time was all about that. So as soon as I heard the first Acid House record, which was called Chippy, Time to Jack, as soon as I heard that record, I was like, yes, this is it. This is exactly where I want to be, and I want to push this music. as far, as fast as far as I can possibly take it. And then when I started playing this type of music within the funk and soul parties that I used to do and the warehouse parties and the house, people thought that I had absolutely flipped. What is this music? It's all for gays. It's too fast. It's got no soul in it. It's got no funk. It's not going to go anywhere. It's just a fad. And here I am. after all of that, and all of those people that said that, or all the ones that are on the dance floor still today. But I knew that it was a start of an evolution of music, of what was going on. I knew that this music is unstoppable. And not only that, I mean, I was like a one-man band. I was like a one-man crusade. I didn't have the joys of a collective like Paul Ockerfold had when he came to Ibiza and he had Danny Rampling on board and he had Pete Tong on board and Nicky Holloway because as a collective, then they came back from Ibiza, they set their clubs up and they had their club nights. And I was still just a DJ that had a sound system that enjoyed this music. But I never had an outlet for it. But what did happen was that my sound system would be the very thing that would get into the rave parties in and around South London, North London, anywhere you choose, any of these parties that happened. my sound system would get used and then sometimes the DJ wouldn't turn up so therefore I could get my small selection of house music or Acid House at the time or Garage and play the music and then the promoters were like actually you're pretty good and I'm like you know I enjoy this music and I spin it in the way that I feel that it should be played so oh okay well we book you and the sound system you know but then of course the money got split divide by you know well we don't know he's a dj but we'll put the sound system but we can give you 50 quid on top of the sound system i said well 50 quid 50 quid you know it's i'm glad to be a part of of you know of the collective of djs that get will get played like frankie fonzett paul trouble anderson noel watson trevor fung the list goes on. And then you had underneath it, this small little right cold cocks, you know, underneath it. But that is how it started for me. And then eventually, some of the more predominant ray promoters, like Energy and Sunrise for sure, they started giving me top billing. And not only did they give me top billing, it was only because... I was also selling tickets as an outlet for Brighton, for the South Coast. So that was the deal. I sell you tickets, you put me in the line-up. And they put me in the line-up really early, so they just get me out of the way. But the pressure was too strong because all the people that went to the parties, any of those parties, were always... very interesting what I played, how I played it, and why wasn't I playing any later. So they got pressurised to put me into main slots with everyone else. But then I had to then decide what to do with that sound system, so I sold it off to these guys from Brixton. So they carried it on, and I think the sound system is still going today, but only at the 9-0 carnivals. But for me, I then decided to push myself as a DJ wholeheartedly. And this is where it started to get really interesting. At that time, the festivals you talk about, the Orbital Raves, Energy and Amnesia House and all this type of thing, that was kind of the defining moment for you. to really push your name as a DJ then, wasn't it? Yeah, at this time, I mean, I was on nearly every flyer after this. Not that I played on nearly every one of these parties, but I would try to make every one of those parties for sure. But also then I started to make a management company as well because a lot of stuff was going on within that. period of things that was happening and uh and people would you know we'd we'd do like a business card to say call cox if you want him at any rave party and uh and there was no real contract sign it was it was like well if you play for me uh amnesia house and it is here's 100 quid you know to do an hour and at the time it was good money you know good good enough you know But it wasn't all about that. It was the fact that I was able to play my music to these people. And then I'll turn up and they'll say, oh, no, it's 75 quid. And I said, no, we didn't say 75 quid at all. And it just turned into a bundle. We've got to get the money back one way or another. But I didn't go there for that. I went there to be respected based on the reason why all these people were coming in the first place. Even if I charged a pound and there was 2,000 people in there and those people came to see Carl not 100 quid, then for them to tell me it's 75 pounds. So I had to protect myself against all of this. And then eventually I started up a management company called M&C Promoter. MFC management company which was Maxine and Carl's management company at the time and so therefore people then didn't speak to me anymore I spoke to Maxine and Maxine really was hard as nails with everybody she was you know we'll sue you if you don't pay him we won't turn up if you put him on the flyer and all of that is the reason why most DJs are managers today because there was no structure for it there was no handbook based on how do you book a DJ? It was eventually, you know, these companies had to arise and FXTC, which is one of Lynn Cosgrave's companies, was obviously responsible for leading the way in the sense of how DJs got managed. And also for me, I went from MC management promotion company to World One Ultimatum or Ultimate Music Management. And for me, we had 25 DJs, we had three live acts, all being represented by Carl Cox and my ex-wife at the time, Rachel Turner. We both basically decided that this is the way to go. And then, of course, when we started working out the figures of how much money these people were earning, that had to be reflected on the DJs. So the DJ still wasn't earning... I mean, but it was respected by what they could bring to the table from a financial point of view. It was important to be able to be, I would say, respected by that token. Otherwise, you just get basically steamrolled, like I did quite a few times. able me to then create my own management company. For people who aren't aware of what the orbital raves were about and how the parties actually happened, can you describe from a kind of first-hand point of view what it was like for you being involved? Yeah, me being involved in a lot of these orbital raves was, again, it was exciting. It was really good fun because it was kind of cat and mouse with the police. And also it was, you know, out there, there was an underbelly of people who wanted these parties to happen somewhere. You know, at the time, society was pretty bleak when there wasn't much. soul music being played in a lot of the first leisure clubs. Everything finished at 2 o'clock in the morning. You had to go home and then you ended up in a taxi queue having fights at fishing chip shops, this sort of stuff. It's all repressed really. We needed something exciting, something that we needed to feel part of, something that we felt that this is for us. So, basically, the whole kind of all-night party thing really did start off from a lot of warehouse parties at the time that was playing funk and soul music at the time and disco music. And this warehouse music was really good, but the music was still from yesteryear. There wasn't anything that was happening now. until house music basically was that predominant 4/4 kick sound that was driving everybody insane. So for me, I was right on the cusp of all of that based on that, A, I was utilised as a ticket outlet for Brighton, so anybody that I could basically influence to come to one of these orbital raves and to see something else. You know, I have two drivers, me being one of them in a transit minibus, and I had to have two minibuses taking you to a mystery party somewhere around the M25 somewhere. So we used to set off around about 2 o'clock in the morning, and none of us had any mobile phones. It was all... to do with pages and red telephone boxes. And hopefully he had enough 2p's and 10p's and 50p's to make that phone call to find out, to go to the one number that you would get at that time in the morning and an answer phone message would tell you exactly where the party was at that time. So therefore the police couldn't react on where the party ended up because it was too late. And so it all became a little of a military operation, the whole thing, purely based on where you was going to end up. And where you ended up was on an airfield somewhere, a farmer's back garden, it was a paper mill somewhere. All these amazing locations. I mean, we can't use any of them anymore. But at the time, it was really exciting. When you ended up at a place called White Waltham, a place in Popham, at an aircraft hangar, and you get there and there's all these lasers and lights and sound system and the DJs are just playing great underground techno and house music. And for me, that was it. I wanted to find as many of these parties as possible. to go to because we don't know when it's going to end and if it does end at least we would have lived the moment based on that these parties were for us. It was during this time you also became renowned for playing on three decks something which you kept doing for years basically afterwards how did that come about? Well many years ago at home I always wanted to perfect the art of mixing music And I learned from a difficult point of view, I couldn't afford to have Technics turntables because they were expensive, they were nearly £500 a shot. I didn't have £1,000 just to spend on turntables and then another £1,000 on a mixer and I had already spent... all this money on my sales system and that at the time. So I used to do a sales system for Paul Oakenfold on a Friday night in Streatham, a place called Ziggy's. And Paul basically said, well, if you're going to be working for me, why don't I give you the money we earn and for the money that you earn, you can pay me back from a week to week basis. I thought, great. So I ended up with a Rolls Royce of turntables. And then I started to work on perfecting that. But then another friend of mine called Ray Locke, he also was able to afford a set of turntables. So I used to borrow one of his. And so now I've got three turntables and basically I perfected the art of mixing two records together. Now it's all about having those two records in the mix and then working on a third turntable. Now I didn't want the third turntable to be something like you put on like whale noises or sirens or whatever. I wanted people to understand that that third turntable is as important as the second one or the first one. So the idea was just to use all three of them, and by that token, you could remix any record that was popular at the time. So, you know, say like French Kiss by Little Louie, for instance. Most people would have one record and then mix that record into something else. But I had two copies of that record, and I would mix it. acapella or something on top of that so I would remix French Kiss within itself and then throw somewhere else some other vocals on top of that and then people instantly heard a mashup bootleg based on free turntable mixing which interested everybody they never heard anything like that before and I've never done anything like that before so it's new for all of us and all the time I was booked to do the free deck turntable mixing it was a novelty for everyone to see, okay, this guy can't do free turntables, let's see him mess up in this sort of stuff. And I just wouldn't, and I didn't, because I had already practiced it at least four years before I did it. So it wasn't like, okay, I can do it, and then I'll get on, and I'm totally rubbish. I knew when I'd get on and do it, that this was my art. This was my calling and this is where I am right now and basically pushing the creativity and the elements of DJing beyond itself. This was Traktor before Traktor. big time live as well, no sync button in this house. It was all to do with my ears, my coordination and my belief of the way how that came out. Because eventually, all the flyers that came out to push Cole Cox's name was all based on free turntable mixing. And there were some seriously defining moments by what I'd done. Even for me, I still don't understand even today. how much that meant to a lot of people based on how I did that. And now, I mean, I emulate that today by using four turntables from Pioneer CDJ 2000s. But the artistry was really, you know, having those two records in a mix and then mixing the third one. Because it was kind of like spinning plates, you know. You get one plate, you spin it. You get another plate, you spin it. And you get another one, you spin it. but then you've always got to go back to the first one because it's slowing down. You go back on the first one, you spin it again, you get it back in the groove. Well, this was what it was like playing three turntables. It was something that you had to basically really be aware where the mix was and what you were trying to do, because also it could make it sound really cluttered, too much going on, you know, non-silence. I can't hear what you're trying to do. So I would really just choose the most popular records and then remix those live. And that's what basically got me through the realms of all the big name DJs. As dance music moved into the early 90s, I first remember you as kind of like a hardcore DJ more than anything else. How did you take the step from there to becoming kind of a more mainstream club DJ, if you like? Yeah, a lot of it is to do with popularity. I mean, even if I was playing commercial or underground, I mean, some of those records I played were more or less speed metal. It had nothing to do with commerciality. It was like... It was like 180 BPM, the biggest kick drums you could think of, the noisiest, brashest sounds you could possibly hear. And I used to cross that line. I played those records. And that's what made me popular. People knew that I would start at one place and then seriously end up somewhere else. And that was... In between playing the constraints of that sound, in the middle would be the balance between overground and underground. Because again, I would be playing some of the more popular records, but underneath it all, you had this wave of the underground sound, which even some DJs wouldn't even dare to cross. But also the whole jungle scene and the tribal techno and all this sort of stuff. I used to mix them all up. I mean, if you hear any of my sets going back in the day, there was always a kick drum on the breakbeat. And this was the Colcox sound, the kick drum on the breakbeat. Because before it was either kick drum, techno, or breakbeat, rave or drum and bass. And so I was one of the only DJs to play this sound. sound again you know my persona was even more so based on I was able to cross cross over on both sides of the fence. In the early 90s as well you enjoyed kind of brief commercial success as a producer can you describe what how that came about and your sort of producing days? Yeah this was quite bizarre because I always was toying and messing with records at home and I Want You Forever, which got signed to Perfecto Records, which was Paul Oakenfield's record label at the time. he felt that if I did something, he would represent it. So I used to play a record called Success in Effect, and I want you, the vocals from an American artist called Victor Romeo, made a track called Love Will Find a Way, and I just love the vocals on this track. So I would basically do this live and put the beats together and create this song. And Paul was like, well, if you could put that together in a studio, I'll sign it. So we also had a producer called Martin LaSalle, who was a great pianist as well. And he did the piano line in the track as well. So I had all these beats, and then there was a song. There was a piano line and a song to this track. And I think this was one of the first true rave records that had song appeal, which crossed over. Because when it came out, it just went number one in all the dance charts. all over the country, which I couldn't believe. I was like, oh my God, what's happened here? My phone was ringing. Did you realise in Cool Cuts chart, and you realise in Record Mirror, and this, and this, and this, you're number one, number one, number one. I'm like, wow, that's phenomenal. We need to take a step back. And then the next thing, do you realise that your record's gone top 40? He went clean into the charts at number 32. That was the first week. I was like, my God. And the next week he did. Do you realize he's gone into the charts at number 21? I'm like, oh my God, that's a jump. Normally when you get a dance track like that, it goes down, not up. So we had some really good sales. So this was a big impact for me, big impact for the scene. Of course, now I became a pop star DJ. I wasn't just a DJ playing music to the masses at the time of all the race parties that are going on. I'm now the guy you see on MTV. I'm now the guy you hear on the radio on rotation. I'm now the guy that you used to know from this point on, and now I'm seen on a different pedestal. So I suppose at that time you could call me the David Guetta of 1991 because for me, you know, people, then I was getting a whole new crowd coming towards me now, not just the Ravers. So this was a situation where I had to decide where I wanted to be. Do I want to be a commercial radio-orientated DJ? Or do I need to get back to my roots based on what I feel comfortable with? And after about two or three releases with Perfecto Records, it wasn't meant for me. I decided to go much more underground and basically carry on to what I feel I can do best. And not only that, get back to playing house music again. So that's what I decided to do. So all my parties in 92, 93, 94 was Colcox house set. Colcox house set. So no more speed metal, stomping Gabba records. It was all about getting back to... where I felt I belonged. You mentioned there were a couple of follow-up tracks on Perfecto that I think had, again, reasonable chart success. Do you find it difficult producing? Do you find that's a natural thing for you? Is the studio a place that you like being? I'm a creative person. I like to have the opportunity to create. I don't think I shouldn't be doing it. I think I should be a part of... It should be a part of my career as someone that's basically played everyone else's music the whole time. My whole life has been about supporting other people and within my own self, when I hear records and I want to remix them or maybe put a different bass line in, that's creativity. That's something which I'm adding an essence to someone else's music. And also, I mean, because of my background, I mean, I grew up with jazz, funk, soul and techno music and all of this kind of sound. I've always incorporated it within my own music. So I'm kind of being someone that when it comes to making my own music, I'm being selfish because that's the kind of music I want people to know me for. I don't want to be known. for someone that just made music for commercial reasons because my life as a DJ and what I've grown up with has always been respectful towards music, musicians as a whole. And if I'm being inspired by something which I feel that I can basically represent, like the Detroit sound for instance, I love the Detroit sound because there's emotion in the Detroit music. And even if it's not the sound of today, it doesn't matter because even if you played this music in the next 20 years, it will still sound great. For me, that's the reason for making music. So, you know, I haven't... rushed to make successful records like that. I could if I wanted to, but I just don't, I can't stand and feel good about it at all because it's just not what I'm looking for when it comes to me making music. So that's why all the music I've ever made, all the remixes I've ever done, It always has an essence of what I believe to be what represents me by anyone asking me to do anything when it comes to making music. And if a record stands out or it gets used for an advert or it goes on a movie or this sort of stuff but doesn't have the commercial success, it doesn't matter because someone's seen the good in the reason why they've taken that record in the first place and I feel good about that knowing that there's at least one person out there that actually believes in the music that I've made. And it's not reflective on me as a DJ because it hasn't changed anything at all by having records in the charts or not having records in the charts. It's just great. I'm kind of under the wire. I make records and remixes and they come out and they do their thing, but they don't get the exposure like a lot of other artists do because I think people are not looking for Carl Cox music. for dub fire music i'm looking for loka dyson next release or richie horton's next release oh my god richie's brilliant album i've got to get it whether it's good or bad um for me karl kock's album i'll give it a listen but you know it is the way that it is perhaps one of the most um commercially successful projects you were involved with was the fact mix series which sold you know hundreds and hundreds of thousands of copies um why was that concept so successful do you think I think a lot of it was because it was all done in innocence. It was kind of... I had a reason for doing that album. The reason was, at the time, I was playing a lot of trance, melodic trance, a lot of good techno records. I did quite a few remixes at the time as well so I can basically show people that I was involved in supporting new acts and that sort of stuff. I think Quench being one of them, one of Laurent Garnier's acts called Rez, I did a track for him. I did a few of my own tracks on the album as well, a track called Motorway I think was on the album. So there was quite a few... products and quite a few Colcots remixes on it but also that sound wasn't represented in the UK at all that music and but I was playing outside of the UK a lot. So I was playing Holland, I was playing Germany, I was playing Italy. A lot of this music that you hear was from Europe and of course some tracks from Detroit and also a lot of music, some music from the UK as well and Australia. So it was a collective of all this music that I enjoyed from a worldwide perspective that I put as a collective onto the... this album and what was really amazing is that react records at the time they had this compilation out called bunkers and Bonkers was one of their biggest selling albums that they've released, and I think they sold like 15,000 or 18,000 Bonkers compilations. So they were thinking, well, Carl Cox was an individual, because Bonkers was something which was like all the big rave hit records, and they were happy enough doing those. combinations and I thought well maybe Colcots release maybe 18 22,000 sales respectively and we're like yeah okay that sounds good so we did a deal based on that when we promoted the album we did all the artwork for it I did all the sleeve notes thanked everybody from worldwide to help us out bringing all these records together and I basically both of those mixes were done one time no computers all mixed by me, straight off the back. I went into my studio, stroke garage at the time, and I said, right, I'm going to do this album, and I just did it like I did it live. and I managed to get a really good quality DAT recording, put it through a processing deck. When I sat back and listened to the mixers, I listened to it again, listened to it again, could I have improved on it? And I said to myself, no, they're done. Mastered them, got them to react. They listened to them, they were blown away. Woof, this is amazing. We'll make 25,000 copies. You know, maybe they might have a few left over. In the first week of sales, they were sold out. Where can we get more? All the record shops that they had them, HMV, whatever, Virgin, where can we get more? So they did another 25,000, sold out. They did another 25,000, sold out. And within the first three months, we sold 100,000 pieces. I'm thinking, bloody hell, this is nuts. And there was still more demand on it. So what was great about this album was that people were talking about this album. You have to buy the Carl Cox Facts album. People were really excited by the music, by the way how I produced it, the reason why. And it was off the time. A lot of those records on there were up to 155 BPM. But that was what was going on at the time. Myself, Swim Mavs, DJ Dagg. Mark Spoon at the time were all playing pretty tough records but I wanted to represent that sound as well but within it there's some real amazing beautiful melodic moments of trance music of where the truances of trance came about was because of Fact Album so React kept kept selling this album and eventually we think we did just under 300,000 releases we went to a silver series went to a gold series I had to accolade at home I was just thinking wow now that I don't think that's ever going to happen to me again in my lifetime but obviously people really took that album to their hearts and most of the time when people associate me with techno and house music or trance music the fact album is always the thing that comes comes to people's lips. And then I did a Fact 2, which came out on Moonshine Records, and then I did Fact Australia, based on that. I was also representing that sound of Australia as well. Around this time at the end of the 90s, you were also involved heavily in the essential mix for BBC Radio 1. What impact did that have on you? did that have for you on your career? Well, the thing was about Radio 1 Essential Mixers, I mean, they certainly had an audience for that. And at the time, Eddie Gordon, who was basically running the musical direction for Essential Mix with Pete Tong, Eddie had a plan based on that. that if I did an essential mix for South Africa or did an essential mix for Holland, essential mix for Germany, I was basically being set up for the big one, Essential Mix 2000. But Radio 1 at the time was really pioneering and championing this house and techno music movement from a worldwide perspective. When the Manilium came, Radio 1 decided that they wanted to do a... Well, first and foremost, sorry, I think most of it came about based on that they did a Radio 1 essential... Sorry, Radio 1 roadshow. here in Ibiza at Space and what they did was that they had their after party at Space of where I basically turned the terrace into their after party and it just became legendary and we recorded that show from the Kolkhoz and the terrace and then that went on to the Essential Mix which was one of the most listened to shows at the time. And that mix was really listened to a lot based on that we had mics in the room so we could get the atmosphere from the people screaming and having a good time. And this really was a good bolster for what Radio 1 wanted to do next. So they called upon a few DJs all over the world, Sasha to play South Africa, Sanchez to play New York. and this kind of thing, Pete was going to be somewhere in Italy or something. And they worked it out that every hour up until 12 o'clock that they would have a DJ play somewhere around the world. But when it came to me, I mean, I'm sure they must have asked other DJs about what I did next, but... Nobody wanted to take up the challenge of performing two maniliums in one night. So they said, and they said it can be done. They said, well, if we get you to Sydney, Australia, you play Sydney and it'll be the first party that happens for Radio 1. So I started the whole... radio show for me being in Sydney and of course it's like 1.30 in the afternoon in England or in Europe but it was 12 o'clock for me and everyone was so scared because of the Y2K and everything and everyone's going to go back to zero the end of the world is nigh we're not even going to hear a broadcast everything's going to blow up or break down and we did the whole countdown 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 In the year 2000, boom. And broadcast started, all the fireworks going off and everyone screaming and cheering and hugging and kissing and all sorts of things going on. I played a track called Fanfare for the Common Man by Emerson, Lake and Palmer, which was completely apt. And then I just went into all the big records that came out over the last 10 years of what got me where I am today. And the emotion and the sound and everything, I mean, you can still find this recording, was phenomenal. So for one hour on the radio, every record I played, the crowd were going completely nuts and completely crazy. to the point that once we had done that broadcast, I played for another two more hours in Sydney and then basically went to get a flight to Hawaii to go back in time and go and do the whole thing again in Hawaii. And so therefore, by the time I did all of that... it would go past their 12 hours and then they'd get me to do the last broadcast. And this is where most DJs did want to do it because they thought, I'm not getting on a plane headed towards the Y2K. So what Qantas Airlines did, they basically put on one of their oldest planes. So if anything technically did happen, any of the pilots could get hold of the plane and fly it because most of the modern planes are flown by fly-by-wire. But meanwhile, when Radio 1 asked someone to do it, I put my hands up and I said yes. I didn't know what I'd let myself in for to be honest but because the travelling aspect of it was so super tough because I hadn't slept really excited got to the other end and it was 7.30 in the evening they haven't had their 12 o'clock yet I've just done it all the balloons and fireworks and everything and then I just played into Fox Television Network and all those radio shows how was Sydney they heard it was amazing this is brilliant what are you going to do tonight and I was just like oh my god I've got to do this whole thing again and I went on again 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 Happy New Year Hawaii Have we just done this? Let's start talking about Ibiza a little bit. When was the first time that you came here? First time I came to Ibiza was in 1984. I came with my girlfriend at the time, Maxine Bradshaw, and my sister Pamela. And I just wanted to explore the island. I read a few books based on that the clubs here were the very best that you're ever going to see and the sounds you're ever going to hear. So I was quite interested by that. I didn't know too much about the island apart from it is what it is. It's an island. And for me, there was a place for the British holidaymakers to go, which obviously is San Antonio, the West End. So that was my first port of call coming to Ibiza. So we picked up this hire car, this little Fiat Panda, drove it from the airport on this dark road. I had no clue where I was going. All I did was follow the bright lights. And I didn't really have a lot of money at the time. I mean, if I had any money, I'd spend it on records. I'd spend it on bus fare. I'd spend it on clothes, of course, and stuff like that. So I only had enough money to really go to the clubs, have a half-decent meal in the daytime, spent some money on a med-ped so we can get around on the scooters. at the time and then it was time for me to go exploring so we didn't even have enough money to go even to have opportunity to go to the hostel so what we used to do is that we slept in the car for the first three days on a car park next to Eden which was chaos before that and the Star Club before that and this story really I'll go past the car park now and I just can't believe that I did that stepped in the car because when the sun came up it was just beating down in the car like a greenhouse opening up the windows And me and my girlfriend at the time, Maxine, we were like, look, whatever money we have, we have to get a room somewhere. This is ridiculous. So eventually we got two hostels, one from my sister, one from me and Maxine. £5 a night or something like that. But obviously we couldn't eat as much as we would like. We kind of ate into our dinner money until the time we were there. So I decided to come here for a week and explore the clubs and the scene and the vibe here. And I fell in love with it instantly. I've been back to Ibiza every year since then. What did you, which clubs did you go to then the first couple of years you came here? What experiences did you have in the clubs here? My first club that I came to was Star Club, which is now Eden. And big club. I mean, it was all painted in white, semi-outdoors, fantastic. The sound system was okay. kind of loud but no real bass and a lot of top end and the music they were playing was like pure Euro trash and I was like this is terrible the music sucked but the clubs were amazing and then I went to Summum at the San Jose and that's still there today and this was an awesome club the sound was great a little bit smaller But I kind of liked the idea and the DJs there were playing some really good stuff there. And then I would save up to go to Koo Club, which is now Privilege. And before it was Privilege, it was one of the biggest open-air venues I've ever been to with a swimming pool in the middle of the club, unheard of. totally and palm trees all around the outside and everything and we still looks quite impressive today when he when you go there as a club but um obviously a lot has changed since then when the roof went back on the clubs it changed everything but i went eventually i went to uh amnesia again at the time i went at no roof on the club you're dancing under the stars and eventually under the sun i just loved that um And I used to go to a club called Angels that was in the city. And this club had a balcony going around the top, but it had a slide from the top of the balcony right onto the dance floor. So I used to go, right, meet you on the dance floor. I'd go around the top, wee, poof, onto the dance floor and start carrying on. I loved that. Angels is not there anymore, but this club was awesome. But my number one club on the island was Space because, A, You'd go there at 7 o'clock in the morning. I can't remember how many mil it was to get in at the time, pesetas. I'm sure it was 10 mil or something like that to get in. And once he did get in that club, that club wasn't for everybody because if clubbers went out, they went out until seven. They didn't go to a club from seven. So you would get the hardcore that would go to space. And I was definitely one of them because I loved going into the terrace. It was open air. He had a random block and Alex P playing music on the outside of the terrace. The decks were behind the bar. There was no DJ booth at the time. But it was very cool, very cruisy, very chilled. But then inside was techno music being played by some really good Spanish DJs playing some great techno records. And most people that were at Space never went inside. Too cold. too dark and too hard. For me, I loved it. That's why I went to space. And I'll never forget it. Every year I came to the island, every year I'd be at space. 7 o'clock in the morning, waiting with everybody else. And I used to run into the club. There'd be hardly anyone in there. That's about 300 or 400 people maximum. And some parts would be really busy and it'd be like, yeah, really going on. Most of the time, no one inside. Too cold, too dark. So everyone would be outside, sunglasses, hanging out, having a couple of beers, loads of girls and that around and stuff. And it was a really good scene. But most of the time, I was inside that club and I was up in the... podiums i was down on the floor i'd be on the dj booth i loved it that was like my playground and then of course eventually uh i got to play in my hallowed ground eventually when was the first time you actually played a gig out here in ibiza then my first official gig was was going back to 19 i would say 19 1990 where um i was basically playing for a guy called ment who's not around anymore unfortunately, God rest his soul. But basically he used to do a party in Worthing and he wanted to take that concept of raving from Worthing to Ibiza. And the club that I got to play through Mensa was... Chaos and Sumum and both of these clubs for me are the very best time out it was just awesome to actually officially go in as a DJ under Cole Cox and as you can imagine for me to be able to through these clubs and they play the music I love playing them and also we'd been on the island a few years before that I knew exactly what to do that would really get people really rocking on this island and then once the name got out that I was playing here then I was asked to play Manly Mission and then on a Monday night obviously it's a very big crowd I mean, he mentioned. And I was asked to play at Pasha as well for a DJ called Alfredo. He respected me very much. I've known him a few years before I was asked to play at Pasha. But as soon as I played at any of these clubs, and then all the clubs would want cold cocks. This was obviously really great for me, but one of the biggest problems I had was accommodating everybody. Because if I didn't accommodate Amnesia or Pasha, they'd be like, what's the problem? Why do you want to pay for our club? We pay you more money. I'm like, look, I just, I will get round to everyone, but no one club's bigger than anyone else. I enjoy all of them. But also my sound was being split between what the Pasha sound is and what the Amnesia sound is and what Manimisha sound is. And I couldn't find... my own Carl Cox defining sound. So being at Space with that techno club inside, for me, that's where I need to be. But also because I played house music as well, I also enjoyed playing the Terrace when that all got devised as well in the early days too. So I would always play a house set on the Terrace at Space and I'll always play... techno set or techno orientated set inside space when did you first start playing for space I first started playing for space this was through react records because I had the fact album out and react or coming out and react James Horrocks thought it would be a really good idea if I did a a gay night for them for React Records at Space. And then this is where Fritz and Pepe, the two co-owners, Fritz is not there anymore as a manager, but Pepe certainly is still today, saw me play, saw what I did with the crowd. and Pepe really was like we need to have this DJ player at our club you know it took him a few years before I eventually went as a resident DJ there but Pepe saw something in me to feel that he could support me in anything that I wanted to do at that club tell us about the DJ booth in space, I think it was for a Radio 1 party you mentioned earlier, the position was moved and that completely changed the whole vibe of how the terrace was. Yeah, all the time that I was going onto the terrace, the DJs were playing behind the bar. I'd never seen that before, you know, and you had to back towards the people. to all the people and everything it was like so when Eddie Gordon asked they said right we want you to do a party on the terrace I was like where? there's no way I'm playing the DJing from the bar so we spoke to the management and said okay if I I'll put my mobile disco head on now So if I was going to do a party here, where would I put everything? So we got some sort of wallpaper-based table. And so we got that out and said, OK, this DJ booth needs to go here. And eventually we opened the doors and Radio 1 were thinking, oh, we're going to have about 200 or 300 people turn up. 1,200 people came. The place was chock-a-block. The sound system was flat out. I couldn't get no more out of the house. I'm looking at Pepe again. We need more sound. We don't have it. All the red lights are on on the amplifiers. I'm thinking, please don't blow up. This is such a good party. Everyone absolutely loved it. And then when Pepe saw how that night was, or that day was and the night was, because I played minimum six hours. That was a true Ibiza moment. This is where things really started to take off for space in a sense of the terrace now became where the legends are made, where the DJs are now on a world stage basically based on how that party started. And I was a very big part of that whole beginning. Meanwhile, they did need to develop a DJ booth, sound system, soundproofing. set up monitors, crowd control barriers, this sort of stuff. And then the next week, the booth was built and the DJ booth area was created with monitor systems and everything. And it was all repainted and it was all really... I'm thinking, how did they do this in such a... small face of time but then every DJ wanted to play the Terrace you know Pete Tong wanted to play the Terrace Steve Lawler everybody it was just fantastic to see are you trying to Explain why the Space Terrace has become such an iconic part of clubbing history. I think Space Terrace really came into its own as somewhere that if you was a DJ you really had to play there. Because it was open air, it was outdoors, it was in the afternoon. It was like you're on the Space Terrace Monday morning when most people in the UK are at work. And you're just having the very best time possible. And it's like, you know, all the time we was repressed, you know, playing in nightclubs, you know, air conditioning, dark, you know, smoke. You can't hardly see the next person where when he was on the terrace, you could see people, girls in bikinis dancing, having a really good time. Smiles on people's faces, people dressing to have a really good time. and it's 2 o'clock in the afternoon. I mean, I used to play the terriers from 2 o'clock in the afternoon until 8 o'clock in the evening. So I used to play a full six-hour set. And then my six hours went down to four hours, then three hours, then two hours. I was like, well, you know. The music I was able to play, I can't do anymore. So by the time that was all happening, Fritz turned around. to me and he asked me if i wanted to to take on a residency at the club and i said like where because the only time this club's working is on a is on a sunday he said well you know we're not opening the week i was like yeah but who's going to come to a space in the week no one goes to a club in the week no one no one's used to going to the club in the week he said look if you put this party on it's going to happen so uh i was a bit skeptical happy playing for Amnesia, quite happy playing at Pasha, Privilege, doing all these things, but then I was unhappy because I wasn't able to flex my muscles based on... the music that I truly wanted to play for the island and for the islanders and for the people who have supported me all the way through this. So we took on, we obviously lost the residency on the Sunday, stopped playing at all the other clubs as well and just said to everyone, I'm only going to be playing at Space Club. on a Thursday night. It was, are you mad? Who goes to club on a Thursday night? So anyway, we did our marketing, our lead up, and our line up as well. At the time, DJ Vibe was playing, Michelle Dehay was playing for us, a few Spanish DJs as well, Christian Varela. And we opened the doors, and I think on our opening night, we had about three and a half thousand people. On a Thursday night at Space, never unheard of, really. We were all quite shocked by that. And we also had introduced drum and bass straight off the bat. We had Ronnie Sides for our opening night as well for the first time. Because I still enjoy my drum and bass as well. But no drum and bass has been represented on the island. So this was really great as well because we wanted to also have... opportunity for people to hear something else at Space, not just a regular house music or techno sound or what it's known for. So introducing these DJs also to the turntables was brilliant. And whether it was going to rise or fall, I want Space to be a place where you get the opportunity to hear all types of music. One of the defining features of your parties at Space? has been the diversity of the line-ups, really. It hasn't just been one style and sound of electronic music, has it? No. I think part of success really is the fact that you're able to see the plump DJs, Pendulum, you're able to see Andy Seave, DJ Marky, Giles Peterson, Stefan Pompignac. For me, this is the reason why I like getting involved in clubbing anyway, because I love the fact that people... I'm gonna expect to hear one thing but also there's some more water in the well There's other aspects of dance music that's gonna not get which is going on out there of which You know some people go. I don't like house music. Oh, sorry. I don't like techno music It's too hard. There's no funk in it and then they go into space and then it does it detect that music Like there you go. It's just just music. It's good. It was played by the right DJ at the you know, you're going to move. You're going to shake it. And the reason why you're shaking it is because it's good. So that's all I've ever done, really. All the premise of the DJs that I've ever booked is because I want the DJs to basically play what they believe in and how they want to be represented. And also, for me, I could support the fact that these DJs are coming through. based on where they're at right now and that keeps everything fresh for me. And of course, I mean, I've been there for now minimum 10 years and so if you can imagine from my early sets of how it started to where my sets are now, they're two completely different things. But that's the evolution of where we've ended up from the beginning to where we are now. What is the difference then? How has it changed? Well, a lot of the music in the beginning really was to do with how house music and techno music was from the late 80s into the 90s, because we started in 2001. And then now the music is more understood. And also the DJs that weren't big DJs at the time are now big DJs now. So like Dubfire, for instance, massive DJ now, where before he was just a part of Deep Dish. Of course, as a unit, they were big, but individually, they were small. So we see the development of where they've ended up as well. And you've got people like DJ Vibe, who basically has always been a tribal-esque type house DJ. Now he's playing very, very good electronic kind of guitar-orientated tracks, a bit progressive in some places, but he has a different drive and energy to his music and sound. I mean, I've developed my sound a lot since the early days to where we are now, a lot more funkier, still with the power and passion and energy that I've always had, but it's not at 145 BPM, it's at 126 BPM. So you can imagine that the beats have actually slowed down and not sped up. Why do you think the party's actually become more successful? I mean, this year it's more successful than ever. It seems to be getting bigger and bigger. I think people really like the change of space because space has really, I mean, when we started space, the sound system was crap. The toilets used to smell. The air conditioning didn't work. And if it did work, it was too cold. and the thing was the club really wasn't set up in the way that we see it how it is now today but instantly space did all those changes real quick And based on what I didn't like about Space, they turned it around to a point where it's what you did like about Space in the end. And for me, if they were happy to develop their club and to basically support what we thought could happen at the club, and therefore we can give them the very best DJs to basically play from the very best platform. And so this was like a match made in heaven. We push the envelopes, they push the envelopes. And every year, space just became one of the nicest places to be in when it comes to nightclub. And still is today. I mean, every day, they paint the space. Every day, it looks like they've never had a party the night before. Every day, they change all the decor around and make sure there's enough beer stocked and the temperature's right in the rooms and everything that goes with it. And the only thing to complain about now, if there is any complaints, is there's no space at Space. It's too busy. We can't make it any bigger. But the popularity has, I think, come because we both developed, not just I developed or Al Sound developed or we've become The Sound of Now. We had a beginning and a middle. And now we're having an ongoing story of where we are now into the next 10 years. What we do with this into the future, I mean, we obviously carry on. But I want to kind of redevelop the future now of what happens with space now. I mean, I want to get, I've got to this point. We've been there 10 years. There's so many new DJs and a new kind of conceptual sound coming through and everything. I want to really elaborate on that. So for me, this is something of which I'm really looking forward to getting to. And whether I actually DJ for the next five or 10 years, I don't know. But what I do know is that Space for me has definitely made a difference by what I've done on the island and also what they've done on the island as well. What do you think about the scene and its influence globally? I mean, I'm now cut from the old school cloth, you know. I'm 25 years into being here in Ibiza. I've seen a lot of changes from how clubs didn't have an influence to now have a major influence on the world scene. It's going really commercial in some ways, which is not a bad thing, but... It needs to go commercial in the right way. I'm not sure if the whole hip-hop scene is something which is our beefing, because most of it's quite gangster and sending the wrong signals. And a lot of kids are getting influenced by that. And as we know, we had the London riots, and a lot of that is all backed by hip-hop music and R&B and everything else that goes with it. What I wouldn't like to see happen in Ibiza is an Iron Apple situation where the government and the locals don't even want to see that type of music or those type of people in their country based on the troubles that it's caused. So far we haven't seen any of that right now. There was a little bit of trouble at Snoop Dogg and Amnesia, but a lot of that was down to infrastructure, and I'm sure the gig was fantastic, and I heard it was. But it was a situation which, in a sense, which arose, and it's not just from my point of view, it's by what everyone else saw and had to deal with at the time. But meanwhile, the underground parties are going really well. I'm really enjoying the sound of the underground on the island. I think the radio stations have been supporting the underground sound quite well as well. I'll be for Sonic Radio and Global Radio. If you listen to their shows, most of the music you hear on their shows are quite underground. And there's quite a few cool underground parties that Cocoon are creating and also Vega Bondus as well with Luciano, of course, are making a very good noise on the island as well. So for me, there's some really good aspects of what's going on to push things through to the future. I'm not sure of the whole... up R&B thing is what we need to see here because then it doesn't make us any different than Vegas and this is definitely not Vegas. You kind of answered the question there but have you thought about stopping playing then? No, I haven't thought about stopping playing. I mean, it just goes through everything. I mean, I'm still playing more now than ever before around the world. and everything else that goes with it. But there's going to be a point where I'm going to be hanging up those turntables or hanging up the CD players or hanging up my computer in a way that I'm able to basically have a life which I think is well justified by what I have done for music. from all points and all aspects from how I started in the very early days. But, I mean, obviously Ibiza will always have something ongoing when it comes to music and I still want to be a part of that. But meanwhile, I mean, there is a future of space and I want to continue that by redeveloping it again into what happens next. So, you know, one day, yeah, I'll be hanging up those turntables, but at the moment, there's no signs of slowing down right now.
