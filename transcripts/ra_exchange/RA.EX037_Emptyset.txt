Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. On this edition of the Exchange, we'll be taking you live to Montreal, where over the course of the next few days, we'll be talking to a number of artists performing live at the MUTEC Festival. calling it the RA Live Exchange Sessions, and we're hoping you'll enjoy this particular chat with James Ginsberg and Paul Pergus, a.k.a. Empty Set. The duo makes experimental techno, but with Bristol being their home base, their music and careers also intersect with the city's vibrant bass music community. I talked with them in front of a live audience on Thursday, June 2, 2011. you Welcome to the RA Live Exchange with Empty Set. My name is Tidal Burns. I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Thank you for coming out at this early hour, at least by Mutex standards. So, I saw your performance last night. It was great. And I was wondering if you guys could just start by talking a little bit about what a live performance kind of consists of hardware-wise and if that was something different than what you normally do. Yeah, I think we wanted to make sure that we started from a point where we weren't going to use a computer on stage. That was kind of the first kind of stipulation of actually doing a live performance. And so I used to be in a hip hop band years and years ago. We did kind of like sort of live instrumentalists and vocalists, but I was kind of in the back with an MPC and a mixing desk and all that sort of thing. So that kind of felt like in a kind of comfort zone to kind of go back to that. So the kind of primary device is an MPC, a thousand. All the constituent bits of our music are very, very basic. It's all sine waves and noise and one kick drum. And we've managed to get two albums out of that. But it's all about how it's processed and how it's fed back into itself. I think when we did our first album a couple years ago, we'd just come to the end of doing quite a lot of... more kind of club-oriented singles and we kind of sat down to approach the album and ended up writing just loads of really bad music and kind of almost got to a point of desperation like maybe doing an album is a really bad idea but just kind of out of nowhere we just happened upon a process and a way of approaching making music that It felt interesting to us. It didn't feel like it was just kind of putting dots on a grid. making it go for six minutes kind of thing that was more like process oriented. But it was also something that when it came to preparing a live show, it was actually quite easy to transfer, but required actually bringing a good chunk of the studio with us. It seemed like you had quite a bit of stuff up there on the stage. Yeah. Sorry. It was a process, I think, of trying to translate the studio process into a live context. So I think the thing that we were quite nervous about was... was presenting something that felt, that wasn't risky for us, actually. That there wasn't a sense of danger, that potentially things going wrong. And I think that's actually the space where something exciting can actually happen, I think, in a performance. We thought about spikes and stuff. So what could have gone wrong last night? Or what did go wrong? Well, miraculously nothing. But I think, I mean, basically, just to go through the actual setup, the most kind of important parts of the whole process are the kind of outboard processing. We use a few valve EQs and compressors. and also the ability to feed everything back on itself. So I had to use a couple of mixers to do that because it's kind of... I had a Nord module on stage which I programmed with a few patches that basically did different feedback functions. And so it just involves lots and lots of cabling and slightly delicate wiring and stuff. And basically we kind of... calculated what we'd need for a sound check. So by the time we finished actually putting everything together and making sound happen, they were like, okay, five minutes. So we basically pushed play and some sound came out and then we kind of hoped for the best. So for the entire day, I think both of us were pretty much expecting that we'd get on stage. nothing would happen and people would look at us and I'd cry. And also there's the aspect that coming out of the sampler, coming out of the MPC is basically the raw sound without any processing at all. And there's a kind of rack, part of kind of rack equipment, and if any part of that chain fails, then the sound isn't made. It's not correct as it should be. I read an interview with... with you guys and you said that if you didn't have all of these machines sort of cabled together that the actual original sound is really pathetic. It's kind of embarrassing. We did a single for Chris Liebing's label CLR earlier in the year and he was like, oh, can we get some remix parts? And we're like... It doesn't really work like that. If we gave you what we made the music out of, you would laugh at us. Because it basically sounds like... I think all the gravity and the texture is generated through external hardware. And actually it's a case... of reducing everything down to pretty much one track and all the interactions between those elements in a signal chain is what produces that kind of final result. Yeah, it gets more and more elaborate as time goes on and I think that's something that's made it quite an enjoyable kind of process to go through doing the first album, the second album, because every time... you go to a new track, you're just increasing in order of complexity. And so it's kind of, I mean, the last thing we've done, which we haven't released yet, we're sort of working on, we basically, there's this giant neo-Gothic mansion outside of a town in England called Stroud. Basically, it was kind of half... built in the late 1800s and then the guy died and his family was like we're not going to spend the family fortune finishing this monstrosity so it kind of left was left there grew over and it kind of was rediscovered and turned into a kind of I guess not quite a museum but a kind of a space where people could go and just wander around and we got permission to record there. So the kind of next step in kind of increasing the order of complexity of the process was basically to make a bunch of skeleton tracks and then bring all the equipment, bring a PA into the space and then set up six mics in various kind of rooms and positions and kind of feed that back on itself. And I don't know where we're going to go next. We're going to have to... I think he was just trying to... find a way to essentially start trying to explore the idea of architecture as a processor within our kind of active making music or working with sound. It seems quite interesting that you're going to such lengths to make such basically simple music in a way. But I think it's something that it's essentially I think to us it almost has this kind of alchemical process of it's... Yeah, we probably could achieve results in much more kind of simple, stripped-down, less elaborate processes, but I think there's something that happens in that space and happens in those actions that we can't quite define, but we think it kind of engenders a kind of power or kind of an energy to it. But even in a more sort of functionalist... of way you know the music's entirely about texture that it's not really um i guess you know trying to make everything as a referential as possible and focusing in on the just the kind of texture which is basically like you imagine if you put you know when people go to sort of measure the acoustics of a room or a space they put like very basic things through it as a sine wave sweep impulses noise and then they measure how the room or the space changes that. And so for us, it's kind of like by putting the most basic kind of sort of sound constituents through equipment or into a space, you're kind of getting an impression of the space, you're getting an impression of the equipment, and then you're getting the kind of interaction between all of those bits of equipment and space. So it's almost like you're just setting up a process by which... a room or a piece of equipment comes alive and it sort of makes the music itself, if you're prepared to call texture music. Do you think that people need or should have that context of where you went to go to create this music? I think it makes a nice story, but I think, you know, I guess for us it's kind of the quality of the content first and foremost and a narrative afterwards. You shouldn't need a narrative to justify why people should listen to bad music. So if it's not good, then... it's not good, you know. But I guess for us, I guess we have our own internalized narrative about the project, and I guess that's what sort of inspires us to carry on doing it and makes it interesting for us. Particularly, I mean, for me, having made however many, I don't know, put out however many dance records over the years, like electronic music records, after a while, for me, it kind of got to a point where it was like, well... particularly as like, you know, computers, the software to make music on computers became universal. Everybody's got a Mac, everybody's got cracks, blah, blah, blah. You kind of feel like slightly, it's harder and harder to take yourself seriously because you can feel a bit like you're playing video games day in, day out. So I think that got me interested in kind of recording again, interested in kind of, I've always been interested in kind of outboard, but more like I want the computer to be like a fridge, just covered with fridge. magnets rather than be the kind of everything about the process. It's just the capture device somehow. So I think keeping interested in the actual process of making music seemed to be about actually finding processes that were interesting to make music with. How did you guys meet originally? James, you're from, you grew up in the States. and you moved over to England. Did you meet while you were in university in Bristol? - No. I basically moved to Bristol in 1998 and did university for about five years. And afterwards set up Multiverse, basically to stay in the country. I mean, I wanted to do it anyways. That was part of it. So a few years after I was running Multiverse, which is like a label house publisher and studio, at the time the studio was in my attic, so it wasn't very fancy. But Paul had got in touch with us because he'd moved back to Bristol and wanted to make some techno records, basically, and was looking for someone to work on some stuff with him. So he kind of came in and hired me to produce some records. But we made like three records and they came out really well and we really enjoyed hanging out with each other. So I was just like, man, it's cool, bro. Just keep it rolling. So, yeah. Yeah, there was just, I think through us working together initially, there was a sense that our kind of interests about kind of cinema, literature, art, music were kind of very much aligned. And so kind of what started off as a kind of professional encounter. pretty much kind of spilled over and blurred over. There's a moment where we kind of stopped working together. We didn't contact. We weren't in contact for about six months. Then James kind of called up and was like, you know, let's come back. Let's just do it. Let's get the band back together. Yeah, and it was, let's get the band back together. And from that point, that was like 2005, I think. Something like that, yeah. And so from that point, we just kind of kept on working and working. And it There's been points where... There was a point where we worked on one track for six months and it just wasn't working. We'd meet up week after week after week and continue to try and work at this idea. And then literally straight after that, get back into the studio and then make a record that we really loved in like four hours. It's an indefinable process in that way. I think that, yeah. that seems to be in a way the most, for me it's kind of one of the most interesting things about the process that we've happened upon for making music is that in other projects I've been involved in, you actually do a lot of work and there's a lot of sweat and a lot of just kind of chiseling away at things whereas because the whole project's about setting up processes rather than it's sort of letting the world do its thing rather than sort of having this idea that you're going to build it from ones and nots kind of thing, ones and zeros sort of thing so is it actually like in an eight hour session we'll probably spend seven hours in cafe and one hour in the studio but there's something about Getting into a headspace where you sort of chosen the right moment and it's generally speaking we'll get into the studio Think oh, maybe we should just watch a Vincent Price movie instead of doing some work And then we think oh fuck it Let's just have a go and it's always that point when you're just about to give up or just about to leave and you decide I will do something anyways that you know a couple hours later. You're like oh, that's There's something definitely true in the sense that you can never really time or design those moments in which the kind of the perfect circumstances are in place to make the kind of music that you want to. I think with us it's just very much been Those points of giving up are the points where we're like, should we not do this? It's actually where something quite magical happens. And I think that's what probably keeps us working together, I think. When you first started working together, you said it was almost a business relationship. You wanted to make techno records. Yeah, well, I've been involved in techno music since I was very young. I remember meeting Jeff Mills in 1999. for DJing in a record shop in Bristol. From that point on, that was when Trip Hop and all that stuff, like Poets Head, Massive Attack, were all happening in Bristol. Drum and bass was kicking off and big. I was just hanging out with a group of guys who were just obsessed with Detroit. Chicago house music, Rob Hood. And then so I kind of carried that through and was constantly kind of DJing kind of techno music and kind of mucking around and kind of producing a bit on the side but never really taking it seriously, like potentially kind of being a producer. And then... And eventually after DJing, going to Berlin, meeting Hard Wax guys, going to Detroit, meeting Mike Banks. And then eventually my path crossed with James. So I think we intended to make Techno at first. I didn't tell him that I'd never made a Techno record before. Did it become apparent in the studio in that first record? I didn't want to embarrass myself, so I think I just made it up as I went along, and it was fine. He totally bought it. I think it's actually strange, actually, when you think about the distinction between genre and actually, especially in electronic dance music, the inflections. And the subtle variations are essentially what construct genre. So I think there's a moment where there's techno, electro house or whatever. Actually it's very easy just by making weird variations to produce something that you really don't want it to be. So I think that's what's amazing about techno is it kind of has this... a very refined grammar. It's interesting you mention genre because I think a lot of the discourse around your music talks about you guys being connected to Bristol and obviously multiverse. like everyone sort of brings in the idea of dubstep and bass music. Do you guys feel connected to that in any way? It's hard not to be working in the multi-office. I think we started our first dubstep label in 2004. I probably did my first dubstep record in 2004, 2005. I think it was a very different thing, and it meant a very different thing to be doing that at that time. than it does now, and I feel quite divorced from that, even doing my kind of Ginz project, which still occupies that world. I feel like people who generally play before and after me are kind of engaging with the world of music in a slightly different way than I am. But at the same time, in terms of the lineage of, I guess, the idea set, that definitely does... come in, but I guess for Empty Set in general, I guess it's about... taking it, decontextualizing it away from it being about the sort of club environment. It's kind of a rave paradigm and sort of moving it more into the idea of kind of noise and space and noise in different contexts. So that's probably where the departure happens. Yeah, I think it's kind of an interesting one because it's like, I think, intentionally we're... we're kind of exploring that space of an irreferential kind of music or sonic experience. But at the same time, I think the fact that we're from Bristol, like I grew up in Bristol, James moved there in 99, we're somehow kind of in that, the kind of, the radiance of kind of Bristol bass culture. But in a very, like, I don't know, you know... sense like everybody knows everybody in Bristol everybody's kind of popping by the studio playing you stuff there's like a company without even realizing it there's kind of a constant sort of dialogue going on and I think it'd be very hard not to be even unconsciously influenced by what was going on around you. One of the most interesting things I find about Bristol, especially right now, is the amount of collaborations that are happening. Like, Bowel Bing is putting out this album, and it's coming out very soon, or has already come out that's strictly collaborations with different people. Are you guys going into other people's studios and working? No, I mean, not really. I think for us, we've restarted an old multiverse label called Subtext. We put out the first couple of Vexed records in 2005 or so. And the idea of the label at that point was exploring the kind of industrial flavor of what dubstep was at that point. But then there wasn't actually enough interesting music to follow up from the Vexed releases because we felt so passionate about those releases. We were like, we can't put... anything out that doesn't continue that. This was 2004 and the third release is now 2011. Yeah, but for us it was about evoking a kind of continuity. But the direction that the label's going is more kind of where industrial meets kind of minimal classical. And so we wanted to start with the kind of empty set album. because it's kind of pushing it in a sort of textural direction but the stuff that's going to follow up on it is uh i mean we've got one half of vexed rolly vexed um roy porter has done this amazing album of like it's the first time i've heard in five years i'd say that it's something completely different like and i hear a lot of music but i literally begged him to let us release it when he played me um And then Paul Jevenason, who used to produce under the name Moving Ninja, he does kind of Arvo Pärt-inspired kind of drone music. But I don't know, it's very difficult to describe, but it's kind of got this very... industrial kind of basis. So I think that's, in terms of the multiverse network of stuff, that's the kind of space that I think Empty Set's gonna be occupying more and more. And so we're sort of collaborating in that quadrant, but I don't see a Baobing-averse Empty Set record or anything. Can you just talk a little bit about Multiverse and the beginnings of setting it up and what it's become since? I know you guys do a lot of work that's not strictly 12-inch releases, album releases. You're doing music for different purposes. Yeah, I guess we started out purely as actually artist management labels. and yeah, in a studio. But we kind of moved the model to like labels and publishing, no management. And over time that kind of evolved into supplying music for different contexts. So we've been doing film trailers recently. We did the Transformers 3 film trailer. We've done the, I don't know if it's in Canadian television. but the one for Spielberg's Falling Skies thing and a few other bits and pieces. And we've also done kind of, you know, big ad campaigns for various companies and blah, blah, blah. But it's, I guess, well, from our position, it's kind of on the kind of, I don't feel like we've ever been put in a position where we had to do something that we didn't stand behind musically. And I guess there's also four of us in the company who all have very different areas of interest. But yeah, I guess just in brief, the company started in 2004. I couldn't stay in the country. My mom's British, but back in those days, only your dad could pass on British citizenship. So I kind of went through university assuming I'd be able to stay in England and then got to the end at that time and got deported. And I kind of worked out that I wasn't going to be able to stay. So looking at my options, I'd already been running a few, a small record label and managing a few artists. And so I applied to set up a company. and the one kind of stipulation was that I had to have two full-time employees to from the word go I had no business experience at all at this point but I was desperate to stay in England and so two people I went to university with, one was Rob Ellis, who's Pinch, and another is James Fidian. I was like, do you guys want a job? And they just sort of finished university at the same time, and they seemed to think it was a good idea, which for the first two or three years, it wasn't a very good idea. But things got momentum, particularly when we started Tectonic. I think that was the first thing that really, you know... the kind of music world at large seemed to get behind. And I think that opened loads and loads of doors for us, actually. And, you know, I think all the sort of bigger, kind of more interesting non-release-based work we've done, I think is probably a direct consequence of the doors that that sort of opened for us forever. And speaking of non-releases... obviously Paul you're a curator? Yeah, that's it. So essentially like a normal day job is kind of working. curating contemporary art projects. So it's... That's usually the kind of world that I inhabit. So it's... But I have, as we were talking about earlier, worked on projects that have little kind of connections between contemporary art practice, sculpture, photography, painting, and kind of experimental electronic music. So, like, recently, I think last weekend or the weekend before, I did another thing. with Mick Harris, a gallery called Spike Island in Bristol, and a New York kind of sound artist and filmmaker called Rose Kalal, who does amazing kind of 16 mil projections with kind of modular synthesis and kind of tape echo. So I guess I'm interested in those kind of blurry boundaries where kind of art and electronic music can kind of connect. But equally, I think that's more of a professional approach. With Empty Set, I've always been kind of keen to position it as a completely, almost like the equivalent of playing golf. You know, something that's done on the side that we just explore in a kind of different realm. And not to say that there isn't the potential to position it as an art project at some point. But I think at the moment it's kind of exciting to have a space that you can just explore ideas independent of a context. Actually, I think that's an exciting space that music right now enables people. to do. Like in the way that you can there's the potential to be a fan of kind of everything from kind of black metal to noise to minimal composition to techno to like even R&B and like bass music, dub and you can actually find a space where you can kind of connect all the dots between that. And that's something that potentially didn't exist, you know, in a more acceptable sense until the last couple of years, I feel at least. Yeah, you mentioned though, you know, trying to get out of context. There is obviously context. You're playing at Mutech, which is an electronic, you know, and you're playing to a sit-down audience. But I saw when you guys were playing that you were like really getting into it. I was sitting in the back row and there's this girl who was like, just got up on the, and started dancing. Where would you like to be in an ideal world playing in all of these different places? I think this was essentially our first time out of Bristol. I think the elements of control or choice. In a way, I think Mutech has always been a festival that's inspired us amazingly in terms of its programming. And I think just the opportunity to be here and to kind of come to Canada was just such an exciting proposition that I think actually is... I think we're just kind of amazed and very happy to have done it. We started to do a series of events in Bristol, which was kind of, I guess, about creating somewhat of a context for the subtext label. Which we basically found this I guess I think say 15th century church right in the middle of Bristol that lots of churches Yeah, well it's buildings involved in what you guys there's always a kind of slightly pseudo religious connotation to everything but It just I guess knows maybe it's a sense of kind of like our respect for kind of the idea of sacred music Let's put it that way. So and I mean it's a desacralized church, but it's totally ancient. It's really, really beautiful. It's got a functioning pipe organ, which we're going to use for some of the pieces later on or whatever. But there's also something about spaces which are designed to be acoustically, aesthetically pleasing. That being as much a part of the performance is anything else, that you kind of develop a relationship with the space and eventually you're sort of writing music for the space. And I'm not, we're going to have to look at things for next time because when we did the event last Friday, by the end of it, the roof had kind of dropped detritus all over the entire kind of setup. And I'm not sure if we did any structural damage, but, you know, there's kind of stained glass and all this sort of stuff. So, yeah, I think that's, I guess for us, that. exciting spaces or the kind of ideal context. And I think just in terms of the way kind of experimental electronic music is now, the lines between kind of rhythmic structure and experimental texture-based music through kind of, you know, people like, you know, Albin Noto, Rasta Noten, that kind of community, like Mark Farrell, S&D. There's a position that's happening where there's the opportunity to make a music that sits almost in a space that we don't really know where is the right context for it. But there's something that's exciting and people want to investigate that area. And I think it just needs to play out and it will find its context. You recently put out a single from, not the album, but just a standalone single with CLR, which is obviously quite a techno label, dance floor driven. I was wondering, first of all, how this got to Chris Liebing, who runs the label. Chris got in touch with us through our distributor at the time. And then apparently he bumped into somebody on a plane that knew somebody that knew us. were swapped or whatever. And I think he really, really enjoyed the first album. And I think he just wanted to find a way of connecting what he was doing with Empty Set, which we were really flattered by. And so we'd sent him this record that we'd put, that sort of Paul had organized with Cornelius Harris to vocal. It's like an Alistair Crowley poem. kind of got edited down a little bit and sent it to Chris just like here check this out not like thinking he was gonna be like yeah let's do this but he was totally like yeah let's do this and you know did a remix himself arranged a kind of couple Ben Clark remixes and kind of I guess the thing is we'd already gone a few steps down the line with the project ourself as Multiverse we got Peverless did a mix Scuba did a mix And he really wanted to release the track and release the package. And we're like, well, I'm not sure how that could really work because we've got to get these commitments to Multiverse. And they were just totally cool. They're like, yeah, we'll do a joint release. It's all good vibes. With Caravan, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right, which is a label that we were running for an artist we work with called October. Yeah. Yeah, I think for us it was I think the opportunity to kind of play with the positioning of the project as well is something that's quite exciting. I think we've shied away from the fact that we've been inspired incredibly by techno music. within the lineage of what we do and so actually the opportunity to kind of go you know because i think demiurge is a very kind of much more experimental album and the fact that we had this this kind of piece of music we were like and it is a collaboration with you know a detroit vocalist and there's that whole kind of story related to it that actually i think the opportunity of putting it with working with chris was really exciting for it and It just felt right, I think. How did you get together with Cornelius and have him... I was throwing back to this story of there being no techno in Bristol in the 90s. I started running a techno party and... In, like, 99, I got some guys from Underground Resistance over to Bristol. And we did a party in a place called The Arc Bar. And it was a brilliant night. And I just kind of kept in touch with Cornelius over the years. And then, I think in 2009, I was DJing at Block. I met up with him again there. we just kind of hung out, we ate some dinner in the canteen and at the end of the conversation I was like we should just make a record together and that's where it was born I think and he's also a huge fan of Aleister Crowley I'm not entirely sure about that really I think at the moment he was kind of quite struggling to kind of generate some vocals. I think he was slightly in a space where he was like, I think he wanted us to propose what the vocals would be. And equally that completely baffled us because we kind of had no idea what they should be. But I think kind of externally we had a lot of kind of literary influences that kind of sit somewhere within the project. And we kind of came across some poems from that era. To be fair, like Alistair Crowley is no poet so it wasn't very hard to find the best thing that he did and to exclude a lot of the other stuff so I guess it was just a piece of a piece of kind of text that somehow connected with an idea that we wanted to communicate what was that idea exactly I mean it seems like you're talking Vincent Price movies Alistair Crowley very dark influences on M.D. Sands Vincent Price is like cartoon darkness though he's more like a man of exceptional facial expressions but I guess a kind of primal spirit in some sense I mean, I think, yeah, I guess maybe the kind of narrative for us of the project starting with the first album was the kind of idea of cosmogenesis, the idea that we wanted to sort of look at how a universe of sound kind of emerges out of nothing. And I think the way of kind of looking at that was to start with reducing things down to the kind of simplest units of sound, so the sine wave. noise and then kind of building from there. So I guess in the beginning of the first album there's this kind of long drone which I kind of spent hours and hours and hours and hours and hours making trying and kind of everything seemed really contrived about it. So I kept pulling it back and pulling it back and pulling it back. And in the end, all that we ended up with was this kind of ringing and throbbing, which I then realized was the closest thing I've ever known to silence since I was 20, which is basically a ringing in my ears and the beating of a heart sort of thing. And then from that... point it was just about kind of you know moving into one dimension to two dimensions to three dimensions and it kind of I guess the idea of the second album sort of in terms of our own inner narrative is the kind of idea that when when you kind of keep increasing the order of complexity eventually the appearance of intelligence emerges and that's the kind of I think connecting with the idea of kind of elaborate feedback is the idea that after a while things start happening beyond your control and seemingly beyond the basicness of the function or the premise that you started with. And so I guess that's maybe the mystical aspect. I think it's like an approach that's based on... the emergence of possibility through accidental processes connected to the act of making sound. A lot of the time we find that the variations that come out through just experimentation and things that we don't expect are actually the things that most excite us and are most powerful about it. One of the most interesting things I find about the albums especially is that the songs are very short. They're like three, four minutes when most electronic music context, seven, eight minutes or even longer. Is that a conscious decision to say, we've made our point with this? track. I think, to be honest, for both of the albums, we've approached it as we were aiming to make, you know, X amount of minutes of music. So I think more so than anything else I've ever done, it was about approaching a whole rather than necessarily trying to shoehorn a bunch of discrete packets together and calling it an album, whatever. But, you know, as you said, it's like, as you implied, you know, you don't... it's almost like there's a natural amount of time that a track needs to last and that an idea needs to have to present itself and to make itself kind of heard. And I think also being freed from the kind of constraints of having to give somebody something to mix in and out of as an idea. I mean, I go back and listen to the records that I used to make and... the early 2000s and there's like these like two minute intros that just like doof doof doof doof doof I'm like yeah I would feel happy to never ever have to like be that functional with music you know so there just didn't seem to be any reason to And I think inadvertently for like an album context it really makes I think I think giving people a kind of compressed experience Is actually not necessarily a bad thing for electronic music And to kind of provide something more palatable for not necessarily palatable, but more engageable As an experience I think has actually been in favour for this project actually because you know it is the music does take something out of you. That's the other thing. I listened to this album, the first time I was driving my mum around, we listened to it in the car. And afterwards she said she felt exhausted. And I was like, oh. But then I realised that actually there is this quality about it, that there is an act of engaging with it. And I think actually the shorter format has lent itself really well. It's quite abrasive. to put it in maybe more simple terms. And I think that's a really important part of it. I think hearing it loud. When we did our first album, Launch we basically just hired a seller somewhere put a huge sound system in it put 50 chairs down and gave everybody earplugs But it felt like there's something about the kind of visceral Experience of it that is the thing somehow it's it's like you've listened to on laptop speakers listening to on a small hi-fi you almost kind of want to put a little warning on the album which is kind of don't bother you know it's like either sort of from big headphones or so you can't listen to empty sets softly i think there's a lot of music that i would listen to instead if i wanted to have a gentle moment but um yeah but i guess at the same time um But Srinjan, I think the first album, having said that, I think the first album, I've listened to it on headphones quite a lot. Smooth jazz. And actually, there's something that's very, because obviously it accentuates kind of different elements, I think. In the face of the studio, it's very much kind of presented as kind of sound system-based music. But actually, I think we've been quite lucky in the way it's translated to smaller systems. Although it's probably not the intended format, kind of held its own within that. So do you find the second album is quite a bit more abrasive, quite a bit more experimental? I feel like there was more of a handrail in the first album for people who are coming from club-oriented electronic music, whereas I feel like it was a little bit of a difficult thing to let go. go of for us because you kind of never want to alienate what has been your core audience I guess but there isn't really much it's for people who kind of like you know DJ oriented music in there it's kind of you know which I think is probably its strength really and I hope that that kind of means that you end up finding a new audience or whatever or at least people that maybe came from that background would check it out but yeah it's not a very friendly record it's definitely not for everyone but I'm totally okay with that I think if it was for everyone I'd be kind of worried but I'm not going to send it to my grandmother I think it was just an opportunity just to... I think it's always a scary thing when you start positioning something in a slightly different space of reference. But I think for us, we just make the kind of music we want to make and then think about an audience afterwards. I think that might not necessarily be always the right approach, but I think for us, that's our approach. and that's what works for us. Can you talk a little bit about the video that you had last night? Is that something you shot yourselves? Yeah, it was something that Paul coordinated and shot already. Yeah, there's a designer, two designers from London, Clayton Wellam and Sam Williams. I studied with Clayton at the Royal College of Art in London. And he does a lot of kind of motion graphics. And he works with an agency called Why Not in East London. And they do lots of commercials for kind of Nike and kind of more brand-based stuff. But we met when he was studying graphic design at Royal College. And he's, you know, a lot of time has passed since then. And he's got married and whatnot. I think he just wanted an opportunity to get back involved in something utterly experimental. So a lot of the video work that he produced was using black and white analogue TV sets and tape erosion from... dv tapes and kind of feedback stuff uh and we're really happy with it it's um but it's definitely a collaboration that's going to continue i think i think it fit really nicely but i also was kind of surprised in a way that you had visuals at all in that yeah almost putting something to your music kind of changes or at least put something on the listener well i think we wanted to go for things that were basically based on natural processes. We didn't want to have computer generated images at all. And we liked the idea of processing them in an analog way because it sort of was... at least in essence, the same sort of production process we're using for the music. But to be fair, Paul shot a bunch of stuff in Bristol, sent it to the post-production people in London. We never actually saw it. It got sent to one of the anti-VJ guys in Italy by Courier before we looked at it. And then he, between everything that he's doing, Giovanni, basically just turned up yesterday and was like, oh, got your visuals. And we're like, okay. I think it's also just a case of obviously we... Playing it to... So I think working at Mutech, we were presented within an AV context and I think we needed to provide some kind of visual material. So it was a bit of a rush for us and it was... We don't actually produce the music with a visual setting in mind. But it's something that I think obviously when you're playing at festivals and kind of... larger scale events is something that's kind of quite often demanded of you or expected of you. So I think it's something we'll continue to kind of explore and develop. See how that journey takes us. Maybe work a little bit more closely than seeing it an hour before. Yeah, that would be awesome. But Johnny, the guy from Anti-VJ, was really excited about it in the end. And I think we were talking about doing some stuff which is a little bit more interactive with him for future gigs we've got coming up. So I think that would make a lot more sense. But at the same time, I think, at least in terms of our production process, the idea of things happening in a fairly spontaneous and out of control way and actually working, that fits quite well with our kind of narrative. So I don't see that as a kind of somehow being problematic, actually. I wanted to open up to the audience if you guys had any questions in particular. What sort of things or artists or anything inspire you? I think me and Paul probably have very different kind of reference points, really. And I think Paul has probably directed the aesthetic of the project in many ways. So maybe if I... Thanks. Yeah, I think it's the... I originally kind of studied architecture and design. I think the original intention was very much to kind of take that approach to developing a project. It's very kind of design-led. But I think in terms of kind of inspiration, sonic... there's everything from music to a lot of avant-garde 20th century experimental electronic music while simultaneously leading into from the 80s onwards Chicago house music and Detroit techno that the radical experimentation of that era is unquestionably, to me, one of the most powerful eras of music. So that definitely sits there. But then equally, there's kind of, you know, I think, you know, even tomorrow we're going to go see like a Mies van der Rohe. Apparently he built a petrol station in Montreal. So I think, you know, architecture and design does definitely sit within that whole kind of conversation. It's just about how... sound, design, art can all kind of connect together within a kind of moment. Yeah, I mean, I think for me, I guess, strangely enough, the kind of most powerful experience I had listening to music... in the last sort of 15 years, was this kind of moment listening to Herbie Hancock's Man Child. I think that's informed my approach to everything to do with music, because it sort of represented a point for me where music shifted from being a kind of collection of references. So you'd hear a guitar, you'd think of a guitar, you'd hear a synthesizer, you'd think of a synthesizer, to a kind of... I guess maybe a more direct way of hearing sound is kind of texture and color and shape. And I think there's something about the way that he works with kind of interlocking rhythmical patterns between instruments, like lines being made up of sort of four or five instruments at once, just kind of passing the kind of movement between them. So there's sort of like this kind of incredible complexity, but kind of ordered in this way, which makes everything, even though it's kind of, there's musicians in a band playing, it makes it feel like one organism rather than a kind of a collection of individuals. So I think for me, that's probably my... biggest kind of reference point, really. I have a few questions. There seem to be this trend going on right now in techno. There's a lot of good music being produced, but it's not being digitalized. Like, it's not going to MP3s. Like, for example, K209, you know, and... How do you feel about that? And who are your... I mean, what kind of labels are you really influenced right now? I mean... It's an interesting idea, the kind of not presenting your music in a digital format explicitly. I think, you know, chances are, if your music's popular enough, somebody will record it and say... computer and distribute it or whatever. I guess it's like this idea of kind of like object-oriented music, somehow that you have something that is physical, its intention is to be physical. I definitely feel like since... I kind of stopped buying vinyl and stopped collecting vinyl. My relationship to music changed quite a bit. It's something I've only noticed recently. So I think for certain people where that's like a massive part of their life and that's like very important for them, I can totally understand. I guess for me, you know, it doesn't make much of a difference really. I think it's about connecting with... as much as an audience wants to engage with their music. But at the same time, I kind of respect it. So maybe I'm ambivalent. But I'll let Paul field the rest of that. So, yeah, there's definitely a stance that's being taken within, for want of a better term, the relationship between old and new media and how that kind of relates to... music or electronic dance music. But there's definitely, I think, even projects like Scudge, for example, the Scandinavian techno project. I think they recently won the Swedish... equivalent of like a Grammy. But there's definitely, and I think probably, Berghain, that culture has had a lot to do with reverting to a kind of a vinyl-only approach. And people like, you know, Marcel Detman and Ben Clock at Berghain only play vinyl, which is pretty astonishing considering they're playing like up to 12 hours of DJing music, you know, purely vinyl. So I think that there's a strength in the music acknowledging that history and kind of continuing to support it, definitely. Oh, and the second part was what labels, I think. Well, I think, you know, definitely the influence of Oscar Ton is kind of... It was Shadows, Europe and global electronic music now, but equally Scudge and I think Sam Will did... strict equally like I think Regis like Carla Connor it's you know it's an astonishing man I think in terms of his influences and that and actually I think it's been really important for kind of British electronic music to have somebody that's been positioned within the conversation of kind of techno but actually is equally influenced by like Robin Gristle Cabaret Voltaire kind of zap even through to napalm death and industrial and metal. I think he's actually created a space that actually... artists like us, you know, somehow are related to. He did a work for that, one of the projects that you worked on with Mick Harris. Yeah, that's correct, yeah. And I think he's really kind of important in drawing connections, as you said, between these different ideas in San Juan District. This really good example of saying post-punk techno, actually really similar, even though it may not be. be directly obvious. Well, I think it's just really important to have people that are willing to position themselves to different audiences and kind of actually just push the boundaries of what's happening. And I think, you know, I'm very happy that there's somebody like him out there that's doing that, definitely. Any other questions? All right. Well, thank you for coming by. Thank you, guys. Thank you very much.
