you Hello and welcome to Resident of Pfizer's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident of Pfizer. Simon Dunmore is the label boss of Defected Records, one of the UK's biggest... house music imprints. Begun in 1999, Defected has sold millions of records from the likes of Bob Sinclair, Kings of Tomorrow, Roger Sanchez, and many more. Building on the success of the label, Defected also does plenty of events around the world under the Defected in the House umbrella, an event that perhaps has its most famous home at Pasha. in Ibiza over the course of each summer. While Defected continues to thrive, they do so at a moment when labels are struggling to survive and old models are failing. Dunmore addressed these questions head on, including what he terms as the "perception problem" that Defected has in some corners of the world, with RA freelance writer Stephen Titmuss earlier this month. So, Simon I guess a fair description of a lot of Defectors music you put out would be soulful. Were you much of a big soul fan growing up? Yeah, I... And it's always hard to place a year specifically when... when I really got into soul music, but there was one show I used to listen to Bob Jones on solar radio back in the day when pirate radio was quite, you know, you kind of felt a bit kind of like you were breaking the law listening to it. There was a few pirate stations back in the early 80s and solar radio was one. And one show Bob Jones interviewed a guy called Mike Sefton and he was playing his rare soul or his collectible soul collection and there was several cuts on there and I thought wow this music is amazing and it really, I just remember from that moment really wanting to, I listened to Bob every week and then heard you know. discovers more and more DJs but there was a record he played by Bobby Womack called How Could You Break My Heart which just absolutely kind of knocked me out and I started collecting Bobby Womack records and then you get more and more inquisitive so at the time I was kind of playing a mishmash of kind of disco rare groove I was going to like Case the Soul weekends going to see DJs like Chris Hill and But then it became a little bit more specific, what I kind of liked. I collected soul and ended up playing the soul room or soul venues around the country. I played the soul room at the Southport Weekender. didn't play the first one but from the second to about the 30 if I played but not actually the first maybe 10 were in the soul room and then I started to play soulful garage and that wasn't taken too too well so I was removed from the turntables and ended up playing in the powerhouse in the main room. So yes, soul was a big part of my early life musically. So being a soul fan in the early 80s and being from London, were you one of the people that would describe yourself as a soul boy? That kind of tribal thing from the London era? No, because Soul Boys was really, you know, you'd listen to jazz funk and disco and, you know, Crown Heights Affair records or Fatback Band records and stuff. And I definitely was listening to those records. But the soul that I kind of really got into was... what they called the modern soul scene, which was a 70s kind of version of the northern soul scene. So it was rare collectible records. I mean, you know, and I remember paying over £100 for a couple of singles, you know, back in the day, which was certainly more than I could afford. As a DJ, you were defined by the records that you had. So it was a... I mean, they were records that I loved, but they were also an investment for me. So it wasn't really the Soulboy scene, it was the modern Soul scene, which was a kind of southern version of the northern Soul scene. So it was a bit more down-tempo, it was a bit more 70s-based. But it was a great scene to be involved with. Yeah, I was going to ask, because that's perhaps not one of the more famous scenes that people would talk about nowadays, but was that a big thing at the time? No, it was, I mean, people talk about it now as kind of communities. But back then, we probably thought we were a gang. There was maybe, across the whole of South East England, maybe 1,500 people that were into it, and then you would have dues. like Nicky Holloway would put on a do for the special branch which would have Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold in the main room and then he would have a soul room with Bob Jones, myself maybe Giles Peterson would play a jazz come soul set in there and it was But it was like a real community. And you had mailing lists, you know, and there wasn't social networks like there are now, but there actually was a social network amongst the people that liked that kind of music. So you would go to a club, you would see the same people, whether it be an event in Kent or an event in Oxfordshire, people would really travel. And actually, they travel to the extent that when Nikki Holloway put on an event in Ibiza, 200 people booked the holiday. We all went to Ibiza in 1986 and again in 1988. So, yeah, and I'm still in touch with quite a lot of those people now. And a lot of those people actually have done really well and are quite influential still on the scene today. Yeah, it's interesting you mentioned the Nikki Holloway Ibiza trip. Is 1987 the one that apparently started house music in the UK or at least that's what the press seem to kind of talk about? Well, I mean, I don't know for sure. I think he might have gone to Ibiza in 87, but the trip... There was a trip to Ibiza in 86. I believe they went to Corfu in 87. In 88, they went back to Ibiza. But I think the Ibiza trip in 88 was probably based around the fact that they'd been there the year before. And basically, we went there as a collective. but the group kind of split in two. There was the die-hard soul and jazz rare groove fraternity that kind of went there to hear that kind of music. And then there was the other half of the gang that just had discovered amnesia, pasha, coup, and went off and disappeared into the night, and everybody was scratching their heads going... Where the hell have they been all night? So you were still listening to the soul music at that point in time? Absolutely. There was elements of House and Garage that I liked, but again, it was the soulful end of it. It would be C.C. Rogers' Someday or Blaze Can't Win For Losing or a Tent City record. Those were the records I related to, but the moment it went into... you know anything that was deemed balleric or new beat or industrial or whatever i just i it wasn't my thing so uh i i didn't you know i was kind of quite a purist i guess and and so i just i i remained uh in in the soul camp and it was it was when i actually got a job at cool tempo records when really it became of what I needed to do to go out and sit to new clubs, listen to new music, promote the releases that we were working at the time. I gradually, over probably a 12-month period, then got more and more into what is called the house scene and stuff. But it wasn't an immediate thing for me. And a lot of people, like the flatmate that I lived with at the time, I remember that he was a casual. I mean, he used to spend hundreds of pounds. on his appearance, Ouija loafers, Farrah trousers. So could you just explain to people what a casual is? Because I reckon some people might not know, and it's quite an interesting one, I guess. Well, a casual was... Well, basically they're called casuals or dressers, and basically they were... You know, it was kind of an extension of the Soulboy scene, and there was an element of the... of football hooliganism about it as well and it was people that used to spend an extraordinary amount of money on on a certain kind of clothes and you know back in in the 80s music was very tribal as well you know you had goths and you had rockabillies you had mods you had soul boys and and And casuals would wear Baswegian loafers, Farrah trousers, Pringle, Lyle and Scott, Taccini, tracksuit tops, etc. Be very well groomed. They'd spend time on their hair. It used to take my flatmate just a ridiculous amount of time to get ready. And he went from being absolutely besotted with himself to making sure he would walk out of the door so immaculately dressed to wearing, literally about a month later, he discovered Acid House and Ecstasy. And he was donning a white boiler suit with a bandana with Out of Control written on the side of his sleeves. acid on his back and I just I was you know I can remember looking at him just going what the fuck has happened you know and yeah I mean it was that instant for a lot of people I mean it you know I remember you know that the special branch trip was was was in May And by the middle of the summer, there were illegal raves and there was headlines on the sun and there was the famous News at Ten expose on Acid House. And it was a movement that literally took the country by storm over a couple of months. There were parties like Spectrum going on at Heaven. on a Monday night and I have no idea what employees must have thought of the people working for them bundling into work at 9 o'clock after staying up all night going to Spectrum but it was happening so fast and such an extent that it became national news but it just it wasn't something that resonated with me straight away It took a while. OK, so to kind of backtrack a little bit, you said about working at Cool Tempo. How did you get the job there? That was quite a successful record label in the early 90s. I was DJing quite a lot in West London, in the Uxbridge Hillinden area, where I was brought up. And I started, I left school, I was DJing. I was working with my father and he had a dry cleaning business. I was working for him. And I think he became a little concerned with the fact I was DJing so much. I was, you know, rolling at two or three o'clock in the morning. I wasn't able to do, you know, work for him as probably he'd like. So I did the right thing and I got a job somewhere. So I actually got a job in a record shop called... the Record and Disco Centre in Rayner's Lane, which is near Harrow in West London. And it was a very influential shop. A journalist called James Hamilton used to buy his records in there. And he would compile the Record Mirror club chart, which was a very influential chart back in the day, from sales. at the Record and Disco Centre and from DJ Chart Returns. So I would have every club promotions guy coming in to me. James is coming in on Friday. Can you tell him this record's flying or can you put this in his hand and et cetera. So I got to know a lot of people doing A&R, a lot of people. club promotions and after a while I got offered a job I went for a job at MCA which I didn't get and and then a couple of months later I got offered a job at Cool Temper which was owned by Chrysalis Records at the time doing club promotions so I started in 1989 And some of the records were great records to work with. I remember one of the first records I worked with was Urban Soul All Right. a record by a tribal house called Africa, some earlier Diva records, and some of the records weren't so great. And, you know, when you're doing club promotions and you've got a record that you've got to promote and there's really nothing that you can do with it, it's a very frustrating experience. So what I would say is, like, you know... I'd just be pretty honest with the A&R guy or the marketing guy, I'd say, look, there's absolutely nothing I can do with this record, but if you get this remix done, perhaps it's something that I could work and I could push and we could have some kind of degree of success on the dance shows or in clubs. So that really, I think, was my first experiences of A&R. and that worked to a degree and then what would happen was I would still be buying records I was still DJing and I'd hear records that were coming on import and I'd think well if I was promoting that I know I could do a great job so I began signing records one off records on the basis that I knew that I would know who would play them how I could promote them etc And, you know, early records that we signed were Elias, Follow Me from Strictly Rhythm or River, Ocean, Love and Happiness. And it just started... Basically, that was the start of my A&R career. Was it this time that you just kind of moved on to AMPM to do A&R or was that kind of a much later thing? No, I worked at Cool Tempo for five years. So we had... It was a very... very mixed bag actually of music that we released so we did a lot of early house and gowards but we had a hip-hop a UK hip-hop act called moany love that we promoted and released we had we do the we basically would be the release arm for a lot of the US dance releases whether that be dance or or hip-hop so we did gang star We did Arrested Development. And on the UK side, we had an act called Innocence, which did really well. Kenny Thomas, who was a kind of blue-eyed Essex soul boy, who did phenomenally well. Who else? Shara Nelson, her album. And it was a really well-respected and successful label at the time. And I eventually got offered a job running the dance department at A&M Records, which was A&PM. And it was already a very established label and some of it was locally signed and successful. But basically, a lot of the success that they had was due to the fact that the A&R in America had signed... Sounds of Blackness, CeCe Peniston, etc. So they were give-me's from the US company to the UK company. But they still had to do a great job on them, and they did. So it was a dream job, really. And you also signed some pretty legendary records there yourself, like Ultranate, was it? Helen Farley project and things like that? Yeah, it actually started off quite badly. And I don't particularly know why. I think that... sometimes it just takes you a while to adjust to certain cultures and some people need to learn to trust you and you leave an environment where you know the way that everything works to something new and sometimes it just takes a moment so it was about 12 months before I had any kind of success in terms of records that I signed. And I signed a few and they hadn't kind of quite happened. I mean, in my mind, I didn't expect them to be big hits. But when you work at a major label, the expectation is that everything that you put out has got to sell 100,000 or a million copies. Otherwise, why are we bothering? And, you know, from my perspective, I wanted to make my mark by signing a few cool records to just show that we weren't just about commercial dance success, that we wanted to develop new acts or be associated with new talent that was coming through. But, you know, sometimes that's not understood at a major label. So whilst I was kind of quite happy... After a while, I began to feel the pressure. Certain things were said, etc. Anyway, the first record that I really felt passionate about and I banged the table was De Lacy, Hideaway. And I'd heard it. I went to Cream one weekend and Deep Dish were playing or somebody, Rocky and Diesel Express 2, somebody was playing and I heard it and I was just like, wow. At the time there was, you know, Deep Dish were kind of, there was a buzz about them, but they hadn't had any kind of success. That record just stood out. There was nothing like that at all. And I went back, I said, this is the record that I want to sign. Anyway, the guy that owned it, Pete Harris, who's sadly not with us anymore, owned Slip and Slide. he knew he had something that was you know that was was was hot so he drove a hard bargain and my business affairs guy we can never agree to that there's no way we're going to pay him this and you know that's outrageous and i'm like look this is a hit record we've got to sign it it took about three or four weeks to get to a point where We'd agreed a deal. And we faxed over the offer, spoke to Peter Harris on the phone. He said, yeah, the record's yours. In the time it took to send the fax over and him to sign it, Deconstruction sent over an offer which blew everything that we'd offered out of the water. And we lost the record. So I was pretty distraught at the time. But what happened was the record, I think, went off to be a top ten record in the UK. But what it meant was they didn't second guess me at A&PM anymore. When I said I really believed in a record, at least, even though we never got that record, at least they thought it was successful. So, you know, from that, I kind of probably got a little bit more self-belief and there was a little bit more belief in me around the company. And, yeah, we had a good run with a lot of good records. And also we were commissioning mixes. There was a Janet Jackson. Greatest Hits Project so we commissioned all the mixes on that with Morales and Tenaglia and Deep Dish and we ended up remixing some police records I mean Roger Sanchez remixed a Barry White record he also remixed the Police Voices Inside My Head Ashley Beadle and Harvey also did mixes on that and Yeah, so it became like a really good club conduit for some mainstream acts. At the same time, we were having success on records that we signed, like Moose T. Horny, which always makes me chuckle now. and Alternatae 3, or Alternatae 3, I should say. Yeah, so it was a good moment. So what was the experience like working in a dance music label in the mid-'90s? I imagine to be young and working in a place like that with lots of great records, it must be quite a heady experience. Yeah, it was, actually. Although sometimes, you know, when you're in the midst of it... You don't really kind of... And even now, sometimes I have to stop myself and go, wow, we just did that, or I was there, or I was involved. And at the time, I just was so busy that I never really took stock of what was going on. And actually, have you heard of this book called Kill Your Friends? Yeah. And it's a book I read maybe about 18 months ago. And it really, I mean, if anybody's out there hasn't read this book called Kill Your French, you should read it because it's a great read. And it's a kind of exaggerated take on the music industry in the 90s. but some of it is so close to the truth that I mean it's you know having lived through that it really kind of brought a few things home so it was a bit wild and rock and roll and there was a lot of shenanigans going on but at the same time things got done. There was great music being made. There was great music being released. And you had a job to do. And I think if you could, you know, if you could ride the line correctly, it was great to be involved. Of course, a couple of people fell off the cliff, so... Amazing. So, yeah, so obviously working at a major label, you've done it for, what, 12 years? There was obviously a time when you thought, I'm going to leave and do my own thing. What kind of precipitated that? What made you feel like, you know, this is the time I need to kind of leave? Well, it was in... I remember in... beginning of 1998 we everybody was on a contract you know I was on a two or three year con and my contract was up for renewal and I was doing really well records we had a couple of records that had gone into the top five of the charts and sold you know over half a million singles each and um anyway I went to renew my contract and um they only offered me a year and I was just like that's really weird and um I really, really pushed hard and it was all that they were ever going to give me and I just couldn't work it out. And then we ended up speaking to some other people that were in a similar position and everybody's contract ended at the same date. So we all kind of got an inkling that something was about to go down. Then we found out that Universal had made a bid for Polygram. So they didn't extend anyone's contract. contracts because they were obviously going to make changes and they didn't want to have to pay people out etc so what happened Universal bought Polygram they closed A&M which was a label with amazing culture and amazing acts and they merged it with Ireland Records and Ireland Records has a similar culture and again has amazing acts but it wasn't the label that I wanted to work with and the people there weren't the people I wanted to you know when I worked at A&M I worked there because I loved the managing director and my boss who I thought was a great guy they were no longer part of the company So it was a really good time for me to take stock and they offered me a job at Ireland. And I just felt that, you know what, in this instance, I'm lucky. But, you know, when you're a major, it's a bit like if you're, you know, you're in a sports team. There's a point where your career is going to come to an end. really know you know you think you can carry on and carry on forever but that's not the reality so I felt that if I started my own label at least I would be in control of my own destiny and it would give me an extension in my career a bit more longevity it just seemed like the right time to make that decision And as luck has it, the Ministry of Sound were looking to start up a number of dance labels. They were having quite a tough time trying to license repertoire from the major labels. So their reaction to that was to start up their own labels and they approached several A&R people. They approached me, we come to an agreement, and 1st January 1999 we started Defected Records. So you couldn't really have got up to a better start, Defected. The first record you signed was Can't Get Enough, that went top ten. Did you think that was going to happen when you signed that first record, or put it out? Do you have an eye on the charts? No, is the answer. I mean, that record was an instrumental and was getting played on the underground and actually was getting some evening specialists playing on KISS. And so I knew the guys at Sulfuric, phoned them up and said, you know, I'd love this to be my first record. We come to an agreement. I said, but, you know, to get radio. It needs a song, it needs a song on top. You know, in those days, it was really hard to get an instrumental club track played. So, you know, it was quite a common thing to have a big track and then to get a vocal put on top. So Mark Pomeroy, who was part of Jazz and Groove, one day he phoned me up and he said, I've written a song. And I said, oh, can I hear it? And he said, well, I haven't got anyone to sing it yet. So I said, no, sing it to me down the phone. So he sung it to me down the phone. And he didn't have a terrible voice, but it wasn't great. But it was a great song. And yeah, it was That actually was the first release because the other factor, I believe, was that everybody knew what had happened to A&M with Ireland and everybody felt that it was quite tragic that A&M had been closed down because it's had a label that... It had the police, it had Sheryl Crow, it had Janet Jackson, the sounds of blackness and lots of amazing acts. It didn't really deserve, just because some corporation had made the decision, that it could assimilate a lot of roles. So there was a lot of goodwill out there and I think that I really benefited from the fact that there was, you know, a lot of profile about the close down of A&M a lot of profile about me leaving starting up my own label and I believe a few people wanted us to do well and to succeed so we got lucky with some playlists and some profiles and that undoubtedly helped but yeah it was Again, you know, you're so busy doing what you're doing, you don't kind of think, wow, this is amazing. You're looking for the next record and the next record and the next record. Yeah, so immediately after that, you went on a really, what seems like a really strong run, you know, like Master at Work, To Be in Love, Powerhouse, What You're Looking For, Paul Johnson, Get Down. That's like in your first 10 releases. How did you manage to sign all them? I assume there was competition from bigger labels and people with bigger budgets and things like that. Well, the great thing about starting a new business is you've got no baggage. You've got none of the crap that I have to deal with now, and there's enough of that. It doesn't exist when you're a new label. So you don't have many staff. You're not worried about... cash flow so much because you've got your cash flow from your get-go you haven't spent any of your money yet so everything's hunky-dory in the bank and so my so my mind was completely just free to to focus on signing music and it was it was a great period for for for dance music and and has me I mean it wasn't just you know defected that we're having hits everybody was having hits at the time And it was, we just identified with a certain kind of record. And we had the goodwill of the producers, the labels that owned those records. And I think once everybody gets confidence in you, what you have to do is just keep the momentum going. So we were just on a roll. It's completely different times now, but radio would take a chance on underground records. There would be people that were DJ presenters that knew about music, that were passionate about music, and that would champion a good record for you. That doesn't really happen anymore. The radio presenter now is on there because of his personality, not necessarily because he knows anything or really even cares about music. so back in the day it was just like if you had a good relationship with producers of shows or heads of music or a certain DJ you had a good network of people that could champion an unknown record for you and push that through so you have enough profile to get presented to the playlist and if there was enough goodwill um you know you would achieve that and now it's about whether a record is gonna be interesting to the advertisers of a radio station and uh you know i'm not i'm not complaining about that it's just completely different but at the time in 2000 we benefited from the fact that that uh there was a lot of people that that understood and were passionate about music working at radio stations certainly so it seems like at least initially, the model for Defected was find the great record, usually from a US label, sign it for the UK and put a package... together is that about right yeah absolutely and and you know it's you know I still got out and about and and when we started defected we deliberately started we found an office it was directly opposite black market record And just down the road was Uptown, Vinyl Junkies. um plastic fantastic and and every record store specializing in every genre so we had our finger on the pulse we could see records that were that were that were selling that djs were playing uh we were going to clubs we were hearing them uh you know we were seeing dj chart returns i mean in those days people would fill in a form top 20 you get it faxed through um And, you know, you would see records that were occurring on a regular basis. And, you know, it was easy to do your research back then because... everything wasn't so fragmented as it is now. There was a lot more focus. So we would identify records that we liked, we felt that were a good fit for the label, and sometimes we would just release them as they were, sometimes we would get remix packages. And, yeah, and as I said, we got the trust of a lot of people. and we kept it going for two or three years. Wow, so I guess the internet has massively disrupted that model of not only signing and putting stuff out for the UK, but also the way you used to do your research. Is it tough now that any artist can just basically put a record out on their own label and might not need a middleman such as Defected to put the package together for them? Yes, it's, you know, I understand, you know, because if you're a producer. you know, and Why would you wait for somebody's opinion somebody to say yes? I like it or no I don't like it when you can just put the record out yourself and if you have enough of a reputation and enough of a following You can hit your audience directly and as you say there is no need for a record label to get involved and So that's made Things are a little challenging for us in certain respects. But I believe that when you have your own record label, that you can only take things so far. And we are, at Defected, we are a record company. We employ 22 people, and there is a big difference between a record label and a record company. So we promote our records hard. We have in-house promotions, social media, marketing, etc. And if a record is just an underground record and that's... you know that's as far as it's going to go there is really not much need for us to get involved it may as well stay with the producer on their label and do great work for the producer but if a record has a little bit more appeal could you know can be taken a little bit further i believe that's really where we come into our own really i mean a lot of the records that we sign whether it be Fish Go Deep, The Cure and The Cause, you know, came in on an import out of Canada and sold a thousand copies. And it probably would have stayed that way if we hadn't have got involved. And it's an amazing record. It's a great record for our catalogue. And it was, I believe, a record that still sounds good today. So that is really what I believe is... what Defected is about, it's about the fact that when I started in the music industry, whether it be I was selling records behind a counter or I was DJing in a wine bar, I was promoting music. That is promoting music. You're promoting music to a dance floor or you're promoting music to another DJ. And at Defected, we just promote music. That's what we do. as long as people make great records I think we'll do okay so what is actually the process for you signing a record that's affected is it just something you like or is there more that goes into it than that do you know it's as simple as that it's you know Over the years you get experience of, as I said, I used to buy music, a van would arrive at the record and disco centre on a Friday afternoon with 50 new releases, 60 new releases. You would take those records into your store, you would play them, you'd skip through them and you'd say I want 5 of them, 20 of them, 50 of them. And you had to make a decision. And, you know, the shop was either successful or would go out of business based on whether your ears were good enough. But once you're making that decision, you're going... I know this amount of my clientele will buy this record. These people would be interested in this. And when you're DJing, you have to make the same selection process. It's just like this record is going to be right for this time. So... Whenever we're listening to a record, it could be, would this record work? Great, a sunset session, a beach party, peak time at Pasha. And if it has a place for us when we're DJing, and there's several people that DJ at the label, and also all of the producers that are involved, if we feel that it can readily fit within... a moment in someone's set then that's probably the first question that we ask. Then it's you know can we work with the label, are they likely to be receptive to an offer, some people are not interested, you know is the producer someone we can identify with and but really it's just about whether we like the record. And then it's the process of making an offer, making sure that the people, whether it be the label owner or whether you go directly to the producer, they're comfortable about working with you. We really try to involve people because there are plenty of labels that just take a record and really upset the people that have actually produced the piece of music. And that's something that always horrifies me. But, you know, it's really once you decide that you like it, it's down to the fact that whether you've got ears that other people can relate to or whether, you know, I can't say good or bad ears, but whether, you know, whether other DJs and other punters and whatever can relate to it. And if they can relate to it, then the records usually end up doing well. And if they can't. they're normally the labels that struggle or eventually fall by the wayside. Is that something that plays on your mind? You mentioned you had a staff of 22, you're a record company. Is it ever a challenge to think, oh, I've got to sign something that does well to support the business and keep everything going? Do you ever feel the pressure? It's a massive responsibility and I don't... I don't think about it as much as really what I should do. And I think if I did, it would probably put me under so much pressure that I don't actually know that I would be able to continue to DJ or to listen to music in a way that is not affected by the fact that, God, I've got to sign a big record. God, I've got to sign a big record. Because I think the moment you get into those kind of realms... you lose all your soul you're doing everything for the wrong reason it's all about that um that you have to make money and and there are records that we've done that um historically with they've never been the best experience for us sometimes they've been successful but most times they haven't The most successful records for us have been the ones that we've signed because we just absolutely love them and we passionately work them and get behind them. So, you know, and that's the case with someone like Bob Sinclair. We didn't sign Bob Sinclair because of Love Generation or World Hold On. We signed Bob Sinclair because of I Feel For You and the fact that he'd done the Paradise album. We loved Bob Sinclair and... at the time he was a super cool underground DJ super cool underground producer and he made great records and he grew and he developed out of that we maintain our relationships with our producers where we can he went on to produce Rock the Party World Hold On Love Generation all of which had enormous worldwide success And then people kind of sometimes think that's a problem. It's because we've had commercial success. But actually... That funds everything that enables us to sign records that that are more underground that maybe we don't make so much money on and I think that it's it's all about the balance in business and Chris bobson class still plays for us at Pasha when he plays he packs the club out and again that enables us to use up and coming new DJs fresh talent because we can take chances because six weeks out of the 18 that we're out there the club is absolutely heaving you know from from every nook and cranny so um i think that uh it's um having having someone like chris bob sinclair just takes the pressure off and uh uh he's he's been very loyal to defected and uh i've got a lot of time for him yeah so almost like the success of someone like bob sinclair allows you to do more interesting stuff in a way and completely remove some of some of that pressure Absolutely. And, you know, I think if you look at most businesses, that there's probably an aspect of that, that they've got, you know, something that really funds the business, that allows them to research and develop things to come through and succeed or an experiment, you know, because you have to do things that are... You know, we have bills to pay. We have, you know, our salary bill. Every, you know, 22 people at the end of the month want to get paid. You know, artists that play for us or release records, they expect their payments and their royalties. So you have to take that side of what you do seriously. But you have to do things for your soul as well. that's the yin and the yang of what we do. Obviously Defect is not just about the label you've also got the event side of things how important is that to the whole operation? Is it something that really keeps you afloat more than the label now? Where's the balance between those kind of things? The events side of what we do is really important, actually, because it's a direct connection that we have with our fans. And what happened, actually, it was probably about 2004, 2005. I remember it quite vividly, although I think that they deny it, but Mixmag. had on the front of their cover, dance music is dead, or some kind of proclamation that I thought was horrifying, that one of the biggest dance music publications in the country was actually saying that the genre of music that they reside in is about to just fall off the cliff. And because of that, radio just went, why would we be playing this, you know, dance music? Because even the magazines that support the genre are saying it's all over. And, you know, and I think radio advertising was starting to become more and more important. And radio just stopped playing dance records. Because radio stopped playing dance music, all the major labels shut down their club promotions and their club A&R departments and their dance labels, and they stopped doing dance compilations. So we couldn't get records on the radio. We weren't doing licensing to major labels for compilations. And I was like, oh, my God, how are we going to promote what we do? We've got, you know, the Internet wasn't, you know, there was no YouTube. There was no social media then. So we started, we agonized for a while about a concept that would work. And that's why we started Defected in the House, because it was, we were a house music label. so we were proud of that and we wanted to go out on the road and if we were going to be appearing in a venue in a destination we would be in the house for that moment in time so we identified some people that we wanted to to make compilations for us and that set the tone musically for what we wanted to do We went to some clubs and we tried to pitch it in and they were just like, well, no one really cares. Why would we want to book your event and pay you a brand fee and do this? We're doing your marketing for you. So it wasn't actually something that was successful from the get-go. What happened was a few of the albums came out, they sold really well. And as soon as they sold well and the clubs realised we didn't need them to market our releases... and that they were popular and kids were interested in what we were doing. Then, actually, they started to become interested in booking us. So the two fed each other really well, and it really grew out of there. Now, when we started to do Ibiza, we had two scenes at a time. El Divino and Ibiza was a huge shop window for a lot of labels and a lot of big club brands at the time. Cream were there, Ministry of Sound were there and we knew that we wanted to be there in some way but it was hard to penetrate any of the big clubs. So we did El Divino, we did a Sunday night first of all and we did a Friday night after that. And it wasn't the most fashionable destination for people to go to, but we put our hearts into it. We worked really hard. And again, our community is a very loyal community. And they turned up. We had great parties. It was an amazing time. And after two years, we got a call from Pasha. And yeah, since then, the events business has been a very substantial part of what we do. Certainly. So how many years is it a Pasha this year? Is it your eighth? I always forget. I think it's our seventh, but it could be our eighth. Oh, good. Well, it's just got quite a diverse lineup at the effectiveness events this year. Can you tell us a little bit about those? Yes. I think if you stand still too long, the grass grows around your feet and people become less interested in what you do. We had two or three years where our line-ups were quite static. We're very loyal to the people that make music for the label. and so we support them and the events that we do are 75-80% based around the people that make music for the label but having said that music is very diverse these days and we like a broad spectrum of house music at Defected it's not about a specific sound we would put out we've just got a record that Candy Staten sings on it's an original record from the 70s and Lars has remixed it and it's a deep soul record and then we'll put out something like Parupa Parting On Stop which is like a banging Todd Terry-esque record that we picked up from Desolate and we like music across the board so the DJs and our nights have to really reflect that And we're always looking for new talent. I want to know who's going to be the next Dennis Ferrer, the next big thing in four or five years' time. And if I nurture my relationship with those people now, conversations with them will be much easier in time to come. So yeah, we've made a point of trying to make our line-up a little bit more interesting, more diverse. And we've programmed the nights accordingly, so we wouldn't put Solomon with Bob Sinclair, because musically it would be too much of a contradiction. But he's playing with Dennis, and I think that will make for a great night. And again, it gives us something new to talk about on all of our forums. It gives the journalists something new to talk about. and it will give us longevity, I believe. It seems like you're very adept at putting both underground and maybe commercial stuff together. Is Defected an underground or a commercial label? Can you say either one? We are... We have a little bit of a perception problem at Defected, I believe. Because I believe we put out great club records. But because we promote them hard and we market our records hard, the underground doesn't really kind of give us the credit I think that sometimes we possibly deserved. But I'm fine with that. I've, you know, I learned to live with that a long time ago. But, you know, we're not a commercial house label because it's really hard, unless you're making what people are deeming or calling EDM now, you know, stadium house records, as some people have termed. I think it's really hard to be a commercial house label. I think that we make and we release records that are very DJ-orientated records, and then it goes to the extent that some of them are maybe punter records that are a little bit more accessible. But I wouldn't say we're a commercial house label. So it's interesting. and you know you you obviously stated you're great at promoting records you know you've got a great history of doing that and America's really opening up to dance music now do you think you would be able to promote some kind of more tasteful music to this growing oh I hate the word EDM but the growing EDM market the dreaded uh the dreaded EDM word You know, there's some hotly debated EDM topics going on at the moment. And I'm not in the, oh my God, that's terrible. What are they doing to my scene? Look what dance music is in America. I don't subscribe to that at all. I believe that most of the guys actually that work in our office at Defected, when they were 18, they liked trance or they liked drum and bass, etc. That's their entry point into dance music. As they grow older, they become, you know... more inquisitive or their tastes evolve and they go off to like different things and and and uh some of them like deep house and they know far more about dance music than than than I at this moment. They just absolutely live in it. And I believe that's what's going to happen in America. I think that what's happening now is an entry point for a lot of people who will then evolve and go off and find different things. Now, I don't believe we will play like the Swedish House Mafia on a main stage at a festival to 75,000 people, but there will be a place for us. And, you know, and that's great for us. And we need new markets to survive as a business. So, yeah, it's it's I think it's really interesting. We're not making a place to to. to promote what we do or to go and tour in America at the moment because I actually don't think the time is right. But I believe it will be maybe in a year or so's time. So yeah, the EDN phenomenon is a good thing. So I think we've probably got time for one more question. I know you're a huge football fan. This is a bit tangential for RA, but how do you reckon QPR are going to do this year? I know you're a huge QPR fan. Well, supporting QPR has actually been quite painful. The good thing about QPR is you know exactly where you stand. I think there are teams that are far more difficult to support. Like if you support Tottenham, for instance, you're just on the edge of doing well. They've been on the edge of doing well. forever so there's way too much hope with Tottenham Hotspur supporters it's probably never going to happen so sorry if I've offended all the Tottenham supporters so we had a very traumatic season in the premiership last year when I looked at the fixture list with 12 games to go we were down dead and buried we managed to pull a few surprise results off especially at home I do wish we'd have held on against Manchester City to win or to draw but I don't know if anybody watched the match we knew we were up with two minutes to go and we stayed up and we just switched off and City went on to score but I reckon that puts us in good shape for this season and I can see a lot of teams struggling. We've bought well. I think Mark Hughes is an astute manager for the level of club that we are. And I feel we're going to do OK. you
