You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour. This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Welcome to the Hour and RA's 2016 in Review podcast. It's become an annual tradition for members of RA's editorial team to get together at the end of each year to talk about some of the artists and records and labels that have been exciting us over the past 12 months. We hope you've all been following the year-end pulse features we've been running on the site recently, and this talk should hopefully be a nice companion. to those lists. We'll begin by talking about some of our favourite albums from this year, then we'll go on to discuss DJs, live acts, labels, mixes, and then finish up with our favourite RA podcasts. We'll be getting some personal perspectives on 2016 from people who you maybe only know from their exquisite writing, so let's get started. Let's introduce everyone. We've got RA staff writers Matt Unicombe. Hello. Holly Dicker. Hello. And Angus Finlayson. Hi. RA's tech editor Mark Smith. Hi. And Will Lynch, RA's associate editor, who also DJs under the name Time Cop. Hi. Okay, so before we begin, I wanted to touch on the results of the RADJ poll, which saw Dixon take the number one spot for the fourth year running. Does anyone have any thoughts on what it might take for someone to steal his throne? Well, the thing that might change is people start moving away from this emotional house sound that Dixon and Tale of Us and these kind of guys do so well. So I was thinking maybe with Adam Beyer and Jack Masters like high placement, maybe there's a growing appetite for more beat based rhythmic stuff. I guess you can see the power of these big room DJ sets like bang clock is always placed highly Adam Bay are extremely high this time. You can just see that this music has as a broad appeal as this more melodic kind of emotional stuff. It's basically the return of the big beat manifesto. Exactly, which can only be a good thing. Right, let's begin with albums. Will, we were saying when we put the top 20 albums together that SW's Untitled seemed to come out just slightly too late for people to consider voting for it. Personally, I felt like this would have been a strong contender for inclusion if it had come out a few months ago. I assume you'd agree with that. Yeah, it was my number one album. album of the year, but it's a vinyl-only label, and it's not necessarily on everyone's radar, so I think it will turn out to be kind of a sleeper hit, if that. But yeah, for me, Sued has been one of my favorites for a couple years, so I was sort of pleasantly caught off guard to have them release what I consider is probably the best thing they've ever put out. I guess what makes it so good It has all the things that we like about, or that I like about the label. It's kind of interesting, organic sound design, sort of genre-transcending styles, sort of lots of things going on at once, techno, house, in this case kind of drum and bass and ambient. But something about this one, it felt like it was delivered. with a bit more of a, I guess you'd call kind of a human dimension. These are songs that I really have created a strong personal connection with. For instance, I failed to... I forgot to rip the album before I went on a trip to London, and I genuinely missed it. I was excited to get back to Berlin so I could listen to this album. And I was extremely relieved when Andrew Rice sent me his ripped files, which at this point, it's quite rare for me to establish that kind of emotional link to an album of this kind. I also thought the untitled thing that they always do worked out particularly well. All the tracks are untitled, the album's untitled. There are some songs that seem to be kind of different mixes of each other. but you don't know that for sure, so the effect is just that certain chord progressions and certain loops and sounds seem to just recur throughout the album, which has sort of a cool effect. You're saying that it felt more human in relation to the label's other releases. What does that say about the label's other releases? A lot of their music is improvised and kind of jam-based and just sort of out there. trippy, psychedelic, and I'm sure there have been a few, but I can't remember one that had this kind of emotional content to it. you Well Matt, I think many of us were impressed by Peder Mannerfeld's output this year. You've gone for his album Controlling Body, which did feature in our top 20 albums list. Yeah, I was pleasantly surprised to see it in there, but actually it's probably not so surprising because these are nice tracks. that seem to have pretty broad appeal, which is, I think, part of the reason why I like it so much, because it's one of these albums that's nice to listen to, but you know a lot of complex stuff is going on underneath. And I actually kind of feel the same way about Don't DJ. It's like nice melodies, you know, bright sounds, but you know these Avena, I don't know, it's a production master putting this stuff together. So yeah, it works on like lots of different levels. I can't say I was so into his previous stuff, like the darker Roll the Dice or early Peter Bannerfelt stuff. I think, yeah, this is the only thing of his I've really latched onto. And it's probably just because it has this positive kind of appeal. A lot of it's sample-based, or almost all, with voices, of course. I guess, like, he just has an ear for choosing nice samples and tweaking them in a way that sounds good, you know? It's a pretty artful thing to do, I think. It's one of the hardest things in electronic music, make music with broad appeal that's also very complex. Thank you. Holly, I know you're a long-term fan of Laka and you've picked Struggle and Emerge, which was released around the middle of the year. This one had a pretty specific concept flowing through it. Yes, I mean, I think I've picked this because of the concept and the fact that it's extremely close to home. So LACA were commissioned by Revive, which is an initiative in Holland designed to link up artists with archives, media archives, including TV, radio, etc. And LACA were invited to come and... create a new body of work involving the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, which is based outside of Amsterdam, I think. They were asked to respond to the theme of the Dutch and water. The Dutch and water. Dutch and water. Yeah, the Dutch and water. So they didn't really know anything about this theme. I've been living in Holland for a year and a half and I don't know anything about the history of the Netherlands and the sea beyond the fact that half of it, like a lot of land, has been reclaimed to create this country. So I'm just going to reel off a couple of facts. 60% of the country is susceptible to flooding. and it's amongst the most densely populated on earth, which actually all points to quite a terrifyingly doomed future. So all of this is going through this album. And then you listen to the album and you realise it is really dark, it's quite extreme. I know that Laka make intense techno music, but this... you know, this is another level. There's lots of mechanical, industrious sounds there. There's less of a sort of cinematic, poignant element which normally comes through in their music. So it was, and then I saw it live and it was a real striking piece of music. It's a really fantastic album. So presumably the intensity levels in the live show were fairly extreme. Yeah, I mean, I saw it at Rewire and it was sort of a whole weekend of real extreme live music, but this was really, yeah, it was really powerful. Really took the prize. Yeah, totally. Angus, please tell us about your selection. Yeah, I chose an album called Sign of the Cross Every Mile to the Border by Ceramic TL, which is an alias of Egyptrix. Egyptrix is a really kind of unusual and interesting artist. He sort of had this strange kind of like diagonal path across various different kind of styles and scenes. I guess he came to my attention as an early member of the Night Slugs crew. But he was out in Canada, you know, most of that crew was and is in London and he kind of started off making this kind of synthy stuff that suited the label but by the time He kind of did his last thing with the label. He was very much an anomaly. He was making this sort of strange, kind of metallic, kind of dread-filled techno. And he eventually kind of went off and started his own label, Halleck Lean Trance. And this album, I feel like, is kind of the first thing he's done where it really feels like a cadence. He's no longer beholden to any sort of other scene. He's not trying to fit in anywhere. This really is his thing. And it has these kind of really specific traits to it. The structures are these kind of stark blocks of sound. It's very suspenseful. It's kind of ambient, but it's very rhythmic as well. The theme of it is environmental cataclysm. and somehow, even though it's lyric-less music, it doesn't use samples or not in a particularly obvious way, but somehow this theme really comes through very strongly. does this all sort of equate to tonally? Quite terrifying actually in places. Yeah, it's somehow a very intense album even though there are long stretches where nothing in particular happens. It's quite a visceral experience to listen to. Mark, you reviewed Space Travel's Dancing Therapy, which came out on Perlon and gave it a 3.6, which of course isn't a bad score, but has this one continued to grow on you, would you say? Yeah, for sure. And, you know, 3.6 is a great score. If you've got a 3.6, you've nailed it. The appeal of this record for me is pretty simple and I think it's something that will keep coming up at least when I'm spoken to here. It's very obviously just dancehall music. It's not a record which has any greater meaning than that. but it's just simple things to do with the type of bass lines that he writes. Really syncopated, dexterous bass lines combined with really nicely programmed shuffling drums from classic drum machines. And then just the melodies and sound effects have this really maniacal... crazy quality but it's also like extremely light-hearted and approachable and you might listen to it's like a it's a double pack even I'd even hesitate to call it an album like it's it's for DJs to play and this is the sort of thing where every time you play it you're surprised how well it goes down for how strange it is and you hear it on a system and you hear people mixing it and you're like this is freaking awesome but you might like just hear clips on your headphones at your computer and be like this is like a strange shuffling tech house track it also has a lot of character and this space travel guy is just i don't know this stuff is so weird But to slam so well, it's awesome to dance to. What is Space Traveler's deal? I don't actually know too much about him. He is an Italian guy who lives in Berlin. And he is somewhat affiliated to people like Ben. Stuff like this is put out records on Mailerflow, which is Vera and Alexandra's label, and Bin's label, Time Passages. So that's the sort of general world that he's in. You can tell there's a vein of music that he's getting at, which is just... weird bass lines which work, awesome drums and weird sounds and that's all you could ask for on a dance floor basically. Okay, let's talk about the DJs who impressed us this year. Angus, I'm going to start with you because you're actually the only person who picked someone who finished in our top 100, or RA's top 100. Wow. Tell us about your choice. Yeah, I chose Object. partly because he was the DJ who most surprised and engrossed me in clubs this year, but also as a kind of an opportunity to discuss an intriguing kind of micro-trend that he seems to be spearheading at the moment, which, to put it simply, is playing slow. I mean, like, really slow, so like 105, 110 BPM and down. down to like 80 maybe. And this is something that I first saw him do at the launch for his Trizzle mix. He did the warm-up slot in the club. And yeah, he was playing for three or four hours and he sort of slowly ascended and didn't go above 110 BPM for the whole set. And since then, every time I've seen him, he's managed to sort of sneak in. at least one section where he goes right down to these tempos and he's playing kind of like half-time drum and bass, instrumental hip-hop, like a lot of kind of ill-being stuff from the 90s. So he's not necessarily starting with this stuff but he'll build to this stuff. Yeah, something that I think was discussed in his Art of DJing interview, Will, maybe you can confirm this, is that he pays a lot of attention to transitions. So his ability to go from one thing to something completely different in the space of 10 minutes without you noticing is quite extraordinary. But yeah, it's been interesting to see how these tempos go down on dance floors. I think it's just... completely new frontier for instance i saw him playing at the pan night at berghain recently and um yeah to watch a relatively full dance floor at sort of i don't know five in the morning kind of swaying to this like yeah 90s instrumental hip-hop it's just the energy is totally different yeah it's completely different um and in that respect I think it's really interesting and it's not just him as well I mean I know Cool Super's been playing dancehall sets here and there Ben Uefo on his Rinse show has done segments every now and then of this slower stuff. And also there are these kind of parallel movements that aren't related, but maybe speak to some kind of wider shift that's going on. So like Bok Bok at the beginning of the year did a mix with the subtitle How to Rave at 105 BPM. And of course, you have people like Lena Villikens as well, who plays very slow. So it's just interesting to see these. Previously unexplored tempos suddenly being discovered by DJs. Just going to add, in that art DJing feature, something TJ said I thought was interesting was it's one of his goals. This might not have made it in, actually, but he said it's one of his goals to play a full two or three hour set at any tempo range, which is something that's a lot easier to pull off. with things like record box and the way you can organize your folders by tempo. But that goal sounds like it's maybe something other people are thinking as well, whether they're aware of it. or not. Yeah, I do wonder how many people have seen objects playing one of these sets and have suddenly thought, oh, you know what, like I've got quite a lot of slow tracks in my collection that I never played because I just thought, well, I'm never going to have the opportunity. Maybe if I scrape them all together, I'll have a couple of hours of stuff. So I think it kind of somehow maybe, I mean, I don't know where he initially got the idea from. Maybe he also was inspired by somebody else, but it feels like suddenly there's this permission to give it a go. There's also these somewhat drum and bass affiliated guys who were making tracks at 170 or 180 bit or in triplet time, which means you can mix it with techno. So I think that's an interesting addition to that. You can play multiple tempos at the same time or get from one to the other without people even noticing. And that'd be sick if that became more normal, you know. Interestingly, this pan set that I saw Object play, he did exactly that. He used a Don't DJ track. I guess 90 or something like that. I'm not sure of the exact maths, which is kind of decentered. Like, you know, you can't really work out how many beats there are in the bar and then mix that into a made up sound track, which is in triplet time at like 125 or something like that. And so there's this sort of confusing five minutes where it feels like you're sort of underwater and you can't work out what's going on. And then suddenly you're just at a different tempo. Again, I guess that's something that's facilitated by digital DJing, where you can be extremely precise with the beat matching and it's much easier to hold a mix like that. for several minutes without everything just completely kind of falling apart. Holly you've gone for Acid Arab this is a French duo who are putting kind of modern dance floor twists on eastern sounds does sound like a difficult thing to get right but assuming it's something you think they pull off. Yeah I think the great thing about seeing them play is that it is so natural. even though you're transported to a totally alien world and you have no idea. what music is being played. I mean I'm personally not an expert on this stuff. I am definitely not an expert but I now have a sort of curious interest in finding all these different sounds and I think they're a great conduit for that but I've picked them mostly because I've seen them a bunch of times this year and they gave me sort of my... highlight festival moments like twice, three times. So I saw them at Strange Sounds from Beyond in Amsterdam and just, it was sort of in an amphitheatre, the sun was setting over the IJ waterways, curious sounds coming across. Across the waterways, everyone was just sort of euphoric, shoeless, throwing glitter, dancing to music they have no idea about, but enjoying it nevertheless. And I think that's sort of the whole point of what Acid Arab do, is uniting sort of different people, different cultures on the dance floor. Matt, you spoke to... Vera, your pick for an Art of DJing feature earlier this year. It feels like she's had something of a resurgence of late, or is that just a kind of outside the Berlin scene impression that I have? I was wondering the same thing, because I was actually surprised she wasn't in the top 100. I really thought she was a shoo-in. But, yeah, it's... The thing is, she's just been a very skilled DJ for a long time. And maybe just... The thing with Vera and lots of people in her kind of, like, field... is that they haven't shaken off the minimal tag that so many of them are stuck with. So as soon as most people think of Vera, they think of Oslo Records and Mannheim House, which is basically not true anymore and hasn't been true for a while. So I think since she's kind of... stepped away from those sounds and is playing something maybe a bit more modern like this space travel kind of stuff. Mark mentioned, she's just, she's been able to reach more people because she's playing really cool tunes. You don't need to be into like stripped down dance music to enjoy it. Hugh, our events programmer said that the Vera set for In Residence is one of his favorites of the year, which is saying something because he's into this like weirdo, you know, grime and experimental kind of stuff. And she's also just like, She's technically very good. I think in that kind of field, the only person that comes close is maybe... Onorosa and they have similar backgrounds actually both started playing off this like loopy kind of music and then switched to something more dynamic so basically the the knowledge of how to build a set is there as soon as you give them more like interesting tunes because that's a subjective term they dominate So following on from that, Mark, you've picked Treatment. Duo people will more likely know as Bin and Ozer. I assume this pick is based on the set you saw them play at Robert Johnson, right? Yeah, and I also saw them play at Trezor too. Okay. Following on from what Matt was saying about Vera, these people who... came from this quote-unquote minimal world have now equipped themselves with a range of music which compared to the regular house and techno stuff that you know something like RA is indicative of just feels like there's more to grab into there's more depth to it. It could just be a factor of being like disenchanted with a certain type of house and techno that I personally would consider normative or something. But these guys are playing like a lot of electro, Sheffield bleep, early IDM, like English people in the early 90s inspired by Detroit and then Detroit as well. And they're very often going between 4-4 tracks and broken beat tracks. And I personally am very much... drawn to that type of transition when something's been syncopated for about eight minutes and then you have that 4-4 payoff and it's just constantly going between straight and broken and again kind of like the the space travel record a lot of it's like bombastic super weird stuff but it's still imminently approachable in a way. Like, perhaps it is a quote-unquote nerdy sound, but I find it fun, like a lot of fun. So how does what they're doing together differ from what they do individually? Well, I've actually not seen Ono on his own. But I saw Bin a couple of weeks ago for maybe like third or fourth time and he was playing a lot straighter, a lot more kind of weird, wiggy, techno, like odd, deep house sort of stuff, not syncopated, which is the key difference here, it seems. Treatment is specifically very much electro-oriented, I'd say, yeah. Will, you've chosen Avalon Emerson and Courtesy, who you saw recently closing Panorama Bar. That's right. I think part of what made it so good was I kind of waltzed in at the very end of the whole thing. The club was only going to be open for another couple hours. So I just caught the most kind of loose, unhinged part from a musical standpoint, though. Basically, it reminded me of there's a quote in the book. how to DJ properly that I always liked, which was if as a DJ you have something that other people definitely aren't going to play or this is something that only you would do, you really need to make an effort to work that in every time because those will be the memorable moments for the crowd. Those will be the parts that are different from other nights out. And yeah, this set kind of embodied that. Basically, I guess, simply put, it was very eclectic. Everything from kind of crunchy electro Cheeto records to Avalon doing Aaliyah over the opening bars of Gislot and Circle, Submit X, and then things like... Nine Inch Nails, Rishi Sakamoto. It was kind of all over the shop. These were edits of those tracks? Some edits, some just the originals. using the loop function on cdj but it's all strung together very well you're in panorama bar it's sort of broad daylight in there it's obviously kind of a um extraordinary atmosphere um it's just much nicer to hear something totally unexpected like rishi sakamoto's reign rather than um you know the pumping house that we get so much of all the time it's also just For me, I've always felt the thing that makes DJing interesting as an art form is the incredible range of what the DJ can do. You can literally play anything, and hardly anyone ever takes advantage of that. And this is a time where I felt like this, you know, it was this incredibly vast, varied collage of different sounds. But then, of course, you can't just do that. It takes a lot of finesse and subtlety to build the set to a point where that kind of thing feels appropriate. And then on a technical level to actually execute that in a way that makes sense. none of that's easy. But yeah, for me, it was definitely a very, very memorable set that left me very impressed by both the DJs. Let's move on and talk about your favourite live acts. Angus, your pick is Kalayla. So I saw her a week or so after Cut For Me. Her debut came out, I think it was 2013. at that point she was already super impressive let's say like incredible stage presence so I assume by this point like she's just owning it yeah I mean um I had not seen her before um I saw her this summer in um Prince Charles here in Berlin which is a I guess a few hundred capacity um club So it was after her Hallucinogen EP, which came out, was her first thing on Warp last year, but before her debut album, which still, I guess, I guess is coming out next year, but she was playing a lot of material from that. It's in this kind of calm before the storm that you get with, with these artists who are clearly going to go and do very big things. But there's this kind of... eerie silence whilst the album's been done but there's they're kind of waiting to gear up the promo push so it almost feels like it's the final opportunities to see someone like her perform in a venue like that exactly um and you know with a very basic setup like it was just a dj and i think one other musician but yeah she just it's just abundantly obvious that she's like ready for that kind of transition. Yeah, as you said, she has a great stage presence, she has a lot of charisma. Also, just the set was really well thought out and really well executed. I mean, she kind of like snuck different sections into some familiar songs and she sang the high from Hallucinogen over Dizzy Rascal's Wheel instrumental. These kind of like little moments that sort of surprised and... kept things interesting and there was like a clubby section at the end where there was sort of a medley of like ballroom and grime tracks but also she's just like very kind of emotionally open performer so she would kind of like pepper her set with little monologues about you know, what the songs meant and it would be about a breakup or like a new relationship or she would kind of reflect on her success and how amazing it's been and stuff. And these are all kind of potentially platitudes, which could sound extremely cliched and kind of like rehearsed. But somehow from her, the whole thing was just hugely convincing. I got that impression also. Yeah. Holly, I'm admittedly not too familiar with your pick. Do you want to explain who you've gone for? Brilliant. If I can pronounce his name right. So I've picked Paul Jebenasem and Tarek Barry. And their piece, they've created it together. It's Continuum. It's an actual audiovisual piece designed specifically for both components. The Subtex released the record in February and then immediately they went on tour because the whole point is to see this show live. I've been really privileged to see... a ton of amazing live acts but this one really blew my face off. It was at Sonic Acts Festival in Amsterdam in Paradiso which is this old church building so it's really quite impressive space. There was a huge screen filling the back room, chairs laid out, it was a very sit down affair. You need to be sat down to watch this. Musically, it's sort of a continuation of the music that Jib and Asim has been making, which is sort of very physical, power ambience, quite industrial. organic and artificial sounds. So you're talking beats, no beats? No, I mean I'd say it's, well I'll tell you the composition is a response to the life, power and energy present in the universe so as gaping as that sounds that's what is being translated into sound. And then Tarek Barry, he's a Dutch visual artist. He's been working with Tom York, Nicholas Shaw, and Monalake and hundreds of others. He's really, I'd say his style is quite simplistic, but he makes bespoke pieces with whoever he's working with. So this Continuum project. He actually wrote his own software which creates real-time computer-generated alternate realities, or in his words, the computer's imagination. So it's all really... How does that manifest? Well, it's a lot of lights. And again, it's very simple. But just amazingly striking. I mean, it's really, I think describing it is almost pointless. Like, I really can't stress how this needs to be felt, seen, heard. Experienced. Experienced. Okay, so I was going to go to Matt at this point, but he's had to dramatically run out of the room to vomit. So, Mark, let's go to you. So I remember catching up with you about your experiences at Semibreve Festival in Portugal. It kind of sounded like a hotbed for live electronic music. Tell us about your pick and tell us a bit about the festival. So my pick is Carly's Coverdale. who is a Canadian composer. She's extremely fluent in the sorts of traditional Western canonical stuff that you learn in a conservatory. But unlike a lot of people who've had that sort of academic upbringing, she's super on it with electroacoustics. software, digital manipulation and things like that. And so she's playing at these festivals where there's a lot of like, you know, power noise bro stuff going on and she just like destroys them. She just destroys them with like... the color that she has in her performances and also the control of dynamics and it just seems to be obviously on another level. In our dance music related world we tend to get exposed to a very specific type of experimental electronic music which tends to all fit into a sort of grayscale post-industrial aesthetic. And she just shows how narrow that is with like total flair. Having a hazy line between acoustic and digital sources is something that a lot of modern electronic music does. But the way she deals with different sound sources and manipulates them is, it was just honestly stunning. And there was... Things like each individual element feels like it was improvised when it was written. It has like a lively feel to it. But then the way in which each element is deployed as a whole is like so specifically composed that I was just kind of like jaw dropped at the virtuosity of the whole thing. Is it immediately clear when you're in the audience what is digitally derived and what is kind of acoustically derived? Well, very often, no. But some of the obvious high points of what she did, at least on this night, was when a unaltered acoustic source would become readily apparent and then... It sort of plays on this empathic human thing that everyone has inside you that even if you're into somewhat dehumanized music, you can't help but respond to choral voices. She has a background playing organs. in churches and she uses a lot of like ecclesiastical sounds like Gregorian chants and stuff like this. And so it has a very like totemic significance about it while also being colorful and approachable and, you know, exciting. I actually saw her at Rewire and she actually played in a church and she ended her set because she is a classically trained organ player. So she ended her set by going upstairs and playing this organ and she was also accompanied by MFO with visuals so I think it just accentuated all what you were saying. put into a real life setting of a church and just sort of brought out what she does in a very physical, it was just put into perspective, I guess. It was really amazing. Yeah, one of the best things I've seen as well. Will, Babyfather topped our albums list, but I got the impression that a big part of the fascination with the group this year had to do with their live performance. Yeah, in a way that would actually kind of surprise me. Basically, the thing that I liked about seeing them was this sort of prankster-y mischief element to the performance. I saw them at Unsound. They were kind of the, I think, sort of the main draw on the Friday night. They played at 11 p.m. on the Friday night of the festival, sort of thing everyone's planning their evening around to some extent. But then when you got there, the whole thing had this kind of funny element of anti-climax to it. Basically, the group is obscured by this wall of smoke. And also, the lighting was just extremely bright, unchanging floodlights, which you could sort of consider the exact opposite of normal event lighting. There was this weird effect where... I felt like for a while people couldn't tell if it had started. They didn't know if they should stop chatting or if this, you know, was this still some kind of annoying intro or is this all? And then, you know, for a second it felt like kind of a pop art joke of some kind, but then you realize, you sort of see movement in the smoke, and eventually you realize there is somewhere in there a relatively normal kind of hip-hop concert going on with guys that are dressed all cool kind of dancing around on the stage, or maybe not dancing, sort of lurking across the stage. It was just funny. We eventually realized. if it weren't for this ridiculous amount of smoke and this weird lighting choice, this would be something like a normal concert. And then we sort of got the hang of it. I don't know, you can sort of get into it like it was a normal concert and realize, you know, they're reeling out all the hits. This is really fun. But yeah, I just like that weird tension at the beginning there that, you know, when the artist kind of fucks with the audience. audience in a way that makes them think like, God, Jesus, this really is, this is all that's going to happen. And then. despite yourself you find yourself getting really into it yeah who knows about this one what you gonna do what you gonna do what you gonna do what you gonna do what you gonna do what you gonna do What you gonna do when we make it? Let's move on to the labels and discuss Diagonal, Holly's pick. Yippee! Felt like another strong year for Powell and Jamie Williams' label? Yeah, absolutely. But I think... I've been listening intently this year. I always thought they were a curiosity for the last couple of years. Had your ear, but not your full attention. They've totally caught my attention this year with the Not Waving Animals album, which I thought was a really interesting retro act. post-punk EBM band meets disco mashup and then came this NMO album which was a duo from Berlin with Laptop and Drums totally rambunctious noise, mellay that I really would love to see live and then there was NHK with his Doomsteppy Reverb album which is lot more conventionally clubby and then this second record from Evil called Right Frankfurt which is sort of micro compositional deconstructed rave and so all of that sounds completely diverse but it all comes from the same label it's all packaged in the same sort of neon playful considered fun way and I have to say that I've not enjoyed every release this year which sort of makes me love diagonal the more because they're just willing to go there yeah Bye. Angus, you picked Time Dance. This is a label I think a few of us were pretty impressed with this year. This time last year, I was sat in this chair talking about seeing Peverellist DJ at free rotation and how... hearing all of this kind of Bristol, whatever you call it, hybrid, bassy, techno, in this context, it kind of rekindled my faith in that sound and that style, after perhaps feeling that it had stagnated slightly. And one of the things I mentioned there was that I had been slightly disappointed by what... the younger generation, the people sort of five years younger than Peverlist and Cowton and so on had been doing. You know, they had lots of interesting ideas, but somehow they were still very much in the shadow of labels like Liberty Sound and Hessel Audio. They hadn't really sort of started their own thing. And this year, I think Time Dance, which is the label of Batu, who is a Liberty affiliated producer, has become that sort of new hub for this music. He's kind of gathered a bunch of these artists from that world. and released some of their most kind of adventurous music yet. So the releases this year, you had this track called Beta. by Lurka which is this very strange kind of like slow electro thing and then you had an EP from Ploy who also did a release on Hessel this year this kind of like spooky tribal techno. Bruce released in my opinion his his most banging single two really bizarre tracks that are just extremely powerful tools in the hands of good DJs and then just came And our Elaxa record, this kind of like distorted techno thing. Yeah, they're all very different records. All of these producers really have their own personality. None of them sound like they're trying to be, for instance, a Peverellist record, which I think was maybe a criticism you could level at these producers in previous years. What does connect them to Peverellist's world? I mean, you've described it. multitude of genres there but what's the kind of connecting tissue well I think it's I think it's structural rather than stylistic often so um I mean, Batu lives in Bristol. I believe he lives with Bruce and Ploy, both of whom have released on Hessel. Lurker has released on Black Acre and a few other labels that have released various bits of this kind of UK stuff. And their previous music has obviously been looking to these older artists for cues, but they seem to be in this place where... they're each developing their own sound and it's kind of going somewhere interesting and new. Will, you chose the many labels of Sotheby's and Fett Burger. Did it feel as though each of the labels was saying something different this year? You know, I've never really been able to parse what separates one from another. But if you consider the various labels these guys have going on, so Sex Tags Mania, Sex Tags Amphibia, Vanya, So Fat, Freak Out Cult, and then they've kind of got their fingers in a few other ones. a Cheeto and a few more run by their friends. Anyway, if you consider all these at once, they sort of form this weird kind of strange universe where on the one hand, sometimes it seems like there's no clear common thread to the music, but there absolutely is. It's just kind of... eludes simple description um but you know they've got sort of uh like dub reggae house seven inches um tribal techno um Vanya recently put out that mad teo and sensational record that's kind of left field low tempo house um with an mc uh they just have this ability to sort of follow their strangest impulses and it always kind of makes sense and it's delivered in this irreverent hip-hop inspired crass we don't give a shit kind of way but I think the fact that they release quite a lot of music and it all is quite fractured it's on different labels different pseudonyms causes you not to sort of see it all at once. But if you do, these are obviously some of the most inspired and prolific artists going at the moment. I mean, do you feel as though it's a case of them intentionally limiting their success in a way? Yeah, who knows? That's sort of the thrill of it too, is they're just kind of so generally strange that... It's impossible to say why they have so many sort of sub-labels and sister labels and et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, then another one I just want to give a shout out to is that LNS record on Freakout Cult, which is sort of like Fettberger and Jada G's label, which A, it's kind of cool that Fettberger would have this random Vancouver connection, right? Or is that Jada G's from Vancouver? And then LNS, the producer from Vancouver, just kind of like dreamy house. Electro record is definitely one of my favorite things this year. But yeah, it just kind of underlines the fact that these guys are just very unpredictable. They couldn't do anything to surprise me at this point. Mark, you've gone for Traffic, a label that had three releases this year, but that was sufficient to catch your ear. Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty obviously showing my hand here and talking about space travel, treatment and traffic. I said at the outset that they all appeal to me in largely the same way. But Traffic is interesting in that in the past few years, various groups of people have been playing a more eclectic range of music. And now that is starting to be reflected in new productions. And Traffic is, in my opinion... the label that takes that and actually makes something which has its own voice. A lot of this music is quite strange, but you can kind of tell it's becoming a formula already. Whereas Traffic doesn't feel like that at all. They're from Off and Back, which, you know... Near Frankfurt, it's an area which has created a lot of interesting different types of electronic music over the years. And these guys are drawing from that same soup of electro, breaks, bleep, two-step, Detroit, early IDM. And like space travel, they have these records which have this maniacal... goofy uh aspect to them which is just like infectious and fun but you could be like an uber vinyl nerd and be like oh yeah this is like drawing on all these obscure electro records i know or you could like have no clue about it and enjoy it in the same breath essentially Like the sounds of their records, if they were released in 98 on a white label, there'd be like a hundred dudes trying to buy it for like a hundred bucks or something. It's particularly their electro tracks are just fierce. Awesome. It's an interesting one. I checked out everything on the label and. I recognize it in broad strokes. You know, I might describe something as like a tech house track, for example, but there's something there that sets them apart. But I can't quite put my finger on what it is. compositionally or to do with the sounds that they're using. Again, the thing I've said multiple times about these other artists, quality bass lines, bass lines, which are syncopated and pick out strange pitches, but they're, they've obviously heard like, you know, a billion tech house and minimal tracks with dope bass lines as well. So there's this kind of. coming from this more elaborate early techno IDM type of complicated programming but on a system it's just like knockout. Okay let's talk DJ mixes. Angus you've gone for motion graphics blowing up the workshop mix. I definitely didn't hear many mixes like this in 2016. Yeah I don't know what it is about. I mean, it's, you know, it's just a sequence of tracks. I mean, I'm describing a mix, but, you know, like the blending, the technical aspects of how the mix is assembled is not complex. Even the zones from which he draws music are not completely unknown zones. But nonetheless, the tracks he finds, they just have this weird sort of fascinating power to them. I mean, I think for me, why I love this mix is because I love the Motion Graphics album from this year, his debut album on Domino, which is this kind of like very extremely contemporary sounding pop record. You know, his idea was that in the way that Kraftwerk... reflected their kind of technological moment in pop. He would do this, but now, so like kind of inspired by the sounds of... phone notifications and the feel of digital interfaces and this sort of thing. So it's a very contemporary record, but it has also this very clear historical context, particularly around this kind of experimental synth music from Japan from the 80s and 90s. And this mix, the Blowing Up the Workshop mix, provides that historical context. So you kind of see how this sound that he's come up with sounds extremely modern and fresh, but also is very historically rooted. Will, you've picked a Radio 1 Essential mix that features Nick Drake, Radiohead and Frankie Valli. Explain. So it's Midlands Essential Mix and those track selections are pretty much the reason I like it so much. Basically mixes in general, maybe especially the Essential Mix, are often kind of a snapshot of what a DJ would sound like in a club. or they show you what this DJ brings to his club and festival performances when really a mix can be much more than that. And in this case, the fact that it starts with that guitar and strings intro from Nick Drake, Brighter Later, sort of signals right away that this is something much more personal than the average DJ mix fare. And that balance between those kind of off-piece selections, Talk Talk and Radiohead and whatnot, plus recent club music, upcoming things on Midlands labels, and the odd bit of film dialogue, like there's a snippet from Paris is Burning in there. The result, to me, feels like kind of autobiographical, or almost like a self-portrait, which is... something that's definitely possible with a DJ mix almost more similar to mix CDs you would make in high school or something like that where it's sort of you're using this as a way to, you know, convey your own personality through your musical taste. It's something that I think is a very potent dimension of DJing as an art form, but it's one that you don't see very often. And I thought it was particularly gutsy to do this in that venue on the BBC Essential Mix. Holly, you've picked Flavody's Fabric Live Mix. This has to be one of the rowdiest mixes of the year, right? Oh, yeah. It's a party from start to finish. And I think that's why I like it. I've been listening to a lot of Grime this year, as have quite a few people, I'm sure. And I thought this mix was... particularly special because it was a real pure snapshot of Flavadie herself. She pretty much produced or had a hand in every single track here apart from a handful now she's a really amazing technical cd dj but she never like it's only in the recent couple of years that she started dj she's a producer first so i thought this was a real um bold twist on the fabric live um series and so she she sort of showed off both sides of herself the producer side And her DJ style, because this is exactly what a Flavody set would sound like, went to see her in fabric at the launch. And yeah, it was just, it was a pop-in party. To properly characterise the mix, there were certainly some grime selections, but lots of garage, lots of kind of baseline house going on as well. Exactly. So, yeah, we know her mostly as a grime DJ, grime personality because of the Butters connection. But she has this other sort of sugary... UKG side to herself and this mix sort of tossed and turned between the two quite energetically. I quite like the sort of the extremes that she can go to in her productions and her DJ sets. It can be sweet female attitude, sing along, all the girls swaying and then suddenly it's screw face, bass line, grime. hard as nails and then back to sipping pina coladas on the beach kind of thing. It was great. Mark, I didn't get a chance to hear your selection, which is Sylvia Castell's Barbula Harena, but the press notes made it sound like a pretty wild ride. And this was a tape on Blackest Ever Black, right? Yeah, I think it came out like last week or something like that, very recently. But I've seen her playing in small venues and radio stations around Berlin this year. She's been part of like a experimental electronic slash noise. seen for a long time. She's released a lot of records, she runs her own label, but she's also just a sick DJ with tastes that I very much respond to. This mix on the blackest tape kind of jumps between concrete, post-punk, electro, jungle, digidub, Detroit. techno with no kick drums and things like this and they're all great tracks and they're generally mixed fairly standardly but there's just a few certain transitions which are this like clear surprise wow moments which really stick out and 4-4 club music mixes I don't know it's just something that I don't really get a lot out of anymore and something like this is a genuinely like surprising experience whereas I don't think I've heard a 4/4 mix this year on headphones sitting down where you're like genuinely moved by it so that's part of the reason why I like this mixer. Right, so we usually finish these year-end discussions on a self-congratulatory note by talking about everyone's favourite RA podcasts. We don't include these in our online mixes poll, so it's obviously a good shout-out to the DJs who recorded great mixes for us. Angus, you've picked Josie Rebell's podcast, which was certainly one of my personal highlights of the year. She has a pretty unique ear, right? Yeah, I mean, if I recall, there was a bit of strange sort of telepathy going on because I suggested to you... I'd love to do a feature on Josie Rebell and it just so happened that that week or very recently you asked her for a mix. She's a DJ that I absolutely love, mainly through her Rinse FM show, which is three hours on a Sunday morning, every Sunday. She kind of moves in a world that I guess I don't follow particularly closely anymore, which is this... to me, very London soul continuum. So, you know, she's playing like 80s, like New Jack swing tracks and things like this. This is on the Brint show. Yeah, just in general in DJing and disco and then like classic house and techno, but then right through to like contemporary, rougher UK sounds. Also a lot of this kind of new soul stuff that comes out of labels like Egg Low and... 22A and things like that. And yeah, this is music that I don't follow super closely, but I just, I find that her ear and her way of presenting it, I'm always completely stunned by these tracks and immediately want to find out what they are. And this mix, I think, does a really good job of summarising in just over an hour what she does as a DJ. You know, it kind of takes quite a few styles at a clip. Could feel rushed, but actually the whole thing flows and I just think if you need an introduction to Josie Rebell, then this is the mix for it. Mark, tell us about your selection. It's Reim's RA podcast, which in hindsight, now that they've released this record as Yally, kind of makes a lot of sense, but I was super psyched when we were listening to it the first time because it was full of... garage going between like kind of lighter two-step into dark kind of LB style garage and then touching on grime and like the continuum between all three of those things which is just an awesome combo you know that like 98 to 2003 era where everything's just kind of going off in its own direction but they're still interlinked in interesting ways and they're kind of like obscene perfectionists at everything that they do and it was just really great hearing them turn their hand to this sort of you know bubbly effervescent music even if a lot of it was quite dark because Their music is basically the opposite of that but it's interesting hearing the Continuities that they draw between what they do and this type of mix. Did you spend much time with their album? Yes, did you get the link? between what they did there and Garage and Grime. It is like an implied link which I don't think is actually deliberately enunciated. I think it's something that is within the DNA of it but there's not like stylistic elements where it can be like this element or that element except for perhaps the way it's mixed because like they cut it on two 12s and it slams like if you play it on a system it is big and if you were no disrespect to the drum and guitar people out there but um Those chops don't come from nowhere. So Holly, you've been championing the breakcore artists for even my dear on RA for a good few years now. At least since the moment I walked in here, yes. So did his RA podcast deliver in your eyes? Absolutely. This was a real triumphant achievement for, I guess, me as a journalist, proof that if you bang on about someone long enough... other people might be curious about it. Yeah, so it's no surprise. I love his music. I love his style. It's very mercurial, which is sort of what Breakcore is anyway, but he brings so much other influences, a wide variety of music to the table, including opera. Japanese folk music, etc. But I thought his mix was quite interesting because for a start he's not a DJ. So this was quite a rare thing and I think a bit difficult for him to do. So he sort of looked... sort of within his his closer remit of like friends and also the labels that he's released on so there's artists from like ad noisium and prospect um but in general i think if you still don't know what breakcore is this is a great this is a great place to start um are you going out seeing many break whore DJs at the moment? I am poised, so long as I don't have Matt's illness, to go to Prospect on Saturday. It's pretty much the biggest party in Holland that has a break whore and hard drum bass gabber platform and I am super excited. Who's on the bill? I'm going to see Busy B. I can't wait for that. Unfortunately, I missed Room Idea Play last time. It's actually quite a lot of Hellfish and DJ Producer. They're also great, great guys to check out. Also, Bangface is coming up next year, guys. It's a great line-up this year. It's actually amazing. Who's headlining? Atari Teenage Riot. Boom. Well, we're ending with an artist from Giggling, our label of the year. Tell us about Leafa Legoff. It's probably the best received mix of the year, right? In terms of the number of comments and the tone of them. That was actually why I wanted to talk about it. If I'm totally honest, my number one podcast of the year was Reign, along with Mark. But the Leafheart Leg of Podcast made such a weird splash that I felt like it had to be remarked on. It sort of came over the transom. They sent it to us and for some reason needed it to be. run quickly. But they, I don't know, I guess it's an example of this thing they do where they use these free online mixes as a kind of, I guess just as a mixtape where it's all kind of unknown music, presumably unreleased stuff from the artist, but you don't actually know for sure. It's the same thing that Prince and Metatron and Prince of Denmark do and also Sapa. But yeah, in general, I guess what's interesting to me about it is how when I first heard it, it didn't scream hit. Like I knew it was... very nicely done and I personally liked it but I didn't think this is definitely going to be our biggest podcast of the year and then it was such a sensation like it was the podcast for sure that the most people just wanted to chat with me about I was at this house party one time where it was played twice and the second time I put on something else in the middle of it and got this horrible reaction. Like I felt like I was going to be, you know, physically assaulted. And I just think it's interesting that this is, you know, somber, sensitive, kind of vulnerable sounding music. And it gets people absolutely jazzed. Like people are obsessed with this thing. It just sort of speaks to the, I don't know, just general interesting phenomenon of this. what you've described as weepy music, really pushing people's buttons. It's interesting to consider that we started today discussing weepy, somber dance music that is at the very, very top of the DJ poll. And we're finishing talking about weepy music that also seems to inspire a kind of rabid fandom that may... propel the Giggling crew to some kind of similar zone. Obviously it depends on how they play it and whether that's the kind of success they want. But I think the potential is there for them to find that kind of audience. Well, either way, it just points to, I guess, the... cultural moment we're in where it's there seems to be a kind of irony to uh club music having this somber reflective element to it that there seems to be kind of strange tension there but in fact that's the stuff that's really driving people nuts these days um just sort of interesting to reflect on you
