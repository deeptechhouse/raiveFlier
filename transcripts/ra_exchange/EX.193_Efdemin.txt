Thank you. you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Will Lynch, and I'm the Associate Editor of Resident Advisor. Over the past 10 years or so, Philip Solomon, or Eftiman as you might know him, has homed in on a sound that's at once gentle, atmospheric, and propulsive. The results have been inspiring. His 2007 self-titled album was a breath of fresh air, nudging dance music away from minimal and toward a smoother, deep house sound. Since then, his style has gotten more and more techno, but it's always kept that soothing element. This is truer than ever on his new album, Decay, which, to these ears, is the best thing he's put out in years. Chatting at our office in Berlin, Salman shed light on his new album and shared insights on his craft in general. 🎵 I guess to begin, your new album is inspired by this trip you took to Japan, or rather, I guess more than that, the album really came out of this trip to Japan. Can you just tell me a little bit about the trip itself and why it made such a big impact on you? My partner and I, we were invited to stay in Japan for three months in this artist residency in Kyoto, which was organized by German Goethe Institute. And we went there in September and came back last year and we were working on a film together which is not finished so we will be we continue working on that and cannot talk too much about it it's like ongoing process and we'll be going back to Japan soon to continue our work there and we have of course had a lot of time exploring the country and parts of Japan I had never been to I've been to Japan many times, maybe seven times before, but only stayed there in the major cities. maximum for one week and this time we had like three months of um yeah the possibility to travel and to explore really like more interesting and and more far off sites like countrysides and that was amazing so the the cover artwork reflects my surrounding in Kyoto. This is a collage of pictures I took every day from the bridge in front of the house. And this is the mountains you see there surrounding Kyoto. And they're always blue. And so I gave all these pictures to our graphic designer, Chillsperle, who's been doing die record covers since, I don't know, for the last 10 years or something. And then he came up with this idea to make a collage out of his... mountains he liked the most and this is kind of like a artificial mountain range in Kyoto but it's it's even more beautiful than the original ones I'm very happy with this artwork it's actually I think it's the most beautiful cover I have so far and you took photographs yes photographs are treated in a special way to have this kind of silken paper, Japanese silk paper effect. And I've been thinking and also talking about making the blue record for the last two years. So now this is it. I was thinking this might sound different, but now this is the blue record I made, finally, because blue is my favorite color. You said that you feel like this album is more coherent than your other ones. What exactly does that mean? Or, you know, how is it different from the other ones? Well, like I said, the process of arranging it in Kyoto was a quite fast one for me. And so I think the feeling I have towards it is that it's more one piece. Then there are two ones I made before because sometimes it took a year. Many tracks that I didn't use, you know, on the side. And here I only had one track left over. And it was just like... this is it and this is done and then Lawrence arrived in Kyoto on October 16 I remember and I finished the last one one hour before he arrived and I played the whole thing to him and he was like yeah this is it okay let's go and they always do except anything you hand in to dial. They would never say like, oh man, I don't know if this is the right one. Maybe you should think about it. But no, I think that's why it's more coherent because it was just made in one fast workflow. And so I think now that I've been listening to it sometimes in the car. on CD that it somehow makes sense. It has one energy or something. And Tobias Freund, who I really look up to, he's been telling me that he likes listening to it in his car. And it makes me very happy because I'm a big fan of his work and he's a good friend. And so I think it's maybe it's a car album, which is good because I always been, I love listening to music while driving. I didn't have a driving license until two years ago. Since then, I've been listening to a lot of music. Did you put the same amount of care into the artwork and everything on your past albums? Yes, always. It was always a very important part of making an album to have the artwork as something that delivers a second. a level of information what this whole thing is informed by where it comes from where where maybe other things that that are important in my life than the music itself or something and um now with this one i also with the last one chicago we we made one video which kind of tried to um all these ideas of modern architecture and something which was an important part of Chicago in a video. And this time we're working on six videos for the two are done already and I'm waiting for the rest to be finished soon. And so they bring also a lot of information. other things that I'm interested in. It was very interesting to work on the visual aspect or to work on something that helps telling this story that I told in the musical, on the musical level. For example, the first track, which is my favorite track. gets a video that I did with my friend Toby Cornish. And he's a visual artist and filmmaker. And we were set up a 16 millimeter film loop in his basement. And it was a blank film. And we started filming it like kind of directly on the center of the-- It was a direct transfer into the digital film without any lenses in between. And I started, we had the music running and I started applying color and chemicals on the blank film. And you have all the color and the dust and the scratches of the film in a very like... How do you say? You see the film itself. It transforms over the time and there are many levels of movement on this film that we see and this will be released soon. internet to watch. Hopefully people like it. For me it's very, very nice to have this film which totally tells the same story as the music, this kind of phase drift that the chords have. And I said before that I think this track opens the door for my future productions maybe to make it more abstract. kind of droney trippy um music that is maybe not focusing on dance floor too much or something but it's still informed by this whole experience as a dj and whatever but it's more it has something like a new level i think yeah you said um this one had an element of like sound art is that something you spend a lot of time with well not sound art as explicit sound art but art is plays a important role in my music in my life because my most of my friends are artists somehow my girlfriend is an artist and As I was talking about this, making this film, I also like working in other fields and producing techno music. And I did some installations over the last years which were more dysfunctional. you could see on my website philipsalmon.de and there are some pictures and some examples of what I do when I'm not working as abdomen which is like I have like these two persons and then with this first track I it feels like that they're coming together these two identities somehow which is my goal for the next years to kind of get rid of my two personalities maybe and merge them into one. That would be my goal. I hadn't heard before that you did work in, that you worked with film. How long have you been involved in stuff like that? No, this is something new. We only did this one video four years ago, which also won a prize in Oberhausen Film Fest, which we were really happy about it. And this was the starting point to... I don't, you know, I don't make like a big difference between making music or making a film. It's the same idea of working with time and narration. And I'm not a very visual guy, so I need people to help me. Yeah, it's, I mean, I'm not working on a movie, you know, like, it's more like... abstract visual art and it's always been interesting contribution to music I think to have this visual level and you were also thinking about making a live show with analog video but then this time it was not enough time to prepare something like this so maybe next time I will come up with this. You said something before about how with electronic albums, there's some element of the album being necessary basically in order to keep getting bookings um how true is that of you know how much did that play a role in in um this one or your past albums i think now i wouldn't have wouldn't need to make another album to get bookings so much maybe it helps a little bit to get some festivals or something but um the booking situation was quite good let's say before But somehow, like after recording all this music, I felt like getting rid of it somehow to clean my drives, to make something new. So this album is kind of a detox for my musical. It's a good thing. I mean, it's a positive effect. I get something out of my system that I've been around with for a while. Now it's like tabula rasa for me. There's not so much that I have to... finish there are two remixes and it's the last ones I will ever do because I realize that I don't really I'm not a good remixer I said that before but it takes too long it takes too much time and I think other people can do it much better and then I will just have you know all the time to explore and find out where I want to go in the future. And this is very important to finish stuff that you've been working on before. I had like all these ideas and loops and songs in my studio and then they kind of, they haunt you when you don't. make a decision you know if there is it's good if it's worth being put out or if it's you know maybe throw it away it's also great because there's so much unnecessary stuff of course i hope this is not too unnecessary but it feels good it feels um right also i wanted to make some Maybe it helps a little bit to explain what I'm into. Also, like as a DJ, when you get requests, people understand better what is exactly what I want to play, what I want to present with the album or like doing a podcast sometimes helps a lot to clear the path or something. But the intention was not to get more bookings or something because I have to reject a lot of bookings because I don't want to play. I'm not able to play as much as Ben Clark does or something. I'm sitting there and watching all these guys playing three or four times a week. I don't know how. I could never do this somehow. I can do it sometimes, but not every week. And I have a high respect for that level of traveling and playing and deliver entertainment at a very high level for people, you know, and keep evolving and tell stories and then play Berghain for 12 hours every month or something. It's crazy. I'm not the guy to do this. But I love my job. I love traveling. And I still love this being surprised so much. Like last weekend, I went to Nantes and I didn't expect anything from this little town in France. And it was one of the best parties I played in years. with the best energy and the most amazing sound in a, actually it was like a bar and they turned this into a club every Friday or something. And it was so mind blowing. So, because I arrived there and was like, this is gonna be okay maybe, you know, but it ended up as being like a really, really intense experience of playing. And I enjoyed myself, watching myself making decisions and playing really without thinking kind of, you know, like, which is quite rare when you play for two hours, it takes a long time to get into it. And then it's already done. And if you play six hours, sometimes you get this on this level. where you stop thinking, we just play, yet you become part of the music. And, you know, and this is what happened there. And so this is what I really liked being surprised and coming to places where you've never been and meeting people that you wouldn't expect, maybe in a techno context or something. Yeah, it's really kind of uncontrollable, this kind of whole thing. Like playing a DJ gig has so many variables that you can't control at all. You have no chance to know what it's going to be like, even if you've been there maybe five times. It can be completely the opposite of what you've been experiencing before. This can be quite annoying sometimes, but it's as I don't play too much these days, I found out that if I limit the amount of experiences, I can enjoy them much more. And yeah, this is it. Earlier on, you said something about how the album is sort of like... a way to let people know generally what your style is what you sound like and everything does that complicate the idea of getting more experimental in your music the way you were talking about earlier yeah i think it's it's opening a door like i said i feel like i'm at a like on a turning point and maybe going in a bit in another direction that I've been over the last seven years and maybe doing more what I've been always dreaming of. Somehow it took a, I mean, I don't reject what I did before. I like it and I think it's cool, but now I need to maybe change the direction a little bit. bring in other ideas, musical ideas that I always try to involve in my music. And now that I think has a lot to do with my new studio that I built over the last two years and all my gear that is in there kind of in place and connected and accessible. And now that I come in, I switch one knob and everything is on and just ready to use. And before it was always like a big mess moving from studios to studio and never really set up like proper set up. Like if you have 10 delays, you need like a proper set of patch bait to connect them. Otherwise you end up like looking for right cables to, you know, and this is what's happening now. And I feel that I can, now that the album is done and everything, I have some time to, you know, to play around and to find where I want to go. What's your studio called? It's called The Meadow. It's in Wedding, Berlin, north. And it's very nice. We have a studio complex with some other producers and film music composers and graphic designers and filmmakers. And there's someone who's printing in the basement. And there's going to be a kind of mid-size concert hall with a studio connected opening soon, hopefully this year, maybe next year. And this is, so we have all the possibilities and most of the instruments you could think of are in this building. Somehow we have a grand piano, a harp, all the saxophones and flutes and drums. All the drum machines and synthesizers, I think most of the interesting stuff is there so we can like kind of lend each other what you need. So if you look like, I need a cymbal now, I want to record a cymbal somehow. Then you go over and knock at the door and say, do you have a nice cymbal? Yeah, try this one. So this is kind of a perfect situation now. Surrounding is very nice. We have this little backyard with a... green grass, which is the reason why it's called a meadow, because it's so small. It's like a fun thing. And yeah, I love being there. It's great. I was having a really nice studio like that. Do you think that sort of encourages the, like a more adventurous approach to production or, you know, does make you want to? I hope. I hope that this is, that I will. challenge myself more in the future. Yeah. But I don't know. Let's see. Can't really tell where I'm going now. But now I have this kind of huge modulus in. And so I think this might lead to different music. Hopefully it's not boring or something. I don't know. Let's see. Earlier you said something like You said you made a distinction between what you did before and the stuff that you're making now. In what way do you think your music has changed over the years? Or how does what you're doing now feel so different to you? That is your job. I can't talk about my music. I used to be a journalist, music journalist, writing about other people's music. One reason why I stopped this was I wanted to make music and making music is the opposite of talking about music. Actually, I can't really tell. It just feels a little different. For me, it's still the same person. In the end, it's the same. It's just maybe a bit more refined, maybe for people, other people it's more boring. And I don't know, it's maybe the sound has changed a little bit. But now I finished two tracks with Marcel Fengler as Dean. We have this project called DIN. We made remixes of our music we composed for the ballet last year in Berghain, which was called Masse. And now there's these dance versions coming out. And I was just listening to the masters of these two tracks on the way here. And they sound very much, you can hear my influence in these two tracks a lot. But it's a very good. So I think there's a certain sound like it's never too harsh. It's never it's quite melodic, warm somehow. But it's nice working with Marcel because he brings in another. energy and a different approach in production. And working together is quite efficient, kind of very funny, first of all. It's a lot of fun being in the studio with Marcel and then we both learned a lot from each other, like, because he has a very non-musical approach. He's not, he cannot play like instruments. he's what I totally miss I would love to have this sometimes just like hearing the whole thing as sounds and composing sounds together and I always end up like tuning things and making a harmonic concept and this sometimes makes it so boring because This is actually what techno is so cool and what I love about techno is that it doesn't have this, you know, it's all these harmonic systems and cages are not there if you don't use them. But I always end up bringing them in because I come from playing cello and playing notes and, you know, playing piano and stuff. can't like get rid of this. So what makes it so interesting to work with Marcel for example, he's like comes from very different approaches and sometimes brings two harmonic elements together which in the first moment I think like whoa. this is so rude you know and then i think this is great it's just amazing you know it's like it's um ends up like being these two harmonic elements together is more like a noise and the harmonic part of it is goes to the back and this is so interesting But I don't know if my music has evolved or become better or anything. That is what you could tell me or people can tell me in the end. You said before that when you first got started making records, they were really heavy on samples, like 90% samples or something like that. I imagine that's something that's really changed over time. It's no longer the case. Well, I love samples because samples have these, they transport something beside the main information. They bring in all this information from the recording and from the technique that was used in the recording, the room it was recorded in. maybe it's sampled from a vinyl so there's some samples in there like some pads and stuff I sampled from vinyl still something that I really like because it brings in noise and dirt and interesting side information. But of course, there's also a lot of stuff that I just recorded from a drum machine or a synthesizer or something. But I'm not dogmatic in any way. I just use whatever I want to use or what I have. And it's great. I think if you would put me in a room. for a year or month with one synth, then I would just start liking this synth and working with this one. It would be enough in the end. But as I now have all these possibilities around me, I play with all these. And a friend of mine... talk me to selling some of it. So I started selling some to just to make it more clear, my environment more clear, focus on the really good ones. I read you say something like, about how back in the day, you would be at a techno party and they would play like all pro fan style, or like Studio One, like, you know, pretty challenging, weird music the whole night. which obviously is kind of hard to imagine now, would that be kind of like, is that something that you, you know, which is more common or is that kind of like an ideal situation for you? It was a very special evening in a very small room. It was just, maybe they also played other music that I can't tell because I just realized that. So they played some of the records that I had just discovered. I mean, at that time, you could you had different different parties where you maybe it was not only focusing on the party aspect, but just listening to electronic music in a weird environment, for example, in the bunker in Hamburg days. And yeah, I think it changed a lot. The whole party scene focused. somehow so much on entertainment, like the DJ as a clown somehow, you know, like the stage, the idea of having a stage, all these festivals these days, it's different to what I liked, like what made me be interested in this music. It was my interest was always sound, like sound and music. And of course, like being in a room where you could hear it on a very high level and with not too much light. And these days you have all these things that kind of distract people from the sound itself. It's more, it's very visual. I think the experience of... music sometimes is more visual than acoustic you know it's more important that what you see or what's happening and what you hear and This is maybe one reason why I make this record. So to explain this is more focusing on the sound thing. It's not so like, yeah, party guys, you know, like, I don't know. I love parties and I love good vibes and stuff, but I don't want to complain. I feel pretty... well understood now most of the times where i get my bookings and where you know the crowd knows where i come from and i also have my my bag of hits and and house records that i love to drop but also like it's so nice when you can play for half an hour like kind of like this trippy psychedelic thing that you get lost and you don't like scream every 10 seconds and you take the bass out and in all the time. You know, it's this different things, I think. So my ideal party is, and I got just got a request this morning from a guy that starts a new party. in Europe and he has this, this is the Japanese idea of going to a club which is just dark and has the best sound possible and the perfect technical setup to play vinyl and whatever you want to play. It just sounds all the same and it works and there's no skipping and feedbacks and whatever. Yeah, and then go in there and it's the music is in the center, the central thing. And there's no stage and there's no like, you know, too much projections or whatever. And yeah, I just instantly said, yes, let's go. Of course, this is this sounds like what I love. And that's why I love going to Japan so much because they have this, this idea of kind of just pure sound it's funny because it doesn't seem like it should be like a you know unusual thing or like a weird idea to have a club that's just focused on just the sound and just the experience of the music you know yeah but i mean there's so many times you end up in a in a club where you i could nearly start crying because i you come there and the needle is 100 years old and The system is, I don't know, it's a mess. And it just doesn't make sense to book someone there. It makes no sense for anyone, not for the audience, not for the DJ that flew over maybe to Canada or something or whatever. And then there's this really shitty sound, which is the most important thing. And you ask the guy, like, what is your idea? And obviously, it's making money is the first thing that he's interested in. Second thing might be getting laid. and getting high, and then maybe in a long, long, far distance, he's interested in having a good sound, but obviously not that night, and it really makes me cry sometimes, because that is why I do this. And when it's good, then it's even better than it is sometimes for me, because it feels so right. You know, it's like, you get this request and the people say like, yeah, and we have a function one. And I said like, okay, I don't want to play that because this is just like random. It doesn't mean anything. You buy a system and you can put it in any room and it sounds like a piece of shit because you need to set it up right. And you need someone to know, to understand the whole idea of acoustic in space. maybe you have to work on acoustic treatments and stuff to have this proper sound and not so many people do this but I see that there is some people who did understand and they know that it's not so expensive to have a good sound it's just you need to have some love and passion for sound and you know and then People don't know, the audience, they mostly can't tell why it's different in this club or in this night than in the other one. But they know that it was really good because, you know, everything felt much better. And you maybe go home with your ears not bleeding. And it's, when you play so many times. On this high volume, sound is such a big issue for me. If you have a good sound, it makes so much fun. If the sound is bad, I think I don't play as good as I could because I'm afraid of the sound sometimes. destroying my ears. And yeah, I don't want to lose my hearing. It's so important. I want to save it for the next years. What are some clubs or parties that you think do it exactly right? No, let's not talk about it. I think that you can, you know, when it sounds good, you can talk to your friend while you dance in a very high volume because it's not, you know, there's no like too harsh high frequencies or all kind of strange basses that have just volume but no information. So it's, you can tell, you know. when it's good sound and mostly when you have good sound you also it looks good i think what was the name of that party um they were talking about earlier where they played all the pro fan stuff i don't know the name it was in hamburg back in in Maybe 97. Yeah, I guess 96, 97, around that time. It was the time where I really got absorbed, like so interested in this music. and started buying records and finding out about all these labels and had no idea it was it was so funny at that time going to a record shop like container records in hamburg was so huge It was such a huge shop with thousands of labels and different styles like Psytrance, Deep House, hip hop, drummer bass. It was all alive at the time. It was like there and there were so many customers and there was people playing DJs and playing the new records for like half a minute. Be like, what is this? I need it. And I was just in there like, wow, this is like a zoo. I don't know. I have no, I don't understand how to browse through this. And I was always afraid of going in there. And I remember the guy was, the owner was playing America by Moody Man on the system. And I was like, wow, this is skills got heron. I have the original record. What is this? And I went there. It's like, dude, I need this. And he's like, no, it's limited. It's the only one. And it's like, yeah, but I need it. You know, I love this. This is exactly what I want to buy. And he looked at me. He's like, wow, I've never seen you before. Okay. have it and then I got this record and I listened to it like maybe a hundred times you know and it was such a I don't know mind-blowing thing and then It was the starting point of me exploring and looking for all this music that I had no idea of. I mean, I knew it was there, but I didn't know about any labels or DJs or certain styles and cities and scenes and whatever. And it's until now, I'm still working a lot of... on my archive kind of you know like exploring labels and from 97 or whatever and like you know checking it's it's very interesting these days you can find out so much about us movements and scenes over the internet it's great and you can sometimes buy the record for a decent price I don't buy records for like more than 25 euros or something. I think that's really hilarious. It's not, no, I don't do this. But yeah, and if you have a nice record dealer like I have, then sometimes he provides me with the stuff that I don't know from back in the days, from someone brought it in secondhand. And I get this jam was like, wow, this is exactly what I need in my set. And I think it's an ongoing process. You can go back and forth and always find stuff. I was just discovering music by Christian. uh morgenstern the other day which is so mind-blowing i had no idea from 97 i knew some of his stuff of course but this one miscellaneous compilation is called i think unconsumed amazing music so forward thinking at that time and interesting sound because all analog machines are like like real machines and then recorded in one take you can hear it and sometimes adjusting something while recording it so cool really good yeah you said um When you're first learning about electronic music, the whole party element didn't really do it for you. That part was maybe a little bit off-putting. What eventually got you hooked? What made you want to start checking it out? Oh, it was the sound. There were some parties that like illegal parties in Hamburg back in the days that where they just played in an old train, abandoned train station in the harbor. And this was amazing. It was like I had no idea what they were playing at the time. with some kind of techno music. And I was very, very impressed by the whole thing. Like this, it was so far off. It was so, I don't know. I liked the sound. It's hard to say. It was just, you know, music is, I don't know, hard to answer your questions really. You listened to indie rock before that, right? Yeah, a lot. Of course. I mean, I listen to so much different kind of music. It's, I think, techno music or electronic dance music or it's just one idea. music and of course it's somehow related to to parties and stuff but when people do it at home in their studios there's no party going on and there's always been music that leaves the typical traces and looks for something new and I have the feeling that Me as a producer, I'm always just starting to find my own language, to find what I'm supposed to do. And it's still, I'm dreaming of music that I haven't done yet. Everything I put out, everything I do is just a... attempt to get there and to bring in all my other interests and sort of bring it all together. I'm dreaming of a different music than I'm able to deliver right now. I can't describe it properly. If I could, then I would do it. But, you know, I sometimes hear it when I wake up in the morning or something. It's been there. I mean, close to it. Hopefully I get there. That's, I think, my duty to keep on finding it, trying to get it out. But until now, it's only been attempts to go there so far. Do you see yourself doing like totally... not dance related music at some point yeah yeah i did that before i will i will do this uh i'm working on things that are completely dysfunctional playable in a party context it wouldn't make no sense you know just like one drone no beats no rhythms and on obvious rhythms of course yeah i'm very interested in Going back to that, because when I studied in Vienna, the electroacoustic department, it was all about that. I didn't buy any techno records for three years. I didn't listen to that music too much. I went to some parties sometimes. Then I met my friend Oliver Random, who was DJing at the time a lot. He got me back into this whole thing and he told me about what is happening. I remember him telling me about the first Omar S coming out and it was like, wow, this is really interesting music. He has a huge record collection and I learned a lot about stuff I had no idea until that point. And when I came back to Berlin, not back, but when I came to Berlin in 2005. this kind of the energy of the city got me absorbed like it got me soaked in and there was all these like crazy after hours like beat street and and there was bar 25 was just opening and of course there was berghain and um and uh still there strong as ever and um I was much younger and I was very impressed by what was going on in Berlin at that time. And I went out much more than I do now. And I started liking the whole party aspect a lot for a while. And I learned a lot about DJing, I think, from listening to... to other people's sets. And then I just, I started making music totally inspired by this whole energy I was surrounded by. And I met all these people that were in the city, like making it and being part of it. And that's why then my first album came out, was kind of the result of being, coming to Berlin. being very, very, yeah, inspired by this, what was going on in Berlin at that time. And yeah, wasn't my plan actually when I came back from, came from Vienna. It was not my plan to become a person who's traveling regularly every weekend somewhere. and playing DJ sets in the mornings. It just happened and now I got used to it. I like it and I try to find a way of keeping it cool for me and staying healthy and having fun while doing it. But this was also kind of a process to find out the right amounts of everything. Takes a while. Thank you.
