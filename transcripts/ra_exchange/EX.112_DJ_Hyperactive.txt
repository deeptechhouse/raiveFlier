Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Among Midwest rave fans, DJ Hyperactive is a bit of a legend. Along with Woody McBride, Hyperactive was one of the biggest names in a scene of hard techno. that soundtracked barns, warehouses, and other abandoned buildings right across the middle of America in the early to mid-90s. Hyperactive made his name via mixtapes, which he sold out of his car and at the Chicago record store Hip House, a shop co-run by DJ Sneak at the time. But in the late 90s and seemingly on the cusp of international stardom, Hyperactive made his way to... California and eventually took a step back from the music business. After a lengthy hiatus, he's now back running his record label Four Track Records and playing regularly for the likes of Los Angeles' Droid Behavior Crew. Fresh off a gig at Berlin's Berghain, we talked to him earlier this month about his return. So I guess you're regarded by many people as a Chicago legend. Were you born in Chicago? I was born and raised in Chicago, yeah. Southside. Southside. What does that mean for people who don't know very much about Chicago? What was the Southside of Chicago like when you were growing up? I mean, if you ask most people, they'll just say that everything kind of really started on the Southside as far as... as all the music scene went. I was born in Harvey, which is basically right on the tip of the south side of the city limits, if you want to get technical. But everybody from the south side knows where it's at. But yeah, basically, I mean, you have the lake, which borders pretty much the whole eastern part of the city. I mean, there's an east side. but it's kind of more of a southeast side because if you go, if you take Halstead all the way straight down and you start heading into like Hyde Park, the Stoney Island area, I mean, it's just, you know, that's kind of like the south loop going all the way to the south side. You take Halstead all the way, it runs right into the town I was born in. which that's the true blue South Side, if you will. You said the music started there. I mean, if you look at all the releases that came out, all the artists were all pretty much from the South Side. I don't want to exclude any that were from the West. but the north side really didn't. The north side contributed from, you know, Gramophone eventually ended up there and there's a lot of clubs and, you know, it's just the demographics of how the city's laid out. If you look at, like, you know, you have the Loop, you have the near north side, and then you have the north side, which is... Some residential and businesses, you have Wrigley Field up there, but the south side is where a bulk of the people are, and the west side as well. What were some of the people that we're talking about here? If you go back to the early people, they were doing all the original clubs, Ron Hardy. Farley, a lot of the original guys that were on the radio because you attribute a lot of the success of the house music kind of wave of music that came out. BMX and GCI really ignited that whole thing. I mean, we had our radio shows, what, Friday and Saturday night, 9 to 5 a.m., they're just running consecutive 30-minute mixes. every half hour, they were just pumping the music that just really wasn't all that commercial, even though, you know, ironically, it was on the radio. And you grew up listening to these mixes? I mean, before that, we were roller skating. We were all roller skaters, man. Okay. So, you know, along with that, you know, you have your disco and... early just funk and R&B and, you know, like I said, disco, and then just house, just a flick of a switch, it all just kicked off. It felt like that flick of a switch. It was that kind of immediate that the music somehow changed. Yeah, it really, I mean, I guess for those that were there, it might seem natural, but, you know, prior to that... I mean, there wasn't a whole lot on the radio. I mean, you had your typical commercial shit on there. So, you know, rock and maybe some of the disco stuff, but not like what BMX and WGCI had. You mentioned GCI, and I think everyone talks about... The other one. What was GCI like? Well, WBMX had it, and they had the original Hot Mix 5, and then WGCI kicked off. So you had 105.9, and then shortly on its heels. I don't know. I don't want to state some improper times, but it wasn't long before WBMX. jumped off then WGCI was there so you had the original Hot Mix 5 which was like you know Mickey Oliver, Farley, Ralph Rosario, I don't want to go through the whole list but and then you had another crew that kicked off on WGCI and I think at one point they even switched over to the other station so What do you think it was about radio in Chicago that was so open to this new sound? I mean, you said that it was quite commercial, and it's quite commercial in tons of other cities. What was it about Chicago that was so open to this? You know, that's a good question. I mean, it was just music. That was happening in the hood. It was black music. Not to say that it was meant to be exclusively black. I don't want to bring race into it, but those were the predominant black radio stations. Their format was catered and centered around black culture. Mickey Oliver wasn't black, but... He was a funky white dude that was into the music, and you've got to attribute a lot to him. You give credit to these guys that kind of brought a different flip to what disco was, your pre-electronic style of music. So what were you doing around this time? Were you listening to it? Were you participating in it? We were listeners. Right when I went into my freshman year of high school was when it really all, that summer before high school, 83, 84 is really when it was just night and day for us as kids. So when we say house parties, it was house parties in people's houses, but we were listening to house music. So we have a different... definition of house parties back in the 80s. So, I mean, you couldn't go anywhere at any party and not hear one of those two stations playing and just bumping jack and early house stuff. I remember talking to Derek Carter once, and he said that there were just so many parties that he would just go from party to party throughout the night. And he would be able to play at these places. Such a vibrant scene. Yeah. You know what? I don't want to digress and go on a tangent, but it's definitely not. Right now, it's nothing like it was early on. There just seems to be a lot of division. I don't want to get political about it, but those days, to me, are the days I cherish the most as an artist and a DJ and as a music fan. And like you said, Derek was there. He was right in the middle of it. I remember Derek at Imports, et cetera, when it was right in the loop on the South Loop on Plymouth Court. And he, you know, that's when everything was fresh and raw. There was white label test pressings running around the city. You know, you'd see all those guys up there at Imports, et cetera. You know, you could sometimes buy white labels right out of the trunk. That's when people were really train-spotting for records. They wanted the stuff that they were hearing on the radio, or if you were fortunate enough to go to some of the parties that were going off on the city. I mean, there was parties everywhere. I mean, the Southside had, you know, music events at Sock Ops. They'd have lock-ins in the... gyms and all the south side you know city schools is where a lot of these artists came up and you know they bring the real real and they'd have their drum machines and 1200s and just playing their stuff you know it was amazing times back then so how did you make the jump from listener an interest in this music to someone who was involved in it? Well, the crew I hung out with were a year older than me, so those guys, you know, a little bit older, a little more mature. They, you know, buying equipment, buying 1200s. We actually ran a mobile DJ. company just because we were into the music and, you know, we could play this music at a lot of the weddings. So when we did, you know, when I helped, it wasn't my company, but when we helped some of the early guys that had equipment and they were running the DJ service, we were playing house music and stuff at weddings. So, you know, at that time and era, you know, we could play house music. and not have to agonize over a lot of the typical wedding stuff they did here. So these guys had equipment. Like I said, we all grew up in the rink, and the natural progression was we all DJed, my friends had equipment, and then... Really at some point in time in college, right around 87 is when I... said to myself, being in the clubs, having fake IDs, getting into the clubs in the city, you just got fed up. Well, I did, saying, you know, I don't want to be in the club. I want to actually start making this music. I don't want to waste my time in getting hammered in the clubs. As much as I like to be there, hearing the music, you know, at the shelter and the early clubs back in the day, I just said, you know, it's time It was just a decision, a conscious decision I made to say, I'm going to make this. I don't want to be here. You know, dancing to other people's stuff, I want to make my own music. So from that point, it just kind of progressed from there, really. So what was the first sort of instrument that you mastered or had? First thing I had was a 606 Roland. Where did you get that? Just part of the crew, one of them had that. We would basically program it. We would do our live. We'd be spinning our sets and parties. We'd just run the drum machine along with it just like a lot of the other Chicago guys did. So we'd just run our beat tracks and rhythm patterns and just run them and mix through them and kind of mega mix through it. And that was it. So 606, and I had an Ensoniq EPS. And these guys didn't want to help. They said, you know, you want to do the music? Go and get the manual and figure it out. I had to do it because one of the guys that was on our crew. Like I mentioned, they're a year older, so when they graduated high school, one of them was out and went to Florida, went to Full Sail and got his engineering degree. He's still an engineer in the city. This guy named Ron Staley, he's been involved in the scene and recording engineer, real solid recording engineer. And he was one of the guys that kind of helped guide. Kind of helped, but didn't help. But he pushed me, so it pushed me to the point where I said, fuck it, if I really want to do this, I've got to figure out. I actually have to read, and I hate reading. So he's one of those hands-on guys. I just got the sampler, figured out how to sample, how to truncate. you know, how to loop stuff and, you know, it was tough because back then, you know, we're so spoiled now with a lot of the digital, you know, everything's visual now. Back then it's numbers, you know, you had to figure out all the note time signatures and how to, you know, everything was time-based, you know, you had to really, really pay attention to what you're doing to get anything to work. So it was pretty interesting. And from there it progressed. From there the list goes on as far as the equipment that came down the line. But those were the first two kind of... But the 606 wasn't necessarily like a conscious, man, I love the sound of this. It was just around. Yeah, I mean, it was something that we had. It wasn't like, oh... Yeah, I want this sound because I know so-and-so is using it. I mean, it could have been any machine at that point. I would have taken it and just used it, but that was one of the first pieces of gear I had. Who were you listening to music-wise that you were really drawn to, though, when you were first trying to make beats? Was there anyone that you were thinking, man, if I could do something a little bit like that? And there had to have been certain types of house or... You know, all the original Hot Mix 5 guys. I mean, probably one of the main influential guys that I like because there were different... Even early on, there were kind of different styles. You had... He had a lot of disco that was, you know, a lot of the guys played a lot of disco and mixed it in with a lot of beat tracks. But I'd have to say Farley was really one of the main ones. You know, funking with the drums, the early track stuff. He stands out in my mind as one of the ones that was just doing this jacking, just jack tracks, you know, just raw beats and just, you know, little samples, some vocals, you know, little samples and just the beats were just, were intense back then to me. I mean, there's others. I mean. You know, like Steve Selkirly and just, boy, the list goes on. I can't even, you know. So when did you have something finally? When did you finally learn the instrument and release something? So here's an, I'll give you a bit of an interesting history. As the radio, right before, there was a transition on the radio. BMX and GCI, the original teams kind of left. It stopped. And then I remember in college, another station in the city jumped up and snagged a couple of those guys and then kind of a new hot mix crew jumped up and that was B96. So that was 96.3 FM. So once that, they kind of kept some of the similar format. But then it really started to shift. That's when I really kind of saw the original, I'll say Chicago house sound, really start to kind of transform. Some might say for better or for worse. It doesn't matter. It happened. The music started to change. It started to become what we would say more commercial. So at that time, we started, we were doing stuff. like jack tracks, but then we were also kind of, you know, hip house kind of jumped up. It started a group called Hypercussion. That was the first stuff we were doing, you know. You're smiling right now. Yeah, it was just, you know, we were experimenting with the music and rap and MCs, and it was just, it was. really kind of, you know, experimenting in different sounds of music. And then from that point, you know, when B96 really started to commercialize it, I feel like that's when I kind of lost interest of what had started happening there. From there, I just, I remember talking to Derek and Mark Farina when they were... When Gram, you know, after imports was closed. Because when imports, et cetera, you got to understand there was two main stores that were really, there was three. I'll say there was Loop, there was Imports, et cetera. And then you had Gramophone that was always kind of going on on the north side. So once. Imports was done and then soon thereafter. I think loop. I don't know I don't know what the order was but then gramophone became really like the main spot on the north side on Clark and I just remember talking to Mark and Derek. I said, you know, I just can't, I don't feel what's going on on the radio. I'm just done with that. I just need, you know, I need to start looking at other stuff musically, you know, like what I'm buying record wise. I got to really, you know, expand my horizons here. And, you know, and them guys being in a record shop, you know, they're right on the cutting edge. They see it Even if they didn't play it, they would know what was really the right stuff to kind of steer guys to, guys like myself. And I looked up to those guys. Those guys were rocking DJs way back in the days, like late 80s, early 90s. Those guys knew what the fuck they were doing. So I trusted everything they said when I asked them and just started looking at some of the Detroit stuff. Just threw some records at me. I go, okay, this is exactly where I want to go. Were you also starting to make similar stuff? Yeah, so right at that time is really where, you know, I would say 89, 90 is where it all just kind of changed. Everything I just said, you know, I really started to understand, like, you know. what I wanted to make, you know, what started buying a lot more equipment and just really started taking it serious because once I left college, I knew music was going to be a path for a long time. So leaving college after three years and coming back to the city from that point, it was just, that was it. That's where it all really started accelerating. vinyl obsession progressed, you know, buying abstract gear and just analog stuff, you know, digital. We only used digital at that time for just sequencing, you know. You know, we had sound tools and stuff to do some editing, and it was starting to inch its way in and become more of a prominent, you know, kind of a sound part of the studio for me. That was the turning point there, right around 89, 90 for me. At that moment, did you decide, man, I really want to be a DJ or a producer? Was it all the same thing? I just want to do music. And you focused on both of those things. Well, you know, my first love was a DJ. So I knew that would always be part of it. And I knew that, you know. I don't want to say it, but I knew I wanted to get records out, and I knew I wanted to use that as a vehicle to play more outside. outside of Chicago, because then the rave scene kicked off. So right as kind of the whole underground house and, you know, that term underground had a different meaning back then than it does now because underground was the... You know, they were throwing the first raves in the city when E-System were doing the raves. And they just, you know, there was a... a concerted effort to get it underground. So whether it was parties or clubs or the music, everything we were doing had a purpose. It's not going to be commercial. We're like against it, vehemently against it. And, you know, from that point... The scene's kicking off everywhere else. It was already happening on the coast, east and west coast. And then I said, you know, it's not enough. I want to go overseas. So really producing was, I knew, because DJs are a dime a dozen, even back in the 90s. There were very few that started traveling abroad that were just pure DJs. Even back then. Even back then. That's interesting. And, I mean, there's exceptions to that, but I think most would agree that, you know, there's only, you know, a couple handfuls of any that would really do any European touring or in the UK. They were just purely DJs, you know. I'm talking about in the house or techno community. I said I knew where I wanted to go. I kind of had the vision. So you started your own label back then? Yeah. Before I did my own label, I was doing stuff for... people I mean as far I'll talk about domestic labels you know these are the influential labels crowd party throwers party goers you know drop bass communique those those came before but right right around that time is when I started contact which Sneak was influential in a lot of my career. I owe a lot to him. He said, hey, come over here. He was working at the hip house on the northwest side of the city. He was doing his graffiti, airbrushing shirts up at the hip house. And that was a whole other crew of guys from the city and from the Burbs that loved the music. They started Strictly Hype. they started underground construction along with Sneak. I mean, if you look at the early UC labels, like Sneak's tag, you know, the UC on it. And he said, come up here, man, and work up here with us. You know, and I started working up there and started buying for them. And then the relationship with... with the owners of Strictly Hype, UC, The Hip House, Record Shop, and The Brickyard at the time. Started talking about, let's do a label. So I did Contact as a P&D deal under the UC and Strictly Hype guys. You know, we were pressing at Sony. And we had a really good arrangement there. We did all our mastering in the city, at Metropolis, and then we were just pressing and getting records out. So we did about 22 releases. Well, I did 22 releases. I had complete A&R control over them. They just did the pressing and distribution. and I handle everything else. It seems like your sound is quite different from what Sneak was doing at that time. Did it feel like that? What I was doing? Yeah. Yeah, I think Sneak was doing more, you know, just kind of a lot of sample type. You know, just kind of ghetto-style sample tracks, you know. Listen to those early stuff like Work It and stuff. But you still followed a kinship with him. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I bought my first 909 was from Sneak. It was $350 on it. I forget it. Did he teach you anything on how to use it, or was it a similar situation? The guy at Full Sail said, go read the manual. No, I mean, between that time and when I bought my 909 from Sneak, I mean, I already had kind of some momentum behind me as far as getting my head around in the studio and getting around in the studio with, you know, using. We were using Macs right from the early jump, man. We were using Studio Vision and Studio Vision. So we were using the computers for MIDI sequencing, but we were still doing kind of like, I was doing a hybrid of some of that and then doing some live triggering with a lot of analog stuff and drum machines and using rim shots to trigger old analog synths and stuff like that. My sound from Sneak was different. I had a kind of different ear for what I liked. I was not fully into that commercial B96 sound and I wasn't really like... Like a Ghetto House producer, I was kind of like finding my own sound. I knew what I wanted to do at the time. What was it that you wanted? I mean, what was that sound? It progressed. I mean, early on, some of the drop bass stuff was a lot harder. I mean, Drop Bass Network had a reputation for being very, you know, like... A lot of them parties, if you've ever been to any of them parties back in the Midwest, you know, a lot of it had some Gabber influences, you know, really, you know, hard acid, you know, just banging stuff more for the most part. But, you know, there was always like this acid undertone that you always associated with drop bass. And then Communiqué was really more acid, techno kind of stuff. I think by the time that the stuff on Communiqué was coming out, I think I was... started to really kind of settle down into a sound that was kind of like acid and techno influence. You were part of the Midwest rave scene circuit. Tell me about, you know, what those parties were like. I mean, it must have been... crazy to just go out in a field somewhere in Wisconsin. I mean, there was a stretch there, like, you know, like the popular DJs now here in Europe that are playing every weekend. I mean, it was like that every weekend for years, you know, from like 90 through literally like 97. It was like every weekend, whether it was, you know. Milwaukee or Madison or Minneapolis, Chicago, Indy, Cincy, you know, the list goes on and on. I mean, it was St. Louis. I mean, the memories just are flooding me. I mean, there were so many shows going on. And I was in the thick of it. I was fortunate to have a strong following in Chicago. The records were coming out. There was just a lot of focus and attention. I was very fortunate to experience some of the foundational experiences for a lot of... you know, party goers at the time. I get Facebook messages to this day, even maybe a week ago, saying, you know, you were the first mixtape I bought. You were the first guy I heard at this party in a barn out in the middle of, you know, Wisconsin somewhere. And I've been into techno since. So there's this... There's this, you know, it's humbling to hear that, you know, and to know that in those regions, a lot of them didn't have, they didn't have the luxury of having a B96 or BMX or GCI. that it gave them a foundation to hear that kind of music. Because we're talking, for the most part, in those rural areas, there's a lot of white America. You didn't have, you know, I'm not saying there's no ethnicities in Madison or Milwaukee, but... I don't know what they were playing on the radio. And I know in a lot of those outlying areas, they weren't playing anything other than commercial stuff. So they didn't even have that. So their introduction to, you know, I hate using the term electronic music or techno, was a lot of these raves that were going on. That was the forum. That was the medium that... that these people were influenced and heard the music. So these promoters are calling you up. They're saying, I'm from Madison, Wisconsin. I'm throwing a rave in a barn. The first time you get one of these calls, it must have been like, really? Like, Wisconsin? No. Okay. You know what? The more rural, the more obscure. The more excited you were to go. We were the more excited. If it just seems just, you know, that was our canvas back then. If it wasn't in the city in some bunk-ass warehouse, it was in the cornfield in some barn somewhere. So, you know, we took it. We were just, we didn't care where it was. We just wanted to have our, you know, our loud ass PA and the people who come. I mean, there's so many shows. There's countless shows. It's just ridiculous. I can't even. I see people, there's a lot of people that are posting a lot of the old flyers and they're just saying, remember the show? I'll see my name on it, but I don't even remember the show. You know, some of them have. Talk about one of the ones that you do remember. Pollination. Okay. Yeah. I don't know if that was in Milwaukee or Madison, but I know it was two floors. It was in an era where Rooster was playing a little bit harder. And all I remember, I think Terry Mullen and I were playing on four turntables. And I know it was packed upstairs. I know they were playing a little house here upstairs. But if you looked at the floor above us, which was maybe 8, 10 feet. The wooden beams were just bouncing, they were moving. You could just see it bowing as the people were dancing. We were like, fuck, man, is this going to give in? And we're going to have a thousand people crash down on us, but we didn't care, we just kept playing. It just added to the excitement and the mystique of what we were doing there. So that was certainly one of the more memorable parties for sure. I think most people would agree to that. Tell me about, you said that you made this distinct decision to produce music so that you could play elsewhere. Did it work? Were you asked overseas because of some of these releases, basically, and the reputation that you were growing? Yeah. It worked. You know, it can never happen soon enough. It always seems like it takes forever sometimes. But after I got through maybe the first half of the contact releases, between that and the notoriety from the other labels, you know, it started. I mean, really, the first show happened in 94. Was it the U4 Club in Vienna? That was the first show. Woody McBride was a big part of, you know, he was playing over here. He was really pushing the boundaries musically. Had the labels going in full swing. I think at one point he had like 10 or 15 labels running. But, yeah, it happened, and when it happened, it happened quick. So, like, when I turned the corner and getting over here, once I had a booking agent out of southern France, out of Marseille, that's really when everything just catapulted from there. And what did that mean? For you, in terms of your career, what has catapulted looked like? Because I felt like when you got over to Europe, I think you took your game to another level. It's a different audience. You feel like you're mission accomplished, so to say. you know, what's next? So you're thinking of what's next from there. But really, I knew that, you know, you always hear about the parties, you hear about the numbers of people, you hear about, you know, at that time, there was only a handful of American techno producers really coming over. There wasn't a whole lot. I mean, it wasn't like now where you got guys that actually live over here now. But at that time, you know, you could count them on your hands how many U.S. techno producers between Detroit, New York, and Chicago that were traveling regularly to Europe. So I felt like, yeah, this is exactly where I wanted to be at that time. You said... Woody McBride, was he someone that you were kind of looking up to in terms of how to make your career? Um, I think we, I wouldn't say that. I would say that we, you know, we shared a lot of, you know, we did a lot of shows together. You know, we, I produce on his label, you know, remix stuff for him. He was part of the whole Drop Bass. I mean, I think between him and I, I mean, we were on some of the first releases that the label had, you know, and I need to, I need to credit these guys. because these were the guys that devoted a lot of time, a lot of focus, doing the shows in the Midwest. And Woody was an influential part of my career growing up as a technical producer. And he was always pushing. He's responsible for a lot of guys. I don't know if they would all. really attribute a lot to what he did, but I certainly, you know, appreciate a lot of what he's done for me through the years. What do you mean? How exactly? I guess he opened some doors, or do you mean that he had people releasing on his label? Well, I haven't, you know, I mean, between, like I said, Woody had a lot of labels. He had Communicate, he had Sounds, he had Head in the Cloud. Head in the Clouds, Country Western, Lovers. I mean, there were a lot of, he was a busy guy in that scene. He was a foundational. piece to that scene in the Midwest, you know, between throwing his wall of bass parties and doing his labels. He was revered in a lot of the European circles, you know, as one of the pioneers in the U.S. scene. So, you know, Woody was a strong promoter of not only himself, but the people on his label. and people that he enjoyed doing business with. That was a conscious decision on his part. There's a marketing angle to it, but he certainly helped my career for sure. We're in the mid-90s. You're in Europe now, and you said that you're thinking, where's next? You know, what's the next horizon? We're up to the next level. So what happened next? You know, you always want to play the next best, greatest thing, you know. Once I did, you know, some of the kind of core places and, you know, playing at the Rex Club in Paris or playing in Liquid Room in Tokyo. You know, you're always looking, you always want to take it to another level, right? But there was a little bit of a turn there. So when I left, I left Chicago in 97. So everything was really kind of peaking for me as a producer, as a DJ. You know, after all, after all the barrage of U.S. releases then. I was doing stuff on the European labels. Through DJ Skull, we did a collaboration on Kerry Lacabush's hybrid label. Then I did an LP on hybrid. And then I was doing stuff for Tim Taylor's Missile and playing the drums. And from there, everything really, really, really kind of caught fire for me. So, I mean, even to this day, even some of the original stuff that came out on... On this aisle, it's getting re-released now, as you know. It's on Len Facky's edit series. But there was a turning point there in, you know, 96, where I made a move out west. Decided, you know, I was playing coast to coast. You know, met some of the L.A. guys. Had an opportunity to, you know, open a record shop out there in Huntington Beach. And... You know, married at the time, I told the wife, let's head back. Let's head back. She grew up there and said, let's get you back home. Let's see what I can do out west. I felt like I could, you know, spread the sound, be the evangelizer for techno out west and help influence the scene out there. You know, in the record store, you know, that was kind of, so that's a change of focus for me. So I went from, you know, globetrotting to Europe like every weekend for a good few years there to saying we're going to go, I'm going to go and set up camp out west in L.A. and open a record shop. And then from that point, you know, Marco Bailey was doing the bookings for me. you know for a short period there after i i stopped with um my french booking agent and um it just became harder to travel from all the way from the west coast yeah you know and be a co-owner in the record shop and you know doing the buying you know at the record shop it just There was it real now now the stress of doing both really started to set in. So I had to kind of make a choice, you know, and I had a family at the time. So you had been doing record store stuff before that. And doing buying and things like that. So I bought all the techno. Any of the imports that came into the hip-hop. I mean, they were probably bringing stuff in before that. I don't want to say I was the creator of import techno into the hip-hop. But that wasn't their primary sound. So as that sound started to really... catch fire as the racing kicked off and you have this underground sound and techno is part of that. I did all the buying at the hip-hop house. Yeah, first on. So what was the record buying scene like when you moved to do this new store? I mean, was there the same sort of appetite for import techno? You know, it was, you know, L.A. always had their parties. They've always had big numbers out there. That was nothing new to them. But the style of music wasn't necessarily as big as it was in the Midwest or in New York. I'm not saying it didn't exist there, but it just didn't have that similar root factor, so to say. But it caught on. Because those knew it. Because there were DJs coming out to play. I was playing there long before I moved there. It took a little bit, but there were definitely heads coming in. They were traveling far. I knew guys that were driving an hour and a half just to get from the IE or the high desert to get down into Huntington just to buy these records. One thing we didn't talk about is I did mixtapes, man. I used to pedal these mixtapes out of the trunk to these record shops. I mean, I'd probably done 30 different mixtapes over the years, and that was as much as playing and even the records, those mixtapes were a big influence on a lot of people. When did you start doing that? That started right from the jump, from like 90 on is when all those tapes started. So when we're playing at shows, I'm selling tapes to the smart drink vendors or the whatever, and then that became a phenomenon. all within itself. I mean, that's a whole other culture within the culture. And that was the big way that a lot of the music really, you know, got promoted, you know, because there wasn't any radio stations playing it in the U.S. that I know of, at least in Chicago. And that was the big way for us to get our music out. That could have been maybe an aid to my popularity in the Midwest more than anything else, even more than the records, I would say. I mean, I was selling 1,000 mixtapes. At a single party? At a release. Not at a single party, but I mean, I'd do a new release. I really want to say it was a mixed CD, but at that time we weren't doing CDs. We were doing these bloody mixtapes. But that was, you know, that's something that we really didn't talk about that I feel like needs to be mentioned. Sure. Because once... that caught fire, then it was a phenomenon. So there was a lot of artists. That was a medium for a lot of DJs to get their stuff out. You would also sell them in the record store. Oh, I'd sell them in the record shop. Oh, yeah, totally. I might be... incriminating myself but i mean they're you know so you know it's seen as bootlegging obviously but everybody was doing it you know no there was no one i mean there was even stories of some of the raids on the record shops that were selling it because there were whistleblowers talking about you know bootlegging and all these mix all you know all the artists royalties that are getting you know people making money off other people's stuff, you know, but I was, that's just what was going on back then. You did some series, you know, volume one, volume two. Can you talk a little bit about those and the idea behind them? You know, you're kind of catching me off guard. I don't know what volume. I did a volume, like a, you know, one of. You know volume one through maybe boy I'm gonna say ten and then I did a one of twelve series which I did one every month and then there was some collaboration mixtapes and then I would do I would even record some of the live shows that happen, you know, like live in Madison, Wisconsin, and it was live in Intellect. There's so many, I can't even remember them all. So in L.A., you were also selling mixtapes still. There were a few that came out, but, you know. It slowed down. Yeah, I mean, there was even one. point where I made a Proclamation that I'm gonna retire as a DJ like I couldn't I Didn't have the skills to manage being married with a kid running the store Traveling to Europe trying to run the labels, you know now that I've trying to run the label for you know Cuz I started for track after I left Chicago, I stopped contact and I was going to start my own label. And I did start it. It was four track records. And then all this kind of convergent ones. And I just said, you know, I got to step back. You know, I just can't keep up with this pace, you know. I started to buckle a little bit and just kind of reassess what I wanted to do. And, you know, it was just, you know, your family comes first, right? Overall things. Maybe not for everybody. Everybody doesn't look at it that way. But for me at the time, I just had to kind of step back. I kind of put the halt to writing. Hit the brakes on the label. We got maybe the first three or four releases out. Joined forces with a good friend that was in SoCal at the time who was from Manchester. a guy named Robin Porter who did Immigrant and Shiva. And another guy and they were doing they had a really really good graphic design from really solid graphic designers man one of the best I know and We kind of joined forces started doing some music stuff and that kind of came to an end and then everything just kind of Halted I just stopped writing Wasn't buying vinyl. I left the record shop I just wasn't traveling. But you know. - In the back of your mind, did you think, "Yeah, I'll probably pick it up again." Or in your mind at that time, it was like, "You know what, that's it. "I gotta find another career." It was a little bit of that. I think there was maybe some slight animosity that I was stopping, but you know what, just the stress of it all. And then financially it wasn't as solid as it was when I was in Chicago. So, I mean, you go from living in a $650 three-bedroom house. almost tripling your rent moving out west. So it wasn't an easy transition. I don't know what my exact thoughts were, but I knew that I needed a change at that time. So there was some needed adjustments that had to happen. made some decisions but you know it it the music kept drawing me back into it you know I some may have taken note that I may stop DJing some may have said this guy writing tracks anymore but then I found myself I've started buying equipment again you know And I was still getting called to DJ. So no matter how much I wanted to stop doing what I was doing, I was still getting, as people found out where I was and how to get a hold of me, because there was a long period. It's like, man, we didn't know where you were. We heard you want. but we didn't have any new contact info. The web was just kind of kicking off a little bit at that time. So you're going from one era of technology and things into a new era, and it was just like this gap. Some people get lost along the way. So like I said, the one thing I just keep thinking about is that the music and the fans and the promoters, it never stopped. It wasn't as plentiful as it was, but... They just kept sucking me back into it. And I don't want to say suck as like I regretted doing it, but I just couldn't hide from it. No matter how much of an effort I tried to stay away from it, it just kept finding my way. So, you know, at some point in time, you just kind of say, well, maybe this is your destiny. Maybe you need to really kind of reassert yourself. and take hold and give it a go. At least from the outside looking in, it always seemed to me like L.A. was more of a house city than a techno city. You know, I always look at the root factor in a city. When I think about my woes as a DJ and producer, I'm always thinking, what has always kind of been around in a city, right? You look at Chicago, Detroit, you had... R&B and disco in New York and you knew that those grass roots sound and culture and ethnicities drove it. LA had black and Latinos but that wasn't really like the grass roots sound you know it could have been more on the hip hop side of things or rock but it really wasn't you know It didn't really progress the same way that it did out, you know, they had funky breaks and houses kind of predominantly kind of what you heard early on. You know, like Doc Martin was one of the first guys that was playing outside of L.A. that I was playing in the raves with. He was one of the first guy and maybe Kool-Aid and a couple other guys that early, I'm talking like early 90s shows outside. You know, later on. You know, DJ Dan and them and a lot of other guys and Donald Blount and them guys were, I don't want to say later on. I'm saying like shortly thereafter they were, you know. But, yeah, I see Doc Martin as one of the house, who's a rockin' DJ and plays a lot of house. But he's a diverse DJ. I don't want to just characterize him as just a house jock, you know. That can play a lot of different styles. But I guess I'm getting to the point that, like, you're wearing a shirt, droid behavior. These guys started up, I guess, around 2000-ish. And the way that they characterized it is that they simply started because they weren't seeing DJs that they wanted to see being brought into the city. Yeah. You know, I'll make two early references when I think of my guys back there. I knew Vidal long before I knew I heard a droid. Vidal was at almost every show I played at. I always saw Vidal there. But there's another guy who's running the Modulars label, Adrian Sandoval. Developer. Developer. I knew him before I, you know, I don't know if we were talking or if I, I knew him before I really got rooted in Cali. So there were, you know, Vidal was certainly after I got there. But, you know, once. I got there, those were some of the couple of the early guys. And then, you know, Vidal, obviously his brother, they do Rise and they're doing the Droid label. And, you know, the Droid, you know, that's the circle of people I'm affiliated with now, you know, not exclusively, but, you know, that's the crew, that's the people that, you know, some of the people that have a name that are really, really pushing the sound in L.A. Not so much are there a lot of the old heads there that I'm affiliated with that are doing stuff. It's really more the newer guys, the guys that have jumped up later, like you said, the droid crew. Tell me about some of the parties that they throw. I mean, what's it like for someone who's never been there? Can you describe, you know, what Droid is all about? Not that you're a spokesperson for them, but you've been there. I mean, you know, I'll paraphrase Moe. As Moe said at Drumcell, you know, it's not for everybody. They didn't intend to have it a club appeal. They wanted it renegade, almost like a rave. They want it in a warehouse. They want it dark and dirty. If it doesn't have air, oh well. They're not going to have fancy restrooms. You might have one. You might have some outhouses. There's an intention to the style of parties that they do, the interface shows. And, you know, they just make them happen. They find these locations. They always pull them off. I don't know. On one hand, I can maybe count the shows that have not happened, you know, if they got busted or relocated. But they're one of the guys that, you know, they obviously have a vision of how they want the shows to be. And the type of music and the lineup, they're always really consistent with what they're doing. Give them guys a lot of credit. In your bio, it says, I think, 2008, 2007, you decide to full-fledged to give it another go. the music thing. So what does that meant, you know, in the past four or five years? What, what did you, okay, I'm gonna, your thought process was, I'm going to start. Up the label? Yeah, that's a good question. Go ahead with that? Yeah. You know, whether it was the label or me DJing or writing for other labels, I said, you know, You go through those moments where like, is this meant to be? You know, can't get away from trying not to do it anymore. So I said, you know, set my sights on just writing and kind of reinventing myself because frankly, I don't want to be only known for the old stuff. You know, a lot of people I'm talking to these days and through the past years, it's like... I don't want to be seen as an old school guy only. I mean, that's great. I did some rockin' tunes back in the day, but I just don't want to be known for just that. I want to be contemporary enough to say, yeah, there's an appeal for this generation. that are coming up to associate with me. I just can't, I don't want to rely on the old stuff. You know, I just, I'm very like kind of driven not to let that be the final say in what, you know, where I'm going and what I'm doing. So, you know, and I, and I just, you know, and I just keep the right company too, to make it, you know, to help rebirth, you know, what I'm doing, so to say. So I did four track, you know, I did, you know, we did a couple releases there, you know, with Music Box and then, you know, doing some remixes and really going to start focusing on getting to the level of in quantity of releases. I don't want to say I'm going to try to have a high number of output like I did in the past. But just to get to more consistent releases and productions, I think that's in sights for the next immediate future for me right now. And what about touring? You just played Germany. Do you have anything else coming up? This is all kind of the turning point again for me. Right now. Right now. In the turning point. This interview, this trip, this day, I knew that once I got to the point of playing Berghain. This is my re-entry back into the European scene as a DJ playing here in over 15 years. Last time I was in Berlin was 96 at Love Parade. So this is kind of the turning point to where I say I'm going to let this be kind of the springboard for me coming back, you know, getting associated with the right booking agency, you know, you know, it's a process, right? You gotta be producing stuff. You gotta be, you gotta be in the light, you gotta be in the light of where people are seeing you. That's why I don't want to rely on the old stuff because. Even though it's still carrying some staying power now, I really want to be seen as, you know, currently what's going on. There are, you know, plenty of examples of guys who have maintained that sort of relevancy. And there are many examples of the opposite, I suppose. Are there people that you're looking to and saying, like, yeah, he did it? that's kind of like, that's something I should look after. You know what? I really don't look at it really beyond the scope of just internally looking. at what I'm doing. I don't have anyone that I really kind of measure myself or compare myself to or you know to say that that's the prototypical type of career you know career path I want to have now like that like this person is doing it. I just you know I can't see that far. beyond my own footsteps. But like I said, the one thing that I'm really, really focused on is not, I just don't want to be known for this old school guy. I got to get out of that nostalgia because I think it hinders more than helps. Not to say that I can't appreciate it. Of course. But it's not the path for me now. So how do you stay ahead of that? Releases, I suppose? Showcasing that you are current contemporary with the sound? I mean, there's a Droid record coming up here later this year. If we can get it out or if next year, whenever it comes, it'll come in due time. And, you know, that's part of the process. It's a process, you know. Whether it be on 4Track or other records, there will be, you know, releases driving this and fueling this. And then, you know, playing is just the cherry on top, right? That's just kind of like the final expression of, like, all the hard work you do in the studio, I think. So, I think playing here this weekend really will help push and get me back into the circle I want to be in. you
