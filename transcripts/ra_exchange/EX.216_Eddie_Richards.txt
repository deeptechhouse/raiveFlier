Acid math. Acid math. Acid math. Acid math. Acid math. Acid math. Hey, what time is it? Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. The exchange thrives on good stories, and when I sat down with the veteran UK DJ Eddie Richards recently, he had plenty of them. He told me about his residency at Camden Palace in London during the mid-80s, a club that was known as one of the best of its era. I heard how Richards was one of the UK's earliest adopters of house music, and how he had a large hand in introducing the emergent sound to London audiences. Then there was the one about him founding the world's first DJ agency. In the early 90s he set up Dynamix to take care of bookings for the likes of Jeff Mills, Todd Terry and Richie Horton, DJs he'd got to know as one of London's most respected selectors. We talked about his gigs as a key DJ on the rave scene, playing legendary events like Sunrise, Energy and Helter Skelter. And he also told me about Wiggle, a party he became involved with alongside Nathan Coles and Terry Francis. that helped establish the sound of tech house back in the mid-90s. Wiggle is presently celebrating its 20th birthday, so he thought now was a great time to have Richard stop by and share some of his many tales. you So I think where I really wanted to start was to talk about some of your pre-history, if you like, with DJing before you became what would be considered like a club DJ. Do you recall when you first kind of became interested in the idea of playing music for other people? Yeah, I do. But it wasn't really my idea. It was a friend's idea. We was at school together. and he was just into kind of techie stuff. He seemed to know like serial numbers, model numbers of equipment and stuff, you know, one of these guys that was kind of into all that stuff. He suggested, like, let's start a mobile disco. So I was like, yeah, great idea. You know, when you're at school, you just do your thing. So we went out and just bought one turntable, and it was like a Garrard SP25 Mark II, you know, like a, not even belt drive, it was like something like a wheel drive thing. And we were committed after that. We decided... buy another one and then we looked in the ads in the back of like wireless magazine and bought a mixer and had to solder all that together we figured we needed a speaker so we borrowed a speaker from somebody who was in a band but he was a bass player so we only had an 18 inch speaker So that was the first thing that we did. And I've said this before, but we actually called this mobile disco Ministry of Sound. Believe it or not. And I've actually got a picture of it. We made our own. like coffin out of chipboard covered it with fablon i don't know if you know what fablon is but it's this fablon is like it's like a sticky back plastic and we've we've covered it in all this orange fablon with fluorescent green letters along the front saying ministry of sound have you since brought that up with ministry of sound no i haven't but you know what at that time i registered my name i had a different name when i started So I registered a name, Eddie Richards, and I thought I'd registered Ministry of Sound. So I was kind of digging through all the documents. I think I might even have it somewhere where I've actually, I own the registration to that name. So did you get any bookings with this mobile disco? Yeah, yeah, we were booked. See, my dad was like part of a social club thing. And I think one of my first bookings was for the place that he worked. those kind of things in those days, they seem to attract like, I don't know, my sister was into, was into Motown and she was like a mod. She was quite older than me and So the first things I did were for all these mods, basically. And they were just into Motown, so she was into Motown. And that's what we played. I played Motown. And these guys on scooters turned up, skinheads. That's the first mobile discos that we played. So if someone was interested in going out and hearing these particular styles of music around that time, would it be more often that a mobile DJ would play these types of events rather than going to a club where there's an installed sound system and DJ booth and those kinds of things? See, I don't remember if there was clubs at that particular time. I was really young. I was like 14 or something. Oh, right, okay. And this was just like a... you know, like a working men's club, if you like, a sports and social club, you know, and they just had a night, like a disco night, but it just happened to have mods, that's what was around at the time, and my sister kind of was there, and she was going out with this skinhead guy, and so we... That's what I played. I played Motown and stuff. When I first got into it, I wasn't really into music. It was just more like my sister was into it and I just kind of got dragged into it through my friend buying this equipment, really. What did get you into music? Was there a turning point? Yeah, that's a good question. I'm not really sure if there was a particular turning point, but I found that the music that I liked... You know, it seemed to stay with me, if you like. It stood the test of time, you know what I mean? And I found that out since then. The stuff that I just got into before all the internet thing was going on, the music that I got into, I found a generation later or two would be looking for that music too. So I kind of... like affirmed my good taste, if you like, at that point in time. But what I got into then is classic today, you know what I mean? And I didn't have any, I didn't have reference points at that time. It was just about what I liked. Did you end up through that kind of doing DJ professionally in some way? form I wanted to link this because I'd read that you were DJing in strip clubs at a certain point in time would that sort of follow on from the mobile yeah it did I mean I really enjoyed DJing it was just with a mate and we were out you know, doing whatever we could do, really. But then I went to college. My parents wanted me to go to college in South Bank Polytechnic. And, you know, I wasn't really that interested. I was kind of doing it really because my parents wanted me to do it. So at lunchtimes, I was just going out and I managed to actually get a little spot DJing in like a lunchtime thing, strip club. And I started playing there. I don't know if it was really a continuation of my love for DJing or something I knew how to do. And it was just get out of classes, basically. But that's how it continued from that point. The actual turning point for me was there was a local, I used to live in Milton Keynes, I still do, place called The Starting Gate. in Milton Keynes, it was a pub, a biker's pub. And I set my mobile disco up in there and all these bikers used to come up and ask me to play all this different music. And then Milton Keynes happened to be like a London overspill at the time. So there was all these different kinds of people like punks and... gays and indie kids and they turned up at the bikers pub because they weren't really kind of welcomed in other places because of the way they looked and they dressed so they were coming up with some tracks and saying can you play this and can you play that and can you play this and I really got into some of the stuff they were playing you know and that pub you know started to attract a lot of kids and it turned into like this indie gay kind of night, and it was really successful. And some of the guys in there were saying to me, you should go to this club in London called Heaven. And I hadn't really actually even gone to London, to be honest, that much. I see. So there's some of the gay guys who would go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They would say to me, you should go to heaven. It's a really great club. So I went to heaven and I was totally blown away. It was like a revelation. You know what I mean? It's like I was looking for something and I didn't know I was looking for it and I found it in heaven. It was like the music was completely different. Everybody was dressed completely different. The way they programmed the music was completely different. And I was like, wow, you know, this is what I want to do, you know. And I was looking around to try and find someone to ask. And I don't know if you know, in heaven, the DJ booth at that time was caged. You couldn't really get into it. But there was some guy smoking there. And I just said to him, can I have a chat with you? And I was like to explain, you know, that I was really into what they were doing there. That actually turned out to be Colin Favour, DJ Colin Favour. And he said, "Well, you know, I play here in heaven." In fact, he played the Sound Shaft, which is close to heaven. And he showed me some of the records and I didn't realise those. It was just a new scene to me. It was like completely new. He showed me like new import records he was buying. And I said to him, well, I've got a night here in Bletchley. Why don't you come up and bring some music with you and play? So he did. I met him off the train. And he had this black bin liner full of records. And he turned up and we played. And I thought it was really good. I mean, it wasn't a thing about guest DJs, blah, blah, blah, at that time. I just wanted to learn off him, really. So a couple of months after that, he just called me and said, Listen, there's a new club starting in London and I kind of liked, you know, what you were doing there because we were playing right across the board. We were playing, as I said, indie and we were playing gay disco and playing electro. And you were saying to me, why don't you come down, you know, and, you know. sort of talk to the guys there because they're looking for another DJ. So I was like, okay. And this was the Camden Palace in London. And I got the job. And so I went from being like, you know, not knowing almost nothing like a few months before to playing in a club, which got voted like best in the world for like four years in a row. It was like. It was the equivalent of fabric now. You know what I mean? So there it was. My journey started. Yeah, I mean, were there similarities with what you were doing in Milton Keynes and what was being played at Heaven? Well, this is it. I was doing something that I think that that's what Colin recognised. I was doing something that was... kind of on the ball, but I didn't realise it was on the ball. I was just doing my thing. I was just playing music that I liked and, you know, crossing genres, but just doing what I thought was, playing what I thought was good music. And that seemed to have, you know, seemed to have caught something, you know, with Colin and obviously with the guys. at Camden Palace. The person that interviewed me was Rusty, Rusty Egan, and he was part of Visage, you know, and Visage started all the Blitz thing. And in fact, that's the reason they got offered the Camden Palace. They were asked if they would host it. It was obviously what I was doing was recognised by Rusty. And I found that, you know, when I started playing at... at Camden Palace, you know, what I was playing in my little pub in Bletchley was pretty much what they were doing in London at that time, you know, surprisingly. They were playing the same sort of thing. They were playing a bit of indie. They were playing a bit of gay disco. They were playing... All this is like a new electronica. And I was just at home. And what was the kind of concept or the idea behind Camden Palace? Well, I think it was kind of like a fashion, mainly a fashion place. They expected a crowd that were going to Blitz Club at the time. Blitz. was run by Steve, he was the host of the night, and Stephen Rusty from Visage. And Boy George was actually working in a cloakroom at the time, I think, at Blitz. And it had all the fashion kids. Blitz was kind of coming to the end of its line, and they got offered to host this brand-new London club, which is what they did. And so Cabinet Palace was full of pop stars, basically, all their mates, Spandau Ballet, Wham!, Grace Jones. all there and I was like bam I was in the middle of this all of a sudden Was it a world you felt kind of comfortable in? Yeah. No, it was just all really different for me. Since then, it's just been a mad journey. I'm just kind of holding on and watching it all go by. That's how it seems to have been, really. I've not had to really try, if you like. I just do my own thing, and things seem to fall into place. to place because i'd read that the club was sort of loosely modeled on like the studio 54 way of doing things um would you say that the studio 54 kind of loomed very large in the minds of people around that time was that kind of a thing that people aspired to sort of get towards yeah you could say that i think it was because at the time london didn't have have a club believe it or not they just didn't have a club like that sort of like an iconic meeting place or something that would like define the time just just a club oh even just a club right yeah i mean most of the places were kind of small places that they had a tiny little dance floor and tiny little speakers but the idea was like the dj wasn't important at all it was more about let's bring people in if some kids playing the music It will bring people in to spend money at the bar. It was like a secondary thing, the fact they had a little dance floor. The dance floor had been this big. It's tiny. So the Camden Palace was the first place to actually... that took the idea of New York where they made the DJ and the music important, you know, like, say, Studio 54 or like Zanzibar in Tony Humphrey's club, where, like, they had a really good sound system. It was the first time. Camden Palace was one of the first ones that actually had a really, really good sound system and lighting rig, you know, and concentrated on... that side of things and the music before then that was secondary it was more about bringing people in to spend money at the bar and you said you could mix there as well yeah i was wondering when did this like the idea or the concept of like a continuous like blend of music when did that first come onto your radar or like who kind of showed you that was that was a heaven that was a heaven yeah really before then yeah i was just because i was playing in this biker's pub And I was playing all kinds of music. It was all segwayed. I was playing one track and then I was playing something else. I didn't speak over the music, but that's what DJs were doing at that time. They were talking between the tracks. So when I went to heaven, I heard like a continuous mix. And I didn't even know that that really existed. I mean, you know, I tried when I got back. you know to mix and I bought some bought some turntables that were like belt driven and they had a little kind of knob on them but they were impossible to mix with you know I mean I mean heaven they had like these techniques obviously and I didn't really realize at the time But, I mean, it taught me to mix, you know, to really concentrate. So Camden Palace was where you started matching records. Probably, yeah. They had three. They had three techniques there. They had a reel-to-reel because, I mean, that's what they were using, you know, in New York at the time. If you had a demo, you wouldn't have a white label to give to the DJ. You'd actually mix the thing. put it down to a two-track reel-to-reel and take that to the club. In fact, you can see, if you look on YouTube, you can see like New Order, say Blue Monday, doing the track in the New York studio and then taking it to... the Funhouse, where John Jellybean was playing, and he would stick it straight on the reel, and he'd mix it in like that. That's why they did it. So I assume it was at Camden Palace that the earliest house tracks were coming through. Yeah, yeah. I mean, do you remember some of those earliest encounters? Yeah, I do. I was trying to find music. In fact, I spent a lot of my week, I was only working at Camden Palace, like a... I did a Tuesday, which was a bit of a, it was called like the Gong Show or something, some weird thing. And I was doing Friday and Saturdays there as well. But I used to come down in the week in London and go to like the record and tape exchange, go to all the record companies to pick up new stuff. You know, I was in a position in where I was getting decent money. I could afford to get the music and I was just going crazy. I was just buying. huge piles of vinyl every week, just going mad, really. You know, I had everything, you know. I guess I'm interested to know what the sort of conversation surrounding this music. was like at that time like you know if you were discussing it with fellow djs or like people who were into it like but you know how were you interpreting it because i assume that you didn't like there wasn't this gut of information around that time was there well these records just arriving from the us yeah no there wasn't no glut but there was one shop there was one shop everybody used to go to was groove records in wardour street which is probably closed by now But the one I went to, I found this little secret place and it was called Smithers and Lee in Oxford Street. It was basically a department store with a music thing. And I started talking to this guy in there and he really knew his stuff. And that happened to be Joe Negro. You know, he was he was basically the buyer and he was into music and he was kind of using using them to buy his own preference. So I found this little secret. hordes I used to go to Smithers and Lee and buy all these and import tracks and one of the first ones I got was I think if you're talking about house music here She's Lost Control by Sleazy D I think it came out in 86 I started to play that and people would say to me playing this stuff it was just drum beats you know i mean they didn't get it at the time i was like it was really cool yeah so i guess the approach for you would have been to um weave it into your existing music that you played would that be the way to sell people on it yeah yeah yeah and were you finding like with you know increasing enthusiasm people were just sort of warming up to to the idea of it i mean was it a tough sell Not really, because we were kind of the dictators of the style, of the fashion, really, so we could play what we wanted. In fact, I kind of liked teasing the audience in a way, you know what I mean? We were kind of there, and I could... I suppose it's in a position of power, but I felt like, you know, I could do what I wanted to. I could manipulate the crowd, you know, and I could hold them back until I wanted most of them on the dance floor. I was in that position where I could play what I wanted and get away with it, really. Yeah, I see. And you end up giving some UK debuts to some of the big US guys, right? Or you were sort of instrumental in bringing some of those guys over for early gigs? Well, yeah, because, I mean, what happened after I finished the Camden Palace was that I was kind of unemployed for a while. I don't know why it is with me. I just do these crazy things. I decided that one day I just didn't want to go in anymore, and I didn't. I just stopped, so I didn't have a job, didn't have any money. But then, you know, somehow the rave scene just kind of popped in. The guy that started off the whole scene, Tony Costner, I hear his name is, used to live in Milton Keynes, came into like this local club that I started to play at just to earn a bit of money. And he asked me if I'd be interested in being his musical coordinator, which basically was finding the music. for his parties that he was going to do. So I did that, and the first one was in Wembley. It was pretty small. He turned out to be the guy that was instrumental in starting the rave scene. That's what kicked off this whole worldwide phenomenon was him walking into this club in Milton Keynes and asking me, and then... And then that was the first raves. They were called Sunrise. And after that, there was obviously lots of other people copied it and it just got massive. And it spread around the world. What was that response to? Why was he doing it? He thought that, just like I thought at the time, going into like a local club, they didn't really look at what your personality, what your character was like. They looked at what you were wearing. You had to wear a suit to get into some of these places. You know what I mean? They figured that you weren't going to fight in a suit, so they made you wear a suit to get in. He didn't like that idea of things, and I think he just wanted to start something different where there wasn't that kind of focus. It was more about the people. They could do what they wanted. So he started this night, and we did one like in Wembley It was only a couple of hundred people and it just worked really well. People must have been feeling the same as we were feeling. It seemed almost like overnight that it changed when people started going to these outdoor raves and stopped going to the clubs. emptied because you could just do what you wanted in a rave you could just it just got on for a long time sound system was massive you know it's like the spectacle was incredible Yeah, I mean, did it feel like in a way that it was melding with other established cultures? You know, you're thinking about like sound system culture and like hippie movement and stuff like that. There must have been echoes of those things. It was really because it started off small and then just got bigger. And then other people came in to the marketplace to compete. And in order to become the best, it just got into this. match of like to get the biggest system to get the biggest fairground rights to get i think that's how it really started but it didn't start off big it just got to be big you know and in the end there was 25 000 people going out to one of these raves do you reflect on those parties pretty fondly Because, I mean, I'd imagine it's the sort of thing that would be very easy to become nostalgic over. But, I mean, do you feel like the parties were as good as people certainly, like, make them out to be? Did it feel like a really special time? It really did. It really did, yeah. In fact, going back to your earlier question, when house music came in, there was a definite vibe. There was like... Something in the air. You knew something was happening. Something exciting was going on. That's what it felt like with the raves. That's what it felt like at the beginning of house music, you know. And through the raves, you were able to kind of re-establish yourself and sort of be playing regularly again. Yeah, I definitely was. I mean, I had about a year off from leaving the Camden Palace. Then I started working this. This little warehouse, it was called Rip, Rave in Peace. It was run by this guy, Paul Rip, and the resident DJs were myself, Mr. C, and Kid Bachelor. It was in the old Clink Street. studios basically where it was clink street was the was the place where prisons were the first prison was it used to be called the clink i don't know if you know that but people say you know getting the clink it was because the first prison was was at clink street and it was on that site Basically, it was a really run-down warehouse that was really dark. I mean, it was scary. And I think actually that's why a lot of journalists didn't write about it and they wrote about places like Shum because they were actually scared to go in places like that. It was the kind of people, they were kind of dodgy people that went in there. And it was like really dark and just it was just strobes and smoke. You couldn't see a foot in front of you. You know, I mean, and I can't imagine a journalist kind of wanting to go there and with his notepad and writing something, you know what I mean? I imagine all that contributed to the atmosphere. Yeah, no, that was that was incredible because, you know, you could actually play a track and it would. be it would be like a religious experience in fact Ashley Beadle was playing in one of the other rooms they had a shock sound system playing in one of the other sections and after done my set I walked in he was on the mic going okay I want everybody to kneel down to the god of house the whole room did it you know it was like it was kind of a religious thing you know I mean it felt like you were like as one yeah i guess especially is this something so fresh still you know people are still wrapping their heads around it it would feel like it's some religious transcendent experience or something yeah seriously it was that's why i think these days when i look back at it you know people are trying to do these raves they've got they're never going to experience that it just won't happen again but they haven't seen what i've seen you know it's not like So, you know, they can they're going to capture that again. It's just a shame in a way. I feel sorry that they don't. It's such an amazing time. So it's a little later on. You ended up opening a DJ agency, didn't you? Which I guess for that time was like not something that people did. What was one of... The first, if not the first. I think it was the first. It started off because, you know, when the rave scene started, there was a few dodgy people that decided they were going to rip people off. The way it worked, really, was if you were putting on a rave, you didn't really give the address of the place out, you know, because the police would shut it down. So you had a meeting point, and then people would pay for tickets at the meeting point. And then they would take the tickets and they could get into the rave and they'd be told where the rave was. Unfortunately, there was people that were just putting up meeting points, taking the money, and there was no rave. I thought that, you know, there should be contracts and, you know, some kind of, you know, system for the DJs that, you know, we would, you know, be able to control it a little bit. And my friend ran an agency, was part of an agency that booked bands. I asked him if he would do it, and he didn't really get back to me. And I was like, okay, well, I'll just do it myself. And I contacted a couple of people from the States. and it seemed to be successful. It took off. And before I knew it, I was getting, in fact, I've still got them. I've got texts, not texts, sorry, faxes from Jeff Mills, from Moby, you know, handwritten, saying they heard there's a scene going on. Because the first people I brought over was De Posse from the States. from Chicago. And I think the word got around, they just telling people, there's this mad scene going on in the UK. Word got around really fast there. Then they were all coming to me. And I had this amazing lineup. I had just everybody that was anybody, basically, you know, all the Detroit crew, Todd Terry, you know, Green Velvet exclusive, Richie Horton, you know, all these people were. exclusive to my agency. I'd read that you'd given sort of early gigs to Horton. Initially, it was like quite a hard sell on what he was doing. Well, I mean, I felt that I was just, you know, again, I was just doing what I like. The music that I liked was never really a motive for me about being hip or wanting to make money. It was just about that's what I wanted to do. I liked all these people's music. I took them on because I liked their music and supported their music. That was the reason. It wasn't about money or anything else. And I took on Richie because he just brought a track out on Plus 8 called Technarchy, I think it was called. And I really liked it. But it wasn't really that big at that time. It was his first track. And so I had a job selling him at first. Yeah. What was the sort of broader context for techno at that time in London or in the UK? I think everybody, they liked to pigeonhole things anyway, you know, and more so these days. But then it was a bit broader. You did have DJs that were playing at the raves, some of whom were playing more techno stuff, some of them were playing more vocal stuff. It didn't really matter at the time. playing more balleric. It just was the accepted thing at that time. Nowadays, it seems like, you know, you go to a club because you're into, you know, sort of deep techno or drum and bass or whatever it might be. But it wasn't so pigeonholed at the time. So in terms of the agency, what happened? What happened, we got bigger. We've gone bigger and bigger and bigger. We opened up offices in Japan. In San Francisco, in New York, in Belgium, in South Africa, in Canada. It just got really big. And I was like using it as a kind of really getting other people to represent the same people as we were representing in their particular territory. Because I figured we couldn't get around to all those territories at one time. It would be better for someone who knew their area. concentrate on it so I was I was you know really giving them the business and they'd have to come through us eventually but it was you know we had offices set up everywhere and it got to the stage where I wasn't actually DJing so much anymore. I ended up like just like running around after this business that I didn't really want to do in the first place. So I ended up being a businessman or an accountant or something, you know what I mean? And I was thinking, I can't do this anymore. So in kind of the height of it being very successful, I decided to close it down. People were going, no, you're crazy. It's like he was making money and he's doing well. But I was thinking, why am I doing this? I didn't even want to do this. So I guess it was this time around 20 years ago that you were first approached by Terry Francis and Nathan Coles, who were pitching you on an idea for a club night. Yeah. So what happened was that I was... I think we've mentioned I live in Milton Keynes. It's right in the centre of the country. When the rave scene started, it wasn't about DJs from other countries. In fact, if you pick up an old DJ, which is what I did a few weeks ago, it wasn't even called DJ. DJ magazine or something else, there was no mention of any international DJs. It was all about the UK. So how long ago were we talking? Say '93. '93, okay. Yeah. Just the scene wasn't international at all. In fact, when I used to travel to some places, some of the DJs used to say to me, "Please bring along any promos, anything that you've got." because they couldn't even buy records in their country, let alone their city. You know what I mean? It was so hard to get music internationally at that time. Where were you going around that time? Well, mainly in Europe, just mainly in Europe. I did a few gigs in the States as well. It just started to spread. I think it spread because some of the kids that went to the parties... You know, they found themselves somewhere else and thought, I can export the idea. So they started their own little rave scenes. And that's kind of what started off the whole rave scene around the world. Just kids moving around. knowing something that the other people didn't know and starting off their own little club nights and then the rave scene got bigger. I was on most of the flyers. for most of the big raves at that time so a lot of people were calling me saying can you play somewhere else that was the first time I started traveling yeah around in the early 90s so with the wiggle party the guys had already started out by the time they approached you was that is that right yeah yeah they I think Terry and Nathan met and I DJed for him one day and they just one night and they said would you be interested in being our resident? So that's how it still is, basically. It's Terry and Nathan's thing, and I just turn up and DJ. Yeah. And what was their kind of pitch to you around the time? What were they trying to achieve with it? They just wanted to do something that wasn't sort of commercial, that wasn't, that was just something different. And I knew what they were trying to do because that was always in my mind, you know what I mean, when I've even. first started DJing, when I even first went to heaven, it was I was looking for something different. I was looking for something that, you know, I felt at home with. And that's what I thought when I met Terry and Nathan, that they were on the same tip as me. They wanted to do something different, something from their heart, you know what I mean? How would you describe your style around that time? Black. American, I suppose. That was my thing. I had to have a groove. I had to have a baseline. I'm still into that. I think that that's what my music revolves around. I mean, with that sort of early guests that played the parties that would kind of define what was going on, were they bringing over guest DJs, in fact? Not really. I mean, it was just us three. It was really based around us three. We started to bring in guests after a while. mainly because people were asking us. In fact, even Richie asked to play Wiggle. It had a pretty big name. But I'm happy to say that we just did our thing. Things have changed a lot these days. I don't want to knock it, but these days it's all about hype. I mean, it's all about this kind of trendy kind of hipster stuff. And, you know, I don't really fit in with that. I've always just done my thing, you know. So the way you're describing the music with this sort of emphasis on groove, would you say that this was the sort of genesis of this thing that later became known as Tech House? Well, I've got a cassette at home, and it was from Mr. C. And on one side it says tech, and on the other side it says house. And he's the guy, I think, that probably coined the term tech house, because it wasn't about being a genre. It was about mixing styles of music. It wasn't being conformist and saying, I like techno, or I like house. It's like... I like both. Why can't I play in both? So, you know, it was tech on one side, house on the other. And that's what we were playing. Okay. Do you think it's kind of been misconstrued over the years? It's just the exploration of the middle ground rather than being like, you know, this wide thing. Somehow I think that it got to be, you know, the genre got to be describing a sound that was like tribal. How? I don't know, but it did. And then all these American labels jumped on that, you know, and then, you know, like Halo and Hippie and all those guys. And it just kind of burnt that out. And tech house got to be a dirty word in a way, which is a shame because it wasn't like that when it started. Yeah. I mean, I guess at the time there was some like, you know, very sort of interesting, like percussive led records that just had this sort of, you know, great sort of understated attitude in a way. Yeah. I was looking for those tracks. I was looking for something. that wasn't too vocally or wasn't too techie. You know, it was something in the middle ground that, you know, had a groove and a baseline. I mean, did you find yourself like picking from both sides around that time? Were you sort of equally interested in? Yeah, no. And house? I was equally interested in everything. You know, my career growing up by, you know, getting into like gay disco, but into indie or whatever. So basically, if I found a track that I liked, I And, in fact, a lot of people were asking me about the names of tracks and I suppose a lot of other DJs have said it, but at that time when I was picking vinyl, I was picking from just the colour of the label. I didn't really care if it was Madonna on the label or whoever it might be. If it was good and I thought it was good, I would play it. And it wasn't about... you know, anything other than, you know, what I liked. And I guess that's a spirit that lives onto this. Well, I hope so. Yeah. I hope I don't get dragged into it too much. I've seen a lot of people get dragged into it, really, unfortunately, you know, where... They started off with this different vision and ended up just getting, you know, dragged into the kind of all the corporate, you know, hype. With this sort of sound in mind, around the end of the late 90s, early 2000s, you had like a number of labels going sort of simultaneously. yeah what was the sort of overall aim and how did you like differentiate between them well actually it was just to spread the sound really because i know that not all distributors that time were great and i didn't have a particular style so i just figured i was just going to make tracks and then if i felt they fit in on one label i'd give them to that label and if it felt in another one then i would give them to another one But unfortunately, at that time, you know, the record industry wasn't doing great and all my distributors went bust. So my label was went bust because, you know, I was owed money from the distributors. They had stock of mine, which I didn't get back and I lost quite a lot of money and really just gave it up after that. Sort of interested. I mean, I wouldn't want to like put two defined terms on what you were doing, but. I think what's very like noticeable to me is this is very nice kind of like understated, like, you know, very functional, very focused on the club, but this very like understated way of doing things. Is this sort of a, like inherent appeal in that approach to you to sort of like reflect your attitude towards music or like other things you think it does have when i first thought about djs i just thought well seriously what are these guys doing they're standing up they're playing someone else's music really it's not that difficult you know i mean so i've never tried to like grab the limelight because i've never felt like i should i deserve it it's just more about like I've got a particular taste and I just do my thing. And if some people like it, then great. You know, it's like people seem to debate and get all deep about this stuff. It's, you know, what's the big deal? So when Fabric opened up at the end of the 90s, I assume you were playing there from almost the beginning. Is that right? Pretty much from the beginning. I can't remember exactly when the first time I played there, but. I did go even before the club opened, actually, to have a look at the way they were doing it. And, yeah, it just looked amazing. I mean, it just looked like my kind of place. I would have loved to have actually been, you know... to be the resident there. Terry got the job but he deserves it. It's a great day change. And why was it such a good fit for kind of what you were doing and sort of what Wiggle was doing? Why did it kind of resonate or why was it sort of a good relationship? I think it was because it was run by this guy Keith. Keith used to come to a lot of the parties that we did. He understood where we were at. In fact he was a huge supporter. Which is why I think Terry got the job, basically. You know, he used to come to the Wiggle Parties. He liked that attitude. That's what it takes, I think, to run a good club. It takes someone behind it that's got the right attitude, the right sense of what they think a club should be like. and it continues to this day. If you look at Fabric and what they're doing, they're now 15 or 16 years maybe. I think that's amazing for any club to last that long, and the lineups are still really, really good. People might knock it because it's like everything. It's got a little bit more touristy. what's in people's hearts there is still the right thing yeah I mean do you still kind of gain the same like feeling from playing that has it always been like an enjoyable experience I love it for the last 15 years I love it and you know what it's like it's like if you fuck up there excuse the language then you can only blame yourself because everything is completely sorted for you, you know. It's down to you on that night, you know. Do you have a particular room you like to play in the club? I like room three, actually. I do my own demo night. I've got a regular night with Terry every three months there. And they allow us to pick the guests that we want. And what we're trying to do is introduce new. upcoming talent that hasn't quite yet broken or got to the stage where Fabric would book them. So we kind of introduced them. I like Room 3 because it's like a room within a club. It's like it's almost its own club. It's very transient. People walk through there. So it's a challenge. You have to play well to... keep people in that room because they're not really interested in that room they're more interested in room one and two and they're just like wandering around the club checking it out so if you can grab them and keep them there you're doing a good job and I always love a challenge because it almost feels like as a DJ you have like a 10 minute window of like demonstration and they're always looking for an excuse to go to somewhere else yeah that's how it was been from the start as I said when I started the Camden Palace. I was doing that. I was trying to manipulate the crowd. I was seeing what I needed to do. I was learning, you know, I was taking it all in. Yeah, I wanted to ask about this, actually, because obviously you've been DJing for a good number of years now, but do you see sort of through lines from what you were doing, like back in Milton Keynes to like your sets these days? Has there been like a prevailing... attitude do you think? I just try and keep it real I just try and think to myself you know just pick the tracks I like not get influenced by names by trends, by hype or anything like that. I'll just listen and if I like it, I'll play it. I don't really care who it is. I don't try and follow anything. I find it difficult when people ask me that question, like, who's your favourite DJ? I don't actually pay much attention to what's going on. I try and keep it like I did from the beginning, which is just like... There's the music that's out there. I listen to lots of it. I select what I like and that's what I play. you know, I managed to build up a following around the world. I don't get bookings you see these days anymore or at all. Never used to from, you know, the hipster kind of crowd. I'm not a name DJ. I'm not a flavor of the month. I've always been there. People book me because they know what they're going to get. So I've got friends all over the world. So when I DJ, it's like instead of going to some random gig. they book me because my name is blah, blah, blah. It's more like I'm going to visit some friends and then I visit some other friends in another part of the world and some other friends and that's what I love about it. I'm glad I'm not involved in that, you know, getting booked just because of I'm this or I've got this production out. that's bullshit right it's interesting you say that because i would link this back to the the music you were making and releasing because i think one of the key qualities for me was this like longevity yeah right there's this idea that there's not really like necessarily of its time i mean you can place it like in a in a certain window of time or something but you know those records could be like dusted off and played at any time and like you know not really leave djs bags for a long time yeah like is this idea of longevity been something that has been like you know key in your thinking yeah question actually because that's exactly what i was thinking most of the time you know that you know i i examine other people's music and it's that that's that i like that longevity i like the fact that you know i'm liking a track and i discovered it and these days the same kids some other kids are liking it and discovering it you know it does stand the test of time when i make mixes Or when I buy music, that's what's behind my thinking, is can I play it again later on? It's got to be just a certain quality. And I'm pretty good at picking up stuff that's like that, you know, and I stand by that still. And you're someone who's placed a lot of importance with pushing new music as well. Why has that been so important to you, would you say? Because I'm bored, quickly. That's pretty much the bottom line. Yeah, I have to actually avoid playing some tracks. Some people, they play house music all the time in the car or at home. I actually have to avoid that because if I listen to something too much, I get bored with it. And then I don't play it, even though it's a good track and it really should be exposed to the crowds out there. So I just generally try and listen to it. If I like it, I put it in my virtual box to play out and then that's it. So you made a shift to digital DJing at a certain point. When was that? About seven years ago. Yeah. I mean, did it feel like much of a change in thinking or approach or was it just like, okay, this is natural. I'm going to get into this thing. I've always been into technology. I've always been to new things. I wanted to try it out. And I liked the idea of it. It felt like playing vinyl, except my choices weren't limited any longer. I could take along 10,000 tracks with me. That's what I liked about it. I don't really see what people have got to hang up about it. I don't really know why. It feels the same to me, playing that music. In fact, these days, the software has got quite sophisticated. What I use a lot in Traktor is the fact that I can jump around within a waveform and play a beginning and loop it and then jump to the end and play. You can't do that with vinyl. Vinyl is very linear. It starts at the beginning, it goes through, and if there's a shitty breakdown that you don't like... you have to put up with it. I don't have to put up with it now. I can just skip over it or I can loop another part. So really, I'm constantly remixing one on because I know what I like and I think a lot of tracks these days, producers don't actually have a lot of... great ideas. The track's good for two minutes and they stretch it for six, so I just play the good two, you know. Do you think it's made you a better DJ? I think so. A lot of people think so as well. They, you know, when I started playing on, it was Serato at first, people were saying to me on my sets, definitely more interesting. So, I don't know, I'll go along with that, you know. I think that it's made it more exciting. I do get these ideas, like I'm playing somewhere, I go, oh, wow, that'd be a great track. I can just dig it out. There it is. I've got 10,000 tracks with me. It's not like I've got, you know, these days if you're playing vinyl, it's hard to take a big box of vinyl. So you've limited it to maybe, what, 150 tracks? it's crazy do you feel as though the culture surrounding djing has shifted a lot in the time you've been involved with it like certainly if you look back to the time around the early 90s and the the people who would be involved with it and the discussions that would take place surrounding it like is it much different these days do you think I think in the UK, and there's not much that has changed, I think they're really quite educated. In fact, I noticed this when I started a DJ agency and I brought guys from the US. They were really quite shocked, you know, how knowledgeable the UK kids were. They knew about producers, they knew about labels. It seemed like in the US they were saying to me, well, if it's not top 40, people don't really care. I mean, surprisingly enough, people like Derek May were saying there's not that much going on in Detroit. It's not like it's, you know, known. It's not like it's bought by those. It was being bought in the UK and in Europe. Actually, back in America, it was all about top 40. You know, they were shocked about the scene. The kids in the UK are really quite knowledgeable and that's always been the way they are now as well. So next month, you're going to be celebrating 20th anniversary of Wiggle. Would that be the exact date that they started out? Do you recall? Who knows what that date was? It was a dim and distant past. But no, we chose that date because... When we decided that we were going to do something, you know, like have a party and we approached Fabric, we asked them also if they would be interested in having a mixed CD out, which... And they agreed to distribute for us. It's just taken a little while to get those tracks in for us to be able to get the mix done. We don't see each other as often as, you know, we'd like these days. I've got our independent careers. Nathan lives in Ibiza. So, you know, time just kind of flew. By the time we've actually got this mix done a couple of weeks ago, it's already... you know july so we have to now schedule the actual mix party for september so on september the 6th will be the official launch of the mix cd and a party at fabric to celebrate our 20-year anniversary at Wiggle. So what was the idea with the compilation? Because you've got, I guess it would be described as like notable or like key guests to contribute tracks, is that right? That's right, yeah. Well, we have had a lot of guests and we did send a mail out to people and ask them if they want to be involved. Some people just didn't even bother to reply, unfortunately. We've had some great guests, which we would have loved to include, but we didn't get a response from them or their agents. But we did get a response from a lot of people, a lot of really good DJs. So we just used the ones that we'd got. It'd be nice to include others. What can you say? So what's kind of next for you? What's on the horizon? How do you look forward to the next? decade of DJing? Well, yeah, I've been around for a long time. You know, I've always said to myself, if I get to the point where I don't enjoy the music or people stop asking me, I would stop doing it. That's not the case. People are still asking me and I'm still loving it. So here I am, 30 something years later, I'm still DJing. Obviously things have changed, you know, these days, you know, it's not just about you can just put out some music. You have to, 50% of it is like marketing. You have to know about all the social networks. You have to know about how to get your music out there. And it's all about, you know, putting out a production in order to get bookings these days. Sad, but true. So I'm getting back into doing some music. I've released a couple of things on my label Storm, which basically were old tracks that have been reinterpreted by some of my favourite producers. I've had Mikhail. Popovicu, Tiger Skin, Kate Simcoe and Dashund. I've got some others that are doing remixes for me. And then once that kind of introduction, so people know my name again, I'll start bringing out some other new music. I'm looking forward to it, but at the same time, I always felt that, you know, DJ should be a DJ. You shouldn't have to produce. to be a DJ, but it seems like that's the rules these days. Yeah, I mean, do you think you would be doing it if it wasn't for these sort of external market forces, if you like? Maybe not, maybe not. I mean, I do enjoy making music. I'm not saying that, you know, I'm just doing it because of that. I do enjoy it, but it's just a shame that you have to be a producer to be a DJ, really. But I feel like once someone's given me a try, then it's all good after that. Thank you. Inside, you can feel the difference. Inside, you can feel the difference. Inside, you can feel the difference.
