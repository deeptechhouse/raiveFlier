Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor, and I can't pronounce a word of German properly. That's one thing at least that you'll learn from my discussion with musical chameleon Florian Schirrmacher. the member of Varika, Hatikva, Federlicht, Glowing Glisses, and a few others, believe it or not, is one of the favorite voices of producers in the world of electronic music these days due to his contributions to those aforementioned groups. But he brings much more than his voice to the table. It's an attitude, a vibe, a celebration, as he so aptly puts it. We talked in October about this and much more. I read in an interview recently that music is a way to develop religion. Bump. strong sentence i was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit very nice question um religion is in yourself and you've got a kind of relation to yourself and if you got this kind of relation you don't you know you you can realize that to this There is a switching that yourself is not yourself and you are not yourself and stuff like this. maybe you become aware of if you are dancing to in a club situation for example if you get into the sound and you become part of the group and this this kind of thing can be quite useful to put the focus on the community. Sure. It seems like one of the things that stretches throughout your music is the idea of community. The idea of coming together, sharing in a celebration, learning and sharing a celebration, I guess. Yeah, this is a phrase from from Vareika Smiles. Learning and sharing, celebration and music is doing all time. You said that that... Music itself is learning and sharing. I'm practicing a lot with my piano. I have studied piano and vocals at Kreiswald University. And it was kind of another thing, it was more or less this kind of church music thing, because I started here in Berlin, started studying theology. And besides that I was practicing with Semidi and doing some tracks we never released. Hopefully it will be someday, but it was never released. But from this kind of... Practicing, Sami introduced me to Zip and so we made this album together with the Pony Slay Station. This is Panty Tap on Perlon. Yes, right. Collaborated the Elastobabe single and back on... on this album, "Super Tahiti" and I still love those tracks because they have reached more or less out that vocals hood. body inside it was not the vocal or the frame it was just concentrating on the body itself so I was... In listening to Last Debate I find it interesting though that obviously you're cut up quite a bit and transformed in a way I wonder if you're coming from this vocal background If at first maybe you were a little bit hesitant to let someone do that to you It happens sometimes when if I put out the remake if I put out a vocal frame a complete vocal phrase and the remixer is doing like this so like a remixer thinking of oh and now i need to concentrate and put just the essence out of it and and what happens is that the vocals are cutted like this but with elastobabe i was coming from just playing with drums i had a I had a band called Drum Spirit in Westerland. and we just played one year only drums. I added with Minimoog and Hammond, I added some sounds. So I was totally into this sounds and drums and rhythms. Yes, very close to this rhythm. thinking sometimes it's now in the Varayka theme, it's kind of mixed up, mashing up with complex rhythms. So just Sammy was the kind of guy who said, "Oh, come on, just do it. Put your voice in it." I was not into this singing, elaborate. yeah this mind thing i was just gonna come sure when you you said you started doing studying vocals. When did you start studying that? I'm interested to... 2003. It was the same time when the Glowing Glitters and the Perlman album was released. So before that you had had no training? No. But you were in choir and doing things like that? Yes, I was in choirs. all time when I was in school. So basic school and all this stuff. And I like singing in a choir. It's like breathing together. I'm in a choir currently. as well. You're still in a choir? Yeah, I'm still in a choir. NDR Radio Choir from Hamburg city. Was it always a religious thing, choir, for you? No, I think the religious thing is just a hint or something. Knowledge can be also a religious thing. If you are in a basic school, in a choir, you just be there and enjoy singing together. Pure joy. And religion should be also pure joy. Of course. It is for me. I was doing the yoga thing. In Berlin and when I moved to Greifswald I was doing it as well there like meditating and all that kind of stuff. I had teached a yoga group in prison in Stralsund. and that was intense. Tell me about that. I mean, teaching yoga in prison, it seems like an interesting thing. I'm concentrating on this intensity because intensity is just maybe a better word for this kind of religion, spirituality and stuff like this. It's just intention. So if Andrej Galutzi is playing and Ausgurte is sad and you're still into it, it's intense. So this is more or less the same. with this Stalsund, I was teaching there because I have learned and I have taken so much I have to give it back. So and I was thinking of yeah I had to go to prison and give it to them because they need it really. When I met these guys for the first time, it was a lot of... It was quite an insecure situation. No one knows what happened. prison itself there's a society, it's a closed society, it has its own society. So there were the guys who were just, yeah, who are running the society because that was somewhat fresh and they have to test it out and stuff like this. So yeah, these kind of hard guys, not so hard. We had a really good time and after this two hours everything was fine. I could work there. It has developed a strong relationship to the guys because they have done every day a couple of hours yoga. There are lots of vehicles to expand yourself. So that's not related to music, there's so much else. It is related to music in some way. Of course it is! You know this kind of mentality that you bring to the vocals and the lyrics that you're writing. I mean, the experiences are informing those things, right? Of course. When did you first start writing songs, like lyrics to songs? Well, this kind of question I have to start at the beginning more or less. My parents are not that. They love music. My father really loves music. He's listening quite intense. to all kinds of music. And my sister, six years old sister, she was practicing, she is practicing quite well the piano. So I started playing piano when I was seven years old. So I became aware of it. lots of songs. Not this kind of songs, more this just instrumental music, like piano music. I always practiced and then I added drums. I played in an orchestra. In some orchestras I played drums. And I played guitar. And then I met a band. Why did you choose Utopia? Just the good place. The translation is the good place. When we are together, it's just the good place. It was not the utopia like Thomas Morris and all this stuff. It was the utopia. Besides of this we played heavy metal. I had a jazz band called Zari and with this Zari thing it was the I choose this word because this was a Zari is made from out one Piece of cloth. Piece of cloth. Thank you. And so, that kind of... It has fascinated us, and so we choose this name. And with this band, I had written my first lyrics. It calls... I think "I stand still" is the first lyrics I have written and later on I took this lyrics for the Varayka song "Belonging". May I draw the line to the first outcome time? That was '93. And then it comes out. '96 was my first album with Zari. We produced it. You were 17. Pardon? You were 17 when your first album came out. Yes, I was 16, I'd like to say. Yeah, 17, thank you. And on 33 RPM Records, we released it. And it was amazing. We had just... earned the money by playing. We had like 50 songs, so quite a broad range of songs, more or less all instrumental, just some with vocals and... And then later on I just had this percussion project, and then this drum spirit band. Well, I did sounds, and then the Sammy D stuff. Were you familiar with Prolone and dance music? I mean, it was, I guess, a club thing before you met with Sammy D. I was in touch with "Mood to Swing", "Move Me", "Dop", "Rhythm and Sound" "Tikiman", "Spend Some Time" is one of my favorite songs ever. I was in touch with Crowd Control. It's an extended funk. It's a single I lost somewhere. It's amazing. Crowd Control is a very, very nice percussion player. I was into this drum percussion thing. I listened a lot of Duran Rigaluzzi's set, which was good. My brother, three years younger, he played lots of techno. He was practicing techno music. He had a 606 and 303 and when he comes home he was just playing and practicing his music. getting always in touch with the techno, with the influence of my brother, he just got the helter skelter. cassettes, this Jungle stuff from London. So he audited by telephone and I sent it. He played it so loud and I was getting in touch with this kind of music. But Move Me Dub, rhythm and sound to him and this was my own favorite. I really loved it. I was a bit intrigued. Trans music like IQ Records and Orbital. Sure. Very important influence for Federleicht also. Okay. Orbital. In what way? They are so free, free-formed. They have free-formed music and mashing it up with acoustic and digital instruments also. It's one flow. It seems like that extends to Warwicka as well, the freeform idea and basically everything that you do in a way, this sort of freedom. No, not really. Hatikva for example is quite structured. It's very clear, very structured. It seems preformed, like it's one flow and everything. It has time, but it's very clear, very structured what happens. Federleichtes Moral. a dream, a playground. And Orbital could be, has given me this as well. So what is Warika then? Warika? Warika, my bad. It's a playground maybe as well, but... How did you meet the other two guys in the group? I had a deep house night in Hamburg city. It's called the sense night. And I had a couple of parties at Mojo Club. And Henrik and Jakob also have had a party at the Mojo concert with the Havana Boys in the other, in the big hall. And before the party starts we just met together and said hello. Jakob has joined the concert years ago from by Glowing Glitters. where I have sang with Guido. So he knows, oh he has a voice and stuff like this. He just invited me to come to their studio and I practiced. for their songs they have given me and... So they gave you a bunch of songs before you came to the studio? No. Yeah. Sorry. Yes. I had two little sketches. Was it a pretty immediate connection to the music that you felt? when you heard it? I was connected. It's really nice because the first song we met is "Burnin'" with the phrase "We burn connected". No need to try. And I had a feeling of that when I met these guys that here comes a lot of things to and I could bring a lot of things in the music itself. It seems very interesting that, I mean obviously you make 4/4 music but it feels of course because it's being done by largely acoustic means or more live means that it just feels much more loose than most of the music. which will be coming out. I wonder if you think about making sure that it can somehow work on a dance floor for DJs or if that's not even something in the back of your mind when you're making music with the group. I understand myself as a DJ. Really? Yes. Always. Because it's a kind of get in touch, being in touch with music. And I have played a couple of times different styles of music and I'm connected with this different styles of, with this kind of style. like there is soul, funk, latin, lots of things are coming into house music. These are all these influences, afro, also as kuti, is coming, is melting in this kind of thing, house, is called house music. I'm fascinated. a melting point. You can't start from zero. Never. And I don't want to. I don't want to. It's just... It's huge. It's great. I am not thinking of this. When I start a track, I'm... I don't say "No, this will be a loosey track, this will be a structured one" or stuff like this. I guess it was more at a certain point in the construction of the track, you know, maybe there's a set or something you can put in there. It's just whatever works best for the song. I'm not changing a lot. I know where I am. Or more or less I can say we know because this is also a very enlightened thing to be aware of a partner. Like the partner and me and we are all the partners and we are just, if we are connected, we have the aim or the end. we know the end already so if we're starting we just have a feeling of this is it and then not doing too much and just concentrate of this essence maybe and then maybe it's complex if i'm for example king's child it's based on a improvisation of me at a piano and Henrik on the drums, I hear the beginning in the track always. So that's it. - Hmm, is it usually same way with the songs in that group that you're starting from jam sessions? No, but the beginning itself, that's important. That's the important thing. I can hear the beginning itself always. It can start from something different. It can just start from from a beat. What was the beginning of Harmony Park? King's Child was a very intense song for us. We have practiced a lot of time with this song. It has more like a little symphony maybe. It has so many elements in the song. and we couldn't release it like maybe lots of artists as well so we were looking for some partners and when Ricardo was listening to the song he was like "oh wow" we do it immediately so great okay so then he had... He did a remix of the track. Yeah, it was not planned like this. It was planned like an... SED, this SED release and then he said "ah come on, can we do another mix of this" and afterwards he came with the idea "can you, maybe you have, you can expand your this kind of language I heard can be expanded to a longer track and maybe we put it on four sides of vinyl sides and you can mix it up together and stuff like this. So he came up with the idea. I'm sorry. Thank you. Were you worried that you couldn't put together a 60 minute song? Were you worried that you have a fear that you wouldn't be able to pull it off? No, it was planned like this. No, it was planned. I just... later on... The day afterwards I was in the studio of Eureka and I told Henrik and Jakob, I told him... We're making a 60 minutes... No, no, this was the idea. How about this? I mean, he was thinking of doing this and this and we just... We had not this kind of thinking of, oh yeah, let's make it. 60 minutes, I mean just we had with King's Child we had 12 minutes or stuff like this But we have never thought about let's do a 10 minutes tracks or stuff like that. Yeah You said you've been playing it live a couple of times. How is it gone? Is it harder than just playing a normal set? Of course because there are The harmony part is based on 96 BPM. So this is not a clap tempo. 96 BPM is... The most hip hop tracks are faster than this. And so there are multiplex rhythms in the song. And we play with an MPC and I play synthesizer, I play Prophet synthesizer and my vocals. And Hendrik is playing... With Harmony Park, Hendrik is playing MPC as well. he sampled his own drum set. So he gunned VR and he mixed it up with a Sherman filter bank and small delay effects. So just putting it in a sound atmosphere which is... getting more deeper into this harmony park sound. And so to mix up this multiplex rhythms, you have to have lots of channels because you have to switch this tempos and you have to play 16 pads immediately. Just go through the... go in the mix it mix it up and yeah then you have two more then you have three different rhythms and tempo switches you've been performing it in clubs yes and it works it works especially the slow yeah especially the slow part yes That's interesting. Because you start fast, or fast 124, you start 124 and then it slightly moves to this slow. But you have to start fast. You have to start fast. It's very techno. The harmony part thing, if you play it live, it's very technical. I don't sing more or less, just a small part. I just introduce where we are in the harmony part. my synthesizer also play really rhythmics complex section of these envelopes and I don't want to go into too much detail, but it's more the rhythmic part of this prophet. You say you're introducing people to where you are, the Harmony Park, with "Hatikvah". With synchronicity, where are we? Where are we? Basically... Helmut and I, we are there, we are there for you. This is the basic thing. And then you can decide where you want to go to. It means hope in Hebrew. Why did you choose that name? That was your choice again? I mean, you've talked a little bit about it in interviews, but I'm interested. I mean, it seems like such an interesting... In a world where hope seems in short supply these days. Yeah, of course. That's the exact reason. Yeah, it's... Yeah, more or less it's... You said... I was talking to a guy who works at Soma and he said that... basically you sent a CDR via the post and they heard it and they signed it which is quite rare these days I always do it like this I send a CDR "I know this guy" and send them an email and just chatting with them at a party Sometimes I got feedback. and I also send final like finished pieces to labels as well like Heiko MSO, one who runs Playhouse. I send him always my music. He never released stuff like this and we just talked recently and everything's fine so but why not I think. We have a relationship now since years and that's it. Why did you decide to send that stuff to SOMA? It doesn't seem like the first label I would imagine releasing that. SOMA has Silicon Soul and Slam they have just been getting in touch with our recent releases on Bazaar and Morris Audio. I know Zoma from some trance and techno stuff. from way back in the day. - Yes, way back in the days. But Soma has a dubby and... - Obviously the Silicon Soul stuff is quite dubby, yeah. - I think we are right in a good family there. - For sure. - Glasgow. I like them but it's rough. Like Bremerhaven, my hometown, is as well quite rough. And I like this kind of feeling. It's quite rough, Bremerhaven. It's in the north, right? Near Hamburg? Yes. Yes, Hamburg. When did you... did you eventually move to Hamburg from Bremerhaven after school or something? No, I moved to Berlin. Okay. To do your theology studies. Right. First I was in... Westerland, like a small island for just doing one year of social work. And then I moved to Berlin, then I grew up there. I was a music teacher for a short period of time near Schwerin. and then I moved to Bielefeld to do the theology study again but it didn't work for me. You tried again? Yeah, I tried again to finish my studies because I just interrupted them for the church for this music stuff and then I started over. okay, let's go back and maybe finish it. Because I like to work and I have a lot of things to learn in this kind of area. But it didn't work for me. So far, no, it was music, that's it. And I worked there in the church, the Zion church. I had my boxes, my Abacus speakers, very nice speakers by the way, because they have so much intense, deep sound. So I had the speakers and the organ, well the organ was there. I had the speakers and my laptop and the small... So you were producing music? I was producing that. The acoustics must be amazing. Yes, it was good. It was quite well. When you get tired, I always produced it at night. When you get tired, I was then on the organ. playing some organ stuff and then I was awake and then I could produce more and more stuff. I had a ballet, so modern dance, I have produced music for a modern dance. Recital? Performance? Yeah, for performance, like it stood good. And so yeah, I was practicing half a year and after this half a year I was totally fucked up because in the day I was studying and in the night I was producing and it didn't work. It works okay for one or two months, but then... you feel not good because you know it is not good what you're doing to yourself and the performance in Stuttgart was very well, was quite well and I'm doing it now since six years or five years, five years I'm doing this performance in Stuttgart now once a year. I'm doing it all time with my project here today. a project which has released on Buzz and Fly and Philpod, some house stuff. Modernist is on 108 BPMs, so it's very, very slow. And in that time, it was not the... kind of music to release. Like this very slow stuff and yeah, I'm very happy that I can play it now. How much are you DJing? I saw you play Trailer Park but I don't know how much you're playing otherwise DJing wise. I'm very very bad in putting it out on MySpace and Facebook. I can't feed Myspace and stuff like this. I have a partner now who's working there for me and I'm working as well on this size but it's very hard for me to update all this. You have a few things going on. I'm very sorry. I play two times in a month. I play not much. but now it's a bit more at the moment, but yeah, mostly I play in house. techno stuff. Also I play with Federleicht. Federleicht was playing in a DJ set last week. We played at MIGZ in Berlin here. So there we played straight techno. And two days ago I played on Saturday and now on Wednesday I'm playing a funk set here in Berlin as well. When I saw you play Trailer Park it was quite varied. It seemed like you were playing phone and Pep Now and House and all sorts of things. You were there? Yeah. Oh, great! I was. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see that. No, it's fine. Oh, you listened? You listened to the set? Yeah. It seemed like a lot of your favorites as well. if I can say one of my favorites I'll sugar mine it I started with Sugar Minute and I love his music, his vibe. It had really hit me that he died now, two months or three months ago. And I started my set at Trailer Park with a Sugar Minus song. And then I moved to house music as well. You said you were affected by Sugar's death. In a recent email we have, you also uh mentioned that roger chapman had recently died and i find it i guess he's a vocalist right and i'm wondering if there are other vocalists i assume he's an influence on your vocal style what you're trying to do. Are there other vocalists that you kind of listen to? Yeah, there are. Sugar Minot, Tiki Man. First of all, Tiki Man. Because he had really given me the breath to go more deeper with... this rhythm and sound and chain reaction music so he was it was a very important thing and then Leroy Hudson sure I love Leroy He's amazing. And Lonnie Listensmith. It's more instrumental, but it's a kind of breathing as well. And then Curtis Mayfield. Very soulful singers. Yeah, soulful singers. Roger Chapman could be a bit more. But also if I'm looking to my tracks I think there is a there is a own playful joyful note in it that you feel you feel in a playful situation just I have fun, I have a lot of fun. If I'm singing and if I can share the music with you. I hope to bring it further and I don't know any singer who is doing it like this. But these are my influences and I think... They have not this kind of... but they have a lot of joy. I mean, Curtis is so real. He's so boom and then Leroy has so much style, so amazing. And Sugar Minute has a kind of technique. I like. It's his own technique. There's no... never... You can only hear it once. And I like this kind of technique. He has developed his own vocal techniques. Yeah, it's... And Roger Chapman is a bit too much for me. But he's... I like him. It's too much. Do you feel like you have your own technique and that you people might be able to know that's "Glorion"? Is that the joy coming through? Yeah, hopefully. With the vocals, or rather the lyrics, are you writing stories that you feel like people... should be able to understand? Are you writing more about feelings so that people can get? make their own story from what you're saying, I guess. Take their own images from it. Maybe this is the more attractive, the second is the more attractive one. And it's, for me, lyrics, they have their own structure and they have their own presence. And you don't need to understand them. And there is maybe... You don't need to understand them, you just have to get them. However you like, you have to get them. And you can work with it, you can live with it. And then you just... deeper in it and maybe then you can read something. You post the lyrics to some of your songs on the website which I found interesting. And you also said that with the album that you wanted people to get the CD to read some of the things inside, the liner notes. Yes, with Hatikva it was for us an important thing to... show the relationship of the lyrics itself and the music and to expand how you can get in touch with the song. Maybe sometimes you'll get in touch with the lyrics. How about it? I mean just club music if you release a single that you can't get in touch with the with the lyrics I'm just planning to make it possible that the lyrics from for example here today modernist single I do like the lyrics and maybe that the lyrics can be readable for some people. I'm just planning maybe putting out a little book or stuff like this where someone gets his impressions of the songs and reactions and impressions putting in with the lyrics in combination with that there is a communicative situation also in the book but it's not yeah because the communicative situation It's the sense why you are interested, why it's interesting for me to put vocals in it. Sure. It's not like putting out a message and you get it and blah, blah, blah. No, it's just... It's the start of a conversation. Thank you. It's just this little start. Okay. Thank you. That's perfect.
