Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. In the late 90s, electronic music still felt very much like the future. abilities were endless. This was captured in many ways, and one of the most important was a collection of festivals around the world that sought to showcase the intersection of music, art, and various other disciplines. Among the longest running of such festivals is Berlin's Club Transmedial. We caught up recently with one of its founders Jan Rolf in advance of its latest edition to talk about how hard it is even for a festival of its stature to continue to exist in the city. Tell me about the beginning of the festival, you know, what was the circumstances? Yeah, the main point is we never intended to do a festival of course, so the fact is... me and some others. I mean at the beginning it was Mark Weiser from Rechenzentrum in Lilleben. Also at that time Rechenzentrum, now he's more on his solo parts, visual artist. And then Tim Ringewald who is another Yeah, protagonist of let's say Berlin Club visuals. Okay, we all worked in the nightlife somehow doing stuff, organizing or even behind the bar or whatever, doing decorations and so on. And I'm also a visual artist and I had my studio was quite a large thing in an old rundown factory. And so every second week we would do some kind of listening space with more ambient electronic music and some artistic decoration or kind of installations each time. So that was the time, '97, '96. when we had this second wave of ambient music somehow, kind of post-industrial ambient that really inspired us. And especially here in Berlin, we had so much space that there were kind of plenty of, yeah, let's call it venues, but they weren't commercial venues or something like that. They tried to set up alternative listening environments somehow that would fuse visual arts and music. And we found that really inspiring and we thought there would be many, many people involved there, or there are many, there have been many people involved. that actually reach out to a more diverse audience because in their biographies and in their artistic practice it's also more diverse. It's not just music, it's not just art, it's not just nightlife. It's so many things combined. And so... Yeah, we kind of proposed actually to Transmediale Festival that we could do some kind of listening art hybrid intermedial space for one time paralleling the festival. So Transmediale was already going on and you, your club Transmediale. Exactly. Transmediale exists for about 25 years. Well, next year will be the 25th year. And it started off as a video festival, actually. It was an offspring from the Berlinale, the Berlin Film Festival, when video art kind of... claimed to be independent. And then it slowly transformed into a media arts festival and they changed name to Transmediale in I think '97 or something. So making a claim again that they would now embrace the totality of electronic arts and digital arts, but they missed music completely. There was no sound, no music, nothing. And I was a visitor of the festival and I had some friends working there and so I just approached them, made this proposal. They said fine, it's cool, but we don't have money of course, we have some space. So I looked at the space, it was awful. Because we wanted to do something that has a social value as well, somehow kind of a social situation with some intensity. We decided to do it on our own at Maria Mosbanoff which just had opened for the first time. So it was another one, not the one we have now, different building. And Mark Weiser just started to do the booking for Mariamos Bonofon. So, yeah, we made this first festival for people together and it was kind of a success. Of course, we had mostly local people at that time, but not only. Who were some of the artists that were involved in that first edition? Well, let me recall. There was, for example... Mono Lake already, I think. He's a frequent guest, really. There was Kammerflimmer Kollektief, I don't know if you know. There was an early project of Antje Krajefux, AGF. There were some noise musicians from the Netherlands. "Gum" or kind of noise. It's more like digital, abstract, more as the noton type of actually. And column one is another kind of performance electronic music collective from Berlin. Well, who else? I'm sure there were much more. It's really far away now. Of course, there were already names that are still in the loop and we still work with, like Mononake and others. What was the response? to the first edition? Was it quite immediate that people were like: "Wow, this is finally something like this has happened"? Yeah, actually, yeah. Of course, I mean, the combination with Transmediale is an international festival. Already, immediately. brought in a lot of international professionals, so to say, from various disciplines. And this really worked well, they really enjoyed it, as if they were waiting for something like that. And this combination of visual arts, visuals, video and sound really, I think, was to the point at that time, you know, and also, of course... beginning of one of the early times of really real-time laptop performers and so on. So we got a really good impressive feedback and that really made us continue and so the next year we did it again at another space and same story we thought this would be the last time we do it you know it's just for fun and it worked out pretty well it was quite crazy actually it wasn't. I think it was the 12th floor of the High-rise at Alexanderplatz, which is now, of course, some office space. And we had the old concierge, you know, what's this word in English? from the GDR time still down on the ground floor, sitting in a little glass box all night, you know, all these people going in and out. Yeah, and then so gradually it evolved to become an independent festival really step by step. And we never had funding at the beginning, of course, we did it all just as you organize a party. And only in the year 2003. we made our first applications to get some public funding and really slowly decided to make this something that should last a bit. What was the decision behind that? Was it just ambition that we wanted it to be something bigger? Something that was going to continue? Well, it wasn't so much about bigger, it was about... quality, you know. Needed a bit more budget to get the organization really going and to get all these details and to be able to have proper hospitality and have proper hotel and all that stuff. And also to pay yourself, of course, for doing that. And no, I mean, we were still... mostly driven by a kind of mission, I would say, right? So we very much believe in the fact that... you know, club culture as we experienced it in the 90s really is a hybrid space where so many things can come together and pretty much off the beaten tracks, you know, not only aesthetically, but also in the way people behave socially. And we found that was a very good space for presenting art. basically and of course the club environment is always an intermediate environment so intermediate art is kind of logical and i mean it happens everywhere in the world that music and mostly video or then interactive stuff or whatever computer-based things really kind of fuse together. So at that time in the early days of Club Transmediala, I mean around 2000, this was kind of a hard thing to do. It was a promise which not really had... been fulfilled. But this is something else to talk about. But yeah, we really had a mission and we wanted to, I don't know, to create really... It was always not only about the program and the art in itself, it was also about creating situations where people would exchange in a different way and come together in a kind of density but in a very informal way. And this was the driving force really behind the festival and the kind of alternative to what we experienced when we went to other festivals and other art events and stuff like that. What other festivals were you going to that may have been an inspiration or... an inspiration in a good way or an inspiration in a bad way like this could be we could be doing something that builds on whatever this is was there anything around that time that you were looking at and saying huh to be honest when we when we started the whole we didn't have any perspective outside of Berlin. It was the first time I think, yeah, I mean in 2001 actually, the year we couldn't do a festival, Mark was invited to Mootech, who started in 2000 I think. And he came back from MUTEC and he said "Oh, they're kind of doing something similar" and it was kind of inspiring and he saw a lot of artists he thought would be really interesting and so on. And this was then the starting point really where we started creating some kind of connections to other festivals and really get to acknowledge what other people do and kind of... exchange. So then in 2002 we invited Alain Mongeau from MUTEC and some of his community members, you know, Erich Mattson was there, Harkufen was there, that day and so on, to make a night in Coton's Mediata for the first time. And ever since we kind of continued this exchange. So this is definitely kind of... good input. This was inspiring I think for both sides because we're quite opposite in some ways. In what ways? Yeah, I mean, you know, Montreal and Berlin have lots in common also Mutec and CTM have lots in common but then I think the range, the openness towards kind of, you know... more stuff that is a bit further outside of the music world is stronger at CTM but I must admit Mutex kind of developed pretty much also now they have more and more you know installations in the city or nowadays they collaborate with the museum, with modern art or whatever. But in the beginning they didn't do stuff like that at all. It was really purely music and mostly beat driven music. They had these AV visions always, of course. Of course, there was always both. But my impression was always that we kind of are a bit more willing to... you know, enter into territory that would be more surprising and maybe also annoy some people. We would do, let's say, a minimal techno floor and on the second floor we would have primitive rock and roll. Something like that. Which is a little different. I think Mutek wouldn't have done something like that. And in fact they haven't done it. So this thing that we have... more the overall wider perspective on music culture and not only about certain types of club music. Why? Are you so willing to annoy? What is the driving force? I don't find it annoying personally. No, no. I mean, we always do what we really like. I think that's very important. It's a very subjective approach. And of course, everyone picks up what's in the air and you read the papers and you check the internet and all that. So, of course, you follow also the hypes and all that. Nevertheless, you have to do what really kicks your own ass somehow, and we did, and we still do. So when we do something like that, we take the risk that it annoys people, but actually we are not annoyed at all. We love it. I mean, it's a good thing if a festival or any type of art, culture, event... also wants to challenge their audience. It keeps things in motion, it keeps things fresher, but of course it inspires also kind of new... Yeah, I don't know. Knowledge, discourse, whatever. People dive into something they wouldn't do otherwise because often they're really reluctant to go to something they don't really know. But if you create combinations that kind of draws them in and then you put something on the table they don't know, then you get them, maybe. Maybe not, but so it's a try, you know, and I think that's really important. From what we experienced, most people really, really, really like that. They enjoy it, absolutely. It's great fun in many ways. Even if you say, okay, next time I wouldn't go to something like that again. But still, it's the memory. It's something that triggers something. I don't know, stories, but let's say one guy who was a conference speaker at Transmediale and who would really only listen to Bach and stuff like that and classical music. And he was there at this night where we had Stephen O'Malley from Sun and so on with the Burial Chamber Trio and he was completely blown away. And he was one hour talking into my ear because... he found that really, really amazing. But at the end he said, but I will never listen to this type of music. So I think that's good. You can only change them so much. I don't want to change them necessarily. I just want to, you know, break things up a bit. I think it's very boring if you give people only what they want or expect. It's much better for everyone if this doesn't happen. When I was talking to Alain a couple of years ago, He mentioned that one of the struggles that they had with Mutech for a while was with the funding, is talking to city officials for something who have no idea about electronic music and no idea about club culture. Is that something you've run into in Berlin as well? trying to convince certain people along the way that you know this is something worthy of their time and their money absolutely it's same here maybe works so I mean okay the specifics of Berlin there's many factors once Berlin is bankrupt since many years so they get money from of the federal states of Germany. That creates a big pressure politically to first of all save some money somewhere, cut the expenses, and on the other hand give the money to specific things that are widely acceptable. Because otherwise, I mean, yeah, Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg and whoever will kind of raise their... word and they do and this is one thing then the other thing is the same like in Montreal for sure that politicians are not really well informed about specific subcultures or cultures or kind of fringe cultures or even if they're not fringe but they're youth cultures or whatever it's still it's far away I mean it's a generation gap still our mayor is about 50 something that's not too old he claims to be a party man but still I bet you know he is really far away from from what we do. And he's not informed, of course, and all the others are not really informed. And it's a hard job to inform them about what this is, why it is important, why it's something that we should support, and what's the potential of it. So we try to do that, but in Berlin especially it's even hard to get through to those people and be able to get the chance to explain what you're doing. Because there is such a big pool of cultural protagonists, producers, organizations, venues, whatsoever, and they share. very limited amount of resources and it's kind of a shark's hunt. Everyone's fighting, everyone who has something is really really fighting not to lose it, everyone who has nothing is really fighting to get something. And everyone is really trying to involve kind of pressure groups and you know the whole business. Fact is that since the fall of the wall or maybe even since the late 70s, early 80s, I mean I'm not a historian but so far that I know, there has hardly been any new found institutions. There is a couple of big institutions and smaller ones, they get their money every year and not being evaluated and then that's it. And there is no room for progression, there is no room for change. So if there is new players or relatively new players like us, as I said, almost 13 years. You're still a new player. Yeah, I'm still a new player. And it's almost impossible to get some kind of... institutional funding that would enable you to kind of plan ahead into the future because you know you get some money for the next five years or something. So the only option you have is get some money every year by making a whole bunch of applications for kind of project money and this is of course very unsafe, you never know. get it or not there's juries involved juries are independent so even if there's politically political will from some yeah let's say from the cultural senate of berlin or from others it's still not guaranteed that you have a chance to get this money and then Another layer is that it's very convenient in a way to have all these precarious cultural workers in the city. They do a great job, you know, they're really committed and they do many many many things, smaller level, bigger level, and they create a landscape that is highly attractive internationally. It's one of the big reasons why Berlin is such a... magnet, so to say. Why are you here? Yeah, exactly. That's why you are here. And there is a common idea in cultural politics with many politicians that they think once you give money to certain initiatives and you bring them on a safer side, they will kind of lose. some of their energy and commitment and impetus and so on. And on the other hand, so quality will get lower, but we have to pay for it. So why not not pay for it and have the better quality? And this of course only goes... along with a second idea which is that once one of these organizations initiatives people is kind of worn out it doesn't matter because there's someone ready to take over so that's a kind of a cynical approach it kind of hits some reality in a way, you know, because somehow it's the truth that is the next one, for a while at least, you know, but how long is a while? So this is a big question to me. I mean, what's sustainability? Will Berlin be like that in 10 years? And can we maybe make it to stay interesting and attractive and really kicking and alive? Or, I don't know. My belief is... that actually this is not an automatism, that a city like Berlin will always stay as attractive as it is now if you don't kind of take care of certain things. So I'm quite angry. I think this is the wrong perspective that politics are. taken here at the moment in many regards. Giving all the money they have to long-standing institutions and really don't take care of all these free independent cultural activities that are taking place. But then on the next level they always market. these independent initiatives and make them kind of the key characteristics of the city. Berlin is free, you know, Berlin is young, Berlin is fresh, Berlin is kind of... I don't know... What's the English word for that? So when they're selling the city to... Outsiders, they say, "We'll look at these places that we don't give any money to." They're doing these amazing things. This is one thing they do say that to everyone. So buy your playing cricket, come to Berlin, enjoy your trip. And they tell it to investors also. They say, come here, make your headquarter of your company here because your employees are going to have this great context, you know, for living and culture and blah, blah, blah. But exactly those investments. of course destroy most of these things and this is not something again naturally you know it's something you could steer you could change that you could say of course we need people to invest money in Berlin and so on but we could kind of give directions of it you know we don't have to sell them exactly this piece of ground or we don't have to you know options for kind of ensuring that both things can happen on the longer term and then kind of maybe feed into each other in a different way but now it's just competition and it's based on false assumptions it's weird it's not a funny thing And so in this climate somehow we are also stuck in the middle. We have friends in politics, we have people who ignore us and are just not informed. Of course there are many who think that something like this is not really important enough to assign it money in these difficult times and there are others who want to and so on. But all in all, it's this general climate of just let things go. I think the girl in cultural politics has one prime agenda, and this is to keep things calm. And once things are calm, it's good. But this doesn't mean that you develop anything. It's just like modus vivendi somehow. And for me it was kind of very disappointing to see that you think politics means the will or the mission or at least the ambition to develop stuff, to change things, you know, in whatever direction. It doesn't mean for the good, but change something. I can't really see that. But Berlin has changed. Berlin changes. In the past 10 years. Very much, yeah. What are some of the biggest changes, if they're not in what you're talking about, to the city that you've seen since the festival began? How has that changed the festival in turn? Well, okay, we all know what has changed, no? I mean, Berlin has become very, very international, which is great. And Berlin has embarked on a journey, so to say, to become one of many other more or less stereotypical... Metropoles, to my opinion. Of course, you know, luckily, or, yeah, luckily, I mean, every metropole in the world has kind of an original character that you can't so easily twist and kind of level. there will of course always be something which is the spirit of Berlin. But on the other hand, when I look at what measures have been made, really, by politics, by economics and so on, to develop the city, then I just see the same and the same wherever other cities would go. Is it Barcelona or is it London? Parasite. It's always the same stereotypes. All these cities compete with each other, always on the same fields. I don't know. What should I say? I mean, the internationality of Berlin is a great thing. I enjoy it, and this has changed the festival a bit, I think. has been international from the beginning, also attracted people that just came here for the festival and still do. So it's not only about the internationality of Berlin that is already in place, but of course the fact that so many musicians came here to live here, to work here, so many labels, so many other types of cultural... activists somehow widened the pool of people we could work with, the people we could engage to contribute to the festival and so on and so on. So it widened the networks and this was an interesting and a good thing of course for the festival. One of the things, talking about widening networks, there's an organization that connects a lot of different festivals together that just started a couple of years ago. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, because from all this, you know, what we're talking about here, MUTAC, CTM, the funding issues and all that stuff. Over the years, in exchanging with other festivals, we realized that there is a whole bunch of festivals that started about the same time in the early... 2000s or late 90s even and have some kind of similar aims here and there or kind of engage in similar kinds of music and we decided to make this network kind of more informal loose network it's called ICAS International Cities of Advanced Sound and the idea is as with every network It's exchanging information, it's exchanging knowledge, it is sharing productions, it's just meeting up, having a good time of course. And it's also trying to support each other in this political arena, giving more rights to every one of the members of the network and also doing some kind of... joint applications, co-productions and all that stuff on an organisational level. And so we did actually get some money now from the EU, from the European Union, through the network of, I think it's now eight festivals from Europe. So ICAS is international, there's also South America, North America. Now we're going to have a partner also in Australia and so on, but now there's a second layer, so to say, which is the European part of this network. And this year at the festival we actually have our first co-production. that are kind of born through this network. It must be interesting for the first time to be working with other festivals more closely. I mean, obviously you want to be sharing information, you want to be... figuring out how to get bigger grants from different organizations and that's only possible if you join up but at the same time you also want to have your independence you don't want to necessarily have the same lineup as the festival in Poland or something like this. Yeah, that's for sure. There's a certain risk here. It's true. I mean, if close to the circle of people share the same information, the same pool of information, of course you can expect that something will resemble in the outcome. But then, I mean, it's many people. It's not about 70. people involved, individuals. And of course every one of these people has wider networks as well that feed into the network. So it's quite a huge resource and it stretches over different cultures and continents and so on. So I think there is a lot of diversity in this network. It's more, I think it's even, I mean, apart from this network thing, you know, the fact that we all read the same sources of information. basically. And everyone who does a festival has a look what other festivals do and so on and we all work with the same booking agents, maybe even worse. I mean, there's not so much diversity in the world of booking agents, for example. There's quite a few big companies that have compiled so many of artists of a certain field and so on. So I think that the risk or the danger that festivals kind of are... too similar comes from many directions and this network thing is just a little tiny drop in this field but this is something we want to reflect also in the network and I think here This is the good thing, you know, it turns around. Because we have founded this thing also to have some kind of self-reflection on what we are doing and why we are doing it. And actually this project that we have now with the EU money, it's a five-year project. has this as a very strong component to really analyze how festivals work, what's their mechanics and so on, and make some propositions also for the future, how could we deal with these issues. So this is something that will go on, it just starts, you know, it's a five-year term, so we will see where we end up then, but definitely this is very important to... to be aware of these issues because it's true it can be so boring i mean but when i look at our icus network especially all these indoor festivals like mutec like like many others i find there's much greater diversity and there's also especially more openness towards fringe or kind of rare corners of music culture or the yeah where music and media cultures mix and so on. Then when I look at the summer festivals, I think the summer festivals are really, really worse. I mean, they have all the same lineups. There's these bands touring and everyone books them. Some have some exclusivity and others don't and so on. So it's clearly about some kind of locality. It means, okay, this festival is at this specific place and that's why this specific audience goes there and this other one is somewhere else and they can do the same because they don't share the audience necessarily. So it depends really. You have to reflect that in your approach. We don't consider ourselves so much as a local festival in that sense that we really want to attract a specific... informed audience from around the world. But then on the other hand we are very local because the festival is very much, I would say, shaped or colored or something by our Berlin experience. and spirit and surroundings and way of doing things and so on. And I think everyone feels that. So apart from the program, there's another level of diversity. You talked about the summer festivals versus indoor festivals. And correct me if I'm wrong, but you've really opened up to a lot of different... venues over the years maybe it was a little bit more localized to one thing in the beginning I guess that also helps in sort of being able to program you know this will work in this space and this will work in another space and yeah I think it's quite unique to bring all these venues together and It enables us to be very specific with our programmation, which is a good thing and something also very important when it comes to the fabric of a festival that you don't think in fixed formats. that you repeat every year again and again and then it kind of influences which artist you have to choose. It's the other way around or it's kind of a mix. You have inspiration from the space but you also have certain ideas about artists, about combination of artists and you look for the right space where you can do that. So it's both. And you should kind of be flexible with this. And I think this is what Club Transmediale has done successfully over the years, to never really completely formalize, you know, and kind of become the same thing every year. But yeah, I mean, a new venue is also a challenge for festival organizers to make something from it. And these people from the venues, they give in also quite some substantial input. which is a great thing. One of the things you do yourself is quite a bit of visual art. I was looking on your website and you've done... number of exhibitions. What sort of things do you do? It's painting or...? Yeah, I wouldn't call it painting, I call it drawing, even though it's mostly made with computers, sometimes also stuff by hand. It's always a bit hard to talk about it, especially now that, I mean... Gradually I was kind of eaten up by my festival obligations. So I think these days I'm more a cultural organizer, curator than I am an artist. If you can say so. It's just when I look at how I distribute my time then at the moment this is a bit on a halt, on a pause. But it's a bit an antipode for me, the opposite to what I do with the organizing and with the music side of things. This is something that is absolutely not social. I do it just with myself, for myself. It's very much about some kind of imagination. It's not at all very conceptual or it's not very involved in intermedia or in all these kind of things that we deal with with the festival. It's much more... exploring my own psychic whatever. You said it's mostly obligations that have sort of taken up your time. Do you wish you could go back to it every once in a while? Is it something you want to explore more? Yeah, I mean sure, sure. It's this, yeah, we live in a world of contradictions, you know, I'm full of contradictions and one of them is this, I want to do this festival, I enjoy it a lot, it's my social side, so to say, and I need it also, I think, for that part. to be a social being and on the other side I would like to explore these other worlds with my art but it seems more and more that the two things together don't really fit. I was hoping it would when I started both. But yeah, I mean it's a fight of resources really and these days with this festival as we talked about earlier it's just such a big work to get it going and to sustain it and to get it funded and so on that this is really more than a full-time job and I fear that... Some decisions have to be taken for the moment at least, you know, it never means that it has to be like that forever, of course. When the festival began there was a certain time in electronic music where it seemed like the context was right for these festivals to begin, the turn of the century. Yes. Things have changed. Do you do the festival for the same sort of reasons and are you booking, I guess are you looking at the same sort of... ideas when you're programming things as you did 10 years ago? Yeah. Sorry, big question. Well, I think again it's a yes and no. I mean some things that really were important to us when we started still are and kind of inform what we're doing and some things really have changed it's true For us it was the moment in 2005 actually where we decided to rename the festival from Electronic Music Festival to Festival for Adventurous Music because we felt that electronic alone wouldn't be appropriate anymore because for once electronic and digital means have kind of fused into one. basically every action that artists take, so to say. I mean, every kind of production. It is also an electronic or a digital production, no matter if you hear it consciously at the end or not. Even if it's just an acoustic recording, it's very much... shaped also by the recording devices and the post-production stuff and so anyway so that was clear that that this doesn't make much sense and at the same time there was this backlash where people were kind of fed up with this pure electronic music and they wanted to have this mix of like sweaty handmade in combination with and so on and then also it became clear that of course both worlds if you want to say that have very interesting things to offer sound signatures performance modes and so on so Being open to all kinds of music was the thing to do and we did. So this is what we do today as well. It can be completely handmade, it can be absolutely synthetic, it doesn't matter. As long as it's a daring approach to music or to sound. And this is the continuation in a way. that's the continuous part. I mean in the early 2000s of course we and others were inspired by what was done because it was new, it was daring, it was proposing something and it was also trying to connect kind of an aesthetic experience to some kind of discourse that would go beyond music and this is something we try to continue but the discourse has changed, it's not the same. for us. So we have to find different themes, topics, different connections and we do, I think, with the program that we offer each year. Was there an artist that you feel like you booked in 2005 or 2006 or something like this that you felt like, wow? We never would have booked, you know, X five years ago when we began or something like this. Yeah. 2006, we had a performance by Limpe Fuchs, who is... She is now about late 60s, early 70s. A German musician and performer. In the 70s she had a project, I can't really recall the name now, but she and her husband and her kids and a donkey would drive through Germany with a truck. a truck tour actually, you know, where the farmers use and live from playing music everywhere, no matter where, and you just do that for a long, long, long time. Doing this kind of strange, you know, secondary crowd-rocky, but then at the same time really serious sound research. type of music. And she then later on developed all these sound objects which are from metal and wood and stuff like that and she's very careful and she has a great attention to detail and to sound and a great knowledge. So we invited her. to make a performance which was really only her on stage, no microphones, with her weird objects kind of pushing them around, circling them around, hitting a little bit here and there and stuff like that. So things like this we would have never thought of in 2000, for example, when we thought we do a kind of festival about electronic music. Computers it's about to synthesize this kind of thing one of the things I read just yesterday's interview with Karsten Nicolai, I think he said that It's much harder nowadays because computers have caught up. It's much harder to make them make mistakes in the way that they were, you know, making mistakes 10 years ago. The software and the hardware is more stable. I wonder if, you know, that's also kind of... connection to that change is why you know what was once quite futuristic and strange has become. quite a bit more commonplace so you're looking in different places for these things. Yeah, definitely. I mean, of course, the aesthetics and these purely digital aesthetics like Austin Motown, for example, celebrated for quite a while. It has become a real commonplace. It's not alienating people much anymore. There's the danger that this becomes kind of appropriated very smoothly. You need the friction, you need the breaks, so you have to look for where can you find it. And yeah, I mean, of course, glitch, glitch music or whatever you call it, the attempt to work with the digital era. was an attempt but as many things it became kind of a formula in itself again so quickly so that you couldn't just continue that way. But the same ideas are around in many versions, you know, in all types of music, not only in digital music. So there is a lot of strategies and ways to kind of... engage the materiality of your machines, of your music devices, of your instrument to enter a realm where it's kind of uncertain and where you can find some kind of free chance that could challenge yourself and the listener and also the way of looking at things, you know, also in the wider terms. So I think that is still as up-to-date as always. I mean, look at the 60s and the 70s, look at the people like David Tudor and stuff like that. I mean, all these ideas developed in that time, they are not outdated at all. We just have to renew every time. our aesthetic, let's say, the way we can bring these things into the world, you know, with these actual contemporary devices. ♪ ♪ you
