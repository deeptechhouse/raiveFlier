Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. This is our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. So this week's exchange is with James Lavelle, a DJ, recording artist and label boss with an incredible story to tell. We were speaking shortly after the release of The Man from Moax, the feature-length documentary that brings Lavelle's story to life with unflinching honesty. We follow Lavelle through the thrills and spills of his long career. touching on the rise and fall of his highly influential label, Mo-wax, and the combustible creative relationships that drove "Uncle", his main musical project. Throughout the film, we see Lavelle on an emotional roller coaster, navigating the extreme highs and lows of being caught up in the music industry. The 10-year process of making the film has taken something of a personal toll on the Vell, which is where we began this extended conversation, recorded at his home in South London earlier this month. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The Exchange with James Lavelle is up next. Okay, so we're talking a few days after the film came out. I guess I just wanted to firstly say that I found it very compelling, quite emotionally affecting at times. I think you deserve credit for allowing such an honest portrayal of your life. So yeah, big up for that. I was wondering how you are feeling now it's been released and it's out in the world. I'm just glad it's over. Okay. It's been 10 years of my life. I just sort of feels like I can move on now from it. Yeah, to be honest with you, I'm just sort of glad it's done. Just want of relief. Yeah, I just wanted it out. It's been 10 years of sort of the strange journey and strange. thing you know whilst it is a sort of document of one's life it's also you know it has its it has its agenda and its narrative and to make it into the film it is and and that's fine but i just sort of feel like i just you know it finished a long time ago as far as the what the film concluded with and but it's sort of been hanging over me for a long time and i just kind of i'm just glad it's out i'm glad that um generally the reaction for this sort of strange film is, is, is being positive. And I just, for me, it's just sort of allows me to sort of mentally move on really. Yeah. I got it. You know, it's a bit of a kind of, it kind of puts a sort of lid on a box really. Yeah. I understand. Soon you mentioned to, I think it was Clash that you felt like there was potentially an imbalance. in the film in your eyes maybe I don't know if in balance I just think maybe skewed negative or no I just think that it focuses on certain things so if you want to say it's a great film about my career I'd say it has a perspective of one's career, but it's not a definitive film of my career. I mean, you know, I did, you know, there's nothing really about particularly focused on DJing in the world that I played, you know, from when I worked with Sasha or Dove Fire or was a resident of Womb or Avalon or Space or any of those things. It doesn't go into... particularly the art world that I've worked in or the collaborations, particularly with, you know, a lot of other, you know, outside of music, it focuses very much on a sort of DJ shadow. It has a foot very much in a certain period of time that then kind of expands over that documentary, you know, having... Paul Bradshaw or Giles Peterson talk about war stories is, to me, is silly because those records weren't made for that. that genre of DJs so their perspective has no real meaning to me not in any negativity towards Giles or Paul Bradshaw or the fact that you know it focuses on a lot of broken relationships but I but they don't focus on relationships that have continued which have lots of relationships and I think people have to remember that when you're working in very intense periods of time creatively um you're in the studio seven days a week 24 hours a day with people things get heated yeah um and you know just look at any any creative bands or whatever there's very few bands that actually survive long periods of time i think that it focuses very much on the dj shadow agenda and this reconciliation with shadow you even though I'd reconciled with Shadow way before Meltdown. Got it. And also, whilst I totally respect and admire Shadow, it's not a relationship that is that... meaningful me moving in my life right now i don't i'm not i'm not um we don't share the same goals in the music we make uh we haven't had a um an intimate relationship for many years it doesn't mean that we have a negative relationship but you know it's kind of like you're focusing it's like when you focus on that period of moax it's like If you imagine everybody focusing on you being at school or university and how many people, when 20 years later, are best friends with everybody they went to university with or school. Not that many. Some are, but most people aren't. I think it's just that it gives a certain narrative. Yeah, I got it. And I think that it also... has this habit of playing that you know it will say that the consequent the subsequent records after science fiction were less successful which is actually not true because never neverland became one of the biggest electronic records of its time you know sasha's remix of an estate was the biggest record dance record of that year and that record outside of Universal because we relicensed it to the global underground became a global phenomenon. War Stories whilst it might not have sold, no record is going to sell the physical amount of of science fiction. The New Arctic Monkeys record, which is the biggest vinyl record, didn't sell as many vinyl records as science fiction because 1998 was the biggest year ever of record sales. You know, there has never been a bigger year since on recorded history. Digital came into play. And what it doesn't talk about is things like, well, War Story is actually financially the most successful record I ever made. And it was the most licensed record that year in the world. So it was, you know, it wasn't about physical sales anymore because that wasn't the industry. It was about it being licensed film and television. And actually what the actual, so if you sort of do it in a more of a, you know, it's like saying is Avengers bigger than The Wizard of Oz? It's not because one in three people in America went to see Wizard of Oz. But there were less people. So it's inflation, you know, it's like all those things. So I get a little bit frustrated sometimes at the fact that I get frustrated sometimes in the sort of language that is used. And the fact that it centers on certain characters, which were very much part of my life. 20 years ago, but aren't so much and haven't been for a long time now. Hence why I wanted people like Josh Homme in the documentary and Nathan Coley, because those are people that my, those relationships are what are much more contemporary and influential in my day-to-day life now than let's say Straight No Chaser or Swifty or, you know, DJ Shadow, you know. but it tells a story. Sure. And it has an act, you know, it's formatted in a very traditional way. But if it wasn't, would people be watching it? Do you know what I mean? I think that, you know, I'd love to think that, you know, I'd love a film that was just purely based on one's creativity and not all the other stuff. Would people be as interested? I doubt it. In the same way that, you know, when you, for me, I like Hearts of Darkness. I like some kind of monster. I like Dig. You know, they don't resonate in the same way that a BBC, the Daft Punk documentary resonates, even though it's fascinating watching a Daft Punk documentary. It's, it's, it's, it's all LCD sound system, but they're not, it's not like watching a movie. It's, it's a kind of, it's a slightly more anarchy view of. Do you know what I mean? Or who invented the 808 or the Fender Stratocast? I mean, they're fascinating. I love documentaries like that because of information, but they're not documentaries that necessarily have that kind of cinematic quality. And even the MIA documentary that's out. at the moment or about to come out, it kind of follows a similar path because, and therefore is more engaging as a film. Even though I know from friends, I don't know her, but I know very close friends of her that she was, found it difficult to engage with. And I, and of course, seeing yourself, seeing yourself. on screen regardless of the subject matter is can be difficult enough i mean most active friends of mine don't watch their movies it's their job that you're in the moment and i think A lot of what they've taken from in the moment is the low, not all of it, you know, but some of it is quite the lows to accentuate certain points. They're not focusing. There was a lot of good times during those periods as well. I just think it needs, but it wouldn't say the same kind of story. And I'm not trying to be negative about that. I just think that, you know, it's a film. And in a weird way, I look at it like. I'm a second person in myself. It's not me. It is me, but it's not me because you haven't got everything else. You know, you're taking snippets of things and editing them together. It's a version of you put together for narrative. Yeah, for a narrative. And that narrative is this extraordinary, you know, quick rise and then all the sort of the snowball effect after that. And yes, it did. And there were a lot of difficult times. But then that's what's resonating. So therefore, you know, and also I'm going to see probably more of the negative than the positive because I'm looking at myself. But what I found really interesting is that what I think generally people have found, as I've picked up on the positive rather than the negative, is that one, that time doesn't exist. So a lot of younger people are kind of like, wow, it's just like. you know, it's rock and roll, you live the rock and roll, you know, and, you know, it's like, that's the mystique of, that's the sort of the madness of rock and roll, and it doesn't really exist anymore. Not really. No. You know, you don't, You know, it does exist in the sense that people are still going out and doing drugs and doing fucked up crazy shit, but they're so closed doors about it because of social media that you're not going to see it. And yet, because we didn't have social media, there was a freedom that didn't exist then that I think you get. But with that, there was, you know, also there's a sort of... certain price to pay is that, you know, I think people are so, so conscious of every detail of what they do. And, and with DJing and musicians, like, you know, I know DJs, DJs who have been banned from festivals because they did a line of cocaine and got caught doing a line of coke. That wouldn't have happened 20 years ago. I mean, it was encouraged. and everybody and the people that are firing them for it were the people that were doing it then which is the irony of it but it's all about this clean cut and also in especially in electronic music in the DJ world there's so much money involved now you know Calvin Harris 46 million this year I mean it's you know it's I mean, I remember when Paul Oakenfold was getting paid 20 grand a gig and that was like, fuck me, you know, what are you doing? That was like mad. Now people are getting paid a million pounds. So the... You know, with that comes a different kind of industry. It necessarily has to be streamlined and professionalized. Everything's so clean and professionalized. But then on the other extreme, and to be honest with you, what did make, I sort of made peace with the film in a certain way. in this sort of like, what the fuck have I done? Kind of, I'm mad doing this. And oh my God, it is actually now out and it's, or it's coming out and there's posters and fucking interviews. And, you know, because before it was just this sort of ongoing thing that he never felt he was going to get finished. It was kind of like. Yeah, I'll do another interview. It's 10 years later, whatever. It's just, you know, it's not, that thing is not a physical thing for everybody else. It's that with Avicii, I think that kind of hit and struck a nerve for me. Because actually with all that cleanliness and all that money and all that. you know that's sort of the modern world we live in he you know what happened to him and I sort of look at myself and go well I did all that without anybody looking being around for me and any of those questions or those you know you couldn't talk about anxiety you know anxiety or or depression or or substance abuse or addiction or any of those things it was you just you just had to man up you know and I was a young kid who didn't really have the tools. You know, I was a pretty sensitive young person whose life was ripped up from underneath and when Moax, really everything just fell apart pretty much only a couple of years after it started because once A&M, once the deal with A&M finished, that was the end. And that was my life and it was everything, you know, and I was a 24-year-old kid. And you weren't given the tools or the support. You know, Steve Finer, who's in that documentary, he wasn't around. You know, they weren't around. They were, he was managing the All Saints and doing that. They weren't, they weren't. They also weren't really interested in what I was really trying to do, which was trying to create a kind of modern universe, which is. I think why the film resonates now in many ways is that is what I tried, what I was involved in and I was one of the sort of pioneers of was, has become the basis of the modern record business. Everybody collaborates. You know, Kanye doesn't make records to sell records. He makes records to sell sneakers. It's just that that's the cool end of it to get, you know, but really, you know, and I'm not saying that's not why he wants to make music. I'm not saying as an artistic thing, but if you're talking about business, he ain't making 500,000 pounds in a day selling a record. He's making that selling t-shirts. You know, the record serves as the kind of... is the glue for everything, is the sort of the backbone for everything else. It's the art. It's the art and it's the brand. You know, do you think that, you know, most of these people are making, you know, look, of course, if you're Drake or Calvin Harris and Spotify or whatever, you're making money. But that's also become a recent thing because the digital... era of music has only started to become transparently financial in the last couple of years. So I think that, you know, but what I was trying to do, people didn't understand and people weren't engaging in. And that was very difficult because I was sort of seen as this kind of mad eccentric kid. And I was, but the ideas that I had. not being egotistical or anything, but I mean, you know, it's great, even though I'd prefer it maybe if I was doing it now because I would have benefited financially from it, is that actually that those ideas have now resonated because that is what we... living now and that was the beginning of it just to pick up on something you said there about being this like mad eccentric kid uh one of the things that struck me pretty much throughout the film was just your energy levels and particularly in the beginning of the film when you were trying to infiltrate the hip-hop scene or just generally get a foothold in the industry What was driving that urgency? I mean, you just had like, at some points you just had this, I don't know, this energy about you in this presence where you're just like, I have to get shit done as quickly as possible. I mean, I just wanted to, I just, I just, I mean, I loved it. And I was, I was, it was, you know, it was a period where you, for whatever reason, you just make things happen. And it was, you know, it It was the most exciting thing ever. And I was naive, so I didn't have any boundaries. There was no consequence to your actions in the way that they are now. You know, you just went, you know, it was like live by the sword, die by the sword and kind of just get on. You know, you just did it. And as life goes on, you. learn by your mistakes or sometimes you learn by your mistakes but there was just you know it was a kind of It was a blank canvas. No fear? No fear. Well, I did have a lot of fear. I mean, it was an incredibly male, bullyish, laddy industry, and that was toxic and very hard to navigate because everybody was always 10 years older than you. I was bullied very badly. You know, the music, what I was... You know, we have, you know, you can, you know, things like resident advisor and, you know, pitchfork and these and well, things that have come from being online have grown up in a period where. the sort of the intellectuals have taken over you know the biggest people and you know the greatest artists and dancers are people like Fortet they're not Boyzone it's not Terry you know it's not football it's not lad culture it's it's geek culture when I saw it it wasn't it was the opposite huh Geek culture was indie music, was Radiohead, was bands like that. What dance music and electronic music and hip hop was street, rude boy, gangster, and it was football. And you had to navigate through that. And that was hard, you know, but it was also incredible. sort of way of learning and learning to deal with people and I was a middle class kid from Oxford so you're suddenly thrust into a very different environment and how to navigate that and It was a great internship in many ways. But I think the business is very different. You've got to remember, when Music Magazine started, I was hung because I dyed my hair. Now every DJ's got to dye... It's a fashion statement. It's a small personal expression. Yeah, sure. One of the things I wanted to pick up on with you was... the UK's relationship with hip-hop you know when things were really breaking here you obviously very invested in this scene from a pretty early age what was the process like for the UK absorbing and interpreting this music I'm really interested in when did you know imitation morph into innovation But I think it was like that from the beginning. I think so, yeah. Yeah, I mean, you know, you had bands like Stereo MCs were incredibly, you know, innovative. They were working with the Jungle Brothers. You had Moany Love. You had, you know, Moany Love cracked America, you know. You had the sound system scene, Soul to Soul, Massive Attack. I mean, you know, Soul to Soul, I know Puff Daddy when he did Mary Jo Blige. The basis of that was Soul to Soul, who's obsessed with Nelly Hooper. You know, records like Unfinished Sympathy, Blue Lines, you know. So I think the innovation has always been there. I think there was always, there was mimicking. And I think, but the scenes have, you know, English culture has also created more and more of its own identity within hip hop over the years, which then probably the big fundamental change with that was probably something like Dizzy Rascal. But I think that we, you know, at the beginning, I think, especially at the beginning, I think England was incredibly innovative in that way. But I think that hip-hop also went, started as a sort of New York thing, then became a global thing, and then went back to being a very... New York thing and then branched out sort of with LA and NWA and stuff like that. But it prominently been about one city for a very long time. And, you know, but, you know, there was, I think what was happening here, record labels like G Street. were really creative and influential things. I just think that for some reason that worldwide thing sort of started, stopped, and then kind of found its way again. And I think that's indicative of a lot of music. It was potentially helpful that sound system culture was kind of in the bloodstream here. But also don't forget that then hip-hop became something else here. Hip-hop became hardcore. You know, Liam Howlett, all those lot, they grew up on it. They started listening, they were listening to hip hop records. It wasn't, they didn't, they made, they invented hardcore and drum and bass, et cetera. Drum and bass, jungle. was a purely, it was a British take on hip hop. I think the thing was that you couldn't emulate necessarily the success or the style of it. We were obsessed with American rappers predominantly. And it went in a different way. And I think that that also had a lot to do with drug culture and raves and the fact that actually We're a lot freer than America was racially and culturally. We're a lot more, whilst we have, of course, lots of problems in that way. Our culture was a lot more integrated and things came together a lot more and other forms of music came out of that. So the initial thing of hip hop and collecting breaks and samples and all that stuff, that culture then became, you know, much more diverse. You know, whether it was, you know, Nightmares and Wax making Dexterous. I mean, George was a hip hop. DJs. Everybody were hip-hop DJs before. You know, everybody had grown up on hip-hop. And they'd all had their own UK hip-hop crews before. kind of doing this new form of music. But that was also because it was great to go out and dance and get off your head. Do you know what I mean? And so I think that the evolution of hip hop in the UK took different... different directions on one level it was the massive attacks the porter's heads the mo waxes the other direction was the metal heads the andy sees the prodigies do you know what i mean it's interesting i hadn't necessarily made that link before yeah yeah i mean you know amen brother all those records that they're records that were solved you know it was you know you've got to remember in sort of 88 89 when all that stuff happened The hip-hop records are quite aggressive. It was public enemy. Fast. You know, James Brown sampling, funky drummer, breakbeat records, but quite aggressive. If you listen to what then happened with the beginnings of drummer bass and British techno, and even British dance music, they were all very breakbeat-led. You know, it wasn't disco. England didn't make, we didn't make disco records. We made breakbeat records. Even if you listen to Gap Decor or records like that, they're breakbeat led. You know, they're not. Frankie Knuckles they're not and they're not Donna Summer they're not they're not so much those records they're not oh you know who's Paraglides Garage DJ you know they're not those weren't those weren't you know those weren't they wasn't emulating that they were There were street records made by street kids that had grown up on hip hop and created something different. And then you had something which went the other way, which was, you know, the things like Soul to Soul and Massive Attack, where they were taking those beats, but they were using love as reggae singers. You know, the lovers thing was a British thing. You know, that style of music was very much an English thing rather than even Jamaica. And so they would, you know, they'd get something like Shara Nelson, who was a lovers reggae singer, or that's what she'd grown up more on, and putting her over a hip hop. or slowing it all down and doing something where, to me, the greatest British hip-hop, there's a couple of early extraordinary British hip-hop records and I think that Blue Lines is probably at the top of the pyramid. But then go and listen to a record like the Syndicates album. That record is unbelievable. And if you listen to Modern Garage or you listen to Garage or you listen to even a lot of American R&B, contemporary R&B, that record was doing it way before they were. You know, America, it was actually R&B. It was kind of, it was New Jack Swing. It was... It was, you know, kind of, it wasn't hip hop beats. It was Jack, you know, and then suddenly something like Puffy did Mary J. Bly, you know, and that then, but that took an English aesthetic. So it's weird how. in many ways, we took from America and then turned it around and then America would take something back from us. And now what's amazing in the last 10 years of people, you know, is Americans coming back here and taking and, you know, you've got Skepta with ASAP Rocky you've got Drake sampling Sampha or Rihanna sampling the XX or whatever you know so it's sort of but I think it's always been a bit like that you know. Was it important to you to differentiate what you were doing with MoMAX at the beginning from the States? Not really. It wasn't on your mind? It wasn't particularly on my mind. I mean, I just wanted to, I really, really wanted to sign a lot of American hip-hop acts, but it was impossible. I was, at one point I was signing Company Flow. I was signing, tried to sign Organized Confusion. There's a band called Alphabet Soup. I was also in the running that I was going to run Def Jam in the UK. and do MoWax Def Jam was going to be part of it. I was going to take Def Jam and put it with Mo, and we were going to do Def Jam through MoWax. And I went to meet Leah Cohen and he said to me, sounds like a great idea, but I'm way more interested in Houston right now than England. You know, so what, you know, I'm not, you know, I'm not really that interested, you know. What were you looking for in your artists? I was looking for individualism and community and the global thing. But I definitely also having DJing in the way I was and the kind of records I liked. A lot of the blueprint for the sound that became... inverted hip is in common with the sort of mo wax instrumental hip-hop thing is i love finding you know weird tracks on on records that instrumentals i like playing sort of mad cut and paste hip-hop instrumentals as a dj so 33 god the beastie boys or return of the original art form by major force or mantronics king of the beats you know those were records that Really resonated with me. But then you started hearing weird things like you'd heard the first Nightmares on Wax record and it would be on Night's Interlude, didn't it? Or Tranquility Bass, They Came in Peace. And these really strange records which were kind of taking... soundtrack-y, a small soundtrack-y sort of ambient aesthetic mixing them with samples and creating this sort of weird soundtrack. So when I heard DJ Shadow, because previously Shadow, I was still working with people like the Funk Mob and Marden Hill and bands that were doing that. But I think that when I heard Shadow, it was kind of like... it kind of, it ticks every box. And I think also because I was, I was very into soundtracks. I was very into, for some reason, very into classical, sort of the use of classical music within. electronic music so a record like unfinished sympathy or something like that was that i kind of wanted to sort of create something new with that type of sound i also growing up here i was you know you i was i was exposed to whether it's giles peterson and norman j on one level you know wild bunch soul to soul another and then you know uh what was going on with acid house and techno so it was also a way of joining all those dots and creating a language that you kind of worked between everything and that was how you know again you know when you were talking to a carl craig about doing something you know they invented techno before techno they were listening to other records so you could talk to them about You know, I was, you know, I'd be talking to Carl Craig about Sun Ra or John Coltrane or, you know, a lot of jazz or soul records because that's what he'd grown up with as well as the influences, craft work or whatever. So when you were talking about something like the records, you know, La Funk or records or DJ Shadow Records. people they those types of artists kind of understood that because they were trying to do the same thing but with this thing called techno you know if you listen to early great techno records like you know especially carl craig 69 all those kind of records they're very break sample kind of based tracks you know um we're not talking about the techno of so much of necessarily of now. Those records, they were still taking influences from, you know, Bambata and... It wasn't referencing itself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And creating something new, you know. How comfortable were you with the trip-hop term? I hated it. Did you? Yeah, but that was just a sort of thing of... We're all put in the same box. So suddenly it's like, you know, Chemical Brothers, DJ Shadow, everybody's in the same box. And being, you know, at that time in your life and that age, you sort of have a slightly more elitist attitude. And it's like, I think when somebody coins a term that you didn't particularly invent or whatever, you know, it was like somebody was labeling your music. Do you remember where it came from? It came from, I think it was Mixmag or DJ Magazine. It's one of the two. Yeah. And it was an article about Moax, Chemical Brothers. I can't remember the other artists that they were bringing into the mix, but sort of, I suppose things like Wall of Sound was happening and stuff like that. But, you know, but then on one level, it was like sort of the chemicals in DJ Shadow was now you can see this kind of total symmetry. At the time, it was like that was kind of more of the sort of... house techno, you know, that was more of the dance club scene. And what we were doing was something a bit more, you know, it had a sort of a different take on that. So, but when it was all piled into one thing, you know, it's like sort of saying Metallica and Queens of the Stone Age are the same. They have, you know, they're not, they might be hard rock, but they're not the same kind of thing. But. You know, and oh yeah, there was Porter's Head Massive Attack, Chemical Brothers, DJ Shadow, Moax, Tricky. and then sort of Wall of Sound and it kind of, you know. And, you know, also I was dealing with Shadow. Shadow to him, he was just, in his mind, he was just making hip hop records, you know, because they were instrumental was not the point. It wasn't rap. Rap is the language, but hip hop was the mentality. So we thought we were just making hip hop records. I get it now. I don't have a problem with it so much now, you know. Yeah, I mean, but I can tell obviously when you're thinking it. And actually, in a weird way, the term is not necessarily a derogative term. It was trippy. It was just this idea of something which was more psychedelic, I suppose, you know. Just to mention Shadow there, it's going to be an obvious point of conversation. I'm aware that there might be people listening to this who maybe haven And I wondered if you could briefly summarise why that was such a landmark record for the scene, for the label and for, you know, music lovers. I mean, it's just one of the, it's just one of those great records you know sometimes you're lucky in your life that you can be part of or create or make a record that just changes things and I think that record you know, was a record that it's just one of the great records of that period. Do you think that when it's happening? No. But did I think it was something special? Absolutely. Most people didn't, you know, most people didn't get it. What were they saying? Well, how could you put out an instrumental hip hop record? Who's going to care about that? And I'm like, well... who cares about those so but and you know instrumental records will never sell I'm like but well then what about Beethoven or Mozart or Dark Side of the Moon I found it quite strange you know but um but I think also that what was what's so special about that record is it's about a relationship with it's a DJ Shadow record and at the heart of that it's his record but his sources of inspiration and why that record, the dynamic of that record and, you know, records like Stem or, you know, those tracks. you can really hear the influence of the UK and him coming to London and absorbing, coming to me to Metalheads or going to Barumba and hearing me and Giles Peterson play, Carl Craig to Ronnie Sighs to, you know, the first time that Inner City Life was ever played. I mean, we pretty much played, you know, we broke. At that club, we broke. high-estated consciousness. It was the first time outside of, you know, Goldie's, you know, Giles was the first person outside of Goldie to get an acetate of inner city love. It was the first time that any of those records were played outside of their own comfort zones. I was the first person to get Portishead, an acetate of Portishead. I was the first person to get, you know, an acetate of the second Massive Attack record. I played... You know, you'd hear 69 by, you know, Carl Craig. You'd hear, you know, Fotech. You'd hear James Brown. You'd hear Sun Ra. You'd hear, you know, a Latin jazz record. You'd hear McCoy Tyner. You'd hear, you know, FBI. I mean, just these mad records next to each other. And I think that energy. And the energy of what was going on and this mad eclecticism in London and this incredible, I mean, it was just the most incredible period of club culture where the lunatics still run the asylum. It was, you know, every day of the week there was somewhere to go where you would meet the most incredible people. I mean... you know, you go to Metalheads on a Sunday and you, Beck and Bjork would be there, but also Pete Tong and also, you know, Giles and Ross Allen and, you know, and every NL man from the country and, you know, you know, techno DJs and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, it was, but equally you've got to remember. that socially things were very different then there was no internet you didn't you you you clubs were a much more of a a place where everybody went to come together and not the same that that doesn't exist now but i think it's slightly different i think people have much more choice of what they do with their social time got it there's maybe a bit more lawless it was much more lawless but it was just like though you didn't have so much choice so if you wanted to meet people you had a you know you might be mean if you're lucky have a mobile phone most people didn't and that you know and uh you weren't emailing so if you wanted to connect you went you'd be like right i'm going monday night i'm going to go to bar rumba thursday night i'm going to go to movement i'm going to go wednesday speed sunday i'm going to go mount ahead saturday i'm going to go dusted you know, and that's how, that was communication. That was your, that was the internet. Do you know what I mean? That's where you heard the records and you would go every week because I don't know if it's still the same now. I've got to be honest with you from my experience. of DJing it's not is that like when a new record you know every week there'll be a new record you go to that club to hear the latest records I think now you go and see a DJ play his own records But they're not breaking records. It's a different way. You know, it was like the rate, you know, you didn't have the radio in the same way. You might have three or four radio shows you listen to. You didn't have NTS and, you know, or even a six music. So if you wanted to hear that, you know, the clubs were your radio stations. They were your social environments. They were. um, everything the way, where you'd see what the latest, everything was closed to, you know, he was in town. It was, you know, and, and, and also it wasn't so heavily policed. It wasn't so, you know, it wasn't, you know, it wasn't such a kind of, a sort of, um, effort to go through to get in, you know, you could smoke in a club, you could, you know you weren't suddenly now and you're in a club and if you want to smoke you're going to be ushered into the back so the club is completely disparate because people are sort of darting off in one direction to go somewhere else and da da da it was all just in the mix and I think but it was but I'm not saying that these things don't exist in other ways you know but I don't I just think that that was your way of that was that was your communication network you know this had a big effect on shadow when he came over you think yeah undoubtedly because he made you know because no no no you know that was the time that he really you know and being in the office and being around will bankhead and me and ben drury and tim goldsworthy and fraser cook and and Howie B and you know Bjork would be in the studio with Howie Major Force Studio would be across in the other building and you know Nigo from Bathing 8 would be there and then you'd have Futura painting in the corner and you'd have you know every day there would be whether it be a Goldie or a Fotech or a or a Kirk to Georgia or an Andrea Parker or a Carl Craig or a Richie Hall and everybody would be coming to the office so you know that energy was there and that was that was that energy was was unbelievably sort of I want to say toxic but toxic sounds negative but it was just like it poured through the veins of everything and and that's why I think all these great records were made you know I wanted to pick up on science fiction. Of course, the records, maybe Josh. I was, so I guess I was 14 when the record came out. I didn't hear it at the time, but I was aware of it as a product, which I guess had something to do with the level of interest in the release. How did that happen? How did it get to this slightly insane level of pre-release? Because it was, you know, My Wax had become this big thing. It had a major record label behind it. the osman who was running the label was very behind making this happen and the sort of what was meant to be the kind of the this the the the the the coming together of everything and the ultimate sort of the ultimate bombastic release of all that stuff was science fiction and it also there'd been a lot of hype over a lot of period of time You know, the first article about the record was in the face five years before it came out. Because the project had been going... No, three years before it came out. So it built this huge... buzz sort of mythical momentum and that also became its downfall you know um and yeah there was an appetite DJ Shadow just sold a million records you know introducing was pretty much voted the best record of the year two years before and you know records stuck with people in a way they don't now do you know what I mean you know records had much more staying power and momentum in how they influenced populist culture. I think it does happen now, but not to the same degree. we're too it's too much it's too much it's too quick we don't you know you don't you know the value of things is different um it's very hard difficult to imagine us collectively building ourselves up over a sustained period just geared towards one release right yeah It's unfathomable. Not now, no. I mean, unless maybe you're a Drake or something like that, I don't know. But then it's real pop music. Even so at this point, yeah. There's maybe a few artists you could think of, but not to that level. And most of the artists you think about are artists that have already probably been established over a long period of time. You know, I don't know, a new Radiohead record or something, you know. But I think that it, yeah, you know, it was a different time and it was sort of, it was, you know, it was that kind of, it kind of was this sort of pinnacle moment. But in many ways that kind of became its bitter pill really, you know. And I think that also, I think that if I'd been in America. I think things would have probably been different. I think it was also, in England, they build you up and they knock you down, especially then. So by the point, you know, with science fiction, it was like, who the fuck does James Lavelle think he is? you know well that's one of the things that came across in the film i think the way uh i think it was enemy in particular had you know played an enormous role in just talking about and hyping the record and by the time it actually came to be released they had seemingly changed their mind about the whole thing yeah but they also destroyed it because i dissed them about rob putting robbie williams on the front cover so they got it very angry about that And so I suddenly became a kind of celebrated artist to who the fuck do you think you are? And, you know, but I think, you know, for me, what was very sad is I was 24 years old. I mean, I wasn't, I didn't have the skills to deal with that. You know, every... suddenly you're the most, you feel like you're the most hated person in the world. And it was very, very. I mean, yeah, I mean, I wanted to ask that how you reflect on the controversy over your role in the records, you know, the fact that you were. Well, I think firstly, I think it's, I think, you know, I know what I did on that record. And I know that, you know, I also know that Shadow doesn't make records like, you know, John Lennon or Noel Gallagher, for sake of argument. He doesn't sit down on a guitar. You know, introducing is purely made out of other people's music. Is that a bad thing? No, because I believe in sampling and collaging and it's an amazing record and it's an original record, but he's not playing keyboards or guitar or writing songs. He's collaging. And to suddenly then be told that, you know, your ideas have no... value within the creative process was, to this day, I think is completely wrong. You know, Goldie doesn't program. Massive Attack don't program. You know, Dan Avery doesn't program. Doesn't make him make, doesn't mean the records aren't their records. No. Go and try and make them finish Sympathy. I mean, I can, you know, I know millions of programmers, they can't make that record. It's ideas. It's all about ideas. And I think that, unfortunately, I got completely fucked on that level. And it's something I still really feel that it's unfair that I didn't get publishing on that album. Do you feel as though your sort of standing in the sort of public imagination played a very big role in the interpretation of that situation in a way? You know, the fact that you were this, you know, pretty notable figure at that point. said some spicy things as well. Yeah, you know, absolutely. And, you know, how dare the guy that runs a record company and has all this success should benefit from being an artist, even though what people forget is that I set up my own records in the first place. And I put out my own records before I put out DJ Shadow's records. And there were lots of other people doing that as well. Nobody contested Goldie having metal heads and doing his own records. But they were scared of him, so they wouldn't dream of doing that. I was an easy target. I was like, I stupidly let that... I was also very let down by my management and my record company because at the time, you know, they were meant to support me in this process. And because Shadow was the cash cow. they were an egg. And so when it came down to it, you know, I remember having a conversation with Osmer, he was like, you should get publishing, it's unfair. I'll deal with it. And then it's like, oh, actually, we don't really want to mess the relationship with artists who just sold a million records and is considered the most important... artists in the world right now so you know you've got the record company so don't worry about it and don't worry about it because we'll renegotiate so you'll make money out of that we didn't renegotiate and you know to this day I've never made one single penny out of science fiction not one penny I've never had a tour out of it I've never made I they they they um also took my they they did a strange deal with me where i ended up with no sinking come on it i made so that even going to my master rights and i've never made one penny and i think people you know so you know and and and i also got completely my life was torn apart by the negativity that you know that of what was said about me for actually unfortunately it was my the whole thing was my idea and and apart the only person that i that wasn't my idea but was a joint idea to get on that record was called you rap every single person that collaborated on that record was my idea you know I, you know, Shadow wasn't in the studio when I did Be There With Ian Brown, which was the most successful Uncle single. I, you know, it was my idea to do, you know, it was my idea of the shape of the record and to get Shadow in in the first place. And the irony is because I'm working on a science fiction reissue at the moment. During this process of four years of working on it, I found loads of demos that me and Tim did before Shadow. And those demos sound more like Uncle Reckles now than even science fiction. And so when people hear that, I think it'll be quite interesting because... You know, I got really cut down and I don't do anything. But the other thing with science fiction is it wasn't just about the music. It was about the whole it was about the universe around it. It was about the design, the characters. It was about toys, bathing, a soup, all these collaborations, Nike, all these things that came around it. You know, this this completely unique universe. Otherwise, I don't think people would be talking about it in the same way now. It is a record that the universe around it is what is now the basis of modern alternative music. That universe existed within pop. Don't get me wrong. I looked at bands like Kiss for inspiration for merchandise or The Beatles. But that was pop. And so, yeah, you know, I wanted to make a record, which was like a film. It was like, I wanted it to be like Star Wars. And you have the film, but you have everything else that goes around it. You know, it's, you know, like this film saying that I'm really glad that it's done. The next point in my career is I just want science fiction done because I also feel like I've never, I can never move on. And it's, you know, to have something which is so long ago, which has had created a lot of negativity, even though it's by many, many, many, many people. Otherwise, this film wouldn't be out or whatever. People have great fondness for that record. It really aggravates me. I saw there was a review in the vinyl factory of the album. And still to this day, people can't help but knock it. And you're like, do you actually listen to the record? If you listen to that record and you're saying it's not a very good record and it's me standing back from it. It's just bullshit. You're telling me that Rabbit in Your Headlights or Lonely Soul is not a good track? You go and make a song like that when you're 24. Are you fucking kidding me? Because, you know, there are a lot of records that I know are not good records and people know that. It's not, you know, regardless of me being involved or not, purely as a standing back. It's madness that you, that there's all this constant, oh, it just sounds like a bit of a, them just fucking around with demos and trying some, being sort of, you know, the kids in a sweet shop. It's like, do you really think that's how we made that record? Are you insane? You know, it's like that record is unbelievably crafted. Go and make that record yourself or try because where are the records that have even come close? It's not that many. Massive Attack. Probably, not even close, better. But there's not that many. Otherwise, you know, there aren't that, you know, do you know how hard it is to make a record on an MPC with a 40-piece orchestra? The track goes on for nine minutes. I mean, and away from the technical ability, the actual emotion that those records convey. I'm not saying it's the perfect album, but... my god you know do you know how many records came out on other labels that tried to be science fiction that are just they're not good records i know what a good record is that record but people just can't have it's sort of that horrible sort of perpetuation of of sort of of a story and that aggravates me because i actually think that you know if you if you get into the core of it There is some work in there that I think is, you know, you've got, with DJ Shadow, you've kind of, with his best work, what he ever did was introducing science fiction and a little bit of private press. And listen to his records after those records. Listen to his vocal records. They're not comparable. So therefore, when people sort of contest my involvement in it, then look at when I'm not working with DJ Shadow. Do you know what I mean? But, you know, it's, you know, but I'm not trying to say it's the greatest thing ever. I'm just saying that I just, it annoys me when people sort of think it's some kind of, it was just some kind of us having a laugh, sort of, you know, wasting a load of money and sort of trying to, you know, sort of, I don't know what's the right word. You know, there was no cohesion or whatever. Rubbish. Like it was just a... A vanity. It was not a vanity project. It was my life's work up until that point. It was everything that I wanted to say. It was a more... And some of that I didn't get to say because some of the record didn't... evolve in the way that I would have liked to due to time. That's something I wanted to ask you about actually because thinking about the film the story is driven in a large part by Uncle and the evolution of Uncle. We get to see the revolving cast of characters all the different versions of the band. We see behind the scenes some quite torturous at times, you know, scenes of the creative process. One thing I was interested to know from you is you, at times, you seemed very, very focused, almost to the point of obsession over... over an achievement that you seem to have very sharply in your mind. The film seems to suggest that you're chasing success in and of itself. And I assume that that wasn't the case. So I was interested to know artistically or emotionally, what was the thing you were trying to convey with those albums? You know, what was coming through? It's just what you're trying to, what you're, it's like any, I suppose, like most artists, I'm just trying to express myself. And those records represent how you feel and the language in which you want to convey of emotion. I mean, I definitely get that. It was never really about chasing success. It was just about trying to make things and collaborate. And I love, I like working with... creative people and I like making things and you know what else you know I don't that's all I that's what I know how to do sometimes I do it right sometimes I do it badly you know like everybody sure sure sure but I I it's just this desire to kind of create and express yourself it's pretty much the same as probably anybody else You think so, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think if it was purely business-driven, then I would be working in a record company. You know, I know a lot of, you know, okay, example, Max Lassardi started Ultimate Dilemma. He now runs Warner Brothers and he signed, you know, James Blunt and fucking... Ed Sheeran, I mean, you know, is that what you wanted me to do? Because that's what I didn't want to do. I wanted to make artistic, you know, what I thought were creative artistic statements based on feeling and how you convey that through music and art. Was the, I guess, gradual shift towards a more rock-orientated sound Just be simply following you. I just got, I mean, I got inspired by, you know, the whole, me and Rich got really into sort of, rhythm was always the sort of, was the basis for how you started. rhythm and emotion and but the most the you know when you're starting tracks most it would start with beats because we weren't we weren't guitar you know we weren't singer songwriters so you'd start sampling collaging and the beat would be the foundation for the you know to add to and everything would come from the beat and if the beat was cool because you're DJing clubs it was all about the beat then you knew you could build from the beat And so first record was rooted in hip hop. Second record, you know, but then that sound wasn't translating into clubs because I was then in fabric and it suddenly became more uptempo. It became more breakbeat and electronic orientated. So that's where the rhythms influenced Never Never Land. And then I heard Queens of Stone Age and the way that the drums were on Queens. And I loved the way the drums were. And me and Rich were like, fuck, if we could translate that sort of style into what we do, that could be a new sound of beats. And that's kind of where that started from. And I think also, you know, we were quite severe. Like once you did a record, you wanted to move on. It was like, well, we've done that. We want the sound to change. So you're looking for different inspiration for sound. And we'd never, you know, I remember on science fiction was kind of a rule of no, really. It was like, you know, even before science fiction, it was a kind of Moax was like a no guitar rule. You know, we're making records without guitars, you know, by the time it got to, by the time it got to war stories, like, well, we never really did that. Maybe we should start working with some guitars. And it was just what was, what you, what you were by and it just happened that that sort of la you know uh sound chris goss the desert rock sound i found very inspiring it was also the people that were embracing me at the time you know and and and it felt exciting and and and and and shit just happens you know sometimes you just starts something and then the next minute you know you're like i mean i always laugh like my most successful chart record is it was right in queensland stone's sonage like clockwork you know which is the irony from the fact that you know you come from making hip-hop you have the number one record in america with with with a roll record you know um i was interested to know um how you feel you've evolved as a musician producer over the last decade or more, you know, have your interests in the production process shifted at all? Like, you know, what do you think that evolution has been like? I don't know. It's hard when you sort of talking about yourself. I think that I, I think that I'm, It's hard when you sort of talk about yourself in that way. I think that on a purely sort of technical articulation of knowing what can work and not, probably a lot better. And especially as technology's evolved, that's making records like I do has become a lot easier. You know, you can't imagine when you're doing something like, when you're doing introducing, you know, to program a beat could take a month. now you can do it on Ableton in like a minute, you know, which is great, but it also just, you know, it's a different kind of, it's a different working process. I think that, um, I'm not so naive so I have different kind of boundaries and I have different I put myself in different situations and I'm also older so therefore my influences are different in the sense of maybe what I'm trying to say and what I'm listening to and I'm not I'm not that kid in the club necessarily at five in the morning you know in the way that I used to be you know um So that changes. I think that, I mean, I am, but I'm usually DJing and I'm not the kid, unfortunately. But I don't know. I think that, but the irony is a lot of what I'm doing at the moment is sort of going full circle and what some of the stuff that I'm trying to make right now is taking a lot of the influences, which I'd, you know, a lot of the time you kind of do things and then you kind of have this we had this quite strange thing the artists on mo wax like once you'd sort of once everybody caught up with you you had to move on and that was then move on everything was build and destroy you know i think now i'm just i'm i'm much i've got this thing of it's weird like i'm suddenly going back to older records going oh god i like that actually now you know That's pretty good. And I really would like to make more records like that. I never got to make, and I still haven't quite, is my sort of, you know, my, my sort of sample record. And in the sense of, you know, I had a career before DJ Shadow. I think that's what that movie and a lot of people forget is that, you know, I was, well, actually in the movie, it does show a bit of that. But, you know, I was playing with Giles Peterson and people like that and playing very eclectically. And then I went more into the dance world and that, you know, when you're DJing in certain clubs, there's a certain energy you need to create and there's certain records that serve a purpose to do that. which I really enjoyed. But I think now I'm much more, I'm not, I don't feel like I'm a part of any scene or anything. I'm quite open. And it's really exciting for me because I'm sort of like anything goes. And I have a radio show that I really enjoy because, you know, up until doing a radio show, if I go and do a DJ show, predominantly it'll be you're playing in a club, in a certain kind of club, which is usually a dance music club. Therefore, you're not going to go and play Isaac Hayes. in, you know, in the middle of, you know, of, of, of a, of a techno. I mean, you know, there are other records. It's hard to explain, but like being able to do the radio shows just let me just be very musically free palette wise. And, and also the fact that. where I am in my career and also, you know, I think that's partly a positive, for me, quite a positive thing about the documentary, sort of reconnecting with people from the past, as well as the new people that it's brought into my life and how actually, you know, I'm taking all that influence and putting it into new records. So I've got, I work with a lot of younger... musicians and a lot of younger kids that are into, you know, into the past, but they've got their, what they're doing now and how that is influencing me. And, and I'm just really excited about a certain kind of freedom that I think maybe I bought, you know, sometimes you kind of, you retreat, you box yourself in, you're going down a rabbit hole in one level and then you come out and you're like, Oh my God, why did I go down there for so long? I think now I'm just having a little bit of a kind of, oh, you know, it's 25 years here. I can, you know, I can, it doesn't matter if I make an acoustic record or a hip hop record. It doesn't matter where. The jump from science fiction to Never Neverland and that jump from Never Neverland to war stories was felt so severe. You know, it doesn't feel like that now. So, you know, I've just done a soundtrack for Danny Boyle for his new TV show, which is of a certain kind of. sound and then you know I've just remixed the editors and that's you know a club record and I like being able to but I don't feel like I'm going to get that sort of what is he thinks he's doing now you know whereas there was a long time of who the fuck does he think what the fuck you know he's making a rock oh my god you know How dare he? So he's taking advantage a little bit of the open-mindedness. Yeah, and I think that's also what's great about the music scene now is that it's so much more diverse. It's so much more open. I mean, don't forget that 10 years ago, you'd never have a rapper rap on a house record. I mean, it happened back in the hip house days. Died of death. Puffy tried to do it with Darren Emerson. That fucking died of death. Now, you know, hip hop is synonymous with dance records. You know, even to hear the RZA on a house record the other day, I'm like, wow. I mean, it's great. But like, you know, you're like, it's all open. you know and and that's really great because it's sort of you know whether it's mark ronson producing queens of the stone age or you know um you know as an example or a techno producer working with a with a rapper or whatever i mean it's really wide open but and i think kids and i think what's great is that you know i've got a 21 year old daughter They don't see the boxes in the same way that I grew up with those boxes. All I wanted to do was break down those boxes. My friends didn't see the boxes, but media lived through those boxes. You know, radio lived through those boxes, you know. How does all of this manifest in your DJing at the moment? What are you playing? It depends, because I've been playing quite a varied... um varied sort of places of late because of what's been going on with all this sort of mohawk stuff etc meltdown so on one level be very eclectic and sort of you know playing very across the board from sort of soul and funk through to, you know, what I really like at the moment is sort of playing for like four hours, five hours and starting with like soul and funk and then ending up with techno. You get to do that much. I do late. Yeah. But then there are other circumstances where I'm in a club and I, you know, I've got to play for the floor and that's great. So I'll play more. I've always liked playing a quite euphoric, psychedelic. you know, how so, you know, whether it's, you know, uh, Yonath Rathman to, uh, Fortet to, uh, you know, I, I, I mean, I can't, I'm terrible with names, you know, I'll play for anything from Dubfire to those kind of, you know, but it's, but, but I still try and weave things in. I mean, I, you know, DJ, you know, DJs to me that I really love are in in a club scene because you know you can hear techno and then you can hear led zeppelin in the same set i love that it's just how you present that and and so i've always tried to be eclectic but I have, you know, I curated the jazz cafe last year. So each night I did a different performance with a different, I said one night was a jazz thing. Another night was a hip hop thing. Another thing was a soul thing. So, you know, that was great to be able to play a lot of records that I wouldn't, I haven't been able to play in nightclubs over the last 15 years because. You know, that's not the environment that I was playing in. You know, me and Giles are talking about doing some stuff again, which would be great. But I also like to be able to play with, you know, I liked playing with Sasha back in the day. I liked playing with... dub fire and people like that you know something a bit big and epic yeah I love playing big fucking clubs with amazing sound systems and sure but but but I'm not but also that scene has changed quite a lot and I'm not I'm not where I was in that scene right now and I get that so I suppose for me you know an example of somebody that I would probably in an ultimate way that I would probably like to I would play more like in that way ultimately would be like when I see something like Harvey where you can get to play very across the board but he's still playing for a club crowd you know and but I think people are open you know and I think that's great you know but really great DJs to me that was what they always were you know Carl Cox even though you know he's a fucking brilliant soul DJ as well you know came from soul and funk you know You know, and I like, you know, the Dixons and the Armeys and, you know, I like melodic dance music or melodic techno. I'm not particularly in, I don't, you know, it's really difficult now with all these terms and everything. I'm not very into the pop side of dance music culture, even though I can respect some of the records, but I'm not really, those DJs do not speak to me. Yeah, got it. you know, I like people that are, that I feel both, you know, I always thought that DJing was about entertainment and education. And that's what, and so. you know, whether it was a Larry Levan, a Giles Peterson, a Harvey, and these are all guys. I mean, I suppose you've got a new, you know, lots of great new people coming out of that with it. And especially with, with, with, with female DJs and the Peggy Goose and people like that, you know, just great eclectic club DJs, you know, but they can fucking, they can bang it out too. And, you know, I like, I You know, it's not an avocation for drugs, but I like people that are... in a certain place, in a certain environment going on. There's nothing better than playing to a euphoric ecstasy crowd, you know. Yeah, I was wondering just more generally about DJing as well, because something I seemed to detect from the film was that DJing, you know, although it comes with its perils and, you know, we are talking about the chaos of nightlife, in a way it seemed to be this just, you know, very straightforward, quite pure. expression that you were able to fall back on was just like it's me and some tracks and I could just go and do that on my own you know, I don't need, you know, I don't need somebody else to make it for me. I do, I can do it myself. Do you know what I mean? I guess when you're coming, coming from a background of mass collaboration and the studio and also, and it's just, but it's also just that kind of, it's the thing that it's the heart and soul. It's the basis for everything. It's sort of, you know, it's, it's my, it's the grown from that because what djing allowed you to do was was to uh become you know was to collage and to learn how things would fit and flow and you know again this sort of idea of education and entertainment was okay you know how do you get to play something that nobody's ever heard before and make it relevant and fit with something that, you know, so you needed to kind of, you've got to keep people interested. So you drop things that were familiar and then you take people off And a lot of the time, what great DJs did was clear the floor. You know, it would be unthinkable now for a Diplo or a Steve Aoki to clear the floor, right? But I've seen every one of the greatest DJs and enjoy it. You know, I've been there where somebody like Harvey or Colcots would go. Check this out. They're going to clear the floor. But next week, this will be the biggest record in the world. And that was true. A lot of records that people go, oh my God, it's the greatest record ever. When you first played it, that's not what people reacted to. But because of the business, because of the expectations to do that, there's fear. So there's a lot of safety within contemporary DJs, I think. Not everybody at all, but a lot. Especially those at the top of the tree. You know. It just doesn't pay to take a risk, really, does it? No, it doesn't pay to take a risk because in those days you were getting paid... 500 quid if you were lucky or god if you're doing really well a thousand pounds and even with that of course the more money you were getting paid the more pressure it was that if you did make a mistake then you were going to pay for that because you were expected to deliver but in the early days and the great the days where it wasn't and i'm not i don't want to sort of be on this reminiscing like it was better i'm not trying to say that it's just the it was a different industry And when the industry was not a money-making, not even money-making, there was money being made. I mean, we didn't want to do it for free. You wanted to make a living. But, you know, I mean, what are the expectations? If you're getting paid a million quid to DJ a night, which some DJs are, 250, 300,000 pounds a night. Not a year, one night. Of course expectation is it needs to be the greatest party and everybody needs to be happy. There's not a second of that performance that can be out of place. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And actually, you know, but then again, great bands. I mean, you know, great bands have done that. You know, I mean, the amount of times that I've seen my, you know, the, the, what I consider the greatest bands in the world, you know, push people to the nth, you know, people go and see a radio head gig and being like, well, you haven't played creep, you know? I mean, that still goes on today, doesn't it? You know, very that that side of it's quite different you know I know but I think you know I look at people like you know I think people like Craig Richards have always people like that have always pushed the bar and he's you know but but You know, I'm talking about DJs that are even older than I am, so I feel a bit guilty here. But I haven't been, I'm not so in, I'm not in the club scene in the same way, you know. I've also, there are other things that I want to do. Making records, what I love, and making the kind of records that I do take a different kind of amount of time and, you know, life with family and just having... been, as you can see in the documentary, incredibly you know, a very fast-paced, slightly insane period of time. I've also had to sort of, for my own sanity and my own health, I've had to kind of pull back and look at other, you know, what other things do I enjoy doing? I am a rain Rain, rain, rain all day I am the rain I'm gonna rain this way again I am the rain I am the spiral Before the blaze The rain drop out and sing our cause The ripples that become the crashing waves I am the rain. Rain, rain, rain all day.
