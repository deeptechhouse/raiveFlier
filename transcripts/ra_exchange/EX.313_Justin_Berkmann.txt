Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Justin Berkman. He was one of the original founders of Ministry of Sound, a London venue that set the tone for clubbing in the 90s. But the whole venture was inspired by his time in New York in the late 80s. In a conversation with Stephen Titmuss, it's clear that the likes of Larry Levan and the Paradise Garage still loom large in his mind to the present day. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Justin Berkman is up next. So when and where was your first clubbing experience? First clubbing experience? Okay, rave, house, dance music experience, I guess. Raving specifically is, there's no sort of like start point because when I started going out, the word rave wasn't really there, sort of, and there was no verb raving. Well, probably there was, but when I first started, I would suggest that it was probably around the shake and finger pop family function. Salt Assault era of the raves that they were putting on basically in sort of Camden, Kentish, King's Crossy area around 85. And they're like the early warehouse parties that were going on in London at the time, I suppose. They were the early warehouse parties that quite often were, you know, hiring a warehouse and then, you know, getting the electrics from a street light. sending over the wires onto a streetlight and, you know, and just waiting till the cops turn up. And what did you think of those parties going out there for the first time? Obviously really exciting period in London that time with all the music going on. It was an interesting time. I have to totally admit that musically I enjoyed it, but it didn't blow me away because it was hip hop and rogue groove. And I kind of liked them, but I wasn't being captured by the scene at that point. And I think the moment that I had that hallelujah moment was when I heard a house record, actually at a friend's house, and then started hearing these records being played at the raves. And me and the few friends that I was hanging out with, we were kind of like trying to isolate and pinpoint what that sound was and what that music was, not really understanding what house was or anything about it. So it was a very basic, ignorant, blissful and naive experience. era and I didn't own any turntables or anything like that and had probably half a dozen records and just started playing around at my friend's house and before I moved to New York in 86 I played one gig and it was my that would be my first paying first professional so-called gig which was at heaven and we didn't have a clue it was me and my mate jimmy and um i mean and jimmy came through with me all through new york and all the way through ministry of sound as well you know neither of us had a clue what we were doing dj was so it was thank god it wasn't filmed or recorded but um yeah that's where it started and that was just before we went to new york so what brought on that trip to new york Failing as a wine merchant. My father wanted me to be a wine merchant and the idea of being a corporate and having a proper job and doing all that kind of stuff at that point didn't appeal to me at all. So after being fired dozens of times by my father, he was trying to set me up to take over. I was the oldest child. So I was going to take over the family company. And it just wasn't for me. He didn't think it was for me either. So he was like, you've got to go and discover yourself. Go. So I just got on a plane, went to New York and started trying to get work there and started bartending. And then started talking to the kids who were waiting tables, who all... Out of towners, actors and singers and whatever, people trying to get their careers going. So we discussed club scenes here in London, the one we just discussed, and what was going on in New York. And of course, they told me about all the stuff that was going on. So Paradise Garage, Save the Robots, all those clubs. Then Nels opened. And that was kind of the spark. And that's when we started going out. Every night. And I think we went out every night for a year and a half. And it was Nell's Monday through Friday and then Paradise Garage Saturday. And then Sunday we would sort of crawl around town and up at tracks in the evening. And we did that for pretty much 18 months straight. That's a pretty unimaginable scene compared to what you'd get in most capital cities nowadays. Great parties every single night of the week. Must have been a fairly golden era. Yeah, I mean, it was, I mean, New York was in that sort of, that beautiful Goldilocks period between its warriors, bankrupt New Yorkers, burnt out houses, and it's sort of completely, you know. disheveled New York, very dangerous, combined with the fact that there was an incredible amount of A-list VIPs living there and going out clubbing, combined with the fact that it was starting to radically come up. So it was a really interesting time where you had this excellent edge to it. It was as dangerous as hell, but it was as fun as hell. And it just worked. So yeah, it was an amazing time. Pretty much after I left, anyone who's from New York or lived there said that was it. It's never recovered. It's never had that moment since. So I was really lucky just to hit it at that moment. Speaking of the danger element, did you ever get into any kind of scrapes or anything like that whilst on the road, like muggings or whatever? I lived in Greenwich Village. We accidentally moved to Greenwich Village without actually having any clue what it meant, but got this incredible house. and realised suddenly that we were living in the epicentre of gay New York. Subsequently, there was no stress, because everyone, they may look you up and down, but there would be no stress, there would be no violence or anything like that. There would be the occasional... you know, out-of-towners drive down and throw things at people and be aggressive and stuff like that. And there was a lot of hostility, homophobic hostility from out-of-towners. But for us living there, we were embraced by the community and felt very safe and welcome there. And it was part of the magic that we had. We were living in this island of kind of uniqueness in New York and then just going clubbing, going clubbing and working. bars so it was a great period I was 23 at the time so I had the energy for it. Fantastic and you mentioned Paradise Garage which is you know arguably the greatest club of all time I know it had a massive impact on you just to maybe try and sum it up what was so great about the Paradise Garage? Summing it up, yeah, that's a tough one. It seems like it's something that's almost beyond language, but I'm trying to put you on the spot here. I think what the specialness of the garage was, was the relationship. between the people and the DJ. The club itself was obviously perfect insofar as it had been designed by someone who'd really sat down and worked out what was needed and what was unnecessary in a nightclub design and had really built... what was essentially the perfect blueprint for a club. But you can have the greatest club in the world and if the people suck, the club sucks. So, you know, it's all about the people. And it was just, you know, any club or any event is only as strong as its weakest part. And there was no weak part at the garage. The music was brilliant. The DJs were outstanding. The PAs were so memorable. I mean, some of the greatest PAs I've ever seen were in that place. But it was the crowd and it was the reaction that they had and it was that one love. It was like a church. It wasn't a club. It was much more than that. You go down the church route and it all starts becoming a bit silly. But to us, it was like that. And you never considered where you're going to go at the Garage Saturday. It was just what time. And us being out of London. you know, sad kids. We weren't cool enough to go there at five in the morning. We were there at 1230. You know, we were right there from the beginning to the end. But, you know, we got our education like that as well, musically. So once you started going, was it literally every week? Yeah. For how long? Till it closed. I didn't miss a week. So when I finally got in, I tried three times, failed. Fourth attempt in. And then we went every week from that to close. Yeah. And do you have a particular night that, okay, that feels like the pinnacle? They all were, and they were all uniquely brilliant. The last night was obviously the maddest experience because you had 14,000 people in the space, which is similar to ministry. So let's say a 1,500 capacity club with 14,000 people, or at least it seemed like that. There was a queue around the block that actually started at the door and went all the way around the New York block. And I remember being on the roof guard and deciding to go to the bathroom. And it took me, I think, two hours. And I think by the time I got down there, my body just really reabsorbed it. I didn't need to go anymore. It just, it was over. You couldn't move. It was just packed beyond, you know, ridiculous. That was a strange night. That wasn't a usual night. But the greatest night there, it's a really tough one to pick one out. Liz Torres when she sang the first time was pretty outstanding but it's really hard to pick one out like just to be specific about it you know Larry Levan is often discussed as the best DJ that's ever been I just wonder if you could maybe kind of identify why people say that today, because it's obviously hard to explain for some people listening, even perhaps listening back to some of his mixes, because he's not necessarily the most technically proficient DJ. He's not necessarily, you know, doing things as what people would consider today be technically the best way to do things. I just wondered being there, experiencing it firsthand, you obviously have a much better insight into that. Because he was a storyteller and he told stories of love and he made people cry. Today everyone's technically perfect, but there's no message. It's empty. That's why he was so brilliant because he would create musical... you know, love stories and tell the story and people go along with the story. And it was beautiful. But at the same time, he would have an incredible skill at manipulating both the sound system and also the dancers. If there was a group of dancers that weren't going for it, he knew what record to blow them away with. He could manipulate individual people on the dance floor. He knew his people so well. He could just, you know. He could just control like a puppet master. And the way he manipulated the sound just gave it so much more oomph and so much more emotion. And I guess what he was doing by texturizing the sound, which is something that doesn't really exist a lot. But today it's just a big green button press on and off bass. But in the old days, we would manipulate the sound all the time. The manipulation and the texturizing of the sound with the bass and the treble is what gives you the emotion like a Laurence Olivier or a Gielgud would give with a piece of Shakespeare. You read it, it's dry. Well, it's brilliant. But when a Shakespearean actor reads it, it makes sense. And that's what Le Van did. He made sense of all of it and he would put it all together and he would blow your head off with it. I remember Danny Kravitz telling me a lot of what made Larry LeVan great was much beyond the stuff that you could see from a mixtape or whatever. The fact that he would, you know, control the lights. He would even control the temperature of the room by shutting the fans on and off and let the cold air come in at a particular part of the moment. You know, it was much beyond the obvious stuff. Which he taught me. I mean, and we did that at ministry. We were doing stuff where and put red lights on, switch off the air conditioning, and take out the sibilants from the sound. So it became really, really heavy and oppressive. Everyone was sweating like crazy, and it became really heavy. Then all of a sudden, chuck a rainstorm in, blue lights, people with water pistols on the stack spraying people with water. All the sibilants comes back. And you just blow people's brains out like that. It's unbelievable. The effect is incredible. Yeah, so it's theatrical. It was way beyond just records, sound system. Yeah, clearly he had the lights. He had that big, he had that light control thing above his head where he could kill lights. But he would also, like, one night he switched all the speakers off except for one of them, one small speaker in the corner of the room. And everyone's ears eventually got used to it and we all carried on dancing. And that went on for, like, I don't know, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and then eventually chucked the whole system in. And again, you know, So it was fun. He was a puppet master. He was a piss taker. He had the most wicked sense of humour. Practical joker. So it was all that. It was fun. Today it's all so serious. There's some fun around, but for the vast majority, it's so serious nowadays. One thing that I thought was interesting, looking at the history of the garage around the time you went. It's after AIDS has hit very strongly and that's obviously had a huge impact in the gay community of New York. How did that impact the garage itself? It must have changed things a lot in that club. A couple of people told me it was safer for me to be there as a straight guy. Had I been there a number of years earlier, I might not have been quite left alone so much. The cruising scene was very much over us and living in the middle of it, that was quite apparent as well. In the time that we were in New York, of our little gang of friends that we built up, three of them died during that period. So it was very obvious to us what was going on. And it was, you know, it was horrific. The Grim Reaper was around every corner. So it was scary, scary times. Subsequently, people really chucked their heart into the music. And I can't talk about pre-AIDS Paradise Garage in New York because I wasn't there and didn't see it. But as far as my point of view, the joy was there, but there was a sort of undercurrent of terror that was going on. Maybe that helped in some way with the music. The angst and that stress and that thing brought it out. But as far as I'm concerned, it started to close everything down. Obviously, the owners of the garage knew that they weren't well. So the club shut eventually. And regardless of how we were all screaming... We wanted it to stay open, much like today's, you know, people stay in the European Union. You know, there was nothing we could do about it. It was done and dusted and we had to just move on. And you personally moved on from New York fairly soon after that, I suppose. When did you come back to the UK? Well, the club shut in September and I came back in February of the next year. So I carried on playing in a few clubs. I did a residency at the World. a club called Brutal where I was playing Acid House and the Duke of Denmark was playing sort of like really hard end of hip hop so I got a few residencies and stuff and started playing but The garage gone was just, it was almost like there was no point staying. And when you would see people out in the middle of the street that you knew from the club, everyone was so depressed and it was like, you know, what do we do now? And everyone tried to go to clubs and try and reinvent what was going on. But regardless, you could have the people, you could have the DJ, even Larry was playing at the World. And you had the same people on the dance floor, but it wasn't the same. So the elements weren't all there anymore. And I just felt it's time to go. I want to build my own. I want to do my own. Of course, it was at that point, it was just complete and utter fantasy. There was no way I was going to build my own. But in my head, I had it that I was going to go and do it. So off I trotted and came back to London. So you come back to London, I suppose you're at that time, it's sort of the peak of Acid House in some ways in the UK. What did you make of that contrast? Because that's a pretty big contrast to like the Acid House scene of the UK compared to the Paradise Garage. Just before I left New York, I met a couple of guys, a Scottish guy called Simon Gordon, who was absolutely charming gentleman. And his brother, I think, Josh. And these guys came to the garage a few times and we hung out a bit with them. And then when I came back, within days, I hooked up with them and they were putting together Hedonism 2. There was no Hedonism 1. So I really like the idea of these guys because they're a bit twisted. So they did Hedonism 2 out in Alperton, out by Hanger's Lane, in our old shed, with some really cool DJs. Colin Favour, Jazzy M. Jazzy B was definitely there. Anyway, that was the get-go. That was the start point of the Acid House scene. Clearly stuff had been going on before that, but for me that was the start point. And it was just a London version of what I'd been seeing in New York, slightly less stylised, much more grimy, much more messed up. But all equally is fun. So I'd gone from this very stylized, you know, gay, nice music, very intense club to what was a very mashed up, straight, hooligan-esque, you know, scene in London. But they were both brilliant. And from there, we just flew off. But yeah, Acid House. was predominant, but it was still, I mean, if you listen back to the records now from back then that were really predominant, most of them are unlistenable. I never really liked them. I preferred the acid side and the deeper side. So if I could choose any era to live in, I still think that would have, I'm still, I feel very lucky. to have been born when I was born and to have experienced that. But at the same time, it's really, really good if you can try and bring these things back because everything goes in cycles. At the moment, we're in a pretty grim one, grim part of it. What's grim about the current cycle, do you feel? For me, looking at the scene, everything's very technical. Everything is about looking at the DJ. Everything is about iconoclastic, like looking at DJs and worshipping them and the music that they make or they claim to make. The whole business is a fraud and it is really, really rotten, like all industries there are. But the people are being... They're being defrauded by a lot of people. And I just think that in the old days, DJs really made the music, really knew how to play instruments. It's the love, the emotion that you get in the old school music, which is just devoid today. I mean, you do get exceptions, clearly. But as a massive generalization, the music in the old days, in the 70s and the 80s, and into the beginning of the 90s was super, super. super emotional. And then as I despair with the way it is, and I would love to be able to have parties where people see the way it used to be, the one love, the vibe. And it's all about partying together, making friends with strangers, you know, maybe I'm just getting old. But for me, it's just I see that it's not got that one loveness that it used to. Interesting. And I guess, you know, even though it's rooted in nostalgia, but, you know, you've done a tribute to Larry Levan at the club at Ministry of Sound this year. And was that something that you saw some of that old kind of spirit existing in? It's exactly what we had. And that's that was what was so great about it was because we had, especially the night, the November. 18 months ago, so that would be when I was 16, 14. So November 14, we had the first night in paradise where a lot of the people who went to the garage came down and a lot of people who wanted to have gone to the garage, you know, whatever came down and there was a cross pollination of vibe. And we'd done this once before. We did this right at the beginning of ministry where we brought over 250 New Yorkers. The London crowd were getting down and they were enjoying it, but they hadn't quite really liberated themselves yet. They were still feeling a little bit self, what's the word? Self-aware. Self-aware. That's exactly, yes. These New Yorkers came down with Kiss FM. We did this party where Frankie Knuckles came and DJed and it was live on Kiss FM in New York. 200, 250 New Yorkers turned up. And they just went bonkers. And all of a sudden, this New York vibe was infected. It was like a virus that went around the dance floor and everyone caught it. And from that moment on, that night on, the dance floor never moved the same. It was different. It changed. It had become more New Yorkised And people getting down more and it had more of a black vibe to it. And it was just, it just cracked it. And it was amazing. And you see this, there's like this watershed between one week and another. And the Paradise Garage part, the Night in Paradise was very similar to that. It was beautiful because people who had missed it could come and actually get the vibe, feel what it was like. It was virtual reality, but you know, without the goggles. Yeah. So maybe to be specific, one of the key things to run a great party is to have a cross-pollination of crowd, different kinds of people in there working together as one. I think absolutely. I think because at the end of the day, one love. The one thing about the early days was the one love was the fact that it was everyone together with regardless of what you were, colour, race, sexuality, age, everything. It was just. You know, it was just who, whatever. You got down, you were one of the clan. If you could get in. If you could get in, yeah. Yeah. No, I'm thinking about back in the days when we were on the raves. I mean, you know, if you could find the bloody place. I mean, we were driving around Nottinghamshire, four o'clock in the morning, having, you know, probably filled the car up twice and gone to seven different, you know, gas stations to find out where the next drop point was. But when you arrived at the thing, it was just off the hook. I mean, the best was the, I think it sure somewhere it was in a field obviously and there was a funfair right in the middle of it two articulated 40 foot container stacks of speakers either side of a console and probably 20,000 people all off their nut in the field and it was one of the greatest moments of my life I loved it if I played there would have been even better but it was just enough to be there it was brilliant sounds absolutely fantastic to be fair So you're going out to raves and you eventually meet James Palumbo and Humphrey Waterhouse. How did you first come across these two characters, the people that helped you set up Ministry of Sound? So there's this guy called Ray Maudsley, who's a friend of ours who came raving. And he lived in, at the time he lived in Wandsworth and I was living in Sydenham. And so I drive past his house quite often to drop off and say hello and whatnot. And we would talk about the garage and all this kind of stuff. And one of his roommates started going out with James. And she told him about this guy, Ray. So James was curious to meet this guy, Ray, who had all these brilliant ideas. They met. Eventually, I was pulled in and I met James as well. And we sat there. It was funny because at the time, Ray and I were, we'd realized that there was going to be a massive opportunity in the market to... create an energy drink. We'd seen Purdy's, which basically, let's face it, does nothing. I mean, Purdy's, I mean, you know, it's like water, beautiful stuff, but it doesn't do anything. We were selling it in clubs going, this stuff will get you high. And everyone was going, yeah, love it. And we were thinking to ourselves, if we had something that actually really did get them, like a little bit boosted by somehow. So did a bit of research on And that's what I went to Palumbo with. And I said, I want to do an energy drink. And he just wasn't interested. So after we'd exhausted that discussion, he said to me, what else you got? I said, well, I got a club. And that's what we did. And pretty much started immediately. Was James someone at that time familiar with club culture or was he just from the outside looking in? He knew as much about club culture as I did about merchant. banking nothing to clarify yes i can count it about eight and a half um so how did you sell him on this thing then if he you know if he wasn't invested in the culture i'm a good salesman and i uh also i think the concept was so powerful and so bonkers they had the cojones to do it i mean you know i went to school with piers adam Love the guys. Dear old friend of mine. I went to him a little bit further in when the project was going on to see if he wanted to invest. And I explained to him what I was doing. I said, I'm going to open up a club in the Elephant Castle, which obviously when I spoke to James wasn't even there. But I went to Piers with... Elephant Castle, no alcohol up all night. He said, you're bonkers. You're going to lose all your money. Forget about it. He almost threw me out of his apartment. But somehow James and Humphrey, and I have to say it was James initially, but it was Humphrey's belief in me and my insanity to do this thing. It was just about, it has to be like that. This way, Justin's way or, you know. So he was with me. He believed in what I was saying. And because of that belief, it happened. Probably any other set of people, it wouldn't have happened. Ministry of Sound existed because of the incredibly strange energy between the three of us. And it seems like when you were looking to find the initial venue, you had a very specific set of criteria for the venue. Can you just talk us through those? The first was not to have any residents within 200 metres of the front door or any door. So that basically cuts out 97% of any place in London. It really brought it down. I then spent six months doing the knowledge, driving around London. driving down all the roads, all the streets, checking out what was what. Every time there was a residential block of any sort, just that area was gone. We gave ourselves a really rigid... We almost got to the point where we'd stuck a rod up our own back. We really hadn't... We'd got to the point where we didn't think we were going to make it. The project was almost faltering at one point, and then all of a sudden, just out the corner of my... I drove past Corn Street and that was it and when I walked in it it was instant it was love at first sight I knew that was it there was no question that was it with all the problems that I had I mean as a glass roof who builds a club with a glass roof I mean Christ especially one that was built 100 years before the club opened So describe walking in there for the first time. What did it look like before you took it over? You're mentioning a glass roof. Can you just describe the structure? Well, it was a sunny day, thank God. So probably when I went in there, it had more light in there. So it had this wow moment. See, it was a petrol station at some point, probably 100 years before, and it had been used for many different things. But when I went in there, it was just a car park. So I literally just walked in there, a bit trespassing, just walked in there, had a look at it, walked through what was the back part of the garage and then into what is now 103. And yeah, it was that wow moment. There were like 10 cars parked in there and then just loads of pigeon shit and loads of pigeons and that was it. It was just empty derrida. bit of land that people have built around and forgotten about so you opened in 1991 um i'm really interested because you know you kicked it off and you had no alcohol and a 24-hour license from from pretty much from the start correct but that era you know 1989 we're talking like tabloid press you know scare stories about ecstasy and raves and all these kind of things um How did you convince the local authorities that this is what London needed right now, an all-night dance club? First of all, we angled ourselves from the beginning not to be, we never used the word nightclub. When we approached all the councils, we always approached ourselves as a dance studio. We called ourselves Dance Studio UK. So we didn't smell of a rave or of ecstasy and people wearing colourful shirts. But it's an interesting point, which I'll come to in a second. When we actually went for the license, we had the huge advantage of Clink Street going up for the same license before us. They presented. the perfect example of the way not to present and then we went and did the perfect example of the way to present because we were prepared we'd been preparing for months and just to interject there people might not know Clink Street is Mr C's absolutely nuts kind of acid house rave right i don't know if c was involved i don't know if richard was involved at that level i don't know if it was his but it was the owners of clink street that were looking to get a proper license because up until then it was five stories of recording studios with, I believe, no fire exits. And I've been in there many times, you know, worse for wear and thinking to myself, if someone molotov'd the front door, everyone will fry. It would be horrific. That was one of the reasons why I went and built ministry because we were going to all these places and you always felt, in the back of your head, this could be, you know, we could all die in here. It wasn't safe. That element was quite big. And then things started going So, you know, that was the main impetus to actually build the club, create a home for all of these nomadic ravers that wanted a ghost song, which was actually safe. and not get, you know, not have a horrible time. So, Clink, which was brilliant, went in there, but they didn't really do a great performance. But what was brilliant was that the police shot themselves in the foot, in through that Clink Street thing, and then into ours, because they came up with these rather racist, almost, anti-raver comments, and they were talking about all these ravers wearing colourful shirts and stuff like that. And there was a lady on the committee who was dressed in African cultural clothes. And she was getting particularly upset. So she was totally going to give us the license. She hated the cops because they were talking about these drugged up ravers wearing colorful clothes. And she was like, what, like me? And she got really offended by them. So they thought we were going to go in there and we were going to get a music and dance license. It's not an alcohol license. always thinking that we were going to get a music and dance license. And we were saying we wanted 24-hour music and dance. They probably... thought to ourselves well you know when they get the alcohol license they'll be limited to that but we didn't get an alcohol license we didn't want one we wanted the m&d we want the 24-hour music m&d music and dance that was the key and when we got it we were off when you opened was there any confusion as to you know how you guys were going to operate run this space without an alcohol license did Did the media understand it? Did clubbers understand it? Because it's something that's very, almost the antithesis of British nighttime culture, no drink. With the benefit of hindsight, I now no longer drink. And I have to say, I have much more fun when I have no alcohol in my bloodstream. I think it was possibly one of the reasons why the club was so bloody successful. Clearly, no one was sober. I mean, let's not, you know, pretend here. Everyone was off their tits. But there was no liquor in them, or at least there was some consumed before coming in. But that wore off and there was no alcohol. And the alcohol, the lack of alcohol made the vibe so good and so positive. So that's it. So why do we not have alcohol and why do we do all that? It was just, you know, it worked. And I think when they got the alcohol license, I was quite disappointed. If you go to, you go to a lot of clubs nowadays, there's not that much alcohol being bought in the raving clubs. There's not that much alcohol being bought because people know if you're off your nut on ketamine, you start drinking shots of vodka. You're going to die, mate. End You know, your heart's going to stop. So, you know, people don't drink alcohol. And let's face it. I mean, I've just been six years in the alcohol business. It's a grim, grim product. I have friends of mine who are alcoholic anonymous at meetings and stuff like that. And it's a grim, grim product. So I have to say, doing it with alcohol, I think, was a revolutionary thing. But it was probably what made it work and why the club was so fun. Also, the formula of the garage was also alcohol-free as well. We had jelly shots with liquor in it at the end of the bar, so I can't be purist. The garage was pure, pure, pure. What I wanted to do with Ministry of Sound was do the garage, but I couldn't do it because of commercial things. Not everyone was going down that route of free drinks because you got into the garage, you paid whatever it was, 20 bucks, 25 bucks to get through the door. You didn't need money after that. OK, all the drinks that you got were on the bar for free. You could get your scoop of your fruit juice or water and your fruit and your coffee. It was all free. Ministry was commercial. Not what I wanted to do, but it was what was done. Therefore, you know, it started that way. But you know what? I think it cost three people to buy a bottle of water and we sold them for a pound. So 97% markup on drinks isn't bad. I think a lot of, you know have that and um one thing that was interesting about the ministry of sound is how you were probably one of the first clubs in the uk to really put the sound system at the forefront um can you tell us about how you went and found the sound system that became the ministry of sound system i started doing some research and found a company called nightwing and kenny powers who's was at that point as far as I could tell, the only existing Richard Long associate still active. He was working out of Nightwing. So I hooked up with Kenny and then we just discussed the whole concept of building a Paradise Garage sound system in London. Now, the sound system is one element. But what's also important is the actual room it's in and the box, the Keith Slaughter designed box. So Keith Slaughter at the time was the number one recording studio guy. And he gave us the concept. So when we put that into the heads of the sound system guys, they suddenly realized that we were pretty serious. As time moved along, Austin became more and more hands on with it. And Kenny kind of stepped back a bit. And we ended up with Austin coming over. and doing the full install. At the end of the day, it was just the most incredible sound system. When we opened the first night, one of the crossovers broke and we only had left. We didn't have a right. It was in mono, one side. No one even could tell it was that great. So when we actually got the full stereo out, my head's blown off. But, you know, we went down the route. We spoke to loads of people. I'd been working with Turbo Sound in heaven. You know, a lot of the other speakers are out there. But for me, I had to get an RLA system, something similar to what was in the garage. And I think the power of it is notable. Famously, as you're walking, excessive sound levels is... a big warning sign, but that danger is actually relatively real. You know, if you did turn it up full way, it's probably worth stressing that how, just how powerful that sound system was when you first built it. Yeah, it was pretty insane. It was a 1950s Formula One car. It will kill you if you don't treat it with total respect. And it was the running joke. Every DJ that came in to play it, we would be like, don't turn it to 10 because you'll die and everyone else will as well. So I think we got 156 dB before distortion, which is pretty loud. So the opening night, how did you promote the opening night? You've got this amazing sound system. You've got this fantastic space. How did you tell the London people about that? We selected three magazines, listings, timeout. My memory, I have to say, is not good. And I can't remember the others, but I think it was L. But I really can't remember. And then there was a guy's magazine. We won't think for face or ID, but I just don't remember. It's too long ago. But at the end of the day, we picked three magazines. And we told them what we were, who we were, but we didn't tell them where we were. They had an opening date, but no one knew where we were. It was the address was secret. And that was one of the advantages of being down there with virtually no one to drive past. Who drives down Gaunt Street? I mean, you know, but I think before ministry, there was grass on the road. So it was like. You know, it was, I went round to all of the clubs and selected a thousand members. So I went round with all of my friends and basically handpicked the people I wanted to bring in for the first. They were all invited by post. And they were the only people in London who knew where it was. And they came. And when they left, they told 10 friends who told 10 friends. And before you knew it, half London knew where we were and everything. But it was word of mouth, pre-internet, obviously. And those opening nights, how many did you do before it started really nailing it? One, two? The third week we had roadblock. Nothing could drive past. The Saturdays were massively successful. The Fridays were suffered a bit at the beginning for the success of Saturdays, but then they started to get going as well. But it was pretty fast. And you were certainly one of the first European clubs to start bringing over US DJs. Can you tell us about some of the DJs that you asked to come over and sort of the impact that had on London itself? Yeah, I think it's fair to say, I mean, I may be wrong on this, but I think it's fair to say that the Japanese invented the importing of American DJs. So I would say that they were the ones that really, really... like made that into a skill. We then took that and developed it even further. But Delirium really were the first ones to bring over the DJs, the Americans. So that was Noel Watson. And having been at a few Deliriums and seeing Frankie Knuckles and Tony Humphries and these guys, it just made sense to... to start bringing in a regular foreign DJ every week. I have no idea where that idea came from, but it just happened. And it just, you know, we just decided to do it and to bring in a regular DJ. And, well, first of all, I approached Judy Weinstein so that I could get her boys in. And she was really helpful and really sweet. And then I asked her about helping me getting Larry and she said, well, you know, it's, you know, you kind of, no one knows really where he is. So I had to go and find him. And I was just very lucky to bump into him in the shelter and explain to him what I was doing and got him to give me his details. And I got in touch with his Japanese, Yuki, who was his manager at the time. And I got his... I got all of that sorted out and brought him over. Of course the story is well documented about how he turned up eight days late and all that kind of stuff. The DJ that came over with him actually arrived on time. That was Victor Rosado. And Victor was actually, I think, the first American DJ to play in the ministry. The night that LaVanne was supposed to have played, but turned up late. And then it was just all the others. It was, you know, obviously, Deaf Mix, you know, Sanchez, Humphries, all the obvious guys. There were some people I wanted to bring who never came. Merlin Bob was one DJ that I would love to have had because I think for me, he was probably the greatest radio DJ I'd ever heard. The sets that he played on WBLS were just mind-boggling, between him and Timmy. Regis Ford, I wanted to come over as well, but we didn't get him at the beginning. I think he came over to play later. Bobby Condors played at the beginning with Todd Terry. That's quite outstanding. There was no rhyme or reason. It was just kind of like, you know, whoever we could think of and just like, oh, let's get him. And then people would suggest. You know, Austin told me, you've got to get Kenny Carpenter. He's great. So I got Kenny to play and he was. Someone would say, oh, you've got to give this guy a call. You've got to give that guy a call. So Steve Silk Hurley comes and, you know, just slowly, slowly built up. But that was one of the biggest differences in the garage and the ministry was I wanted open decks. The garage was very, very, very secure, that booth, and you couldn't get in there to DJ. It was very difficult to get your hands on those decks, and very few people played there. If you think how many people have played the ministry and how many people have played the garage, it's a ratio of 1 to 20,000. Do you know what I mean? It's got to be 100,000 DJs have played ministry and like 10 have played the garage. I don't know how many it is, but it's, you know, it's tiny. I didn't want to hog it for myself. I wanted it to be a, I wanted to learn for myself. I needed so much to learn as well. I didn't know much. I was still very much at the infancy of my career. So I also wanted these guys to come over so Fantastic. And maybe to speak specifically about the time you got Larry over, like I read that he really loved it and stayed for three months, which was a long time as well. But on the other side of things, I read that he wasn't in a particularly good way when he came, you know, obviously addicted to heroin at that time, I believe, or had he sold his records as well at that point? I think that when I met Larry, finally, because I'd been seeing Larry DJing at the garage, okay, and I'd never met him. So it was just this figurehead, this person that was playing, whatnot. Then when I finally met with him, first of all, my first initial thing was, what a lovely guy. You know, he's got a terrible reputation for being awful. And he was so sweet and nice and friendly and gentle. And funny, I think he was at his utter low ebb because he'd been resident DJ of what was, you know, is now the greatest club probably of all time. And he probably felt that. And he wasn't playing anywhere. And I can relate to it because I've been in those shoes myself. So I know exactly how he felt. It's pretty grim. Well, you fall off the cliff and you hit the rocks at the bottom. So, you know, I can relate to the way he was. But when he came over, he wasn't. The way he was was the way he was. He was always like that and he didn't change. He just was the way he was. He came over and he got a new lease of life. New York had eaten him up and spat him out. And he came to London and he just discovered a place where people wanted to know him, loved him, had fun with him. He was having fun and he just didn't want to leave. So that's what it was, you know, and he had great time. So it was an amazing three months and it was an incredible experience. And he met so many people and enriched so many people's lives. I don't know whether he felt, I mean, you know, he obviously knew that he wasn't well. So he knew that there was an end coming and it was probably sooner than for most. And there was this need or this want to share his knowledge and his experiences. And he was really keen to explain anything to anyone that asked. If you said, Larry, how'd you do it? It's bought you to death. It took three hours and I did it. But boy, did he explain. Explain exactly how it's done. And you'd leave, you know, with a diploma and what you've just asked him. So he's very generous with his knowledge. Oh, extremely. There was no way that he wouldn't. You know, there are some people who are jealous about knowledge and they won't tell you anything and they don't, well, I can't give you that record or anything like that. He'd give you everything. He didn't want anything. He was a totally, you know, as far as I'm concerned, he was completely unmaterialistic. The records were, to him, were irrelevant. I mean, clearly, you know, he probably, back in the days, he got rid of them because, you know, he was And of course, people found them and gave them back to him, bought them and gave them back to him. There's this cycle going on in New York, which has been well documented. But when he came that night and he writes six o'clock in the morning and 18 hours later, he's playing the most blinding set that anyone's ever heard, records he's borrowed off three DJs. So he didn't really need them. No. He just had it. It's fascinating. One connection that came around that time, which is, you know, also well documented, but I find very interesting because, you know, you were a big part in making this happen, was DJ Harvey, who was a resident of the club. Yes, the Basset. Yes. Yes. And who met Darryl Van through that way. I guess, you know. Harvey, when did you first come across him? Because he was one of the original residents at Ministry, right? Do you know what? I don't know. All I know is that I knew Harvey when Levan arrived here. I don't know how long before that I knew Harvey. I think every country has their genius DJ. And I think Harvey's ours, like Flavio Vecchi is Italy's and Levan was America's. These guys are just, they're in a parallel universe. I mean, they're just So he was always going to be like, had to be part of it. But when I met him, I really don't know. We probably have, you know, partied too hard together, him and me, over the years. But I've got an ultimate respect for the man. I think he's an absolute genius. And I'm jealous that the Americans have got him. Yeah. Well, you know, he's like our star on the other side now. Yeah, he is. I mean, you know, he's reputation but he's we need him back really because musically he's got so much to offer you know he's coming back regularly he's now it was good to see him at the ministry he's back at XOYO soon as well so you know it's uh it's good that he's back more often do you have any uh particular memories of those early days with um Harvey playing at the club I read that he was very eclectic when he would close out the club and things like that Harvey installed some eclecticism, if that's a word, into our general vibe of the club. And what it did is that everyone started taking more and more risks musically and the people went with it. And you had some really insane moments where people were... playing classical music, Nirvana, all kinds of stuff in the middle of house sets. And people went for it. So I think Harvey and Levan, both of them in a way, kind of gave people a little bit more courage to really take the piss. And I think that came out as well. So again... It was a little bit more that people were willing to take them at risk because the people were up for it. And, you know, I had my mate Jimmy B, the one I told you about at the beginning, you know, the one from New York. And Jimmy was a terrible DJ. He couldn't play a mix of two records. He'd be playing a hip hop record and a house record together and there were beats all over the place and no one cared. It was just whatever. It was like, he'll get over And he thought it was brilliant and everyone was just laughing and then he got on and the party would always work and there was no negative judgment. Oh God, listen to that mix. What's that record? It wasn't really that going on. Everyone's off their nut on E and having so much fun. It was just like, oh, whatever, you know, he'll get over it. I've actually found that sense of fun just when someone fucks up in a party can sometimes be the best part. Yeah, exactly. You know, it's obsession about perfection a bit too much today. It's the rawness and the madness that's fun. You know, I mean, Levan dropped a... I mean, the famous rainstorm moment in the garage where he dropped a rainstorm for a huge amount of time and then he was playing, you know, obviously... the finally record where he played finally for ages and ages and ages and that was that was a joke but it was just you know people were working this out and seeing that it was more than just putting records together and it was about you know creating moments So speaking of nuts things, I was reading back, researching, and some of the marketing campaigns you guys did at Ministry of Sound sounded pretty nuts. Beaming your logo onto the Houses of Parliament was one, Buckingham Palace was another. Yeah, we did the Houses of Parliament, which were literally a huge light, searchlight in the back of a truck. Tell all the journalists to arrive at a certain time. Truck arrives, back doors open, beamed on the thing, photographs drive off. The whole thing lasted a minute. Whose idea was that? I cannot remember whose idea that was. A lot of these ideas sort of started off with someone's mad idea that then got beaten into something that actually worked. So I can't remember. I don't think anyone will. I mean, if anyone takes credit. for that they're probably lying I don't remember I think it was a combined teamwork because at the time we were uh Lynn Cosgrave Jim Masters Jason Hill myself and occasionally Bert Bevins were sitting on the top of this arch which is now a fridge um and we were sitting there trying to work out what banders to do and it was these were the sort of crazy stuff that we came up with so You run the club from 1990 to 1994. I just wondered, what do you think was the winning formula of Ministry of Sound that made it so successful? You had the crowd, you had space. Are there other elements that really made it work? Look, a club's only going to be as good as its weakest part, and it's the crowd with the key. especially year two. It's 92, the 92, 93 crowd. The initial crowd were kind of like, they were kind of a bit like the West End crowd of today. And they came, they checked it out, they enjoyed it. And then after a year they left and they went back to their places like Tramps and whatnot. The second year crowd were the honest, real hardcore into the music and genuine nutcases that would be there from the beginning to the end. And that was the truest crowd that I've ever seen in London. The only crowd that's as good as that was the one in Naples for me, in terms of me DJing. The crowd in London year two was brilliant and they were so up for it. The quality of the DJs was outstanding and it was the relationship between crowd and DJ. And that's the interesting thing, you know, initially attracting that audience, but maintaining them and keeping them interested in the club and making them feel like they're part of it. How did you do that? Was that really hard to do? I don't think so. I can't say for the others, but I hope that they felt the same way about the club that I did about the garage, that you didn't even question whether you were going to go. It was just what time. You know, we never even thought about not going. So I don't know. I mean, some people have said that to me over the years, and I hope that's true because it's an incredibly... It's a lovely thing to hear that I could have done that with ministry as I'd experienced myself at the garage. But I think it was just the fact that it was a family. It was home. You know, so many people, they would, and there were a number of crowds that came. You'd have the early crowd that would come in, and then there would be gone by four, and then there would be the second crowd that came a bit later on and stayed until made near the end, and then you'd get the the DJs, the promoters, and whatnot, bartenders. And then they would come around 5, 6 in the morning. So you'd have all these different waves of people, and people would come and go. So there would be a movement of stuff, and there would be, you know, like three or four different nights in the night. You go to a club now, it's the same people. If you go to a small club, you know, it's the same sort of people. The club will last, what But of course, I think it was the DJs. I really do. I think the DJs of that era at that time were just working and the crowd. And I think we booked the right DJs and we brought in the right people. I think that's it. But I can't underestimate that it's the people. You know, the term Superclub, by the time you leave in 1994, is almost an established phrase. What did you think about that phrase? And Ministry of Sound were in many ways the first. Yeah, I think the Paradise Garage was the first because they made records. So it was a club, it was a great club and they had... And the music that they were doing was coming out on their label. So when we built Ministry, I think initially, I think we ever discussed really at the beginning that we were going to become a record label. And then it was just one day we said, hey, why don't we do a compilation? Jim and I sat down and basically built up the list of the records that were being played in the box at that time. We put the records that were being played that everyone was loving and got Tony to mix it. So it was made. It was something that was completely from the dance floor, from the DJ booth, from the people to the people. You know, I didn't intend to make a super club and I don't really know what a super club means. For me, it doesn't really have any particularly positive... I think the super club thing was... pretty much like that sort of rule Britannia kind of like Tony Blair, everything's wonderful, aren't we great, and blow smoke up our own arses for the next 10 years. I think we were completely, you know, off our nuts thinking how wonderful we were. And I think the super club thing was just a negative thing. Clubbing needs to be underground. needs to come from the underground. It's the font of so many important industries. Obviously music's key, but fashion and all kinds of things come from nightclubs. So if it gets commercialized and turns into, if all the clubs would turn into superclubs, we'd all live in shopping malls. There's no villages and markets anymore. A club like ministry becoming a superclub. was interesting and the fact that it is the only, I think, super club left really. In 1994, you left Ministry of Sound. Why did you end up leaving something that you put so much effort into, you know, starting, founding, all the rest of it? I didn't leave in 94. I stopped working at Ministry in about 96. But I stopped being resident in 94. And they created a night called Ruling. And I remember the meeting clearly that I was presented with this thing about ruling. And I was presented with who the new DJs were. And I wasn't one of them. And that's kind of how it was presented. And that was it. So it was a sort of like nice, soft padded elbow out the door. And it was that was the way it went. You know, just the way the ministry went. You know, people came in with incredible ambitions and sometimes people were in the way. And I was obviously in the way of someone and I slowly was moved, moved out to pasture. But I suppose afterwards, you know, you weren't totally out to pasture. You know, you still had a. pretty successful DJ career. Oh, yeah, yeah, clearly. Because after that, I moved out of there and I started DJing around the world and I had an incredible DJ experience. But ministry, like all the big businesses, is, you know, is always going to have a massive amount of politics involved. I mean, and once I got out of that massive business and started working on my own and going out, it was, it was, it was quite liberating and quite, you know, quite nice to just travel around the world. But, you know, I had this huge. banner, this tag that I could, you know, sell myself under and work under. And it allowed me to play in some of the most incredible parties. You know, it allowed me to do that. I'm pleased that I left. If I'd stayed there and just been resident, I wouldn't have had those experiences. I was just about to say that, you know, in retrospect, you know, how long can a residency last for? anyway you know it all has to come to an end at some point so logically you would have had to make that move at some point it perhaps just came a little bit sooner than you might have originally envisaged I'd done my apprenticeship, you know, I almost built the club to do my own apprenticeship in a way, you know, so that I could learn my trade and understand what was going on from all these geniuses and these amazing DJs. And then I could go off and do it myself. I guess that's what, without really thinking about it, that's what I did. Interestingly, your relationship with ministry didn't end there. rejoined in 2006 is that right to relaunch some clubs around the world can you tell us a little bit about that you know ministry went on their journey and I went on mine and we didn't really see eye to eye for a good five or six years and then there was a rapprochement and we started to talk again and it was about 93 that we started just to have little dabbles of this and the other together and sort of thing. And then 94, the discussion started coming about that point. They'd been building already there. I think they built a club in Thailand, in Thailand, in Bangkok, and another one in Taipei, Taiwan. And they were building the third one. I think, I think it was their third one at this point they were building in Singapore. And I was given the call last to come out and check it out, give my opinions on it. And when I got out there, I realized that franchisee was about to stick in a line array. I was basically not interested in making it unauthentic. So I then made it my raison d'etre to try and convince this guy that a minister. without a stack system. It's not a ministry. And he was building something that wasn't, he was not really buying it. And then all of a sudden, Zouk decided to put in a Gary Stewart system. And he gave me the angle and the guy said to me, okay, so we got it. So we got the stacks in there and then it became a real ministry. And we got the DJs from the local area who were really lovely guys and we built a team around it. And it really became, and it had a little, there was a little family going on. It was a really nice vibe. Some little bits, you know, bits of infighting as there's always going to be and jealousy between DJs. But it was really a nice vibe and it was a microcosm of what we'd done at London so many years back. And we're all still mates and we're still in contact. It's a really lovely thing. We did the same again in Kuala Lumpur the following year. But then the crisis came and the crash came and they decided not to make any more clubs. Interestingly, we're getting close towards 25th anniversary now. Yeah. Ministry of Sound. Did you ever think that, you know, something that you created? would last that long. I don't think you have a child and think your kid's going to live till 50 or 22. I think for me, birthing ministry, and I use the word birthing specifically because it is an emotional experience and I have an emotional attachment to that club. way more than I should or that's healthy for me. I feel like a parent to that club and I never expected it to live a year or five years or 50 years. You don't have children thinking that they're going to live for a certain time period. So I didn't know how long it was going to survive. Even up until probably a month before it opened, I didn't think it was going to open. Then when it opened, I didn't think it was going to stay open for very long. It was always, you never really knew. But no, I'm pretty shocked it's 25. And I think realistically now that it's 25, it's no reason why it won't just carry on going. I can't really see any reason why it shouldn't. It's just important thing is to keep it real and to keep the music at That's the most important thing. As long as they keep that as the focus, then it should last forever. And it's interesting that, you know, it seems like, you know, not to be disparaging about Ministry of Sound, but it seems like they're trying to bring back music to the forefront, booking people like DJ Harvey, you know, Kerry Chandler, the Larry Levan celebration wasn't that long ago. Do you see a bright future for that side of things, the way they're kind of booking things at the There are hot periods when there are club wars and it's really difficult to bring in all the top DJs because some other people are being extremely difficult about the whole situation. So Ministry have chosen to get a really good quality DJ, but without getting into that sort of that big war between all of the other clubs. So to give it a football analogy, I think they've taken this, they're a bit more like sort of Arsenal than Tottenham than they are one of being a sort of a Chelsea or a Man United where they just want desperately to have to have every single brand new top, top, top. They're more interested in growth from the youth and that kind of stuff. So I think it's a more sustainable. thing but what's happened in the past and what will happen in the future always depends on who's doing what and ministry being a big big company of you know 100 plus people there's always going to be eras depending on who's doing what and who the bookers are and who's doing the promotions and whatnot but yeah I think ministry is definitely trying to push towards you know music becoming more and more important again for the club It's a multifaceted business. They've got lots of different things and they can't always focus on everything. Sometimes the club takes a second backstage when they're thinking about something else. And then this club will get loads of attention and something else gets, you know, it's a very complicated business. Well, it's worth saying, we didn't touch on this, but they run probably one of the world's biggest independent record labels, you know, aside from running this amazing club. That's it. This is it. And the compilation side, I mean, it must be more and more difficult to do because obviously CD sales drop and compilations are what they are and whatnot. But yeah, the independent record label is colossal and we didn't anticipate that at all. You know, everyone always said to me, you know, you've got to make your own label. And I thought I've kind of indirectly made the biggest one in the world, independent one anyway. Yeah, you know, I think the important thing is, is that the music is at the forefront and that there's an evolution or there's a continual evolution with music. And it's not just about looking backwards or concentrating on what's on now, but thinking about what's coming up. And it's just about, you know, I lost the plot there. Well, we've done a lot of looking backwards, but maybe let's look forwards. You know, what's next for you personally? Well, after ministry decided to stop doing clubs, I basically came out of the business and decided to go into something else and try something else. I wanted to, you know, try a whole brand new career in a new industry. And I did that for about five years. in the booze industry and I really enjoyed it. The people were brilliant. The product, I didn't particularly enjoy selling alcohol, but I really, really liked the people I was working with. I couldn't stay away and I got more and more gigs, more and more... I just wanted to come back. I just couldn't stay away. I couldn't. It wasn't what I was. And so I've just filtered my entire record collection. I'm going through the whole record collection, sorting out an interesting new set of bits and pieces that have got lost in time and that kind of stuff. I'm going to be playing all these gigs around the 25th birthday. And then after that, I've got quite a few decent projects coming up. There's some bits and pieces that are a bit premature to start talking about publicly, but I've got some interesting bits coming up. And you could definitely argue that that 90s house sound is... certainly in vogue right now, you know, probably perhaps more popular than it's been for a very long time. So perhaps not the worst time to be digging back into those old records. One of my favorite people on this planet is David Morales, and he's living in Italy and he's doing a program on TV for DJs. I've seen it. You've seen it. It's great. And what's amazing is that everyone in Italy, except for David Morales, thought that they were going to get an X factor on DJs. The only thing is that no one told David that. And what David's done is he's actually turned this into a serious forum where DJs are actually getting roasted for pretending. And he's actually saying what you need to do to be a real DJ. And a lot of people can't deal with it. And a lot of people don't get it. But he's actually, I think he's doing something that's so worthy and so... I mean, he's going against the grain on it and he's upset a few people, but I think he's an absolute don for doing it. And I think it's so important that he's trying to make people understand that there is a craft in this and it's not just about being pretty, getting a ghostwriter to write loads of production for you, get someone to invest in you and turn you into a DJ. And there will be a day in the future, the way we're going with all this stuff, where the DJ anymore there'll be a DJ in the back playing but that's almost where we're getting to and it's got to go away from that it's got to be about I don't care if my a DJ's got spots or is bald or is ugly. They've got to be playing good music. We've got to have, it's got to be about that. And that's what I love about David is he's actually standing on TV week in, week out and actually, you know, upsetting people saying that. But it's brilliant. Good for him. He's not playing a character at all. He's not playing a character. David is, what you see is what you get. And he'll tell you. I mean, you know, if he doesn't like something, he won't make you happy. He'll be honest. If you ask his opinion, you'll get an honest one. Absolutely. Yeah. So let's finish that question. It was what's what you're doing next. What am I doing next? So I'm going to be DJing over the next six, eight, 10 months when the 25th birthday. It occurred to me this morning that for the 26th birthday, we're going to have to do an alphabet party. So because it's now 26, because once you go on to 25, it's hard to start getting reasons why numbers are getting exciting. But there's 26 numbers in the alphabet ABC party next year I'm working very hard on secret projects that I can't talk about so that's a good enough answer that's a good enough answer you
