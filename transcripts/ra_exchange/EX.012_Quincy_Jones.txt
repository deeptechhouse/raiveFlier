Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. And I'll be honest with you, there are not many interviews... that I do that I bother to tell my parents about, but this was one of them. On this very special edition of R.A.'s Exchange, we present a conversation with the legendary Quincy Jones. It may not have much to do with electronic music culture specifically, but we couldn't pass up the opportunity. From his humble beginnings as a bandmate of Ray Charles, to studying music in a French conservatory, to his groundbreaking movie soundtrack work, to a pop hit or two that you may have heard on the radio well, his biography doesn't need retelling. Listen in as I fumble through a few questions for one of the most famous figures in the world of music. In a recent interview about the AKG headphones, you said the record company business is over. Yes. And I thought for someone like you to be saying that, it's pretty serious. It hurts. It hurts a lot. I've been nosing around all over the world, including the British House of Commons, and it's 95 to 99% piracy. That's pretty bad, especially when it's in China, when they've got numbers like 1,300,000,000 people. That's not good. And out of that, a hit record is a million records. We're in trouble. I can tell just from record sales, though. Black Eyed Peas, you know, they had four number one hits all over the world. Will Iams, a friend, they're all my friends, you know. And they work concerts all the time, everywhere in the world. And that album with four hits in it is two million three. It's a joke. Obviously your new album that you did, you did a kind of innovative thing putting it on cell phones in China, right? Well, we're trying to find new ways. Nobody has the answer. You know, it's got to be reinvented. But I think a good start is... China provides you with the kind of numbers that you can reinvent the business with. There's six online situations over there where I think one's 520 million, another one's 680 million. Those are big numbers. It's bigger than our entire population in America. And so we're going to talk, continue talks with China Mobile and China Unicom. And that's the government agency that's in charge of all the cell phones. Nobody here would have one. Of course not. But everybody in this room has got two cell phones. How many do you have? I've got 19 at home, but I can't bring myself to take them out. because I don't want to be reached all the time. I really don't. I mean, every time. It's astounding that there was change in civilization, don't you think? Do you think that's changed it for the better or the worse? Or is it just a change? Anything that's new and progressive can be pro and con. And it's direct communication. Probably a lot of positive things to say about that. But by the same token, it's got to raise your stress level. Because every time you hear a buzz in your pocket at ringtone, and everywhere you go in the world. So that's something that affects social skills, you know, of people interacting with each other. And I know it's probably the person on the other line sending that text and everything else with it. So who knows, man? This is not new. It's probably happened with telephones, that with stereo records and all of it. It just, it always will continue to move along. And I've always been involved in the higher part of technology because I know all the people that are building our future, you know. And you think this is bad. You haven't seen anything. When nanotechnology gets in, and I work a lot with the people that are doing that, like... Marvin Minsky, co-founder of artificial intelligence, like Russ Kurtzweil. Nicholas Negroponte, who built the $100 wireless computer. They don't need telephone lines, which is great for the third worlds, you know, if they can't afford it. And also working with a lot of water companies that are going to deal with the purification, you know, and it's each thing that comes out. There's a positive and there's a negative, you know. So we just have to move on. We're going to deal with it. It's not new. And they say that everything that you see in a movie will happen. I remember we used to laugh at Buck Rogers. People in space, are you crazy? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha, ha. all over space. And, of course, your song was famously, the one you arranged was famously played. They played it on the moon. Yeah. Yeah, with Sinatra. Buzz Aldrin, he's a good friend of mine. When he didn't know how to tie his tie He stood right there and he had hair So we're just about to roll with the punches, you know, and hope that the message that the most creative and the futuristic scientists that are building all these things, it's not many people, it's like 30 or 40 people that are involved in all of it, you know. color-coded nanotechnology in Cal State, Cal Tech rather, and in nanotechnology, which will be... A trillion transactions a second with a $1,000 computer in 10 years or 9 years. And that's pretty drastic. It's a big, big difference from this phone that's out now. And you're going to laugh at this phone one day. That'll be like the dinosaur of the business. It's a crude, primitive thing, you know. Much in the same way we laugh at phones from 20 years ago. Now we'll be laughing at phones now in 20 years. And I asked Marvin at a TED conference and Charleston, who's a co-founder of artificial intelligence, how much faster the new technology... carbon and hydrogen atoms against silicon and microchips. And I would have been impressed by 100,000 or a million. He said one billion times faster. That's big, man. One of the things, talking about technology, I mean, obviously it's been an important part of your music career in a way, but I guess it's also been... characterized by reverence for the past as well. You sort of combine, you know, these new R&B and hip-hop and all of these things, but you're also doing standards all the time and doing arranging. Everything. You'd studied in Paris. Of course, Nadi Boulanger. Music theory and composition. Was that sort of... Nadi Boulanger. Counterpoint, retrograde inversion, harmony and orchestration, composition, everything. She was Stravinsky's mentor. Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland. She's the best composition teacher I think that ever lived. Did you know much about it before you went to school there? Yeah. That's why I kept going. And she said it herself. She said, I can't treat you like... to other classical students because you've already been corrupted by Ray Charles years ago. I was working four nightclubs a night when I was 13. She said jazz musicians are strange because they shack up with music first and then they court it and marry it later and learn what all of the rules are about. Coltrane always had a book with Slomowski. book on Melodic patterns, you know, he was always with that book, you know. And that happened since bebop, when everything changed, you know. You can hear it with the titles, you know. We went from Cement Mixer, Putty Putty, to Open the Door, Richard, and all those things which are kind of naive when you think about Charlie Parker's epistrophe and ornithology. those things that there was a whole different intellectual level that came in. They didn't want to be entertainers anymore. They wanted to be pure artists, you know. And they went, they revolutionized music. They really did. But at the cost of running over the heads of the public and the public... deserted it, you know. One of the things you said in an interview with Downbeat Magazine years and years ago is that, you know, a lot of people ignored popular music and didn't want to, you know, try to make it better. And one of the things that you, that was your effort was to go in and try to bring what you could do to popular music. Right. a new life. Was there a stigma, you know, among the jazz people that you were friends with, you know, you going in a more popular direction? Well, at one point, in probably the last of the 60s, everybody did. We had a little group that was Herbie Hancock, Cannonball, myself, Miles Davis. always say they ain't playing nothing. So how come we're sitting here at Charlie's Tavern on Saturday night with no jobs? And that's when rock and roll had taken over, you know, in the mid-50s, you know. I've seen a lot of transitions, you know. One of the bigger breaks commercially, I guess, as far as your career early on. I feel like after you were sitting around with these guys was when you start to do soundtrack work. How did you get involved? I wanted to do it since I was 15 years old. I used to play hooky and go down to the nearest Skid Row in Seattle and pay 11 cents to go to the movies. And somehow, after watching so many movies, I could identify the almost editorial policy of a... Alfred Newman at 20th Century Fox. And I later worked at all these studios. And the Paramount Pictures with Victor Young, Stanley Wilson at RKO. I could tell. And the guy that did the most pictures was the most influential sound at each studio. And that's how all the other composers, that's who they trailed behind in a sense. Alfred called me when I first came out there. We had something called the Rollers Club, you know. It's the young jazz, the dance band musicians like Mancini and Johnny Mandel. All of us were jazz, the dance band arrangers first, you know. And we had a Rollers Club, and that was just our little, funny little name for rolling around on the piano trying to find a good idea, you know. Alfred Newman heard about it after he had done 408 movies. I said, I've heard about the Rollers Club. I want to be a part of the Rollers Club. Because all the guys out here try to pretend like it's easy. And it's not easy at all. And he was a very gracious man. And he said, we have a 530, what do you call it? holy hour or whatever it is. So it was hard drinking at 5.30 every day, you know, out of his home on Sunset Boulevard. And he was a great mentor to me, like Armando Travioli was, like Henry Mancini was. The guys that had done it before, you know. Because I used to look at these movies when I was 15. No black composers, none. You'd see maybe songs by Benny Goodman and Snowza Kilimanjaro, and he'd get a credit and enroll and so forth. But single card credits, you know, very rare. I think Duke Ellington was the only one that had two. He did two other Primminger films. But I was always, I was in art first, you know, and I've always connected. It's a thing of art with music and all. Even with music today, when I start working on a piece, I think in terms of a charcoal sketch. Then as it develops, you get bass lines and more harmony and maybe melody. You go to watercolors. And then after you get the counter lines and everything else, you go to oil. It's a psychological thing in the head. It may be crazy, but it works. Are there visual artists in particular that you admire? Many, many. When I first went to Paris, they told me, don't go to Paris, everybody's down in the south of France. Eddie Barclay, I was the musical director for him before I studied with Boulanger. I said I want to get ready for the fall when everybody comes back, and so I was getting my copies together and getting more technical. the systems together. And I put my clothes in the cleaners. And when I went back to pick them up, I said, see you in September. So I better listen to Eddie and go on down to Cannes. And I moved in a villa with him in Cannes in 1957. And next door was the California. Picasso was living there, you know, and Jacqueline. And so later on. after he died, we had a little start to correspond. She wrote me a letter that really blew my mind. And it had the cards that Picasso, the pictures that Picasso had painted of her. So naturally, it was one of my idols, I think. We used to call Miles Davis the Picasso of jazz. Because they remind me a lot of each other. The visual and the oral similarities, you know, views of space and air. He went through the blue periods, you know, primitive and all that. It all seems to go together, you know. It seems to fit, you know. Speaking of fitting, the AKG partnership or sponsorship or whatever you call it that you've done, it seems interesting in the context of this. All these people doing headphones now because you've been already partnered with them for however many years using their headphones. It's not. All my career amounts. In fact, I can't remember ever being in the studio without JBL's headphones. They found some pictures of me. almost 30 years ago, you know, with those headphones on. And we've both been in the business for 60 years. So there's something almost spiritual about it, you know. But there's nothing like the best. I don't care what it is. I don't even drive a car, you know, but I've been in a Maybach. I can't even drive a Ford, you know. It's common goals really of how you treat the highs strata, the low strata. If you do 3D and a buoyancy in the middle then it's hard to put words to these things. It's the feeling, it's the sound. Can you tell me about what you might have coming up musically? I know you put out an album, I guess it was earlier this year. Well, I'm doing, I told you, I wanted to do a hip-hop album. The hip-hop's doing a tribute to my old songs. I've really got a lot of people on that, all the way from Snoop Dogg to Ludacris. Amy Winehouse. I'm also working on an album with a producer with Tony Bennett and Stevie Wonder. Great songs. Great songs. We'd like to get Stevie in the studio. And also Joe Pesci. He was a fantastic jazz singer. Really? Absolutely. He's been singing since he was eight, you know. Tommy Mottola, De Niro, and he and I used to hang out for over 17 years before I discovered this, you know. And one day he said, Kill, I want you to hear my new record. I said, man, this is my only day off, you know. I listened to one and he blew my mind, blew it away. Cause his pitch and phrasing, you know, you can't fake jazz, you know, not as a singer. He's got ears, man. You know what I mean? Perfect ears and pitch. I was shocked, really shocked. He looked like him, you know, or sounded like him. But he's astounding. He was influenced by Jimmy Scott, who was with Lionel Hampton's band, who was my roommate when I was with Lionel Hampton. He was a great singer. Very special style. He was from Columbus, Ohio. And Joe was obviously influenced by him a lot. He's something else. Speaking of Lionel, you toured with him? Lionel Hampton? Yeah. Yeah, 19 years old. That's when I first came to Europe. When I first came to Berlin, I came with Lionel. And since then, I've worked with Nat Cole with my band, and many times with my band alone here. At Montreux, we'd use the WDR band in Cologne, George Grumps, you know. He comes to Montreux. You were playing trumpet, correct? When did you realize that you weren't Miles Davis as a trumpet player? I never thought I was. It wasn't a realization. I started, I played every brass instrument in the section. sousaphone, French horn, B flat baritone, flat alto, trombone, and then I went to trumpet. And I was playing full-fledged 14 trumpet. And I answered that question when we were in Stockholm. We begged him to hire Benny Golson and Gigi Grice and Clifford Brown when we heard them in Atlantic City. with a Larry Steele show. And so I sat next to Clifford for a year and a half, and we were really close. He was serious, serious trumpet player. And he only lived to 25. Can you imagine how he would have been if he had lived longer? He used to scare miles to death at Birdland. He did. Because he played like a saxophone. He had that kind of fluidity. And I remember Clifford said he wanted to write, you know, but he found himself playing more than he wrote. And I said the same thing. I find myself wanting to write on the score paper more than on the horn. And so we made a handshake and said, okay, you take care of the horn and take care of the arrangements, you know. We used to laugh about that in Lionel Hampton's band. It was just something that was in me from the first day I picked up the horn. I could hear all these instruments, you know, that weren't even playing, but it was in my head, you know, French My favorite combination of horns, if I had to pick my all-time favorite combination, it would be four flugelhorns, three alto flutes, a bass flute. four French horns, four trombones, and a tuba. That to me is heaven. Soft, and overbrought. Orchestration is something that, it's like painting. It really is. You use four sardino violas, overbrought, and three alto flutes, and trumpet. with a harmonium in it with the stem pulled out. I mean, you could go on painting forever, you know, with those sounds. And I've always had that attitude about orchestration, you know. It's just something that's... deep in my soul. I love it. I started listening to what Duke did. And Nadi Boulanger said, until they have 13 notes, there's only 12, until they have 13, learn what everybody did. I mean, and I got it from Shostakovich, to Stravinsky, Rinsky-Korsakov, who influenced Ravel. Ravel had a virtuoso style of orchestration. I mean, that's the first one that Nadia told me when I asked her about orchestration. She said, "Before we talk about it, I want you to transpose back to C, the key of C, the entire symphony orchestra. Get all those instruments back in concert." And it ends up on a six-line sketch, which was great because we started to do movies and we had to deal with art. orchestrators, you had to make it clear so they couldn't change your sound. It was very specific. Xylophone and two piccolos. You can't change that. And you could write a six-line sketch and note how you want it played, because you don't have time to sit and say, "Da-da!" for 120 musicians for a whole 45-minute movie score. You'd be there for a year. So Johnny Williams and everybody, Mancini, everybody who was orchestrated was Alfred Newman. You didn't have the time to sit there to write out all of the concert parts, I mean the transpose parts. And she said, to transpose. bring all of the Ravels, Daphnis and Chloe, down to concert. First 25 bars. I did that, and then she said, now transpose all 11 half steps, even when you run out of the range of the instruments. And I understood what she meant, because I understood half of the thing. I wanted to know when I finished, you know, such as the sustaining power of French arms, but no attack. And so Ravel would put the French arms, and the attack we'd do would double stop, Violi and Celli, and maybe a harp. And they would do the sustain, and you couldn't tell. whether it was a French horn attack or not, you know. But he was a genius with orchestration. He'd go from piccolo all the way down to E flat, contrabass, clarinet, you know. And I was working in France, so I could experiment with, after working with Harry Lukowski, he used to be the concertmaster for Toscanini, and I met him when I was 15 in Seattle. And he had his share of classical music, and he said he wanted to play jazz, but he didn't improvise. So we would transcribe solos for every Hancock. or Trix Tillman and learn. We was listening to ABC for eight days to figure out up bow, down bow, portamento, so they could not help but swing. And I had all those conservatory string players in there playing funk, man, going over the bar, learning how to notate it so they could only play it one way. And it's going to feel good and feel a lot of feeling and swing. Did it take a lot of coaxing out of these conservatory players to get them to? No, this is all in the paper. It's all in the paper. I was speaking their language, you know, and to force them to speak my language, you know. They couldn't play it any other way. If they were real conservatory guys, they had to play what's on that paper. And I had it nailed down so they could not, it was force-feeding it to them. They couldn't get out of it because it was so, learning from Harry, you know, we'd take a Hancock solo, like I said before. or toot solo, and Harry would overdub it with 18 violins. And it was fun, because that's what he really wanted to do. was to have the feeling of playing improvised jazz. You put all the nuances down and learn how to put it in musical terms so you can't misunderstand it. In addition to Nadia, I've also read that you worked at the conservatory Messiaen. Messiaen. Messiaen? Olivier Messiaen. Yeah. And who else? He's quite avant-garde, known as a composer, I suppose. Yes, he was. What did you learn from him? I didn't study with him. I just used to go. Okay. He was just there at the same time. I used to go to his classes. Lalo Schiffer went to him. Okay. And Lalo was the one that told me about Nadi when I first met him in Buenos Aires. He and Boulez had, you know, we learned a lot. Was it a completely different, they were completely different lessons than the types of things that Nadia was teaching you? Totally, totally. And only the Schoenberg, you know, and Albenberg and all those people, everybody had to win a different way. Only 12 notes though.
