Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I am the tech editor at Resonant Advisor. This week's exchange sees us return to the iFilm Institute in Amsterdam for the first installment of a series of talks and interviews recorded live for ARI's annual conference at Deck Mantle Festival. First, we have Martha Pazienti-Caden presenting a panel titled Knowledge Sharing Across Generations. She brought together a combination of scene veterans and newer artists for a knowledge sharing exercise that explores how the music industry has changed over time. Joined by Karista, Jan Schulter, Aaron Coyes from Peaking Lights, and Suzanne Sciani, we hear of the importance of mentoring. taking care of yourself as an artist, and the changes accessibility has wrought on electronic music. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The knowledge sharing panel is up next. Hi everyone and welcome to the knowledge sharing panel. My name is Martha. I'm from Resident Advisor. We're going to spend some time swapping some insight and learning about the careers of the people who are sitting with me today. We do have DJ and curator Karista. Hello everyone. And we have one half of the psychedelic pop duo Peaking Lights. This is Aaron. Jan Schult aka Wolf Muller aka Boefeman. And with extensive experience in the world of production, DJing, synthesizers, we have Susan Ciani. But to get started, I was hoping that we could get kind of an overview of those of you that produce music, how your practices have evolved in terms of tools, software, hardware. And I thought maybe, Suzanne, this might be a nice moment for you to tell us about your relationship with the Buchla and how that's evolved. Yes, the Buchla, my first love. I started playing the Buchla in the late 60s, and I played continuously for about 10 years, and then it broke. I moved to New York City, and I started a production house and did a lot of music production for television and film. and started making recorded albums. So by that time, the technology had kind of gone into MIDI. So there was a lot of recording. But then when I moved back to the West Coast and reconnected with Don Buchla, I just did a complete 360 and I went right back to the Buchla. So that's what I'm doing now. I'm just playing the Buchla as if it were the 70s. Because in those days, you know, my dream was just to continuously play the Buchla live, but there were no outlets for it. There was no audience. It just wasn't understood. So it's a great pleasure for me to come back. with the new Bhukla, which is the 200E and not the 200, and to find an audience who really understands what's going on. This, for me, is like, I feel like sleeping beauty. You know, and I was, everybody was asleep for 40 years. And then I wake up and it's like, wow, you know. So that's my bootcamp story. And Jan, how about you for making music? How have things changed with your tools? Yeah, it has changed. I mean, in the beginning, I used records mostly as tools. I had a computer and used samples and I didn't even have a sampler as a gear machine. I somehow learned to use the sound color of the records I used for my music. And actually, like synthesizers, I learned through the years and I'm still learning. It's still trial and error. And Aaron, in Peaking Lights, how have you guys been able to refine your creative process for making music over the years? It's a matter of economic disparity for us. So, you know, we... Started in punk bands and I did experimental music. I always wanted synthesizers and I couldn't afford to buy them so I had to figure out how to build them. And so I started building stuff and we started recording on shitty cassette tapes or whatever, having to balance a cassette tape. through a stereo onto another handheld recorder and find creative ways to mix. And eventually, I don't know, I just was able to... Actually, what ended up happening is this record label asked me to do a remix for them and they bought me Pro Tools, so I figured that out. So, I mean, it's always been based on what I've had access to monetarily. Usually that's not very much because... I don't really feel like giving in. I don't know, I'd just rather experiment and make weird shit than write straight up radio songs. Someone else can do that. That's what we like to hear. And Carissa, have you made any music? No, I'm not a producer at all. Maybe one day. I'm a collector and a DJ. I wanted to ask you about your process of staying organised when it comes to selecting songs for DJing and for radio. And how has that process been tightened up since you started DJing? So I started DJing like 10 years ago and in 2015 I had my first online radio at Red Light Radio and before that I was already collecting and playing records ever since it's like already now four years ago and in four years time that I have my radio show and how I organize my music depends also what kind of music I do. honey music is already out. It's a mixture of new music and music that exists already for a long time and that I just found out, discovered, you know, so it's a mixture of those two and... It's the difference between playing in clubs and on radio. The key is for me to make people listen for, in this case, an hour, an hour or two, and keep them listening to the radio show. That's the trick. And the difference between playing on a club night or a festival is to make people dance. And that's the task of the DJ, in my opinion. So it's basically the same thing that I'm trying to do every time for the radio show or in the club, just to keep myself challenged, but also to make the people and the listeners listen more to the music instead of just whatever. Just doing that. So over the years, it's basically the same recipe, but keeping myself and other people also interested. And how about for the logistics of being able to get to your set and make sure everything is smooth? There's a lot of preparation going into organising the folders and literal records. Because you're collecting lots of music that you like, different music that you haven't listened to yet, or friends of friends send you the music. I organize my music for radio shows in a different folder than music for festivals or club shows. So, yeah, I don't think there's a huge difference over the time. I just make playlists. or separate the records that I want to play in my radio shows or in clubs. Yeah, you're just able to sort of refine the process. Every single time, yeah. And you have three different aliases, which I feel like we'll break into later on, but in terms of organising music for these different sets, how do you... There was a time when I was trying to differentiate a lot between those names but in the end, especially with DJ gigs, I ended up that only the promoter knew one of the specific aliases and I knew the crowd would not be able to just listen to a Wulf Miller percussion set completely. I still see DJing also as a service so... As Carista said, it's about to make people dance. And in the end, it always, of course, there's not really a border between all the names. I mostly start with rhythms and how I feel along the path and then decide on the alter ego I use. There was never a plan to have it such a big topic actually. I saw it as a normal thing to have different names and different records, different projects. It's fun to have the whole concept of a record in a new way when you're doing a new record. These days I'm actually embarrassed when I see posters for events and it's like Jan Schulze, a.k.a. Bufmann, a.k.a. Wolf Müller. It's a promotion, of course. People want to do it, but there was not the plan to look like the show off with a lot of AKs. Aaron, we touched on this briefly with what you said before about being given Pro Tools, but I was curious about your thoughts on... As accessibility has expanded and more people have been able to get access to more tools, do you think that is a helpful thing for opening up electronic music? And would you maybe have a piece of advice for someone who is starting out with making music? okay, this is coming from like a real left field thing because I ended up going to college later in my life and I ended up doing, I studied film, an experimental film. And one of the things with film was that it's kind of a weird history. history kind of question. So, okay, so with film, there was like Super 8, right, and 8mm, and maybe your grandparents or great-grandparents had film of your parents or grandparents, depending on your age. of Super 8. Like Super 8 was this totally accessible thing and anybody could make films. And then you had like Nick Zedd and Richard Kern and film was actually in the hands of the people. People could make their own films. And then what happened? It gets taken away. You have all this media form that is given to people. People use it. Cassette, four track, recorders, all that, you know, going into... pro tools, things get cheaper, and then they eventually get taken away from people as people build it. So I think as much accessibility as you can have, yeah, it's great. More people making stuff, yeah, fine. More people that don't know music, like traditional music structures, all the better. Like, yeah, use whatever you have by any means necessary. Go for it. Suzanne, do you have any advice for someone who is not from a musical background but is wanting to get into music? Well, the thing I loved about music technology is that it's, I always say it's a relationship. So you encounter a machine, a tool, whatever it is. And in the old days, what we did, there were no manuals, there were no books, there was nobody to talk to. And you developed your knowledge just by doing it. I know that's harder in a computer system where you have menus and lots of dependencies, you know, do this and then do that and then do this. But that's why I'm in analog. So analog's a wonderful universe, and I think it's a very popular one now. And the beauty of it is that it's just that relationship between you and the machine and there's a correlation. You know, you do something, you turn a knob and you hear a change. You make a patch, you hear... So it's empirical. You can learn it just by doing it. And the more time you spend with it, the more you discover it's deep. It doesn't end. You know, it's not boring. It's not like, oh, I went up to the keyboard and I got a sound out. Isn't that, like, cool? No, this is more like an evolutionary learning process that never... And so that's my idea for now is, you know, analog, spend time, don't read, just do it. Beautiful. Shall we come back to DJing? Because this is what I am extremely curious about. Part of growing as a DJ is obviously playing back-to-back. Last time I saw you DJ was back-to-back. Yeah. And that was here in Amsterdam as well. At Elias Museum. Yeah. What is your guidelines for back-to-back etiquette when it comes to playing with another DJ? I don't play that often back-to-back. Only with the people I really know. Elias and I know each other for 10 years from back in the hip-hop times that we played at the T. was a hip-hop DJ for hip-hop artists here in the Netherlands and I was a tour photographer for a hip-hop group. So that's how we met and ever since we kind of had contact. So I know that the both of us have the same taste in music. if it comes in house music or even soul or funk music, something like that. So I'm very selective with people with who I play, to back with more than 90% of the time because we know from each other that we like the same music we don't really prepare we make we may make it happen on the particular moment that we have the DJ set And that creates very interesting moments and orders in the set that you don't even think about. "Okay, that sounds really nice. I didn't expect that from you or from myself even." So there's not really a guideline. I'm just being very specific with who I play back-to-back with. It's not that I'm going to play it back-to-back with Steve Aoki, for instance. I don't know. I would love to see that. That's really from the other side of the musical spectrum of DJing. But I'm very selective with it. Does anyone else have any experience of playing back-to-back? I think I have, yes. I mean, I learned most of DJing playing back to back in the salon, the Zammertörs in Düsseldorf, where I started off as a DJ mostly. And we always did a night from beginning to the end with two people, which means starting in from 11 and then go as long as the night goes, which would be 8 or 9 sometimes. directly told me maybe a different path about back-to-back playing how it's possible to challenge each other play the records that the besides of the records that you never thought you would play anytime soon but then it just yeah the other person you play with guides you to it does something you didn't expect so my approach to back-to-back playing was always very about also about learning music it was about to show each other your discoveries and it was in a not professional way regarding a music scene from now where big big back-to-back bookings are for delivery approaches for us it was always about discovery as well and to uh like level the approach how much you could go far out with the crowd yeah did you have any practical things that you had to learn how to do like Does someone have to take over whilst the other person runs to the toilet? Do you not eat anything during those long sets? How do you make that work? I mean, the toilet situation is super chill when you're playing back-to-back, of course. That's the evening. It can also be like turn the evening in a different direction. You don't have to be careful with drinking. So you can drink a lot more, which turns the night weirdly sometimes as well. But what was the other part of the question again? I was just wondering, like, do you have snacks when you play for that long? Not really. I mean, I mostly... Like have a beer at some point in the night, which I don't do all the time while DJing, but it's like liquid bread we sometimes say. And it helps you if you get hungry a bit. But no, I think from my perspective, eating food while DJing is weird. Also from the perspective as the crowd. I mean, when someone has time to eat while he's doing his stuff, then... I mean, to me it looks weird. I won't have a snack while DJing. It's like, I don't care, you know, what evening. Yeah, now I can see that. I'm totally in the zone when I DJ. I'm fully into the music. My head just processes the next songs, the next possibilities. So there's no time for me to do that. Can I ask you a question? a stupid question because I'm really not a DJ but when you do back to back are you switching off like every what you make decisions mostly in front of the set it's a normal thing to play one on one But it's of course hard to... Sometimes when things are not running perfectly and you have the feeling it's a bit chaotic, then I decide with my friends that maybe two or three tracks are better to give a new direction. But in the best cases, it works one-on-one and it just flows. So, yeah. How about for you, Karista? One-on-one? Exactly. It depends also on the time that you have for a back-to-back. One and a half hour short, really. So you do one-on-one if you've got like three hours. It depends also. You play like two over two. But basically one-on-one is the perfect so you can like switch easily. make surprises and make people go wow or even the DJ that you play back to back with so yeah one one's for me the best for sure yeah that's why I like it because when you play back to back you basically just get to be the person's biggest fan and stand right next to them and then you switch and they get to be your biggest fan stand right next to you cute exactly um let's move on to talk about the same thing but from the other side um in terms of performance Suzanne do you have any rituals that you've developed that help you get in the zone for a performance I just love it so much you know I just love having that like special time with my book club because in normal life There are so many distractions. You know, even if you sit down to play at home, something comes up. You know, the phone, the gardener, the relative, the... You know, there's always something going on. And that beautiful, special moment when you're performing, it's like just being in a bubble. It's so complete and absorbing and safe. You know, nobody's going to bother me. And it's my time. So I don't know if that was your question, but that's my ritual is just to... you know, jump in a bit. I don't like to be too prepared because then, you know, I like the little shock. It's like, oh my God, I forgot to plug that in there. And I like to recover, you know, while I'm playing because it keeps me awake. It's a very focused, conscious thing. And the older I get, Maybe the less mentally... I don't know if the synapses fire at the same rate anymore. But I'm very patient with myself and just enjoy the surprises. And how about for you, Aaron? Is there any peaking lights, pre-show rituals that you've developed? I can't really eat before I play. Kind of like fast throughout the day usually. And then I don't drink or do drugs. Seven years strong now. Eight years no smoking. So I don't know, I drink lots of water. Stay hydrated. Yes, stay hydrated. Eat a lot of dark chocolate. That's my thing. Yeah, yeah, that's good, right? 85, minimum 85. Yeah, I'm with you. I'm just taking a sip of water there. Yeah, got to stay hydrated. Yeah, I don't know ritual-wise, but, you know, the other, like, playing, I guess it just depends, like, try and kind of, like, be meditative depending on the set. If I'm going and DJing, it's usually like I kind of try and like just clear my head. It's maybe a little bit less hectic as playing live because live, like live we have all our stuff is hardware. So it's, and then I have a big, like a 24 channel mixing console in front that I use. So I'm mainly playing the mixing console, I guess. Yeah, so that's much more involved. It's like 24 channels of dubbing constantly. So that's more focused, I guess. So I just kind of need to maintain focus. Essential. Yeah. Let's move on to the business side of... the industry that electronic music has become and I'd be really curious to hear if everyone's up for sharing some thoughts on the teams that they've built around them because these days when you're like a new person starting out you're kind of made to feel like you have to have an agent and a manager and all these different things and that's bullshit okay you heard it here first But I would definitely be curious to hear from each of you how you've grown the team around you and why you think that's bullshit, starting with Aaron. I think it's bullshit because... I think people will respond to good music no matter where it comes from. And I think that things like Instagram, well, you know, I'm like a child of the 70s, so I guess that I have... a different perspective of growing up. Like when, you know, when I started playing music, I played in like power violence bands and you probably don't even know what that is. It's really, really crazy sounding. Look up power violence bands. Look up like Infest or something. Or Man is the Bastard. playing this really crazy music. It was all flyering, maximum rock and roll. It was a magazine called Book Your Own Fucking Life. You'd call, you'd send letters, you'd mail cassette tapes, and that's how you would get to tour and get shows. I mean, it was all very much, I guess, more organic than... dealing with an algorithm of like a website so you didn't have to have now you have to have money so now it's like the music industry is being narrowed down from people who didn't have money used to be you could spend 50 bucks buy a shitty guitar 50 bucks buy a shitty amplifier that call it a day you know your other friend did it 300 bucks you got a band you know you could tour no problem, hop on a Greyhound bus. Now it's like, you know, if you want to get seen or whatever or have that, you have to have someone backing you. So, which is kind of a shame because I'm sure some of the best music right now isn't even on the internet. It's, you know, it's beyond that. It's not that it's beyond it, it's just under it. I mean, you have like pop stars like Taylor Swift, whose father was a billionaire banker who literally caused like an economic collapse. But yet no one talks about that. Everyone likes the pop star, you know. It's like people's priorities are fucking off to some degree right now. I mean, yeah, I might be wrong, but I kind of think that to have a business, you have to have yourself. That's the number one thing. You have to have yourself, and you have to put energy into yourself. fuck having a manager. An agent will come when it's right. You don't need that. I've dealt with managers and we tried to go one way. I love the record label that we were working for years in the past, this record label called Domino. Absolutely amazing. But there was a disconnect between what we wanted to do and what they wanted us to do. We had a manager that was not on the same page as us. so we get, we're an electronic band. We always have been. We'd roll up to shows and we'd have all this weird gear. playing with rock bands and people would be like, what the hell is this? You can't like, we're just different. We're not, we're not that way. You know, we're not going to, no one's, you're not going to change the mind of an audience who wants to go see that. And we weren't willing to compromise, to make that compromise to, to do that. So, I mean, you kind of have to just do it yourself. I think if you, you know, just not Has anyone had... An opposite experience where they feel like a management or an agent sort of support has helped elevate them? Let me just say an agent is different than a manager. An agent is different than a manager because an agent actually gets you work. They get you work. A manager manages your affairs. So if you can't manage your own affairs, your manager can be taking money from you. Your manager can be setting up things that... might not be appropriate because you're not taking care of your own affairs. You know what I mean? Yeah, that makes sense. Has anyone had a different experience with management? I never had a management, so no experience. But I have an agent and I'm very happy about him because I hate to talk about money and any of that stuff. I would be the worst negotiator in the world because I have fun doing what I do. I like doing this and it's amazing that I can do this so I would go anywhere for whatever money. So it's good that I have an agent. Peace, Rob. Yeah, I do have a manager. He's basically one of my best friends. I've been known for a good eight years from the Amsterdam club scene, basically. We knew each other from there. And this one time I knew that he was starting out with his own agency. called Bidopunt and I slowly and surely get a few gigs in around Amsterdam and I knew like maybe he's the right person to handle my bookings first and then he handled also my management at the same time. I think it's important to have like someone in your team. I've got a very small team, like three or four people. who totally understand where you want to go. Your own vision is very important to have. And from there on out, you can, together, not for each other, but you work together to a certain goal. And so far, so good. So far, it helped me in the best way possible. Of course, you have to look at the... to the money part of course and the contracts that you guys have with each other but basically not with both of the parties with my agent or with my agent with my manager I don't have a physical contract it's just the trust that you build over the years with each other and the willing to try to make a difference. I know that my manager is a very hard-headed guy. doing certain things to make a change and not to follow the mainstream path, actually. And my agent is actually the same. She is, from the people that I've met and that I recognize, is that she has a lot of experience. experience of over 20 years starting as working in an office for one of the biggest DJs like Louis Vega, being a tour manager, she knows from both sides how the industry kind of works and for me that is very important to have those two people, three people because she also has an assistant. have the noses and the heads to the right points to one particular way and for me it helps a lot because I know for myself that there's so many things going in my mind. that I need, I don't know how to say it in English, but I need a clunk board to like someone that I can like interact with and share minds and thoughts with. And for me, my manager is basically that guy who can find the red, the line in between all of my thoughts and visions and things that I want to achieve. And he kind of slowly puts it in a time schedule, in a time frame, because you cannot do everything at the same time. Regarding social media, I do everything myself because I like to do that. I like to share personal thoughts and text this underneath my Instagram posts every now and then to keep it human. You're not just a product, but you're human who is... doing a job for myself. Last year was really my big year and how to handle that and how to maintain it too. For me it was kind of a therapy session via the new media basically, through social media in this case. and to have also interaction with the people that like you, you know, so yeah, I kind of like that. It's also really nice to do that. Really nice. It's nice to hear a positive about social media. Let's come back to that later on. But before we move on, I'll be curious to hear how your team has changed over the years, Suzanne. Oh, there have been many, many years and many, you know, eras. You know, I had a previous life as a pianist. You know, I started out kind of bootstrapping my career. And then it got, you know, where I had a big agent, big manager, and, you know, the whole Hollywood thing. And, you know, now the result of that is... that I have five masters that are on Sony that I don't have rights to. And I made a decision, you know, when it got out of hand. I just cleaned house. One day I moved from New York, I moved to the West Coast, fired everybody, the manager, the agent, the record label, and I just started from ground zero. I started my own label in 1994. And I just wanted control. I wanted control of my own music. You know, I felt that my albums were like my children. They weren't for sale. So that's still where I am. I had the very good fortune to have Rachel here. Rachel Aiello is my assistant, and she, you know, I don't want an agent, and I don't want a manager per se, but that work still needs to be done. How we do it is that we don't solicit. You know, we only take what comes in. And that's already an energy system because you're not spending energy looking for things. You know that there's energy there because they have come to you. And then there's still a lot of work that has to go on to organize it. You know, can you get from Australia to London in... two hours, you know. So it's kind of fun that way, and I'm trying to get my masters back, and I do believe in being indie. I know that the deals have changed. You know, the old dinosaur contracts with the major labels were just horrific, and the typical deal I see now with a record label is different. It's more like a 50-50 deal. And so, you know, I can't really comment that it doesn't work. I don't know. I think it... They fixed it in a way. But the one thing I caution against is getting things for endorsement of your own value isn't a good idea. You don't need a manager to look good. You don't need an agent to be more important. You don't need... As an indie, and I think we're all indie now, or should be... or have indie consciousness you know you need to understand all the business and then you can delegate they always say don't delegate what you don't understand so you know there's it's a lot of work i i don't think it's just like i mean doing music for me is a small percentage that's just the reality i i don't know about it but it is it yeah there's There's a lot more that you have to do, but it's taking care of yourself, right? I mean, it's like you wouldn't wake up in the morning and just wait for someone to make you breakfast. You make it yourself, right? I don't know. I'd still like somebody to give me breakfast in bed. I mean, that is a nice thing. But you know what I mean, to a certain degree. Well, you have to be responsible. You have to tell them how many minutes you want the eggs cooked. You have to know what you need. What about for the budding managers out there? What would your advice be for them in terms of building a good relationship with an artist? Maybe Suzanne, you could start. I like her idea about having a good friend, somebody who knows you well. You don't want to be or feel like a number in a system or a commodity or a product. or something, you know, you want to be as personal and as, you know, three-dimensional as you can be with that person. Equal. Feeling that there is no hierarchy between you guys. I like the boutique, the small. companies, you know, so you feel like exactly not like a number in the system. I think that's for me really important. That's for me individually, but that depends on any other person who likes to be at a big management company and... And you do your own media, you were saying. Most of the things myself, like the bookings, I also communicate by email or even by phone if I would like to do it or not. And it's not that somebody is fixing anything for me, like handling and process how to, but if there's a booking coming in that I don't really see myself playing at. then we're not going to do it. It should be equal in every way. And Jan, you're happy with your agent, but what was the process to settle with this particular person? My story with my agent is quite funny because he found me on Discogs selling a record of mine and then he wrote, are you Jan? I want to talk to you anyways and make you an offer. So it's kind of a story that I like a lot because it shows the reality of what I do is like I've taken care of music and all my thoughts about music and when he approached me I was very nervous and I thought this is... isn't this too early or something, but it was actually the perfect time to get slowly used to it. And it slowly grew over years and I wouldn't, yeah, I'm totally happy with the situation. Like this, I don't have any other experience, but also regarding management situations. I mostly like to keep personal contact as much as possible, which is of course not always possible because every weekend I meet 10, 15, 20 people and their friends and their girlfriends and a lot of people get in contact afterwards. beginning it made me nervous to not answer everything and I didn't even take a day off of just answering and answering. And at some point I had to make the decision of forgetting about it when it's so far down that you don't see it. It's because if I would give everyone this amount that I normally would love to, I would not do music anymore. And I think also people want music from me, so maybe that's the better deal in the end. I don't know. That's great. Priorities are right there. Okay, I think this would be a good moment to sort of break more into the social media world. I think it's kind of a gross topic, but I think we should touch on it anyway, because it's one of the biggest shifts in the electronic music industry that we've seen. So, Carista, you've told us that you don't mind it. It's okay. You can get by with... With using it? Yeah, whenever I feel like it. Yeah, for sure. I definitely do sometimes a break, like a couple of weeks, which is kind of difficult because it's like really in your routine to even like scroll down to the timeline or... post something by yourself or comment even on certain things that you see. But for myself, I like to put photos of a show that I have online and thank the people along in the comment section. But social media is... Nowadays it's a very important asset for being a DJ to be seen or an artist to be seen. Some people even look at the followers, the amount of followers that you have on Instagram or even on Facebook or, I don't know, Spotify or something like that. how big you are, how important you are at that particular moment or just in general. I had a growth for myself, I had a growth since last year of almost 5,000 followers. It's a lot on Instagram only and also I think also a couple of thousands on Facebook. I don't know who those people are. And so, like, I think two or three months ago, when I had my show in Berlin at Panorama Bar, it kind of hit me, like, okay, if I'm going to play this show, it might shift something in the digital world. So I was kind of... I didn't have like a panic attack, but I was like, oh, my mind... Because every time I played somewhere, I was like, really nice time, I'm going to play out, and people are having a nice time too. I didn't thought about what kind of impact it might have, just playing music out loud. And that particular show that made me think like, okay, if I'm going to do that show or even with another artist, it would put me in a certain position, which is nice, but at the same time, it has its downsides because I don't, like I already said, I don't know who those followers or who those people are. So that was for me my personal experience how to, the downside of, one of the downsides of social media. In the end, it worked out for me still is I didn't have any stalkers or something like that. Oh, that's good. No, not even. Not yet. No, please no. But yeah, that's what I tried to say. If you have so many followers, it doesn't say that... The artist or the DJ who has like a thousand followers doesn't make any good music, you know? Or is a good DJ, doesn't say anything. The amount of followers or people that recognize you, it doesn't say anything. And most media and other companies who are valuing, having a big value about the followers and the amount of likes that you have, etc. I think that's a very important thing to work with certain brands and stuff like that. I think it's a good thing and a bad thing. same time yeah depends how you do it yeah all right You've seen the game before all of this. I don't think I have seen the game before all of this. This is like my experience of what the industry is like. It's like brand partnerships and Instagram. But I'd be curious to hear what your opinion is. Well, you know, like way back in the day when they built all like the beautiful cathedrals and all that stuff. in Europe and there was no one's name attached to any of the artwork. It was owned by the church. And I mean, it's weird, like this weird concept of it, but I feel like that, and to some degree, is kind of what's happening now. Not that I disagree with it, because I think it's a great situation for artists, especially artists without money, to have more exposure given to them. And so it's kind of like, I don't know, I think if you would have asked me in the 90s about this, I would have been like, fuck that. selling out and stuff but i i at the time that we're in now i don't necessarily believe that because you know none of us are like we're all trying to live our lives doing the things that we love and by doing the things that we love as artists we share that love with people and we want people to feel that love and the best way to do that is by just, I don't know, having the opportunity to show people that side of it. So it's not all, I don't really think that it's all that bad. I mean, You know, like I said earlier, there's so many artists that come from really wealthy backgrounds that never have to worry about that. Their parents can buy them, their followers, their parents can pay for them to go to music school, have private training. A lot of us don't have that. And so we need those things. And, you know, people working at different companies, you know, are... people like us coming from blue collar families coming from families that didn't have like the opportunity as well so I don't know I don't know if I can knock it that much although I do wish that at the same time that it was that the playing feel of like the monetary what you needed to monetarily put out there in order to beat the Instagram algorithm was like easier. You know, I just, I just, I just wish that there was more. It's just, you know, I follow so many people on Instagram that follow us just because I'm interested. I'll like see, oh yeah, this is cool. Yeah. This artist is amazing. This visual artist. Oh yeah. I'll follow them. But then it's like, you know, my Instagram feed doesn't show me all the 3000 people I follow or whatever. But I would like to see if it's a good art, and sometimes you forget about it. And that's all the algorithm. But it's all across the board. I mean, it would be a good democratizing effect to just have it be where that algorithm was just a truly free open source, but obviously it's not. Sadly, no. Yeah, that was kind of weird tangents, but, you know. Suzanne, how important is your online presence to you? Well, number one, I never look because I just don't want to go there. I really, I don't even know how to post anything. But Rachel does. But we don't do that much. I mean, my Instagram, I think you can see my posts on like one page. And, you know, I don't have an objection to it. I feel the subtext. in here because I don't even understand what it is. I didn't know you could buy Instagram followers. Do people do that? Yeah, totally. A lot of people do that. It's a huge thing. Wow. Okay. How many do you want? I'll sell you some. So I don't know that I have any useful opinions about that. I thought Facebook was for me and my family. And then we had a page that was just for the business, whatever. But people don't go there. They ask to be your friend. And so I just don't even go. They do have those algorithms. So if I go on my Facebook, I see my niece. I see my nephew. You know, I see what I want to see. I don't want to. Some people I noticed in the beginning would be upset. Oh, she won't be my friend. But once you feed that beast, it just gets hungrier and hungrier. I noticed, you know, if you become somebody's friend, then their friends want to know why you didn't become their friend too. And so I just don't do it. I only accept friends, people who actually know. that I live near, you know, or whatever. So I'm not a good example of using it as a tool. But I think that, you know, we do post concert things on Instagram, right? We're getting a nod from Rachel. Okay. That's right. Okay, and I don't think, do those go onto Facebook too? They do. Okay, there you go. But it's good to know that you can have an amazing career without having to engage in all of that horrible stuff. Jan, I'm guessing you don't... It's horrible. This is so much fun for me to find out that you think it's horrible. I thought you kids loved it. No, I think for me it's just a sort of necessary evil. Jan, I'm guessing you don't have three different accounts for all your different aliases. No, but it's hard. I had thoughts about doing stuff like that. and actually I have on different platforms. I mean on Facebook I try to combine it all and as Jan Schulte Music which is not easy for people to find when they want info and Instagram I wasn't taking that serious in the beginning so I called it Bufi Mann because just sounded was quite catchy whatever. Not as complicated as what you are familiar with, but I'm not that big pro in all. I'm maybe from the last generation that grew up without internet. So internet came into my life at the same time where I started making music and discovering all that. It always evolved and it's new. things that i mostly don't understand and i'm using it as good as i can but um yeah i think it's um it's not necessary it was not necessary for me as a musician getting into a scene or having my first releases there was about the local scene and um bringing the records we made into the right record shops. It's a longer process. But I think this longer process was good for me and for my artistic evaluation. Is that the right word? No. I think if you can wait a bit longer and you don't take all these internet... I think so serious it will be good for you as an artist on a longer term that your music comes to the right people and not to people that hang on the internet all the time. I want people to not hang on the internet, I want them to listen to my music, which is what I made it for. One thing about, for example, for Facebook is I realized that if I post a song of mine For example, on SoundCloud, it doesn't get as much feedback as if it was with a video. So I ended up doing a video which is not my thing, like I'm a musician, just with a bit of last energy to show people my actual product, the music. with shitty pictures because people respond more to it and these decisions were weird for me. I don't want to have to put something else on top of my music for people to realize about it. That's not what I made it for. People can just close their eyes if they want. That's like the music video. It's not dreamy music, but you know what I mean. Go for it. The one thing I think is kind of trippy as being an artist, like making your own music, is Spotify right now. And I actually just had a conversation with a friend who works as a distributor, or works at a record distributor. And he was saying that the actual records... sales are going down right now because of streaming that there you know there was a big boom for a while and i don't know i found that really interesting that it's like that now streaming is actually like you know people are starting to see that as opposed to physical i mean You play vinyl only or you play CDJs? Yeah, sticks. How about you? Both. What do you tend to use more? Digital. Yeah, digital? Yeah. So why? But you guys still buy records? Also the touring aspect is mostly, but the general digitalization drives the scene too. I arrive too often somewhere where the record players are not set up correctly and it doesn't make fun where I play one record and I brought a whole bunch. to test out one that has feedback. So these days it's actually just safer to prepare it digitally. I record records on the first day. listen these days because it's safer. I don't want to come anywhere and the crowd thinks it's a shit DJ because the technician set up the record player's shitty. So it's a safety thing with it maybe. So you're a fan of rip, grip and flip? What is this? Rip, grip and flip. Or no, grip, rip and flip. Sorry, wrong way. It's when you... So it's when you grip, rip, and flip is when you get a credit card and you can buy really expensive records. online, you rip them, and then you sell that record again. I never sell records. Not never, but... So you can buy rare records and not have to deal with actually paying any money for it, but you can still get the good digital file. Yeah, but I still collect as much records as I always did. It's for me a thing that I started with and it's still a thing I love. But the thing about recording is a safety thing regarding DJing because the reasons I just told you. And it has a small bonus. If you record directly the track you want to play, you have to listen to it to the end. It's not the case in the club where you play a new record and suddenly something happens because you didn't listen to the end at home. This small bonus I like a lot, so I have it all saved in my head already. I even saw the ending in the audio file and know how long it takes to stop. Amazing. Well, there's one more thing that I wanted to touch on, which I think has been changing a lot in the world of electronic music lately. And that is the perception of women as producers and as DJs. I feel like we could do an entire panel just on that. I think it would be really insightful to hear from the ladies how that's affected you guys. Karista, maybe you could go first. Are you finding that there's more of your peers who identify as women coming through with you at this point? I don't know. I really don't know. I like to think that I'm a really good DJ. If people would like to book me because I'm a woman and that fits. perfectly in the lineup of owning 90% of 100% male and then put me in into the lineup because of that reason and then I like to reject that booking of course I think like lots of promoters and bookers and like to like to work that way but I I don't know. I don't like this subject because I'm very focused on the music and I like to play out. Of course I'm not blind and I see that there is like a... There's definitely a shift going on at the moment for having more workshops for people who like to, love to play as a DJ in a club and like to know how to, especially for women or people who like to identify themselves as women. But for myself and my career, how I came so far, I don't think that it comes from me being a woman. Just me playing awesome music. How important is it to you to be a role model right now? And is it something that you're conscious of or feel pressure around? Something that came around like the last couple of months more. Of course, I'm a woman of color and you don't see that often in the electronic music of nowadays. So whenever I play, there are always like a couple of ladies that I say, I want to do the same as you. You saw a big inspiration for me to start. DJing or being an artist. So that is of course very, very flattering. And I always like encourage them to do so. But being like a real role model, I don't, it's very difficult because It's not difficult to be a role model, but it's like when you get yourself conscious of it, that makes it more difficult for yourself to, okay, then I have to sit like this, or, you know. I like to just be myself at all times and gets me to places where I never dreamed of to be at. So, yeah. I think that's the most powerful thing you can do right now. Suzanne, what was it like to have way less people to look up to or blueprints like what I might have now? My mentor, my role model, was actually a photographer. because I didn't know any women. So this was a German woman, you know, who in her field was technological. You know, she worked with a camera. She was called the diva. No, I was the diva of the diode. She was the queen of the Leica and, you know, worked with her chemicals. And it was a very technical field. She was 80 when I met her. So I was half her age, less than half her age. Now what I'm finding out in this long arc of existence here. is that there were always women along the way. We just didn't know about them. I played last year at Royal Albert Hall, and they had a premiere. It was a special program for women pioneers. We need to focus on this because these people were there. They were invisible. So they premiered a piece that was written in the 40s by a woman named Daphne Oram. Two orchestras side by side, one of them live processed in the moment. So, you know, with reverb and she used it with, you know, directed disc. because the technology was very primitive, or you could say primitive but different. I never knew about her. I was denied knowing that this woman existed. And that's what hurts me, because there would have been role models, and I think role models are important. I think they shorten the leap. You know, once you see something, it's just a thousand, you know, pictures worth a thousand words. It just crystallizes a lot of data from getting from here to there. And call the, what's the other, the American Delia Derbyshire. So I'm reading that I'm the American Delia Derbyshire, and I have no idea who Delia Derbyshire is. And I think, well, who is that? And now I know what a pioneer she was. But in my developmental years, I didn't have that. So I think it's important. Women, we are technologically still a minority, and you can see that where you see collectives, where you see groups. I go to Berklee College of Music twice a year, and there'll be one female in the class and 12 guys. And it's just like... doesn't have to be that way but we're trying to find the levers you know to adjust that because the women are there and they want to you know this is fun stuff you know But I really appreciate what you're saying about not wanting to think about that, that you are in your own right a great DJ. You're not a woman DJ. And I can see how that can feel a little bit demeaning. For me, I don't care because I've been in the place where there were no women at all. So anything that helps to shift that, I approve of, whatever it is. I had one last question, which was to do with taking care of yourself whilst you're on the road, whilst you're travelling for shows, whilst you're in the studio for hours and hours and hours. How do you guys avoid burning out? And what are your sort of music self-care tips from everyone? A good tip is to do what you really like. That's what keeps me alive is that I see it as a present that I'm able to do this and even more and more and more. Which also, of course, gets more traveling time which is more exhausting and I need sometimes one day more to... to get my energies back or something. Sometimes it's of course funny that you, for a two hour set of music, you're traveling 20 hours. There's a level that is confusing sometimes, but in general I would have never thought to be able to do music this way. and I just produced a lot of music in the last half year because it was the first time that I actually had a studio and equipment and time. And before that in my life, sometimes I had time but no equipment or something. All at once, it's a present and that is what keeps me alive and happy about this. Krista? Don't drink. I don't drink. Just to keep myself focused. I've been touring around for a while now and what helps me is that I just... drink beer or drink any alcoholic supplements in between the touring and just leave it for the last show of that weekend so then I go like no dogs but now but then I am allowing myself to have to have a beer or a shot But during shows, it's like clip mat. Oh, sorry. Mat, yeah, I think it's kind of... Yeah, mat and water only and workout on Tuesdays. Aaron? Yeah, I think what both of these two said is like just to be... grateful for your opportunities. You're not drinking and you're loving what you do. Yeah, exactly. Being grateful that you have the opportunity and every day waking up and thinking that and just being thankful. I'm actually super healthy. I haven't always been in my life, but I'm vegan. I don't eat grains and like all this weird shit. But also, you know, yeah, doing what you love and not compromising, you know, like not compromising yourself. I don't know, just following your intuition, trying to build your intuition. Years ago I had actually this time period, a really hard time period dealing with industry stuff, with getting fired from a label. having to deal with a management that was just a bad situation. The other thing about management is if you can, always get in a contract with management so that you know what they are going to provide for you and that there's a clear line. But outside of that, I was having this, it was just a rough year and my kids are really into skateboarding and I started skateboarding again after like... like an 18-year hiatus, and now I skateboard pretty much every day, as many days as I can. But I mean, just exercise and like, you know, yeah, and it can be doing whatever you want to do, just walking, seeing the environment, listening to not just music, but to the sounds around you and to other people. That's a strong tip. Suzanne? I don't know that I'm really good at this. I mean, I love exercise. And when I'm home, you know, I do that. I do Pilates too, I believe. And I love tennis, but I broke my hand recently. But now it's better. Thank God I'm not playing the piano because, you know, Bukla is a lot more forgiving. or, you know, your hands. On the road, I think my biggest challenge is sleep. Because with all the traveling and the jet lag, I don't know how you deal with it, but... I try to ignore it. I just try to say it doesn't exist. Jet lag is not even a concept, right? And that helps a lot, you know, if you don't give into it. Also, if you travel enough, I think your body gets so confused. There's actually a formula for jet lag, for getting over it. What is it? It's like you fast for 16 hours before you leave. So by the time you get there, you've fasted for 16 hours. And then you drink a lot of water, blah, blah, blah. But then when you get there, then you eat with the first meal. And it works amazingly. Well, that's because you're not eating the airplane food. No, no, I don't. I can't deal with it. It's a definite no-no, but fasting. Okay. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Thank you. you
