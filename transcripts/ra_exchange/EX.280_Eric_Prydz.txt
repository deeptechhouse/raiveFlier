Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling, and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. So change of pace on this week's exchange. We'll be speaking with Eric Pridz, who's an artist that maybe even your parents have heard of. Over the last decade, he's had global hits, a couple of Grammy nominations, and headlined Madison Square Garden. But the interesting thing about Pridz is that he's always kept one foot in the techno world. He came up during the sound's first wave in Stockholm, and under his Cyrus D. alias, he's continued to make music that strips away the soaring melodies that he's usually known for. It's been a particularly big year for him, with a label anniversary, an epic Fortet remix, and a new album about to come out. I went to his house in Hollywood a couple of months back to better understand how he's successfully worn all of these different hats. You can find the full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud. ra-exchange. An Exchange with Eric Pridz is up next. So I thought maybe a good place to start would be talking about L.A. a little bit, seeing as we're here. When did you come to L.A. permanently? End of 2012. I kind of made up my mind when I came here during the summer. I did this touring festival for a month and a half. You kind of played every day in a different city and you toured with the festival, the whole crew and all the acts and everything. But I had 10 days off in LA and I've been to LA many times but I think I've been in the wrong places with the wrong people because I never really liked it. As in, you know, because everyone says, oh man, LA is... amazing and I was like it's all right kind of thing but then during these 10 days I fell in love with the place and I asked my wife like we should we should move to LA you know it's a great place and she agreed and we did a few months later and I think the plan was to just stay for like half a year, a year, something like that. Get a bit of change of scenery. But yeah, I mean, I'm still here. And now, you know, we bought a house and our kids goes to school here now. And my son is even born here. So yeah, this is... this is the home this is home now so what do you know now that you didn't know before like why does it make sense to you now la it is a weird place it's like heaven and hell in the same place kind of thing you know but you know it's it's um where we live kind of you know it's uh it's great for kids there's so much stuff to do lots of nature, really good schools. Obviously, as a Swede living in northern Scandinavia, there is the weather that's very, very different. You know, like wintertime, we're used to getting maybe three hours of daylight, but here it's just... all year round, amazing California sunlight, you know. I think, you know, it's made me a happier person since I moved here, I have to say, yeah. What about on a creative level? Like, how differently do you feel creatively compared to, say, like, London or Stockholm? Like, is there a different energy here, would you say? You know, I thought it would be a difference just because it's from one extreme to the other. And when I lived in the UK or when I lived in Sweden, you had parts of the year when it was just grey and wet and cold and really boring outside and you spend your time locked in a studio kind of dreaming yourself away to a... happier place almost, you know, thinking about the next Ibiza season or something like that. So I did think that it might, something would happen with my artistic or my creative process and stuff, but, you know, it's just the same thing. I would say I'm more creative since I moved here, actually, for some strange reason. You know, because there's a lot of distractions here. It's, you know, it's... It's great to be outside. Like every day you can go to the beach, you can hang out by the pool. There's all these things that I'm not used to doing because I'm from Sweden and we have a month and a half of summer and the rest of it is just shit. So you maybe find that these things help to clear your headspace or something. Yeah, but I think... As I said, you know, I know the creative process, how it's always been for me. Like I said, you know, outside is crap. You lock yourself in a studio and you dream yourself away to another place and you kind of... and somehow find inspiration in that. But now I am in this place where I... normally would be dreaming about being in but I'm still it's not affecting my creative process you know it's almost like I'm making more music now than I ever have ever before you know I'm really happy with that So 2015 is kind of a big year for you in that you're celebrating 10th anniversary of Pride Era Recordings. Yeah. So tell us about how you're marking the occasion. Pride, it's been 10 years. That's fucking crazy. It's a label that I started up back when I was kind of fresh. Back then, when you released music, it was all about releasing music on other people's labels and bigger record companies and stuff like that. And everyone always had to have some form of input. Oh, maybe, no, we don't really like the track like this. You shouldn't do that. Oh, that's weird. Like, we never heard anything like that before. You should try and do this and the art. artwork should look like that and blah, blah, blah. You know, you didn't really have full control, which I hated. So starting up your own label for me was like the obvious thing to do because I could do whatever I wanted to. Musically, the way that the music and the releases were promoted, sold, et cetera. So I started Prida and it's been going for 10 years. I've never, I haven't really treated it as a record company. It's just a forum for me, an artistic forum for me to do whatever I want musically. You know, there's not. I release plan that's planned kind of in January for the whole year. I just release whatever I feel like. I put some music out, you know, and I don't really do any promotion. And it's only about the music kind of thing. And yeah, it's been 10 years and we decided to celebrate. that with releasing an album called Prida 10, which is celebrating 10 years, which consists of 22 tracks. I would say 99% of these tracks are tracks that Prida fans... I've been gagging for years, you know, because I... And they've never been released, so we thought it was a great way of, you know, celebrating 10 years of what we've done musically on the label, and obviously it's been going for 10 years, and then... It's kind of a chapter one and then, you know, look forward for the next ten years, you know? So why hadn't the tracks been released? I don't make music with a purpose to release it. I never have. I make the music that I feel is missing in my record box and I make music to play, to play out. Obviously, I do release music, but that's just when I feel, you know, hey, this track... should be released, you know. But I never sit down and say, okay, I'm going to make a new Pride I release, you know. It's more like I want some new music for my sets. Let's make it kind of thing. So, you know, if I'm going on a tour and I'm making a track a day or something, it kind of adds up. So you can't release them all, you know. And it was 22 tracks on the Prida 10, but that's just clearing a corner up in the attic, you know, in the music library. There's so much other stuff. So presumably some of these tracks have a pretty big lifespan. I mean, how far back are we talking with some of these? A few of them, let me think, what tracks are on there? Quite a few from like 2005, 2006. Yeah, so, you know, they're all from the period, like this 10-year period, really. I mean, are these tracks that you would have been, like, retouching over the years, or did you kind of dust them off in their sort of complete form? No, I haven't touched them. Really? Yes. I think that, you know, there's a time and a place and a sound for each track. And if I take something that I made in 2006, it had a certain sound, like a production sound and the way I, you know, worked in the studio with the sounds and stuff. And if I were to take that... track and reproduce it now it would lose its magic or you know it would become something else so you know it was just a question of finding all all the old arrangements and masters and you know trying to get them to sound good together you know which I'm really happy with how it turned out. And yeah, the response has been phenomenal. You know, it's, I mean, I'm really proud of it. I was just going to say, are you someone who has quite a positive relationship with older music? I mean, maybe you talk to some artists and they may be. feel not embarrassed but you know it can be quite a complicated relationship if they've been making music for for quite a while just wondered what your relationship was like with with some of this older stuff are you proud and fond of it yeah because it's a part of me, you know, and it's something I created out of nothing. And I can understand how people could think that because you get an interest for music, you buy your first synthesizer and you make something on that and then you move on and you move on. But I think by the time... I started my label in 2003, was it 2004? Well, the first release came out in 2005. But I just felt that I was done in terms of learning my craft kind of thing. So anything, obviously, I have developed since then, but it's still... within that kind of... I can look at tracks then and think, God, I really love that still kind of thing. It's not like I look back at it, oh, why did I do that? That sounds so bad or amateur or whatever. Because you felt like you'd reached a good place in your development by then? Yeah, I don't know how other people work, but I have the tracks. before I even put them down on, you know, I have them in my head almost. And then it's a question of if you hear a sound in your head to try and create that with your music equipment. And I think at that point, I'd reached that point where I felt that I can, whatever I have inside me, I can... I can get onto a CD or to a piece of vinyl or an MP3 or, yeah, whatever. But then if we go back and we start to listen to music prior to that, then obviously never released, but, yeah, maybe I would be the same. So you've released a fairly healthy amount of music. on the label over the years and, you know, you're in a position where you have up to like 22 tracks that were unreleased. Yeah. So this kind of paints a picture of you being fairly prolific. So I was wondering like, Has this always been the case over these 10 years? Have you been able to produce music and have you felt inspired at a rate that's been consistent, if you like? No, not at all. There's periods when I'm very uninspired and... I've just learned to deal with it. I know a lot of friends of mine, they see going to the studio as work. So they will be there at 8 o'clock in the morning and they will leave at 5 and they go to work. They sit there and they make even if they're not inspired they sit there and try and make something anyway But for me, it's like what's it's not work. It's a creative process. It's like it's not like moving boxes from one corner to the other So the way I do it is if I'm in the mood I'm in the mood and I'll go and make some music. Otherwise, I do something else, you know, and it's been working for me. I don't think you should force it. Like, you shouldn't go into a studio or into a... creative environment and then even feeling uninspired and uncreative and try to make something anyway just for the sake of making something it doesn't make any sense to me i mean would you do things to try and cultivate that sort of headspace or is it more a case of like it comes naturally and then you know it's just a feeling and you act upon it exactly it whenever it comes you just act on it and I think touring has always been very inspiring to me. You know, doing shows, meeting new people, playing music for people, you know, all across the world. And, you know, the energy and feedback you get from them gets you very inspired to go back into the studio and make more music, you know. And then, so it kind of, the whole... touring versus being at the studio um in that creative place they kind of go hand in hand i think feed each other sort of thing and um obviously a big part of you know the volume of your output has been the fact that you have these three like very prominent aliases Maybe talk us through that decision. When was it and why was it that you decided to set up these discrete projects? I mean, the names that I've been releasing the most music under is Eric Pritz, and then it's Prida, and it's Cyrus D. And Cyrus D is kind of similar to Prida in terms of the artist is Prida, the label is Prida, Prida releases music on Prida and it has its own little thing going on there. And the Cyrus D alias is releasing music on another label of mine called Mouseville. And, you know, labels were both set up in the same kind of era. I think Mouseville was like 2004, even, or 2005. And, I mean, musically, the labels are different. Pride has always been... It's very melodic and more experimental and kind of... I can just do whatever I want. It doesn't necessarily have to be made for a club. It could be, you know, it's... Should I say progressive? I don't know. Whilst the music on Mouseville has been much more harder-edged and very club-orientated. very stripped down, kind of influenced by European techno. And I remember why, I actually do remember why I set up Mouseville now. It was the first release I did on Mouseville was a track called Control Freak. And it was supposed to go out on Thomas Chrome's Corb label. I can't really remember what happened. He was very messy back then. We just felt that it just went kind of on and on and on and nothing really happened. So then after a while I just said, you know what, I'm just going to set up my own label and release this track because it was a track that didn't fit on Prida musically. So I said, you know, I like making this music. I should have an output for that as well. And how about the stuff under your own name? How do you sort of box that in your mind? I think the Eric Pritt stuff, I signed like with Eric Pritt's name, I think I signed my first record deal in like 2000 and that was with Parlophone in the UK. They had a dance label called Regal. Regal Recordings and they signed me, Eric Pritz, and the name and I did one or two releases there I think and then I jumped over to another EMI label which was the flagship one called Credence and I did three EPs there. under the name Eric Pruitts. I mean, if you listen to those EPs, that's like Prida music, you know. It's the same thing. Then I signed to another record company in the UK, and... Like I said, they sign you and they own your name for the period of the contract. So you can't do anything Eric Pritz anywhere else. And they only wanted big records. So they would just wait until that big record came and they will take that and that's the Eric Pritz one. So the Eric Pritz has always been the more commercially viable music that comes out from me. So it wasn't a choice of mine, but it just ended up that way. And I guess using all these different aliases, it's kind of... fueled this idea that people have of you as someone who is able to like straddle many different scenes and many different like levels of the dance music scene the latest example of this I guess is the fact that Fortet has been working on some of your music I wonder if you could tell us about that and kind of how it came about Yeah, the track you're talking about is a fairly new track that I made. It's called Opus. And he tweeted, like, I can't remember word for word, but he really liked the track and that he would love to make a remix out of it. And we said, you know, that's pretty cool, actually. We should, you know, we should look into that. And we're really interested to see what will come out of that, you know. And so he's remixed it and he's been playing it out as well. And, you know, it's a banger, you know, and I'm really excited that it's going to see the light of day. Yeah. I was just looking at some of the names of people you've been... playing with over the last couple of years there was like a hot flush party in miami people like scuba and george fitzgerald adam beyer you've had like sasha and maceo plex claude von stroke coming through the pride of showcases so what i wanted to ask is for these gigs are you kind of approaching them differently do you feel differently when you're playing them like do you get a different sense of satisfaction out of them i mean how does it compare to you know, these bigger shows that you're playing. Are you talking about these kind of shows? Yes, yeah. These, you know, with guys like, you know, Scuba, for example. Like, are you taking a different sense of satisfaction from them? And, you know, do you prepare differently, say? I mean, playing more intimate shows versus playing big festivals and stuff is obviously a very different kind of gig, you know. For me, I prefer playing clubs, you know. And, you know, if I had to choose, that's where I feel that me and my music comes across. across the best you know it works well not 90 minutes slot but you know i have to adjust then and i'll i'll i'll do a different kind of thing but um obviously when i do these you know like the pride arenas and stuff like that and i invite these people these are people that i for me and my music taste and for what i like i i get i just you know i i can pick kind of thing which obviously we have to ask them if they want to play, but it's not someone else who picks these names. It's people that I really look up to and that I think musically will fit very well together. like as you said for the cream fields the pride arena cream fields a few of those names that you said like masio plex and and sasha and colorful stroke and and you bring all those people together in one arena for one night that's one hell of a party you know which is great so i'm kind of there as a fan and i'm there as as a performer as well and and yeah This sense of, you know, going in multiple directions at once and kind of exploring different things simultaneously. Where does this stem from? I mean, if you look at your development and your history, has this kind of always been the case for you? Have you always been interested in, you know, simultaneously? pursuing different things. It's just the way it's turned out. I love so many kinds of different styles of music. I could never, you know, if I had this one little line that I had to stay, you know, stay like little path I had to stay on music style wise throughout my career, I couldn't do that. That would be so boring. You know, I like everything from very, very minimal techno to Mozart or even like Def Leppard or Kiss or Depeche Mode or... Nitsureb, Frontline Assembly, anything from the 80s, I love, Alphaville, etc., etc. I make different kinds of music depending on the mood I am in, you know? There's a line in your biography that simply says you began making music aged nine. Yeah. It doesn't really expand upon it, so I wondered if you could expand upon that. Yeah, well, I think it was earlier. I think it was about seven, when I was maybe six or seven. Growing up in Sweden in the 70s and 80s, everything was very... The government would put a lot of money into the infrastructure for kids to make sure they had... you know, stuff to do. So if you, after school, you could go to these places and they had all the toys and all the like music instruments and pianos and drums and et cetera, et cetera. So I got into, I had them there, you know, for me to use whenever I wanted as a kid. And it's just something that I, I started using. And I think I. You know, I wrote my first track when I was about eight years old, I think, on a piano in school. And it kind of, you know, escalated from there, I guess. I mean, were you receiving music training as a young kid? Well, actually, I did. My mom sent me to this piano practice because, you know, my parents could see that it was an interest of me. I could play the piano, etc. But it was just the most ridiculous thing I've ever... I just went once. Because of all these stupid rules. Oh, the pinky finger needs to go there. I'm like, no, I'll do it like this. And you had to play all these really boring tracks and stuff. And yeah, I went once. Yeah, so I'm not musically trained. I can't read notes or anything like that. I don't think, like, I think it's wrong in a way that you should, it depends on what you want to use your skills for. If you as a... creative person want to create something then i don't see why you should go and study what all these other people have done before you that's like irrelevant it's it's it's more interesting what you can do and these are the instruments and and you know try and learn how to play them and do it in your own way, in your own style. And, and yeah. Something more free form. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. And do you remember when the idea of like club culture came onto your radar? Okay, club culture. I mean, I think the electronic side of music came with mid-'80s in Sweden where the whole breakdance phenomenon blew up and was the coolest thing ever. And it came with all this cool electronically made music as well. which kind of opened up my ears and eyes to bands like Kraftwerk and Pashmode and all these. all the breakdown stuff and all like Italo Disco and everything that was going on there but in terms of clubbing I think it must have been I think it was much later like I did DJ in school the school like every other week they would have like a Friday night kind of you go there and you drink Coca-Cola and eat chips and listen to music you know as a 13-year-old kid sort of thing. And I used to DJ at those things with a few friends of mine. So I think that's where the whole DJing thing started out. But then it was hip-hop and R&B and I think I was about 13 years old or something like that. In terms of, you know... Proper clubbing, I would say maybe much later, like 1997, 1998, around there, when I started playing in small clubs in Stockholm. And yeah, I mean, the music scene in Stockholm in the late 90s was... crazy, crazy, like really blooming. You know, we had on the techno side of things, we had the Joel Maltz and the Adam Bayers and the Jesper Dahlbeck and Ariel Bricka. Thomas Krohn and you had Kari Lekkerbush. So these people have been very, very influential on me because that was my first contact with techno. I was never into the stuff that came out of Detroit or Chicago when it first happened. I was never exposed to it. The music I was hearing was more the synth pop. body music and synth and all that but then I think I kind of rediscovered it after listening to the Swedish techno guys who obviously were very inspired by what was going on in Detroit and Chicago but they made their own version out of it and when I heard that I was like wow this is just blew my mind kind of thing so I've been very inspired by them they're all friends of mine now you know and I I still look up to them very much and and you know they are my my heroes in a way um yeah I was just going to ask if there were like particular spots that you guys would kind of you know hang was there like a club or clubs that were like the focus point There was a lot of places in Stockholm. Like, you know, all the Swedish names that I just told you, they were playing frequently in Stockholm. That was like the techno scene. And then you had a big drum and bass scene and you had a big... You had the whole rave thing going out in the Docklands in the Stockholm Harbour or whatever. It doesn't exist there anymore. There was a lot to choose from when it comes to electronic dance music back then. And I just, I was a mushroom back then. I just went to all these places and as a clubber, a punter kind of thing, you know. And yeah, it was very inspiring, I have to say. And to talk about your own music and your early music, I think as someone who's maybe known as having a very particular style, even if it's maybe not so easy to describe. But I wanted to ask if you kind of see particular like trademarks or hallmarks that, you know, you could trace a line from your early music right up to now. Are there like elements of music that have always excited you or you've always kind of gone towards? Yeah, no, I mean, it's kind of hard to analyze yourself, but. I think that kind of red line that people see and they can say, oh, this is an Eric record, I think it's the melodies and harmonies and the kind of chords that I like to work with that has that kind of melancholy, sad... kind of a little bit of hope, and I don't know how to explain it. This is stuff that I, you know, that I, in my turn, have gotten from all these synth bands from the 80s and 90s, you know. mixing that kind of sour sweet in a way it's hard but it has a soft kind of sad yeah because i guess if you listen to one of your melodies in isolation or to play them this is something that like would remind you of kraftwerk or something yeah yeah maybe it's um I think that might be one thing that melody-wise I have a certain vibe that I always find myself attracted to when I make music that most of the music go to. Then obviously there's the odd track that's totally different and doesn't do that at all. But this has been a kind of recurring thing. Yeah, I think it has. You know, if I listen through, you know, especially when I went through all these tracks to choose which one were to go on the Pride of Ten album, I could definitely see, you know, when you listen to that much, I mean, I'm... I must have listened to like 100 tracks or something like that before choosing the 22 of them. And I could hear like, you know, I go for that kind of thing almost every time. Always in a different way or from a different angle. But a lot of the music I make, it's perfect kind of driving car music, if you know what I mean. Just driving. Mulholland Highway or Mulholland Drive or whatever and just or like the Autobahn in Germany or whatever it just makes you want to go faster and you go it takes you somewhere you know that kind of thing a lot of the music I make have that effect I think Could be because I've spent most of my time touring on trains throughout Europe for the past 10 years. Because I prefer not to fly, so I rather do trains. But then you have this view, this scenery just going past you all the time. You drive through the Swiss Alps or the drive through... countryside of Italy or you know whatever like the English countryside or whatever and you have this you know and I think it affects it affects the music you write you have it there and you write the music at the same time so yeah and you know yours is certainly a style that has been influential and you know people have looked to imitate over the years Does that kind of thing bother you? Like, how do you feel when you would listen to a piece of music and think, oh, that's very similar to me? I mean, on one side, I feel kind of honoured in a way and a little bit... I must have done something right because these people love it so much they want to try and make their own version out of it. Like the way I see it, like making music is that you're telling a story. Whatever music you write, if it's rock music, if it's classical music, dance music, whatever, it's you expressing yourself as an artist. It could be... You could be a writer, you could be a designer. You are doing something. You are telling your own story. I don't understand why someone else would be basing their career on telling someone else's story all the time if someone likes... Eric Fritz, why should they go and listen to someone else when they can go and listen to that music being made in a better way by the guy who actually makes it, you know? So I don't really understand, like, people who, who, well, I kind of wonder maybe, you know, it depends on where you are. Are you, like, are you doing this as a, professionally? Do you see yourself as a... as an artist or do you see yourself as a kid who likes to play around with Cubase at home in your bedroom and you have like, I like this guy, I like that guy, I love his music, I want to try and make that. And that's what he does. He makes music to try and sound like his heroes. And that's another thing. You can't tell a kid like that, oh, man, you're ripping off, that sounds like Adam Bayer's new single or the new Tiesto banger or whatever. That doesn't matter. That's fine. People imitate. But if you come up to a certain level when you are a professional and you release music and you just take someone else's ideas and write. your own name on it then I don't know I try not to think about it it happens all the time it's been going on ever since I released my first record and Instead of being bitter about it and say, oh, they stole whatever I came up with, this idea or that, just move on. You'll always be one step ahead of them anyway, because you will always be the one setting the standard and the trends for followers like that. So maybe it will even push you, you know, to kind of be better. to move on okay i've made that i made that thing someone copied it let's move on to the next thing yeah and i guess also um a big part of your artistic identity certainly in the last few years has been the um epic live shows you know some of your like flagship presentations if you like Tell us about how the concept came about. The concept of the epic shows was basically me and my team wanting to do something bigger scale. At the time, what everyone was doing was the big LED wall, the confetti, the CO2 cannons, the microphone, you know, and I just felt that I was so boring and so... It's very effective, don't get me wrong. People still use it and it's mega effective. Fireworks, whatever. Music, you don't even have to have music. You can just have the confetti and the explosions. scream and a mic and that's amazing you know and there's a market for that and you know great but I just felt that we wanted to do something that was enhancing the music rather than taking over and overshadowing it so that's basically what we did you know we I think it was in planning for about a year and a half and then Epic, which is Eric Brits in concert kind of thing. That was the product of that. And it's been an evolving thing. Every show has been different in terms of you do one show and then you go back to the drawing board and like, how can we make this better? That really worked. Let's enhance that somehow. And I've seen this new cool technology. Maybe we can include this in the next show. It's been a... like a playground for a lot of creative people from, you know, me from the music side and like Liam, who is like the mastermind behind all the graphics and the holograms and all that, you know, he can, you know, he's super creative and comes up with new things and... Yeah, it's just a really fun thing that we can do every now and then. It's super expensive. I lose money every time I do it, but it doesn't really matter. It's more about having fun. I was going to say, because there must be, when you're messing with things like 3D animation and productions of that size, there must be such a big team and so many things to think about kind of thing. It is. It's very simple. stressful and it's very you know like when you know like we went into Madison Square Garden and did Epic there nothing was pre-programmed everyone was improvising like the crew didn't even know what I was going to play I didn't know what I was going to play I knew what I was like the opening track the rest of it was just Yeah, but the way we've set up with Epic is it actually kind of works better that way because everyone is so in tune with the music. They know the tracks inside out, every little sound, everything, you know, and everyone who's doing each element is so good at that specific element. So it's kind of like we go out there and we jam, you know. And as a ticket buyer, as someone who wants to come and see a show, it's amazing because what you saw for the past three hours, two hours is... It's never going to happen again, you know, that was unique. So if you do, I think the year before Madison Square Garden, we did the Hammerstein in New York and we did two nights in a row. And obviously the shows were totally different, you know, which I think is really cool, you know. I mean, what's it like as a performer to be up there by yourself playing Madison Square Garden? I was shitting myself. I didn't enjoy it as much as maybe I should have just because in the back of my head I knew. how many elements of this show that could go so wrong. Yeah, I see. Yeah. What if I don't perform? What if I fuck something up? What if, whatever, you know, we had this, and the holograms we were using was this new technology that we had loads of problems with. It's like the biggest hologram in America ever. There was a lot of things that could go wrong, but... As soon as you get up there and you start, you get into your zone. Then afterwards, it was... I needed a few days to kind of reflect because it had... The build-up and the preparations for the show had been very, very intense. And it would have been nice to just have everything pre-set and just go up and, you know, press a button, turn a few knobs and enjoy yourself. But when I was up there, I was kind of... It was work. proper like i had to yeah but it turned out amazingly you know and and yeah you mentioned there this idea of the pre-programmed shows and the confetti cannons and all these things and you know obviously this has been a incredibly popular form of entertainment and you know yeah enormous thing in in the states yeah as somebody who's playing uh shows at this level do you see this continuing you know if you're thinking about america in particular like can you see this still being a thing on this scale in like five years or do you think it may be are you talking about the just like the big big scale festival shows you know this edm explosion this whole thing that's been going on in the state I think it will hang around longer than you think. You look online and you have people, oh, he's pressing play, he's not mixing the records, he's doing this and that. Don't listen to it then. Go and listen to something else. There's obviously a market for throwing cakes and all these different things. That's fine. If you don't like it, you don't have to watch it. You don't have to go and see that. You can go and see what you like. Actually, I think it's great that you have that whole thing because it makes the people who does it differently, you have that kind of contrast in between which gives everyone an identity. But yeah, to answer your question, yeah, it's going to hang around because you're going to have 16 and 17 and 18-year-old kids that are getting into, that goes to the first festival or like... You need to have the McDonald's of music for people to come into the scene to start with. Like, when I was a kid, I loved McDonald's, you know. I had my fair share of McDonald's. I got bored of it. I started looking for maybe something a bit more refined, etc., etc. And it's the same thing with music, you know. You need all that shenanigans to happen to bring people in, you know, in the scene. And then when they start to get their own music taste and start to develop, you know, in what they like, they will move on from that to the next thing and to the next thing, you know, getting more and more refined. And, yeah. So at this point, I mean, you've kind of scored number one records. You've had Grammy nominations. You know, you've toured the globe many, many times. So I wondered, you know, in 2015, what does success look like or feel like for you? Like, how do you measure success at this point? Success for me is being able to... make music and play music for a living. That's fucking amazing. I mean, I'm very fortunate that I can make money off doing my hobby. If I couldn't do that, I would probably still do it and work at Tesco. you know, whatever. I like cooking. I might be a chef or something. But that is success for me. Like, I never set up goals, like, I want to be top 10 on some magazine's top 100 DJ rating, or I want to have, I want to sell 10 million records. It's... you know success i think you should be happy and and and being able to do what you love you know and that's what i'm doing right now and i i to me that's very successful you know in terms of selling records i'm no calvin harris you know i don't really want to like my the music i make is not really i don't make it for that kind of it's not really You know, I make music that I want to play out, and every now and then there's a record that connects with that kind of iTunes top ten kind of thing, but most of it, it's made for clubs and dance floors. But yeah, success to me, just being able to do what you love, you know?
