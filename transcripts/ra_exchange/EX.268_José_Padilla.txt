Hello and welcome. to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Carlos Hawthorne and I'm a staff writer at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is Jose Padilla, who along with a small handful of others is considered one of the founding fathers of Ibiza's Balearic Beat movement. He's also heavily associated with Ambien, or Chill Out as it came to be known, thanks to his residency at Café Del Mar and a subsequent road-renowned on the island, I visited his home to discuss his recent album on international feel, So Many Colors, and why his relationship with Ibiza has been bittersweet over the years. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. An exchange with Jose Padilla, up next. *music* Jose, I make this your 40th year in Ibiza. Are you doing anything special to celebrate? If I do something special, well, no really. Try to have a nice life and a healthy and nice life and enjoy myself, you know. I will do a party when I move houses. As you know, I have to... move houses again so then I will celebrate it yeah my 40 years in Ibiza and my 40 years no and now it's 42 years DJing it's been over 40 years DJing Exactly, because you came to me, say, in 1976, but... 1975. 1975, 76, I don't remember exactly. OK, but you were playing records before then. How did you discover DJing? How I discovered DJ? It's a nice question because the only music I can listen on those years, on the Franco dictator years, was the radio. We have a radio station. station called Radio Juventud Young Radio is the translation so I didn't know DJs exist only radio DJs so I started to go to Lloret de Mar Tosa de Mar on the weekends you know with my pocket money with a friend of mine with Nene to to pull girls to pull tourists And with 15, 16 is when I discovered DJs in Costa Brava, the first English DJs. Yeah. But because of the girls. Yeah, you mentioned that you grew up under Franco's regime and I read that some of the music you loved was actually banned under his rule and that you had these parties, Loro Negro and La Ratanora, to hear certain things. I mean, what were those parties like? Well, before I see the real DJs in action, which this... Costa Brava digits were all English. They just came with a box of seven inches and speech and play records. So we had parties like not legal. There was just friends from school, from college getting together in a room. They start to open like small places. I remember one called Infernillo Rojo, with the red inferno. La Ratonera, which is like a rat house. Oro Negro, Black Gold and many others, I don't remember all now. But some of them, it was only one deck. So, I started to like the action of the DJ playing the records. But when I discovered the real DJs was with two decks. That was in Lloret de Mar. So were you playing records at these parties? Yes, the first one we did it on the house of my old old barrio because I'm coming from a barrio that was so poor that it doesn't exist anymore. that is being put down. It was like illegal houses, okay? So it was my friend Carmelo's house. So we dig, which I think I never tell this to anybody. We dig under the house and we made a room half of this size. like one and a half meter down, but it was ground. It was just ground. And in one corner, it was like we put two steps and a little corner, one deck, and like a few different color lights. And on Sundays, everybody was coming there because it was the only place. That's where I first played records for people, but I never talk about this. I don't know why. My memory. getting a bit... yeah but it was so wet in there. Basically we were dancing half lentos slow and the other half you know we were... We were playing Creedence, Clearwater Revival, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and then, you know, the Bee Gees, before they were famous, and Beatles and Rollins and whatever we have at that point, you know. Tumbler Motown, of course. So I'm curious, what was the criteria for a record being banned? Any bad words? I mean, until the early 70s, any cover? I mean, Sticky Fingers was banned. Actually, the original Spanish one, it goes for a lot of money. But any bad words? talking negative about Catholicism or things like this. Or if the cover was too, like, John Lennon record with Joko Ono that was banned. Things like this, you know, that were knackered on the cover. So, I mean, was there any kind of punishment for listening to these records or playing them? No, really. Actually, we had, it was too, because Catalonia has been always like... more socialist because of the story behind, you know. And it was the first, like, heavy rock band, like, Machina. And then we have the Andalus Rock with Smash. But, no, they didn't go to your house and put you in jail for... I mean, imagine if they have to go to every... They have to go to every single house, you know. But you cannot play on the radio or nothing like this, or in clubs, like main clubs, which there were not many, but you cannot listen. Like, you turn one on blue, that was impossible. I have an original copy because I grew up in France and my sister, which is married with a French guy, bought me a copy. Did it feel like you were living under an oppressive regime? Yeah, I mean, it was oppressive, but it was great because... Because you can do whatever you want as long as you don't, you know, the problem was long hair and strange clothes. That was the only problem. If you walk on the street with like, you know, purplish on your eyes or, you know, like a purple T-shirt that you wear, like everybody look at you. But apart from that. Nothing was controlled like now. It was more free, you know, more freedom. And then you came to Ibiza in 1975, 1976. What reputation did the island have from mainland Spain? I mean, what was your idea of it? Ibiza was... Nobody talked about Ibiza, no. Even Formentera, I know even nothing about Formentera. It was Palma de Mallorca and a little bit Menorca that we know. Because these Balearic Islands, they were kind of forgotten by Franco regime. So nobody talked about it. I knew about this because my friend from school, we just went to Lloret de Mar to... for weekends. He was a carpenter, apprentice, a beginner of carpenter. And they came here to do apartments once, one year. I was 16, 17. And that's the first time I hear, they say, you have to go there, man. It's full of chicks. And they have great clubs and blah, blah, blah. So that's the first time I listened to Ibiza. But in Milan, nobody talked about it. It was like undiscovered. When you arrived in Ibiza, did you feel like it lived up to its reputation? No, when I came here, I came here with 20. It was 2021 and no, this is the same year that Pasha opened. Either it was the first or the year after the Pasha opened. So, KU didn't exist. Amnesia was a place that hippies play live. around a bonfire and the coup was Club San Rafael which was this orchestra on Sundays for the farmers to go and dance with the suit, you know. So, no, it didn't start there, the reputation about music. I think the whole thing began when Koo opened. When Koo started to do live shows and then Amnesia started to rebuild with Alfredo. That was the first kick. of musically and bringing club people on the island because we have on those years we have I see James Brown Duran Duran in Kool you know so yeah that was really Pasha was you know the small room in Pasha what you call it on the right side that was Pasha then that's it Nothing else. But it was already, you walk in there and you're, wow. You know, I haven't seen nothing like the different kind of people and the way of dressing. It was the end of the hippie era, you know, so. Clubs like that would never have been allowed in Barcelona. No, no. As I say, in Spain, people didn't know that most of the people don't have any idea about Ibiza exists. So when you arrived here, did you feel like you belonged here? Did you feel like this was for you? When I arrived here, I arrived in a big boat from Barcelona. I just seen from the top of the boat, when you come into the harbour, I see the old village still. And it was like, wow, I just feel peace and freedom. The next day, they took me to Lolas. Lolas is a club that doesn't exist anymore. It's next to, in the old town, is a cave. It's still there, but it's not open. And I went there, a small place. It's actually a cave, a stone cave. And the first thing I see, because the Paco de Lucia album, Entre Dos Aguas, just came out. And it was like a revolution in music in Spain. I can't believe mixing flamenco with jazz and percussion. And I just saw Paco de Lucia sitting just next to the door with Cordobés hats and a tunica. falling down completely drunk with whiskey in his hand and I said wow I like this place Do you think that your outlook or your character changed much from from kind of coming here? Did it affect you personally? My character now? I was thinking more then, just did it kind of have an immediate effect? I think we are who we are. I don't know. The thing with me and Ibiza is a story of love and hate. Always been like this, you know? It's like right now I'm thinking of leaving. I can't stand Ibiza anymore. I've been thinking of living for a few years, you know. But yeah, do more peace of mind, of course, and freedom. I didn't care if I don't have money or I have a job or I don't have a job. I didn't get a DJ job until when I came here, I started to work as a waitress, painter of construction, doing cement for buildings, anything. So because it was no guest DJs or nothing, you're a DJ of a club, you work seven days a week, you know, no more waiters. And so you have to wait till one come out to get in the place, you know. I suppose I was asking if it opened your mind up to kind of an alternative way of life that you didn't know. existed alternative or you've been more into the yoga buddhism yeah just the kind of that people were living in a way that you've been well it was of course we were in the era of the good drugs man you know what i mean a good good lsd and good Nepal, Nepali hash and it was a different way of taking drugs as well, you know, it was more like a drive, you know, it was like, how you say, you just don't take it. and go, you know, just take it. It was a ritual, you know. We make sure that we had everything, we were all safe, we were going to have the right music, we were going to have that. And, yeah, that opened my mind a lot, yeah, of course. That's one of the things. The other thing was, you know, those days you used to go to Aguas Blancas to see the... the sunrise and you were on your own on the beach all day, there was no one there. You know, that freedom you cannot have anywhere else, you know, and everything's so cheap and the people, you know, you can meet, on those days it was a lot of US guys. people from all over the world, you know. Did the island feel busy? No. It was no roads. There was only one road from a small one and it doesn't exist, you know, from Ibiza to San Rafael. The rest was caminos. Wow. Yeah. You still see horses with carros, I don't know how you call it. and a lot, I remember a lot of Ibizan can ladies with the black dress and, you know, you don't see anymore now, maybe if you go to North, you see one or two. So you soon started DJing in the clubs of San Antonio. Was San Antonio the main clubbing hub at the time? Well, San Antonio was Nitos, Chagmul, Playboy 2, that before was Playboy 1, which was next to Espada, which was no road, it was just right in the sea. and so they have to close when they make the road. And then Sparadis opened, and there was a four or five, it was another one, but there were four or five little clubs, and in Ibiza it was Pasha. Was there a kind of difference between the people going to Pascha and the people going to San Antonio? No, it was all, everybody goes everywhere. Actually, sorry, the people from Ibiza come more down to San Antonio because we have more chicks here. We have all the Scandinavian people coming in San Antonio and Dutch. So, yeah, all the Ibiza guys come here too. So it was a mixture of... The whole island was one island. So it still had... I mean, like today, there were still places that certain nationalities would group. and hang out, so you have the Scandinavians and the Dutch in San Antonio. Yeah, no, but it was all together. I mean, it was English as well, but the English people that come here, that was here on these days, was more people that bought the house, they got retired, they have the pension, and musicians, because it was a lot of Joe Spoons and the Kings, but it was a lot of live music. it was more Scandinavian, Dutch, German tourism than it changed into English the last 15 years. Living here and hanging out with all these people, did it feel like you were part of a kind of secret that no one knew about? There were secret beaches and secret houses where we'd do a party and things like that. But now there are no more secrets anymore. Actually, a couple of magazines asked me to tell them my ten secret places and I'm not telling you the secret. Yeah, that's fair enough. As a DJ, where were you getting your records from? When Basha started to grow up, it got bigger and bigger. And Amnesia started to get better. Privilege, that was cool. All the clubs in San Antonio. It was a couple of them in the Bay as well. And I think another one in Playa de Mbosa. We started to have record shops. And we had Flip Music, which was a French guy in the old town. And he was a music lover and he had all this import. It was like amazing, all these import records. That was the end of the 70s, beginning of the 80s. So we were getting quite a lot. Then there was an American guy, which was a model, an old guy. I did modelling and when it was going to the US, he just to bring a couple of boxes of disco, funky stuff. So we were buying to him. But my first records to play in clubs, when I started to play in Barcelona, in Lloret de Mar I was making friends with some of the DJs. On Moby Dick, Top of T-Top, Trump, it was, well, clubs, I don't remember all the names. And when they were leaving, they were selling me or giving me some of the seven inches. So they were selling, because they used them all the summer, so they just get new ones when they go to England. So that was, I learned my way out to pick up some seven inches that nobody could have, you know. As a DJ in Ibiza, obviously you had rivals that were playing in different clubs. Was it competitive to kind of get the new records and have different records from everybody else? The only guy, it was a guy called Cesar. I think he died. he had a problem with she was the first DJ that really impressed me in Pascha and that was the only DJ they pay him to go to New York to buy to buy import records once a year so he was playing stuff that you cannot listen anywhere else only there and Pasha always has been for music really very special you know and then middle of the 80s when the house started to come 85, 86, 87 until the summer of love some of the DJs actually there's a couple of big DJs I'm not going to say their names just to put top of the label something for you don't see the record right which for i mean all the digits we have a bit that when we discover something and we make we make it our record we don't want it we don't want other people to i always thought that Other people are not going to play like I play and I'm not going to play like other people play. You can play different ways in different times, different moments. Were all the DJs on the island, you, Alfredo, Cesar, were you friends? Yeah, Cesar, Pipi, Ángel. Yeah, ones more than others. You obviously became known for your chill out ambient sessions and slower music. At that time when you first started playing in clubs were you already playing slower music? No. When I play in clubs, you have to play. The thing is, like in this paradise which I was resident for four years when there was no roof on the clubs. So this part of this was, now it's beautiful, but it used to be even more because it was like a garden with big trees. So you have to play from 10 till 6 alone every day, one day off. So the first two, three hours, there was no one there, so I played slow stuff, you know, whatever. and then I have to start to make people dance. But you have more freedom to, middle of the night, if I was tired or you just run out of ideas, also run out of records because there was not so many records, I just put all the lights down for a minute, black, and start with Ultravox Vienna. and put the lights on and the dance floor was full. So it was a different days. People have more patience, you know. Different story. Now you cannot do that. You should do that and throw your tomatoes. So you were playing every night of the week. Was it... Were you kind of doing a similar thing every night? Well... No, most of the nights you have, of course, there were some mixes that, you know, they work and, you know, when you've been six hours there, you know, okay, let's play these three together that work and save my ass, you know. But I was trying, I was going in the afternoon and I have... two cassettes so I was practicing making sounds from birds or animals or sea or whatever mixing with the records and I have two Lenkos you don't know Lenkos? No idea They were Swiss decks really, really strong and you have to 33, 45, 78 like this, like a, I don't know how to say it. A believer. And you can give it more and less speed as well. It was so strong you can stand on the deck and you go around on top, eh? 80 kilos. Yeah. So I was trying to change every day, you know, the music, because otherwise I get bored, you know. Me and the waitress and everybody will get like... Yeah, I was thinking because these days DJs play once a week maybe and they really struggle to kind of, it's a lot of digging records and it's a lot of finding new stuff. If you're playing every night six hours. Well, that's where Baleari comes from because you have to get away eight hours every night or seven with whatever you have. You know, reggae, rock, whatever, you know, tribal. Even salsa, you know, forever, you know. That was decent, yeah. Thinking about the kind of club scene back then, now it's a kind of very fierce industry. It's very financially driven. Was it as much of a business back then? Oh, yeah, of course, if some guy did something like... But it was romantic, it was more romantic. The owners were younger, there was, like, nothing to do like now. It was like, if one day they lose money, they don't care, and the next day they will make more. It was not so much focused on, like... you know big now is factories you know money money money what would you do in the in the off season in the winter now it's nothing just struggling and trying to find a job on the construction would it work the same as May till October it was longer the season yeah it was six months yeah yeah In 1986, you set up your own bar, Museo. Museo Calabadella, yeah. Why did you set it up? Well, that was something that happened by casualty because I finished in Spardis and then I went to the open Macrodisco, but the college used to call it Macrodiscotecas. which he went on fire and then I ended up without a job. All the DJ jobs were taken. So I went to a club, a Calabadella club. They have a small club there and I met this Austrian guy, Franz, that was an artist and I was living in his house. He was renting me. an apartment there on the roof. One summer night drinking with the chef of the Club Calabadella, Franz and me, we decided to open a bar in his garden, 500 square meters. We just made this bar, which was amazing. And you were DJing there? Yeah, I was DJing, I was waitering, I was killing myself, I was doing everything. That was the thing, because I was making the money and Fran was coming because it was his house. And in those days, as I say, it was a romantic day. Yeah, OK, I love you. Yeah, this is going to be great. You're great. And he was coming at night, get the money and one party. And in the morning, he was half the alcohol gone and the money gone. How long did it last? Two years. I think it still exists on the other name. I'm not sure. He killed himself in the bar one winter. Oh, really? Yeah, he shot himself. France? France. He was manic depressive. And because he wanted to open in the winter, I said, this is a summer bar, Franz. We can open in the winter. Nobody, just the trunk people is going to come here. And me and Paco, the chef, we can go and work, make some money and, you know, keep an opening summer again, paint. No, no, no, we have to open in the winter. It was so depressing, you know. One morning I was sleeping on that and I was with my girlfriend at the time and this dry and went down and he was on the bar he actually shot himself on the bar with a brandy bottle of brandy it was like 8 o'clock in the morning and then the next year I tried to but everybody knew he shot himself in the bar so I tried to bring it up but it was impossible wow but it was like really like the first But music and art. We have all the artists from the island. You see the egg in San Antonio? Yeah. Well, we did two eggs like that, one on top of the other. 4,000 kilo material eggs with a tripod, like metal tripod. So one and another one. Eight meters. And all the sculptures and painting, it was an absolutely amazing place. People would bring the art to the future, haven't they? Yeah, all the artists in the islands put a piece or two pieces, paint a wall, leave a sculpture there. And we did it all ourselves. Because Franz was an artist, so he knew all of them. It's a hill in Santa Gertrudis, which they call La Montaña de los... the artist mountain and uh france james willie nesken all those guys yeah fast forward a couple of years you famously got your break at cafe del mar by selling some tapes in the market i mean why were people buying these tapes that was before cafe del mar Yeah, yeah. That was when I got kind of burned of the nightlife. It was like, you know, because you have to work every day. I was drinking and I was to stand up, you know, and doing shit. And I just, no, first I just decided to get a place in Escanar and do my own tapes. So I did what it was, the Acid Jazz. soul, reggae, house, blah, blah, blah. And I think the first day I did... A friend of mine, a painter, did me a really nice cover. I have them somewhere in the garage. And the first day, half an hour, all gone. Then the next, I bought another machine, another copy, normal, you know, tape to tape. I did 60, gone in an hour. So then I thought, why I don't ask Alfredo and Cesar? So I have a deal with them. Either I buy you the master, I give you 10,000 pesetas, which was a lot of money, or I give you one third of the whatever clean money. I would sell them for 1,500, 60 minutes tape, which it was like. 10 euros. It was decent money at the time. So it was a point where I was coming out of the market with more than half a million pesetas. In those years, it was like 3,000 or 4,000 euros. And then the next year, three people started to do it. They actually were buying my tapes, copying my tapes, changing the name. And then the third year the police came. But people were buying them to listen to at home? No, it was like, I have queues in front of, it was only two metres, like this sofa, little place, you know the places in the market. And I have like four or five. files of people with the money in their hands. Give me one Amnesia, one Space, Amnesia 1, Amnesia 2, Amnesia 3. Were you playing the tapes at the store? Yeah, I have a cassette player, yeah. But people were buying them to listen to at home? Yeah, listen at home, in the car. There was no CDs. and give them as a present. The same they do now, buying CDs in the airport, you know. They were good tapes, it was good mixes. I make sure that, you know, I get good mixes from the DJs. So, the British famously started coming over in the late 80s and early 90s to the island. I mean, how did you first notice the island start changing? It was very slow. We have the first promoter, I think, that came into Pascha was called Black and White. It was very slow. It was not so aggressive. And it was a different crowd. Nothing to do. like now in Amnesia, that was when Alfredo, when the Acid House, end of the 80s, it was a completely different crowd. The spirit has nothing to do with now. I was reading an article the other day about a big guy here in San Antonio which has got a lot of business. What I was talking about is keeping the spirit. It's gone more than 20 years ago, mate. This is another spirit. Was there a specific moment or a specific period when you realised that things were really changing? That was end of 90s, beginning of 2000. That was when the whole thing... 2000, beginning of 2000. One big promoter started to come and fight to get a night and then I started to steal legions from each other, you know. I have my own night in passion space called Moon Dance. And I just bring, it was the first one aboard Sasha, Digweed, Tony Humphries, I don't remember, a lot, Harvey, a lot of big names. But I wasn't paid them. It was like exchange for holidays. I gave him a car, rent a house, nice, decent house with swimming pool, him and his girlfriend, one week, everything paid, and they were super happy, you know. Billy Nasty, Paul Daly, Aaron Emerson, and the names coming now. Many, many more. When were you running that? When did that run? That was in the same years I was doing Café del Mar. It's like crazy. And I was doing Pasha and Space After. We closed Pasha and opened Space. And I was doing the Terrace and Inside. So that was... And then the next day I have to go and work at Café del Mar. But, of course, I was much younger, I had much energy, but I end up the summer, like, with 20 kilos less. But it was too much. I wasn't ready and I didn't have really a team. And yet, you know, it was not worth it for the money I was making. But all my friends, all the DJs said, come on, Jose, keep doing it, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, I'm doing all this for you to have a great holidays, you know, and me not getting a single penny. So I stopped doing it. And then... is when I make the decision to either go on with the Café del Mar and work on the compilations and Café del Mar or be a promoter and I decide to do the Café del Mar only. And around that time to pursue the mixes you moved to England, is that right? I moved to England, yeah, when I started, beginning of 90s, all the winters. I lived in England for four years in the winter, in different places. Two years in London, Highgate, one year in Bristol, one year in Nottingham. So, yeah, because I was also a DJ and all over with my car. So I went to Nottingham for one reason. Well, I have friends, all the DOI people were very good friends. But because it was close to everywhere, by train and, you know, in the middle of England. So, yeah. What did you think of Nottingham? Nottingham, I don't know. I played last year in the river. They have a club there. It was good fun. I don't remember the name. But at the time it must be, no much going on, you know? No much going on. Yeah, what's striking about those Café Del Mar CDs is they have this huge global appeal and they're very, they kind of appeal to this sunset vibe that you get as very popular in Ibiza but also in Southeast Asia and places in Greece and the Mediterranean. What's it been like playing in Southeast Asia, for example? Oh, he was great. Actually, you know, I was not really aware of... how big that was getting and the impact it was having in people and places. I mean, I don't regret nothing I did in my past, but I wish I was more aware. But, of course, it feels amazing. It's a tricky one, you see, because your head goes and then you start to do, when you start to think you're famous and all that stuff. It came very quick. The only thing I was lucky because I wasn't too young. But it came very quick. I think could handle it much better. But that's part of the story and that's it, you know. So was there a period when... The offers started coming in very frequently and you were flying all over the world. Yeah, yeah. I have years that it was like every weekend all over the place from South America, US, Australia. I was going in the road to Australia every year for nearly seven, eight years. Were you playing quite specifically kind of Café Del Mar style places, sets? No, the thing is, it was a lot of festivals and on those years, the first festivals, especially in Switzerland, Germany, all these places that have a massive festival and they have a chill out tent everywhere. But now they don't have them really anymore because it doesn't bring money, basically, now. But in those years it was a chill-out, and either I was playing in the chill-out or more mid-tempo stuff. or Deep House, you know. But no, I cannot play Sunset Music in a bar with the terrace. People will get bored, you know. I have to play a bit more up-tempo. I mean, I have the stamp of a chill-out DJ, which sometimes it is more bad than good because... People book me and they ask me, can you play more? I say, yeah, of course. I can play you a house set, no problem. You mentioned earlier a love-hate relationship with Ibiza. I heard Alfredo once say that he was very frustrated when the English came and started taking over. He was one of the pioneering figures of the scene and he kind of wasn't respected for the work that he'd put into it, perhaps. Is that something that you found yourself at all? Oh, yeah. I always feel that and I had a few years that I struggled a lot. Now it's kind of things are much better. for me because I have a very good album out and you know I'm getting you know presence again it hurts when you did something and I know how much love I put and how much energy and research and everything into that and then you see that everybody around you is rich and I don't even have my own house and this is reality. I mean I don't blame anybody because I could have saved money in the good days you know that's what I was telling you before about being famous you think that it's going to be forever you know what I mean and it's not like that you know what I mean but I hope I have people next to me that... But anyway, that was the way it was. But yeah, it hurts. But I have to tell you something as well, honest, from my heart. Maybe we've been lazy as well. OK? Because the industry or the DJ world now is going really fast, you know, since the digital came in, the digital world. And you cannot sleep. You have to every day, you know, move on, move on, move on, move on, move on. Because now, you know, it's a competition. Not only a DJ, any job. It's a big competition. It's a jungle. So maybe also we were not together, the DJs here. Everyone was like, so if we got together more maybe, I don't know, that would help as well. But basically I think we were lazy. We sleep on. We sleep on, yeah. Yeah. It's interesting because you'd think that... When everyone came, you'd think, OK, we need a few DJs that know what they're doing and they'd be involved. But it's almost as if people just brought their own new thing and just totally disregarded what had come before. Some of them, yeah. I mean, there is... Some people that, you know, I know Paul Oakenford, we're very good friends, and Paul Oakenford always, you know, have big respect for everything, but because he lived that, you know, and he's still one of the big guys, you know. But it's like now, you know, I want John Dewey to make a remix of one of my tracks, which I know he can do a very good job. and I know it's a very good track, one of my albums, and there's no way I can approach him. And I was the first person who brought John Dewey here to have a gig in Renaissance, which nobody knew John. John was the second DJ and Sasha was the... But anyway, that's life, you know? But it hurts, you know? I said, come on, John, why you don't answer me, man, you know? Yeah. Anyway, if you don't want to do the remix, at least tell me. It's okay, no problem. And I have big, big respect because I think he's only one of the few DJs who keeps true to himself, to his style, and is still up there. So not all the guys with his age did the same. Not all of them. When things started to change on a grand scale on the island, were you surprised at what was happening? Did you see it coming at all? Not really, because it was more out of the island than in the island. And when you live here so many years, what happened? You don't go out anymore. You don't only, I mean, I was going out when people like Kevorkian at the time coming, I wanted to see him because he was one of, I have a lot of respect and I like what he was doing at the time. you just got to see one certain DJ, but you don't go out. So I miss what was happening in a way, you know. I just was going, doing my gigs, doing the compilations, doing my productions, and I missed it. I missed a few years, you know, but alcohol and drugs have a lot to do with that. I think Alfredo said something similar. Yeah. You mentioned your new album. It's a very interesting project because it wasn't an artist album in the traditional sense. You brought these four producers on board to work with you. Can you explain the process a little bit? The process is I met Mark Barrett, the owner of International Field. through Andy Wilson from Sonica and then we we decided to do a single called Solito which is including the and then it went down very well all the vinyls sold out because I think he pressed a thousand of each with some remixes with Wolf, Muller and other people So it all sold out. Then we thought, well, we're going to do an album. And the idea of the three producers came more from his side. I mean, I always collaborate with different people from his side. And then we kind of choose, you know, I mean, telephones, I suggest them. hanging and then he came up with Wolf Muller and Tornado Wallace and they all came to my house in Sant'Inez and everything was born there you know everyone came for a week and it was working like the chemistry was amazing because these kids is incredible but When they came to my house, the first thing I do is to know each other. We eat, we talk for a few hours, listen to music. And they're just playing what I was playing 30 years ago. And I have the original records at home, so it was already a big link between them and me, you know? So it was already a big respect, me for them, for what they're doing, and them for me. So it was very good. Everyone is a different personality, a different person, but the three of them, and also Mark, you know. Was it very important to you that they came to Ibiza and experienced the island and that was a part of it? Yeah, I think it's important they came to my house and they see a little bit of the island. I would like to do the same thing again, but... More time. Because I like, when I produce stuff, I like to leave and macerate the track there. Because if I have this album, I'm really proud. I think maybe it's the best thing I ever did. But I like more time to produce. These kids, they're so fast. It's like, wow. You know, hey. hold it man you know have a listen keep it let's start a new one and tomorrow we take it back and see we're missing something how did the three producers and Mark as well how did they differ in the way they okay well let's start for hanging telephones telephone is I don't know it's Mr. Happy himself he's positing jolly, happy, great guy, you know, really nice producer. A big fan of the Balearic music. He's got big knowledge on even stuff that I didn't know he showed me. We did some solo. Luis Tornado Wallace is very quiet. He actually doesn't speak much. But he's a scientist, the motherfucker. I gave him a direction, some glues, because a couple of tracks we did, we were not completely, especially the dub one, I show a smell, that one we were not completely happy. We have only two and a half minutes and he came back one week after with an amazing track. So he's more of a scientist tornado. And Wolf Muller is the most sweet, the youngest. He's a bit of a hippie inside him. He's a great drum programmer. He touched me a lot because he was asking me, because I can be his father, about telling me some Ibiza stories and stuff like that. It was a great experience with the three of them. With the four of them, sorry. Was it a collaboration? You just worked together in the studio and people would do different things, bounce ideas off each other? Yeah, everyone brings their own. They all have a Mac, but they all bring a hanging light to have his own keyboard and pedals and different toys. So everyone brings a little bit of gear because they cannot bring a lot because he was in the house, so we set up in there. in the living room like here. Yeah, everyone having some way of working, you know. But you were very much kind of leading the... Directing. This is what I'm good at. My ear and the measure, the timing. elements you know make sure that it's only one track in the album i'm not very happy because he sounds very thin very you know digital so to make sure that he's got that warmth etc etc i mean basically director orchestra you know i'm the one who's sitting on the sofa telling you what to do When we last spoke you said that we've reached the near saturation point when it comes to making music. Yeah, saturation. Near saturation, that there's no new music being made, it's just kind of reinterpretations of old things. I mean, do you still agree with that? No, it's a lot of new music, but it's on the ground level. I mean, the new stuff, the EDM and the bass and some of the bass, kind of like it's house, really. But that EDM, I bloody hate it. It's just music designed for massive sound systems and for big shows in Las Vegas or the big clubs now. But it's absolutely nothing new to me. It's just overproduced, overcompressed. you know, breaks, filters, cheesy lyrics. For me, I don't think that music will go down in history. But that's me, you know, I'm not trying to be negative, I don't know. I mean, I believe if Bach listened to what I was playing, he would say the same, you know, I don't know. I don't know if maybe I'm wrong. but I don't think it will go down to history. Actually, they're fucking people's brains, kids' brains, yeah. I suppose the argument is that people will start listening to EDM and then slowly they'll discover... But hopefully, hopefully, you know. And eventually they'll end up at Jose Pellilla. Hopefully, because it's going on for too long. But I think the music industry have a lot of... to do with this and all the media and the digital world you know have a lot to do all the cheesy part of it you know everybody wants to have the same clothes that kind of clothes and that look and that chic and that money and the boat and the private jet it's all that it's not it's not healthy so you've released the album yeah what happens now what happens this summer Well, I said a few months ago I want to take a break, which I am, really, but I have some compromises. And now I've been in Expo Universal in Milan doing a gig for a cooperative, which actually was great. Amazing place they did there. And now I have some other compromises. I do the Jockey Club, five dates, the first one at the end of the month, which that was signed. But really I'm a bit exhausted. But it's more the travelling. a couple of other experiences I have with one ex-manager and all together you know it's a point you know I'm 61 now so I need it I need time for myself I want to move on a little bit and start to know my 2000 and I want to make the step into the memory sticks yeah I have to I have to because I'm... But anyway, I still play. I need to have something in my hand. I don't know. It's like, you know, why this thing? But anyway, it has to be done. So basically, I just need a break to be a better DJ, really. But I'm still researching every day. I have a discog shop, a record shop. like 3,000 records and you know I'm still with the music but I'm taking it more easy now and yeah you mentioned that you're moving house but you also said that you're considering leaving Ibiza yeah And you have considered it for the past couple of years? Yes, for whatever reason, you know, I'm still paying rent. As I say, I don't have my own house. So here it's impossible to buy a house now. I mean, with the money I make, you know, I mean, if I was doing gigs for 100,000, yeah, no problem. but that's not going to happen. I don't think in that stage of my life. And I'm not going to start to do hits. So no, but also because I want to be more close to my family, which they're in Barcelona. So, I mean, I've been saying I'm leaving the island for a few years now, but I don't know. I'm going back to, you know, I'm going back to living in a house that I just lived 20 years ago. I just have a car that I just have 20 years ago. I don't know, something is happening. So I don't know, maybe I'm staying here for another few years. I used to have a car like that one, red. I used to go to England. with that Renault 4, do all up and down to Leeds, to, you know, Bristol from Stockholm train. And I have no heater. I'm just to go have a blanket on top of my snow and Renault 4 with my records and everything from Spain to... you know to to england with all the record winter clothes the decks because those days you got to have your decks to practice at home yeah and now i'm kind of going back to the to the roots again you
