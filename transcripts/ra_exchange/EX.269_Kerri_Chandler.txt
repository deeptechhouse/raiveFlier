Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, our series of conversations with artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Stephen Titmuss, and I'm a staff writer at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is Kerry Chandler. Kerry has made some of the most emotionally charged house music ever. That's partly due to his skill as a producer, but also to do with where he gets his inspiration. His music comes from a remarkably personal place, because both happiness and personal tragedy inspire his records. He's about to reach his 25th year in dance music, so we discuss the experiences that have shaped the life of a house music legend. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net. and follow us on Soundcloud at ra-exchange. An exchange with Kerry Chandler is up next. So, a lot of artists that come into this interview situation say they're inspired by their parents' record collection, but your father's record collection seemed to be something quite special, something out of the ordinary. Can you tell us a little bit about that? My dad is a DJ. He still is a DJ. When I grew up, that's all I remember, just going through his records. The funny thing is, I wasn't supposed to be playing his records. So when he would leave home, I would actually make little piles of records I wanted to hear. And either A, I would request it, and if he wasn't coming home soon enough, I'd find a way to turn everything on and play them myself. It's just amazing, you know, because I always knew like the artist names after a while of what I was looking for. And I always looked for like Linus Smith or one of these things, you know, Earth, Wind & Fire stuff. And, you know, Cooling Again, because one of my dad's friends surfaced the same thing. You know, I got to see like Uncle Pick, you know, this is his new record. I want to check it out. Yeah. What age were you when you first started digging through your dad's collection? Oh God, maybe 10, 10 or 11. I thought my dad was the coolest dude on the planet. And everybody seemed to love my dad for some reason. Like, everybody was like, where's your dad? No, no. And it was just like, you know, I was just following him around and watching him. I was like, Dad. This is interesting. And it just felt like, yeah, I love what I heard and what I saw him doing. It kind of turned into a family business after a while. So your dad was a local New Jersey DJ. Did he play clubs or radio stations? He played both. He has an amazing radio voice. I mean, he's the deepest. voice like i mean you wouldn't want him calling you like come into the house it's like oh there's a problem But he was always into that. He did a couple radio stations back home as well. But he did a lot of different clubs around New York and New Jersey. And that's where I really got to really see things. When I could go out, I always get to see him do festivals and things like early sets, early on. And after a while, he actually had me when he... finally figured out I could DJ, he actually used to bring me in to let him warm up. I'd just warm up for him. They'd stand me on a crate, and I knew the records because I've gone through them. This is going back to the record collection question. And they'd just hand me over records, and I'd beat match everything. And that was the interesting thing because... A lot of them back then, they didn't do that. I was beat matching. I mean, it was tight. I'd figure out drum rolls and where things sped up and slowed down, especially for disco records. And it just became, I was obsessed with it. It was an obsession, and I had to know every piece of the record and all the breakdowns and where it went and how to extend them. And it just became my, every summer especially. That's all I wanted to do, just listen to records and understand how they were made. And I got very, very lucky to go into the studio and watch some of these records being created. And my dad used to have people come over, like Sharon Red doing performances at the club and all these other people. And I always got to see a lot of people perform live over the tracks. you know, and I was like, wow, this is cool. And to this day, I still do it just because I enjoy, you know, seeing that live part of something. So that was a serious musical education for your father. Absolutely. It felt normal. I wanted to do it. I mean, it's part of my life as a child. I mean, we always have. like parties for no reason just especially on the front lawn it was like i thought that was like just it it was like we grew up in a interesting place it was just a bunch of we were living like the projects but he'd take speakers outside and hang like horns on the fire escape and that the whole neighborhood just became a block party and nobody cared they just had fun And that was just a normal thing for you as a kid? Yeah, it was a normal thing. It's just like, just because. So you just thought, oh, it's not raining outside. Let's just have a party, all of us outside. That was it. So it was almost predestined that you would become a DJ? I'm guessing it must have been. So when did you start playing a musical instrument? Oh, I was about maybe 10 or 11 years old. And just like any other kid, I don't want to actually be in the class. I would love the music anyway, but I went to the school and I was like, okay, what instruments are there I could take up, you know, that were left pretty much. Because by the time I figured out you can actually take. music class, you know, most of the good instruments are gone. So when I went in, there were only like three left. One was flute. I'm like, I'm not doing flute. Timpani. What am I going to do? Like banging a, no, it's not going to work. And the third one, which actually I stuck with and I love still to this day, I still play, is upright bass. It was crazy trying to bring that thing back and forth home. But yeah, I stuck with it and my best friend doc. It's just like we grew up together since we were like four years old He became the bouncer at Zanzibar. So to kind of tell you how big he is, it's like trying to walk through this door he has to duck down. So he'd always carry my bass home. So thank God that was my best friend. So it was always fun. We'd walk home, he'd carry it back, back and forth, get ready to go to school. Here's Doc again. We'd go walking back and forth, this ridiculous thing. Like, it's taller than me. But I've loved it. I still to this day, I have a set of them. And yeah, that's the first. from when I took up acoustic bass. And you mentioned that your dad was surrounded by producers and musicians and singers. When did you think, okay, now I want to record some of this music. I want to start producing. The first time I went to Mikiel Mohamed's studio, which is one of the writers for Kool & The Gang. And I'm so used to like a two-channel mixer. We used to have a Clubman one-on-one, Meteor. It was like big wood box with two, I mean, long faders. These faders were like, you know, the size of my hand, like long, big, you know, very minimal, you know. Just like phono, phono. Maybe the newer model had like, you could switch it to line and a big crossfader. and just a couple set of turntables. That's the mixer I was used to. So when I walked into the studio and I saw their mixer, and it was like, that's a mixer. I was like, that's a mixer? That, the thing the size of this wall, is a mixer? And so I was fascinated with it and watching how they track things. And I got to sit in on sessions and watch how they recorded things and learn how to use tape machines and just all the instruments and the inputs and all the preamps and all these things. And I was like, wow. And then at the end, learn how they actually mixed all this stuff. And after a while, I became an intern at a television studio. And then I went into a recording studio and did the same thing. So by the time I was 14, 15, I was really like, yeah, this is exactly what I want to do. Was it more as an engineer first that you started off rather than a producer? Yeah, that's exactly what happened. And I found myself on the weekends DJing in clubs. And what would happen... is that I would make edits of these things. I used to sit and splice tape, like, you know, just making tape edits and things I could actually play in the club and, you know, just doing overdubs of things. And I'd put them all on reel and I'd take them out to the club to play. At one point, we made this song up called "Drink On Me." And I played at Club America, and Club America was a very interesting club. Me and Johnny Dangerous and Iain Johnson. And what would happen is that during the course of a night, there were two levels to this club. The dancers would be on one level, like on the ground floor. It's almost like a basement. And it was amazing down there. It had a Richard Long system. It had 30-inch woofers. All the way around the room, these louvre horns, amazing system. And they had another section where it was just bar and, like, I would say suit and tie people. And they would always go downstairs, and they would try to, you know, just stare at, you know, the dancers like they were zoo animals. And it was just like no good for anybody. So Teole, which was one of the dancers, Teole Hassan Brown, that's the guy. He was really there. And he had the crews and everybody powder on the floor, typical. We made this thing up. that we would have the bartender give away free drinks. And the drink of choice was Sex on the Beach. So what we did was anytime they heard, the bartenders heard the song coming, and I thought the floor was getting too cramped with suit and tie people and not, you know, leaving the dancers alone, I'd play drink on me. this red light would come on and start spinning. And all of these suit and tie people, you know, cheap, you know, trying to get women or whatever, they run, I mean, like run back upstairs across the, you know, steps, up the gate, across this drawbridge thing, and they just all stay upstairs and mind their business, you know, having their free drinks and leave the dancers to it. So that's what the reference to Sex on the Beach is in that record. Yeah, you can have sex on the beach twice. So we're giving away, so they're giving women free drinks. And it's our inside joke. Amazing. But one thing about that record, actually, I do think that it's almost like a template which you did over the next 20 years. You know, it's got the disco song. point it which is obviously a huge thing for you but it also really stands up well as a production it still sounds really strong you know yeah well i i just wondered you know even back then it seems like clearly you were putting a lot of emphasis into the science of production and the sound of it Would that be true? Absolutely. I mean, sound was, I mean, at the time, the tools we had, I mean, I had to try to make the best of what we were doing. Funny enough, that song was actually made on a four track. Yeah. So it was like one of my quick edits before we actually got to the club. I've got to say, I've had a different way of running things. Most of the stuff I tried to run live, like MIDI tracks live, and anything that needed to be put to tape, I would have on tape. Even the studio that I was in, it wasn't really, you know, until they really started buying the gear I was asking for, it was really kind of just, you know, simple makeshift stuff. Until they really, really, you know, began, you know. trusting in what I said, they, you know, then they really started buying the gear and the things that I knew we needed. And then it became a real. studio. But at the time it was just one of those things where it's an afterthought. It was a guy who ran an insurance company, funny enough. And he says he wanted to get into music and he had some basic gear. But once he saw things were taking off and like, oh wow, there's something to this. That's what happened. And I suppose a really other quite interesting part of your career, which perhaps people might not know so much about, is your early hip hop stuff as Art of Origin. Art of Origin, yeah. Wow, you know this stuff. Yeah. But yeah, just tell us about that. Oh, that's even funnier. Where I grew up, you can actually do both easily. You could do house, disco, hip hop, R&B. Like you would play all of that in one night. Just as how it was back in the 80s where we grew up. And it was just one of those things. You do the break dance, you, you know, hip hop, paint. All of our friends from school, everybody was a hip hop rapper or something, break dance. or something. It had something to do with any type of culture. And they just went hand in hand. You could play everything in one night. And what happened was I did both since I was DJing on the weekends. I used to play house all the time because I was around the corner from, I mean, the same guys who owned Zanzibar owned Club America and they owned another club called Club 88. So we'd all interchange between the clubs. And, you know, I was just, I was a resident. It didn't matter. They just stuck me in anywhere I needed to go. And I had to know lighting and sound and everything. So it just didn't go in there and you're like, oh, I'm a resident DJ and I show up and just DJ. You had to maintain the sound. You had to maintain the lights. You had to do everything. You didn't just go in and I'm like, oh I had a time card. You had to go in and punch in, literally, and just take care of everything in the club. And if you didn't, they'd fire you. They were just like, okay, we'll get somebody else to replace you, whatever. In saying all of this, it was just a combination of everything. You could play everything and do everything. And we had a really good in at a radio station. And I just met Merlin Bob. Merlin Bob was at BLS. And so was Naeem Johnson. And BLS was like the premier station besides KISS back in the States. And you would listen to someone's dance show all the time. And at the same time, they had Red Alert and all these other people and Molly Moore. We just, we listened to everything. We just loved it. You know, even on like, you know, other stations like WHBI. And it was just, it was a culture. We loved just music. We could play everything. We could all intertwine with each other. Each other's house parties were hip hop and rap, house and disco, anything. And what happened was I had a crew, just like every other crew does, and we all did battles. And funny enough, my name back then was Scratchmaster Chaos. So that's where Chaos came from. And then it took it even further. So Scratchmaster 2 just carried Chaos. And then we just took out the rest and just put down Chaos 623. And then after a while, it was Carry Chaos. when I started to wrap stuff off, it was really, really interesting because the house stuff that I was doing actually just got signed to Atlantic and Profile, funny enough. Dan Charnas was at Profile and he was trying to get us signed with Profile. He left Profile and went with Def Jam and Def, you know, like Def, what did they call it? Def America at the time, which was Rick Rubin's label. And he took the project over to them, and he was like, yeah, let's do it. So we were signed by Rick Rubin over there. So at the same time, I have one career going, which was house, and I have a completely different career going, which was hip-hop. And it was absolutely hilarious because everybody that knew I did house music had no idea I was doing hip-hop, and the same vice versa. The whole hip-hop crowd, they were like, you did house? So it was absolutely hilarious to me. Yeah. And why did you, I guess, eventually start putting more of your time and effort into house music? It was one of those things that felt more like me. The big epiphany actually came to me because I felt like I could release myself in house music. I had my girlfriend, Tracy, which is really sad. She was murdered at Club Zanzibar. And somebody raped her. We were supposed to get married. And it changed my life completely. And she loved house music. She absolutely loved it. She played me things that I was like, oh, wow, this is cool. And where are you finding this stuff? And I'm the DJ. I'm like, where are you finding this stuff? And I just remember just how much she enjoyed it. And I had to get it off of my mind. I really did. And losing her was hard. It still is hard. I still think about her a lot. And that's what Get It Off was. It was really a song called Get It Off My Mind. And I put a lot of the elements of what I felt into that song. Like, there's a part that goes, you are so vicious. And that was talking to her murderer. there's another part that goes, now is the time, now is the time. It's like, now is the time for me to get it off my mind. And there's a signature tone that runs through it where it just sounds like the record's being ripped off. Like, just rip! That's how my life felt. My entire groove changed. Like, my entire everything changed, and it switched. And I just felt better after that. I felt at peace. Like I could actually release myself with house music. I could do all sorts of things with hip hop. I love the beats. I love the dirty, grimy. I never did hip house. I never did any of that stuff. I always loved one way or the other. Either way, it had to be deep. It had to be raw. That's just how I was. And in mindset, I love deep stuff. Like, I just love breakdowns of everything. I love, like, dark beats and heavy, you know, bass lines. And that's what it was. And I found myself gravitating more towards the house. because I could release what I thought in my mind. And as rap stuff progressed, it used to be party stuff. But when it started becoming more West Coast based and a little more violent, that's not me. I'm a peaceful kind of dude. I don't want to carry around guns and all this kind of stuff. And there was that one point. that I was hanging out with my partner at the time, Chino, and it was my daughter's first birthday. And there was a shootout, you know, and I was sitting in the car right next to Chino. And it just, that was my wake up call. I was like, I can't do this anymore. I said, I have no reason doing this. This isn't my lifestyle. I don't want to have to worry about people running around trying to shoot me. over some rap. It's just that it doesn't make any sense. I had nothing to do with it. I mean, these two guys come up out of nowhere with ski masks on, talking about, you know, get out the car. Let's do this or whatever. And I thought it was a joke. I mean, the gun didn't even look real. I thought it was a joke. So I get out of the car. I'm like, all right, you got this. It's good. You know, they wanted Chino. And they just, I walked back. I don't even know how I got out of it, away from it. Chino just started speeding away with the car. They shot that car up. Like it had holes in it. And if anybody else was sitting in that car, they would have bought One bullet came in the bullets when we finally caught up, the bullets went all the way through the car like it was through it, like you could see like right through it. The thing that saved him, it hit the emergency brink and just ricocheted up through the roof. That's it. I was like, no. This is I love music, but this isn't the way I want to do it. And I really after that, I just said, no, I'm doing I'm doing house. I'm not playing this game. I have a daughter. I'm not trying to, you know, find out. Was that the reality of hip hop in the 90s? Or was it, you know, obviously Newark, you know, is perhaps, you know, sort of a little dodgy area? Or... Had it changed? Was the music a part of that? It was going into that. And that's what I felt. And it's like, that wasn't me anymore. I was a different person. I was peaceful. I didn't have to be more than what I was. Yeah, I grew up in the ghetto. And yeah, I've been around the surroundings, but I wanted better for myself and my family. I didn't want to have to just stay in that mentality because eventually something would have happened. Because, I mean, it's all about, you know, your rep and what you could pull off. And, you know, you're not going to be punked out. And, you know, I had that mentality. I didn't like the person I was. You know, we'd always, you know, hang out and, you know, have some drinks and stuff. I never did any crazy drugs or anything, but it was always that, you know, base like that. It was always, all my friends had guns. All my friends had drugs. All my friends were drug dealers. And, you know, so that only led me into one place. And I was like, no, I'm either going to do that or I'm going to. do something that I really love as much. It's music. But I'm going to do it more in a positive light. And since then, after that, I said to myself, I'm never going to make a record that I can't play for my grandmother. And that was the truth of it. And it's funny you mention your grandmother because you actually made a record with your grandfather a few years later. Yeah, which is crazy. And then I loved you. I mean, I love my, I miss my grandfather a lot because of that. And he was absolutely one of my inspirations. Was your grandfather into house music when you was doing that stuff? Yeah, you know what the funny thing is, my favorite time with him. It was one of my birthday parties we threw, and my grandfather was the host. And it was the coolest party I think I've ever had, just having him there. The minute he got on stage, it was so charismatic, and everybody wanted to see him. And he actually did like, she's crazy, on stage, and everybody just ran up to the front just to see who he was, because they didn't realize that's who he was until they started doing it. And it was just like, oh, this is crazy. And then it was just like Elias singing Follow Me and Dee Dee was there singing My My Lover. And they were dancing on stage together. It was just, it was hilarious. But it was like one of those things where, wow, this is, I actually get to, you know, do this with my grandfather. So yeah, it was absolutely wonderful. Where was that party? It was actually in East Orange. It was a place called Scandals. Yeah. It was Scandals. It was a scandalous place. One thing actually, we've mentioned Zanzibar a few times. It's one of those clubs that I'm sure many dance music fans have heard about. But perhaps it might be cool to hear what made that place so special. Because it seemed like it was very different to the New York scene and the Chicago scene. I've seen it kind of had its own thing going on. Yeah, well, a lot of it, I mean, Hippie Torellis was there actually first. I mean, he really, he kind of broke it. It used to be Abe's Disco, if you can imagine that. It was a discotheque. And yeah, Hippie kind of broke it down. And then Tony came in after and then he had the radio show. But the difference between was Tony was breaking an artist. It was a lot of vocal-based, gospel-based stuff. And in an area like where we came from, we all had hope and we all had belief and we all had, you know, family ties with each other. You know, we all wanted to go in and just this was our sanctuary. This is our place where we can just forget about what was outside for a minute. and just go party, and just let the music take everything away. And you didn't want to leave. And Tony was pretty much the preacher, the guy driving the sermon. And my favorite thing was to go around the corner. America was around the corner. We'd close about 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning. And I used to take like a cab back in the morning or a bus back with my crates or I'd leave them at the club and just walk around the corner and go, go here, Tony. That was my ritual. I had to go in the middle. floor and just listen. Then I'd go up to the booth, give him a big hug, and he'd go back on the floor and listen some more. I used to sit right up in the basements. That was my favorite thing. I loved the way it felt. It's just like that room and watching the dancers and the way it went. It was just one of those things where it was like a learning curve. And then when he would do the radio shows, we all taped it religiously. And then you take the tape and go to Moving Records, which is up the street. Like, what is this? What the heck is he playing? What is this? Do you have it? And Abby would go, oh, yeah, it's right there. That's the new blah, blah, blah. And this is this one. And that was it. It's just one of those things where you could actually go. And maybe a week or two later, it'd be sitting there on the shelf. And then after a while, all of these people were people that we all knew. And all these people that he'd break. If it wasn't for Tony, I probably wouldn't be doing what I'm doing. Because he's the guy that really broke everything through him. Camacho of Basil, Disciple. I mean, the whole crew, Wild Pitch crew, we used to do all the parties together. All of these people. were just we were all like this we're really really tight yeah yeah you can't really talk about house music without Tony Humphries really let's be let's be honest for for our area absolutely no there would there wouldn't be any of us without Tony for the definite, like Jersey Sound, Blaze and all of it. Forget it. He broke every vocal house record there was and made sure it was broken. And then what happened was after he played it for a while, he bring the artist in. and showcase them like, okay, fine. Here's Bono. I'm going to play this for like a few weeks. And then now here they are. You know, Burrell Brothers, same thing. Anybody who he was playing, you can guarantee that in a few weeks, you'd look for it, really look for it. Like, I want to see this person perform. And we'd all just run to the stage when it was time. And then you run back, you know, and you just hope you didn't miss it. That performance element in dance music, it's not something that's necessarily really there, especially with vocal singers nowadays. Oh, it's tricky, yeah. - Something you miss perhaps? - In some ways, I mean that's why I ended up doing a few projects. I did a hologram project just because of them. And I got a lot of singers together because of that. 'Cause you don't see that element in clubs at all anymore. It's much easier to just have DJs row after row. But I guess some clubs found it cheaper and easier rather than paying a performer for 20 minutes a couple grand, just pay another DJ and just let it go. And then they thought like a few times it would break up the night, especially with the younger crowd that just wanted to dance, didn't care about anything. So what I did was I found a way to, with the holograms anyways, to incorporate it in where the newer generation would be like, what is that? And this thing was just apparition appears on stage as I'm mixing because it was just seamless. And I can get away with it and during the course of a night, just play one. And then all of a sudden there's a, there's a, I don't know, Kenny Bobian standing on stage singing. And then it was just go, you know, he'd fade in like, you know, like it was Star Trek and then fade away again. You know, so I, I, I love the idea of also like bringing something brand new. into a club environment and yeah like your some of your setups are pretty complicated you've just mentioned you know you've performed setups with holograms in them and you know you've had keyboards and all manner of things what's the most complicated setup you've you've run with there must be some pretty outlandish ones yeah most of the time it's either with like the live band I mean, one of the most complicated ones I've done maybe for Heineken in South Africa, and I had the holograms, I had the laser harps, I had all the band stuff, I had live stuff going, and that took a minute to actually set up, and they had an amazing staff to make sure everything was right. And we did sound checks and setups all day long to make sure it ran right. That was probably the most complicated thing to do on the opposite side of the planet, trying to coordinate everything and making sure everything was there. So we were beta testing stuff over Skype. But it all ended up working out really well in the end. Amazing. So perhaps to go back to one of your early tracks that is hugely influential still today, the Atmosphere EP, track one. I feel it's still a record that... you hear out a lot, it's still a record that people imitate a lot. Can you just tell us about how you made that track and how that came around? Well, funny enough, it was supposed to be for Sybil Jeffries originally. And Jerome, he was over at Atlantic, Jerome Sidnell, which is still one of my best friends, period. He wanted to put together an EP, and he really wanted it raw. I mean, this is the kind of thing that... These are guys from, like, major labels. I mean, Jerome was at Atlantic, Merlin Bob was at Atlantic, and then they started doing East-West and all this stuff. But we were all at Shelter and Nels and all these things, so these really underground clubs, and it had, like, you know... commercial dance music, but they always wanted something raw. Like even when I did the theme song for Shelter, it was like, you know, okay, let's make a song about the club. Simple. Don't do anything crazy. Just do a nice four track raw thing. And that's what this thing was supposed to be. But originally the vocal was supposed to be from Sybil Jeffries and it was supposed to be for her album. But Jerome said, no. He said, let's just put this thing together and put it out as like some dubs, some real dark, crazy dubs. So I said, okay, well, let's go for it. Maybe about a week later, gave it to him, and he put it out as a bootleg in Japan first. And that was really odd because it was something called the 007. It didn't even have names on it. It just said like, you know, one, two. three and four on it just some weird white label that was it called double the seven so then freddie sannon from shelter got an idea like he's like wait what is this thing why isn't this out like properly and he says i want it can i have it i said well you got to talk to jerome and that was it and it just took off from there it's just this weird underground track i did that you know just just found legs of its own and took off and you mentioned club shelter there another really important US club. Again, it's perhaps one that people might not know so well. What was so great about Shelter? Shelter was exactly what it sounded like. It's a shelter for the meek and distant franchise, as my father would say. Coming into a place where you can be free, literally. You can go in there and nobody cares about who you are or where you come from. You kind of go in there and you just lose your mind. You go in there, the system was ridiculous. I mean, they're like four huge stacks of like Richard Long just like pounding away, but in the cleanest, baddest way you can imagine. And I mean, the booth set up was just like the best on the planet. Like you can go in there, you can just create. That's how that booth was. And in fact, when I went in, I actually did shelter in the shelter. I designed it in there. I made that track. in the shelter. Really simple, just put my drums up, tuned everything up with my my 909 and just put my modules in. I did a quick sequence and said, here's the levels. This is what I need. And I'm going back to the studio. I'll mix this and I'll be back. I'll be back next week. It'll be done. That was it. So you made the track in the club. I love doing that. Matter of fact, one of my favorite ones I did was, let me see, it was art department. And it was this thing I did for Cape Simcoe. And I actually did it in one of my other favorite clubs, which is... Bob Beeman in Germany. And the same thing. I walked in there and I listened to the system and me and the other Dave. We were really cool. And I said, you know what? I want to mix this in this room. I want to actually get the levels and everything in here. And I just started to track and we're just there just kind of going across things and we'd run out to the middle of the room. This is good. Yeah, take that. No, this is better. And go back and And yeah, I just made it right in the club, came back, gave it to the boys, and they put it out. That's amazing. No, but it's my favorite. I mean, even with my... My setup at home, I have club monitors. I have different monitors, but on one wall, there's a system. I have a vertex system and folded horns and everything. So when I turn it on, I can actually hear what it sounds like in a club because that's the best vibe for me. You're making club music. You want to see what it sounds like. I don't care which monitors you have. For some reason, the depth of it isn't going to come across the same way. You want to feel it pounding. You want to hear what it sounds like in the top. And if something's too loud or too low, you'll know right away. Yeah, why emulate something when you can do it for real, I guess. Yeah, exactly. If I had enough space, yeah, absolutely. That's the first thing I look for. Another one of my favourite tracks from you, and I'm not sure if this is true, is Inspiration. How long did it take you to make that? Was it an hour, I read? At least, it was the quickest song. I mean, the background for that was really, same thing. One of the first times I met Arnold Jarvis, and he came into the studio. And he just kind of looked around. It looked like Ministry of Sound, one of my studios, like at the time. And I had this studio set up in the middle of the room, like the gear. And it was just a wall of speakers. It was like a wall of sound. That's what I used to call it, the wall of sound, the purple wall of sound. He came in and he just kind of looked. He said, this is crazy. And I gave him a mic and we just started messing around. He just came from a hospital, and he saw his friend. His friend was dying of, like, cancer. And he was just like, you know, he was telling me the story about how inspired he was. His friend is still happy and making jokes and cracking. He says his friend was so inspirational to him. And that, you know, he would... And he was really surprised about how happy he was, still optimistic about it, and this man is dying. And I was like, wow, that's a deep story. And we just started talking a bit. And he wrote like four or five words on his hand, literally. Like, that was it. And then I just made a basic track. It was inspirational. the rough version of it, just like some basic chords. And he just stood in the middle of the room, started singing. And he just came back to me and says, can you play this with me live? And I said, I haven't done that in a while, but yeah, why not? Let's just do it. Let's just, you know, have a take of it. I striped some tape, because you had to stripe tape for as long as you could. And I had another reel, maybe it was about 11 minutes left on the tape. So I striped it all the way to the end, wound it back. set everything off, hit play, played piano on it. He started singing. That was it, one take. That was it. That was exactly how we sang it, one tape through. And I ran it back, I listened to it, EQ'd it a little bit, and I said, whoa, I think we've got something. This is cool. And we kind of sat back, and I was like... I need a chorus though. I said, this is, I never did one kind of like this. I said, and he kept saying inspiration in the song. You're an inspiration. And I said, that's it right there. That's it. And I found a way to record him. and reverse the phase so I can cancel everything else out in the room. And I just sampled that part and I put it back in the song. And I made that, I kind of doubled it and then I kind of truncated a bit of the other vocal down and detuned it just slightly and spread them. And I flew it in every time I thought it felt like it needed to be where that spot was. And that was it. That was all it was to that song. How did you know it was done? You just knew, I guess, at that point. Yeah, you know what it was? It's like if I knew I would add something to that song and it started taking away, that's how I always know. If I start adding to a song and it feels like it's taking away from that song, that means either A, I need to do another song, or it's done. Yeah. I suppose after, though, you know, you started having these breakthrough tracks, like, you know, we mentioned the atmosphere of inspiration. It seems like your career really started to take off from, you know, 92 to maybe 95. When did you get a sense, you know, that you was having a real impact internationally? Well, here's the funny part. I mean, I think the thing that made me determine. more than anything, was that, I mean, there's been moments in my life where it's just like, wow, I don't know how I'm going to, in a way, keep going. But there would always be, like, God would always give me a sign that, you know, like, he would let me hear or see something or something would happen in my life that would be like. okay, you know what? I'm not going to give you anything that's too hard for you, but you can bypass this and do better. And it happens all the time. This is where Chaos 623 comes in, which is June 23rd, because I always have something really strange happen every year. I mean, like this year was even crazy. I had a tornado. We don't get tornadoes in New Jersey. It ripped up my backyard. I'm like, I'm moving, and this is, I'm like, odd stuff all the time. But what happened and really made me really want to keep my career going is that everyone's saying I couldn't. It's impossible. I walked into a record store one day and my friend Randy was there. with this other guy. And I guess the person buying records didn't know who I was at all. I'm just a kid walking in. And I just finished Deeper. Like, just finished Deeper. Like, you know, Deeper. I'm happy. I'm walking down the street getting ready to go to the record store. The record store, thank God, was like right there. I can go in there. I walk in, and there's these guys there, and I guess Randy's telling them what's going on with records, and they saw a couple of mine up there. And it's always nice to go into the record shop and see your stuff on the wall. And I'm like, yeah, this is cool. It's like, there's one, there's one, you know. And I just had like, I think My My Lover just came out. I was like, there's one. And this guy just says, he says, yeah, this is, you know, Carrie Chandler stuff. And, you know, I'm standing behind this guy. He's like, oh, yeah, I heard he's hot at the moment. He's supposed to be the hot guy, I ran back to the studio after that. I was like, oh, no, I'm not ever leaving the studio. Not. No way. It's like that was it for me. And I was really, after that, I was like, I'm going to make everybody like, no. Whatever I do, I'm going to make it. I'm going to keep my momentum. So these kind of things always made me think ahead. Like the first time I even came to London, the first club I was blessed to play was Ministry of Sound. I'd never even been out of the country. At 18, I'm flying somewhere. I'm scared to death. Like, I didn't know what it would be like. So the night before, I wrote everybody I knew letters. Some good, some bad, you know? But I wrote letters to everyone like, oh, you know, you're a horrible person, or I loved you, that kind of stuff. So every time there's something like that, it always kind of kicks me in the butt and says, hey, hey, wake up. You're only as good as your last record. So I've always kind of kept it at that. Well, it is fascinating, though, because a lot of people you did start out with in the 80s, they're not here anymore. So almost that guy in the record store, if he'd pointed to someone else, that might have been true. I just feel blessed that people... or into what I do, you know, because it never started that way. And I think the other reason that things have lasted as long as they have is because I really care about people who, you know, listen to what I'm saying. I don't just make a record up and say, oh, I'm going to make money off this and do that kind of thing. every record I've ever done has something to do with my life, even down to the last one I did, which is Who's Afraid of the Dark? And that comes from me and my son playing hide-and-go-seek in my basement. He likes to turn the lights off and run around in the dark, and his sister's scared of the dark. You know, he'll turn the lights on. And often my daughter would turn the lights back on. Stop, Max. Cut it out. And, you know, she'd turn the lights back off. And the way we find each other around the basement is that he'll, like, bang on a pipe or something. And I can hear it. And I'm like, okay, I hear you. And they start laughing in the corner and giggling. And then the thing is with me is like I like to take all the things that I learn and, you know, and love and put them into songs. And it has something to do with my life. Otherwise, I don't make a track. I'll leave it alone. I'll go live a little bit and then come back for it. And there's a sound in Who's Afraid of the Dark that sounds like a pipe in the beginning banging. It goes ding, ding, ding, ding. That's actually my son banging on a pipe. I mic'd it and put it into the track. And then I started showing him what's going on with the track. And he gets a good laugh out of it. really the opposite approach to most dance music producers generally you know i think i think you have to live a little bit see that the fun part is dance music is it's a very honest music you know you can tell who's lying when they're making music up it's like I have to live something before I make it. And I think that's the reason. You have to care about what you do. You have to care about the people you're putting the stuff out for. And I'm hoping that some of these things touch people in a positive way and inspire someone to do something better than I did. And I'm genuinely happy to see all my friends do well. I am. And I try to help everybody I think that has a good way to go. And they had no outlet themselves. And I don't want anyone to go through some of the stuff I've gone through. So, you know, I mean, my friends, I value very much so. And the people that play my music and, you know, keep it going, yeah, or keep the scene going. You know, so that's important to me to make sure, you know, if I can in some way help the next generation come in and, you know, do what they do. And that's something you seem to be really doing with certainly your new label. Can you tell us a little bit about that? Because that's primarily with a lot of new, younger artists you're working with there. Yeah, Mad Tech is that way. Madhouse is just my baby. That's my start. Very soulful, deep, and just heartfelt. They're songs. Mad Tech, I started because I met a lot of younger people that I really believe are very talented, and they need a springboard and a voice to kind of get their music out, and they need a bit of a direction. So I kind of take a lot of people under the wing and just go for it. I can help them any way to do what I believe in. My favorite right now is Voyer. There's Lola Purple. There's Citizen. I mean, you know, at the time before this even, I remember getting a call in from Stevie from Martinez Brothers. He was like 14, 15 years old. And they just, you know, every once in a while email me for like some kind of advice. They met my partner, Dennis. He took them in. They were already, you know, amazing anyway. You know, and that's what happens. Like you just keep, you know, pushing. We all push each other. And to this day, they're like my little brothers. And, you know, they edge me on. You know, we talk mess with each other all the time. We actually started a jazz trio now I love the idea of the energy that's coming in now. I remember it feels the same way when I started. And it's like, okay, they have this wonderful new vision of things. And, you know, as a perhaps an elder statesman of house music, does that keep you fresh? You know, because there's plenty of DJs that started out in the 80s that... rely on classics, you know, kind of almost stuck in the past almost. Is that one way that keeps your eye in? Oh, absolutely. I get a lot of energy from what they do and what they play and all these things. I really listen. And I love a lot of the stuff I'm hearing. And I think the biggest thing is everyone always asks me, so what's your favorite time period in the house? I'm like, I haven't had it yet. I'm looking forward to the future, like what's coming next. And that's what I'm excited about more than anything, the next thing. I've always been excited about what's next. And one party that has certainly brought you to a younger audience would be Circo Loco, which you've had a strong association with for many years now. How did you first meet the crew there? Oh, that was interesting. It's funny, it circles back to... Tony Humphrey somehow. What happened was I wasn't really a big fan of the idea of Ibiza with, you know, bottle service and the way things turned into and she-she and that kind of stuff. And I was approached by Andreas and Antonio. And they were getting ready to start Circo Loco again, and they said they want to change the house scene, or dance scene, pretty much, in Ibiza. And they want to come up with a very signature underground deep house serum. and they wanted me to join the crew. And I kept saying for a minute, like, I don't know, I don't know anything about Ibiza. I'm not really interested in Ibiza. And everybody kept saying, well, maybe you should do it. And they would tell me how amazing the place was before. And I had no idea what Circle Local was at all. Had you been to Ibiza before? Yeah. I used to do a lot of parties. Actually, I mean, 2S parties and things like that and El Divino earlier than that. I enjoyed it to a point, but not to the point where I just had to be in Ibiza. It never occurred to me. that that would be the way forward for me. I was playing in Italy, and I met up with the guys. They wanted to meet up and explain it to me properly, like just meet. So I said, yeah, I'll go. I had a meeting with them, and we talked. And they said the magic word to me. They said, look, we don't have any, like, you know, bottle service stuff going on here. It's not a she-she kind of club. Here's the magic word. We have a big sound system in a red room. No lights or anything. I said, and I kind of looked at them. I said, what? I said, yeah. He says, there's not even a place to sit. You just, you go party and that's, or that's the end. And I said, what? So I thought about it. They were serious, so serious to the point where they got Tony Humphries to do a night at Circo Loco for like a year or something. And I said, wow, they're not joking around. They're serious. So, you know, they invited me to play and for the end of the year And I said, well, yeah, I'll try it. Why not? Let's see what it is. It can't hurt. I went in, and I just started. That was just me. I just played whatever I could play, the deepest, craziest thing I could play. And at one point, I played The Sun Can't Compare. There's this Mr. Finger song. And the minute I played, I was outside in the garden. It's just like when they did the closing party. And I couldn't believe what I was looking at. The sun came out. And this plane just flew over. Everybody's hands went up. The whole place just erupted. And I just like, what is going on here? Like, I need to be a part of this. I would absolutely love to do this. And that was it. And I just, I came in. We did a couple parties, you know, off-season, different places. And I met most of the crew. And they just welcomed me in, and we became family after that. I mean, all of us, we all keep in touch. I mean, as you can see from the Chaos Theory album, those are pretty much my DC-10 family and everybody else who I've been hanging out with. So that's, you know, we just keep the energy with each other. We play each other's stuff. We remix each other's stuff. We always keep in touch with each other. We're just like that, you know, and it's just been years and years and years and years. And we just watch each other kind of grow, you know. Is it ever a challenge to approach those kind of new gigs without compromising yourself somehow? Yeah, you would never know. I go there and play disco sometimes, and it works. It was absolutely scary. When Donna Summer died, a record I started was I Feel Love, and it just started the whole night, immediately. It just immediately went off. Or I'll play something like... Up Jump the Devil. I mean, where would you actually hear that? Anywhere. Like, it's an old disco record. But I found a way to throw it in, and they did that whole floor jump thing with it. For a while, you can play anything because they know who you are, and they enjoy your style after a while. We're all there for our own fun and reasons. We all push each other. We all try to make each other better. You know, all of us are like that, though. And we all kind of swap. If we want to DJ with each other, we kind of just do it, you know? Another party you've had a really big impact over the years would be Southport Weekender, which sadly came to an end this year. Yeah. When did you first get involved with that? Quite early on, I would imagine. Yeah. Funny thing is the first time I went there, I want to say it was 93. It was either 92 or 93. And the first experience I had, but it wasn't actually mine, it was I was going with Arnold Jarvis. And he was singing Inspiration, and he looked like he was the captain of the ship sailing away with this audience. I was like, oh, my God, what is this? And it's just like, you know, then I met Alex and everybody, and we all kind of got along. And after that, it was just history. I just kept coming back, and they kept inviting me back in different parties. it's just like family you know it's now you know same thing going to sunspeed you know so you know to finish it off i think he'll be back actually i know how alex works i think he's giving it a break but yeah but right now they're concentrating on sunspeed And it seems to be working out pretty well. They actually bought the club out there. I think it was called Barbarella's. They actually bought that. So it's kind of permanent now. Yeah. And that club's fantastic as well. It is. It's like an outdoor, amazing vibe there. And I suppose somewhere like South... is certainly one place, you know, where you could definitely play anything, perhaps even more Soulful House being such a big thing there. Yeah. Yeah, but it's a love. We all know each other for like 20 years. It's like playing for family in the living room. Literally. One thing I also wanted to talk to you about was Dennis Ferrer. You know, we mentioned him earlier, you know, but it sounds like you guys, when you first met, had quite an interesting meeting. He was working in an electrical store, right? Or something. Oh, yeah. Well, Dennis is my best friend, period. Him and Jerome are like, we're all very, very close. When I met Dennis. Dennis was working at a music store called Rogue. And he was pretty much the man there when it came to vintage gear. And he knew his stuff. He knew it well. And he was actually doing techno music at the time. And I can't remember. I think it was with Sinewave or something. And he played me a demo one day. And I was like, well, what's this about? And he says, yeah, I was thinking about doing this, and I've got to go back in the studio and do it and whatever. And I said, well, where are you working at? I can't remember what he said. But he said he couldn't seem to get there or whatever. And I'm like, oh, okay. Well, I said, if you want to come by, just come by my place. And he says, well, where are you? And I says, well, I'm in Union City He says, Bergen Line. I said, no, I'm from Bergen Line. What are you talking about? I said, Bergen Line and what? He says, 19th. I said, ah, I live on 14th. I said, whenever you want to come by, just come by. Just whenever you're off from whatever this is, just come by. So I'm in the studio with Jerome, and he comes by, and Jerome is like, why is he coming by here? He came by. He never left. Literally. He just came and stayed. He just took over my couch, just stayed. He lived down the street. He would not go home. And he just stayed. He had no idea, I don't think, who I was at all or anything I was doing, which was great because it's like, okay, cool. Well, you know, he's here just hanging out and just learning stuff and whatever. So I went to, since he was still there, I knew him for a while anyway, but I said, I'm getting ready to go to Boston and go DJ. And I played this party out there, and I started just playing, you know, really gospel And at one point, I was playing Why We Sing by Kenny Bobian, and he just stood in the middle of the floor with everyone else, and you could see him crying. Like, literally, he ran up to me, gave me the biggest hug, and says, He says, this is exactly what I want to do. This is what I want to do for the rest of my life. This right here. He says, I want this. He says, I want this feeling right here. This room, this whole thing. So that was it. He came back to the house. And I had a big enough space where I had another room full of gear, just like stuff in the back. And I just, I made a second studio and just let him have like room B pretty much. And it was it. And we just like, you know, and then I started Sphere, you know, and I figured that would give him a springboard to do what he wants. And that was it. He'd make a record or I'd make a record. And then we kind of remix each other's thing. But the best part was he was the best partner in the world without having a partner. Because it's like we'd hear each other's stuff from the other room. And then we'd try to top each other. So it was always that friendly competition. It was hilarious. Even down to DJing. He was never a DJ. So what I did was, and I know Dennis has an ego. I don't know if he'll admit it or not. He'll probably kill me for telling this story, but that's great. My cousin... is a hip-hop DJ. And she's really, really good. She goes on tour and all this other stuff, but I didn't tell him any of this. And I was into hip-hop, so I was doing hip-hop stuff too as well. So Dennis hasn't, you know, he's really like, he's trying with the turntables, just mixing and whatever. So I played this game we called Out. And you have to kind of follow the next person, just like playing basketball or whatever. You follow the next person doing the same routine. Or not, you know, you get an O. But we upped it a little bit. We all had, like, tequila shots. So anytime somebody would mess up, tequila shot. And it was always Dennis. So, like, he would play. I would play, and my cousin, you know, I'd do a routine, and my cousin would do the same exact thing, and then he'd try to mimic it. And I'm like, oh, good, same thing. And just by the end of the night, we were just drinking and being silly. But it got him to the point where he's like, I am never going to let that happen again. And every day, like religiously, before I even got it. home from wherever I was he'd be on the decks like every day like all day like picking records pulling stuff whatever it didn't care whatever it took that's what he was going to do he was never ever going to let that happen again did it ever get to the point I suppose it must do now where you know you feel like Dennis can give you a run for your money is that kind of surprised you? yeah we kind of we're not like that I like that a lot. We always do that. We always kind of kick each other in the butt. Yeah. One thing that I read was that what the big kind of trick he kind of learned from you was about the foot. It's always got to be about the kick drum. Oh, drums are first and foremost. It's always people come to dance. You've got to remember you're making a dance record. And I got to dance on the roads and pianos and things. They might get a hand in the air or something, or like someone going, yay. It's all about the dancers and what you're going to dance. You got to dance to the stuff. So the rhythm has got to be right. You know, the rest is just bass line and drums. That's the core. That's what gets you moving. The bass line keeps... the groove. The rest of the stuff you put on top makes it beautiful. That's it. That's really it. And what you put to it as far as a vocal or anything else after that is the message. That's kind of where you go for it. And there's probably a bunch of kids who make music listening to this now and wondering how can I get my kick drums sounding like Kerry Chandler's right now. There's tons of methods. I mean, the funny thing is I sat and I do this thing every once in a while with Red Bull Music Academy. And I can sit and explain it and explain it and explain it. It still comes down to what you pick out. You put garbage in, you're going to get garbage out. You pick your sounds first. You make sure you have the right sounds before you start doing anything. And all of these frequencies, they all need space. And that's how you have to kind of keep in mind. Make sure that each of these things that has a space has a space. You don't want to put a sine wave sounding kick drum on top of a sine wave sounding bass because it'll cancel each other out. I mean, that's more like a reggae trick. you're going to have a really solid kick over a sine wave bass. And vice versa, if you've got a really 808 kick, you're going to have a square wave on top of it. You never make it on top of that way. And if you have to use filters to move and notch things, then you do it. And the funny thing is everybody thinks more is going to give you more sound. That's not necessarily the case. If you want to change, and this is my hint for all of that stuff. If you want to change a sound, you boost it. You boost an EQ. If you want to clean up a sound, you cut it. That's really the basics of it. You know, you've obviously been making house music for 30 years and have made some of the greatest records in the genre. Thank you. But I wonder, you know, what keeps dragging you back to it? Because you've obviously made your point with it, you know I tell everybody this. It's a love. It really is. It's one of those things where I said to myself, and I said I'd walk away the moment I walk in front of a deck and I don't feel the same way I felt when I was a kid standing on a crate. playing records. If I don't, if I literally walk up and go, no, this doesn't feel like it's supposed to, that's my stop. You know, I have to call them into us and go, I can't no more. That's it. I'm done. It's done. That's it for me. If I don't have any love anymore, it's the same way I walked away from hip hop. If I don't have the same love I had when I started it, when I did hip We weren't running around with guns and stuff. It was crazy. It's like, you know, we all did party rhymes and, you know, we all battled each other that way. That was the best. You know, we battled for gear. You know, we DJed for each other's turntables and stuff. We didn't have to worry about somebody coming in and, like, beat somebody up or rob somebody or whatever. You know, it was no crew gang stuff. It was, you know, fine You know, that's how we kind of did things. But, you know, that's what it was. My love for that whole thing went out the window. My love for the art form, for, you know, the rhyme itself. the way you put things together, it went out the window for me. I wasn't about, excuse my expression, you know, hoes and bitches. That's not, that wasn't where I was coming from. I was coming from more of a technical standpoint, you know. It was always that way for me. I don't always put something in very complicated or a storyline when I did stuff like that, even if it was a dark storyline, you know. it was there. But that's where I get house from because I can always write to it. And speaking of writing songs, you know, just one final question. I wonder, what do you think is the best house music song? Because, you know, you've written so many and you've worked with so many singers over the years. I can't even begin to tell you. I couldn't say what my favorite was. But I'll leave it probably with, I would say maybe Get It Off was probably the one because it started, you know, my mindset on creating for my life. And maybe, like, I mean. at one point maybe the song i did for my daughter because i always thought things are going too well and she was about three years old at the time and i wanted to leave her a record to tell her how much i loved her and a typical day that we used to have with us running around the place and doing what we typically do on a saturday when i'm home So, you know, and that's probably my two, you know, but they always have to have something really, you know, wonderful happen or something even sad in my life that happens. It has to be that way. Otherwise, I wouldn't know where to write. I mean, the same thing with even with Arnold's thing. It's like all of this stuff that comes out, even with the artists that I work with. I mean, Kenny Bobian, even his song Reality, when he came to me with the idea of it, he's singing about his nervous breakdown he had with his wife. I mean, he really put the words into it. He explained it. So this this is the kind of stuff that that's not only just. me releasing it's just you know and you know and out for my friends to get their point across you know and their their heart out there so so you Bye.
