Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Last year, the struggle for LGBTQIA plus rights in Poland became international news during Pride in Bialystok, where peaceful activists were confronted with far-right violence. The events led to fierce online debate in electronic music circles. Which ultimately caused the cancellation of a techno festival whose statements after the events caused widespread condemnation. Amidst propaganda from both church and state, the risk of violence from the right remains, forcing activists in music to think seriously about combating the threat. This panel recorded live at Polish festival Unsound last year attempts to offer paths to navigate this conflict and work towards a safer and more progressive future. Avtomat from Oramix, LGBT activist Miko Szewinski and Unsound's Paulina Szaszek took part in the discussion, which was moderated by RA contributor Maya Roisin-Slater. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The panel from Unsound is up next. You're just wandering through like we were saying, I think a lot of people have just been sticking around for all of the different panel discussions. I wanted to mention that it's possible we'll be talking about violence, discrimination and hate speech towards LGBTQIA+ people and the community writ large. So if this is something that's triggering to you or you just can't handle it today, it's been a long. and very intense day, you can feel free to leave now or at any point during this discussion. I stand in solidarity with self-protection and self-preservation. So it's an open space for whatever reaction you have to what's coming up. And also for those unfamiliar with the abbreviation, LGBTQIA+, stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, slash, questioning, intersex. asexual and the plus includes everybody else under the umbrella of this community including pansexual people and non-binary people that don't identify as trans. We were just having a discussion before this very talk about the plus and I just wanted to give a little space to go into the pluses. Maybe the plus for some people is not so good. Yeah, we just had a discussion about the plus. Because in various communities, plus seems like an omission, just like a throwaway kind of thing. So instead of that, But we should either include all the letters or we should change it to something more diverse such as gender and sexuality diversity or sexual orientation and gender identity diversity. And looking at those provides us a bigger spectrum of identities. But it's up to the moment and we can talk about it how we want it now. Do you want to go with Soju? Or should we... Soji is nice. Do you want to explain what that acronym... I think that we've just decided right beforehand that we're going to refer to the community with a new acronym for the purpose of this talk, just to make things a little bit more inclusive for the reasons. Yeah, so my aunt, the rest really likes Soji, so sexual orientation and gender identity, because it really nicely rolls off the tongue. So we can go with Soji. So we're gonna go with Soji as a placeholder. So now we'll just dive right in. We've heard already from some people that aren't me, but I'm joined today by some really incredible activists and artists and members of Poland's music community. And so I kind of would like to start with a little introduction round, if everybody could just give me your name, what you do in music in Poland, and also what kind of brings you to this subject. Hi, I'm Kajetan Łukomski. I play music under the name Avtomat. and I'm here representing Oramix, which is a collective that's been working tirelessly to ensure equality in the music scene, especially for women, for SOGI people, and fighting also for equality of pay between central... and Eastern Europe and the Western world. And doing loads of other things, workshops, safe space, monitoring the safer space, policies in clubs. I think if anyone is interested in more, they can refer to our page. I'm a music producer, vocalist and DJ and I also work as an LGBT activist. Welcome. My name is Paulina and I'm part of Unsound team. I specialize in communication of cultural project and up till June 2019, so a couple months before, I was a PR manager of Szpitalna One Club. I might be called an activist because in my... endeavors I try to when I'm doing stuff connected to music I try to make it more multi-level so I was working with Mikko from Kulovemaj and as a part of the team with the rest of the team that was working with me up until June 2019. So with Olivia, who was a booking manager for two years of the club, and Matik, our tech guy, we started to support Krakow Pride, and that's when we met with Miko. But yeah, I think we're going to talk about this more later on. So I'm going to pass the mic to Miko. So I'm Miko, I'm from Query of the Mind, which is an NGO here in Krakow. We started as an NGO organizing the Equality March, the Krakow Pride, and the festival around it. And over the years, we grew with 10,000 attendees last year at the march itself. and we moved to collaborating with clubs and musicians and DJs to provide more safer spaces in Kraków and outside. Great, thank you. So I'd like to jump right in and kind of illuminate the situation for SOJA people in Poland by talking about an equality march that happened recently in the eastern Polish city of... Białystok? Is that? Okay, all right. I watched a lot of YouTube videos about the pronunciation of this particular city this morning. So yeah, can you guys start telling me a little bit about the city and the events that transpired there during this march? Should I start with Białystok itself, maybe? I was there looking at what was going on and To me, it was a surreal experience because I remember equality marches in Krakow years ago that weren't as violent as what happened in Białystok. Just the sheer numbers of neo-Nazis, right-wing people over there attacking. the crowd, there were like 4,000, 5,000 neo-Nazis and 1,000 people in the march itself. What was shocking to me, for example, was also that the crowd was not only neo-Nazis per se, but it was also people from the streets, families with their children blocking the march or shouting and teaching their children how to shout swear words at the people attending the march. I didn't feel safe there. No one felt safe. But maybe to end it on a positive note and how we should talk today about music is I remember the moment, the most vivid moment for me was the moment when the music platform got to the front of the march, the organizers rolled off the rainbow flag. and the music started blasting, and people then, like halfway through the march, starting putting a smile on their face and dancing and realizing that maybe it's not very safe, but we can celebrate ourselves here. So it was a very beautiful moment for me. So for those who don't know, this was the city's first march, right? And can you tell me a little bit about the history of equality marches? This is kind of like, in many places, they're happening for the first time, right? And so... Was there like warning that there would be this violence that happened? Did people expect it? If you could just give a bit of context. I think this is the thing that hasn't been brought up too much. That almost all of the equality marches in Poland started violently and some people seem to have forgotten it. This was especially shocking because for a couple of years couple of years now we've had peaceful marches and some of them were even sanctioned by the local governments and it was getting better and now like out of the blue because of the huge anti-soji propaganda in Poland this happened and it's brought everyone back to the more traumatic time and place for our people. Białystok is kind of, I don't want to generalize, but it's kind of well known for a big neo-Nazi presence there. The LGBTQIA crowd has it really bad there. which was definitely one of the reasons that the march was held, right? But also we should commend these people for their courage, right? I remember like the first marches in Poznań or the first marches in Warsaw were also, you know... and there were people throwing things and getting injured, but it wasn't a big thing back then because no one really cared about it, to be honest. And thankfully, thanks to... recognition that our crowd has been getting more and more in Poland and also in the press abroad, it's starting to be a more prominent subject. From my perspective, Białystok became like a symbol of the political climate in Poland. It kind of, it was a moment, it was the place that all the... negative energy kind of outburst and all the hard work that, let's say, the supporters of anti-LGBT ideology, it outbursted there. But I joined Pride very late, like when I moved to Krakow, because I'm not originally from Krakow. and that was the first time I joined. I was on the first march, I think, maybe eight years ago, and it was really small, and like in comparison to what happened last year and two years ago in Krakow, which is kind of a... grew in past three years. It became like a really huge thing gathering thousands of people and there were always anti-demonstrations but they weren't that big. And as you said, it was like there was this moment where kind of we all had the feeling that we're living in a safe environment with the people who are actually sharing our thoughts and sharing our visions of the world. Whereas this situation in Białystok was, I think, a wake-up call for everyone thinking, OK, I kind of think I'm living in some kind of a bubble that actually isn't really coherent what's happening outside of it and how successful the propaganda of... media and lack of education system kind of succeeded. So I think now it's really important that what your organization is doing and other local organizations and foundations are throwing prides and doing it in small cities like Novi Sącz lately. even though it's extremely dangerous because we get the information like every day that like the march in Lublin, they, so the city that is like, what, 300 kilometers from here to 100, people, there wasn't an anti-demonstration. There were actually, the police stopped the terrorist attack. Two people brought self-made bombs to the march, which is terrifying. And yeah, I think it's good to... try to push it through but it's really hard to do it in this day and age. I think what I would like to add also is very interesting that over the last three years the number of marches in Poland grew like exploded really and there were marches in smaller cities like you said in Novoselic in various cities that were previously thought of as conservative and right-wing and supportive of the ruling party. But what happened, for example, in Lublin or in Zhezhov, where there was also physical violence and attacks, was that the numbers were similar. and from my perspective at least, and it looked like, okay, another, it was terrifying for us, but it was another thing that kept on going. But with Białystok and the whole propaganda ruled by both the church and the ruling party, and the amount of hate that was there. And the diversity of the crowd that was hateful was something very new. And it showed that the message of hate spread not only to very right-wing radical movements, but also to mainstream. And that was terrifying. One thing that really got to me when the whole violence outburst was publicized, and I think it was good that it got publicized because daily attacks on our people are not really talked about and people don't really care about them. And this is like one or a couple of events. that showed the whole country how we feel on a daily basis. We can't wear our favorite colors, we can't look the way we want to look, and we never know the time or place that something might happen to us. I personally had a dangerous situation last week in the train, just like two guys. that were really drunk approached me and they were talking to me like from this perspective and they were like, ooh, so are you some... kind of a homo you want to get beaten up you know we're going to come back for you you know it's like and at some point it starts getting so usual for you that you stop even looking at it yourself as a of something that shouldn't take place. Yeah, for context, for those who don't know about the political situation in Poland, it's a conservative estimate that 70% of sojourn people in Poland have experienced some sort of violence, like harassment from the public in their life. and the government you have right now is an extremely conservative government, which I guess goes back to what you were saying about propaganda. It's very heavily inundated in the media, this anti-LGBTQIA propaganda. Yeah, there was this issue of Gazeta Polska magazine, Gazeta Polska newspaper, which is named Gazeta Polska, which is... extremely right wing, they added to their one issue a sticker with stop LGBT ideology and LGBT free zone, which is even worse. People were actually buying the newspaper and stacking it on various around cities, which it's disturbing for... for everyone to see it. So it's also kind of a symbol. You don't know where you can come across the negativity, which is really hard negativity. Adding to that, maybe some guests here don't know, but we actually are in LGBT-free zone because our region was declared as such. So I don't know. here, but okay. And the number of LGBT free zones the regions that were officially recognized as such is over 30 now. It's all southern or eastern Poland. And it's a bit scary that your local government says that there are no people like you and you should not be here. It's coming from so many directions, attacking us on an everyday basis that it's scary. So to link this back, I guess, to the music community and the actions that were kind of taken in the wake of this violence, what was your immediate reaction or your collective's immediate reaction when you either, the march finished or you heard about this? When we heard about this, there was immediately a huge discussion on our chat and we decided to... you know, take a stand that was like completely unambiguous and like end discussion once and for all, you know, where we stand. So we issued, at first we issued a statement online and then... I thought to myself that maybe we should push it further a little bit and we started working towards expanding this wave of support that started cropping up after Bialystok. There was a couple of clubs and collectives that also put up some posts that were supportive. I think Szpitalna was also one of them. And then I was like, yeah, why not make it a countrywide wave? And we started putting up posts saying, hey guys, please support us, please give us this little bit of support by either changing your profile picture to something rainbow or maybe putting up a post. saying, come to us, you're safe here, you know. And the response was absolutely staggering. It had like, I think we had like around 50 big clubs, festivals and collectives joining in. So that was really positive. So maybe I'll start because the history connects here somehow. Because we are already planning something because we saw the propaganda. And when Bialystok happened, we were like, no, we have to make something bigger. So we were planning an event in the city hall here. We were like, okay, let's contact Paulina and let's make it big and let's make it loud. There is no acceptance from our side, from Krakow, to this kind of violence. So we invited Anson to organize a huge party in front of the city hall to show solidarity with... Be honest, Tuck. Yeah, that was the story. And beforehand, from our side, the steps that we undertake was, as well as other festivals, changed our logo for the support and for showing the support. And I think we were one of the first ones. But this is like, it's not important who was the first or who was the last. It's important that the action that you're doing. doing. And the co-curator of Unsound, Łukasz Warnawysławski, also tweeted a tweet that kind of brought an attention of foreign media and got contacted by, I think, representatives of your office as well. And it's also started on international level because I think that the piece firstly was published on Resident Advisor. And I think that the world that is more conscious and has more knowledge. about how important and how extremely dangerous things happened in Poland, the music media started writing about it. And it was actually international music media that were talking about the topic itself first. Because in Poland, it was more like a news piece. and posts on Facebook by journalists connected to the music world. But our music journalism world is way smaller than international one. And I think that this international support really helped giving this message out there. one of the maybe consequences of our positive consequences of our support and then yes miko contacted me because they were doing the um it was anti uh anti-hate yeah anti-hate event just right outside the City Hall and because we were working before on Pride when I was working in Szpitalna we were connected by our mutual friend and also former stage manager Mateusz Sornad. about doing some kind of upbeat thing, doing DJ sets during the Pride. So it gives this walk some more positive vibe. And it started small. We had a really small car and it was raining three years ago. But it was like, I think the spark that helped. the march here in Krakow, because next year we had a bigger car and a longer set. And longer, and yes. And drive a limo now. And more people joined. And last year we had three cars. You had, like we had together as well, but mostly you, had three cars with multiple DJs. and over 10,000 people. And I remember my first Pride eight years ago. It was small and quite sad, to be honest. You saw people who were really scared going through the streets. later on, eight years later, you have 10,000 people dancing in the middle of the street. So I did like a little background story, but that was... We actually didn't stop with the little wave. I kind of stopped talking because I got a little bit overrun by emotion. We also did a big fundraiser in Warsaw. We raised, I think, almost 2,000 euros just by that. And then Justyna Fuhl, which is sitting right there, and is the perpetrator of some of the ramic stuff that we do, was talking with the New York Haunted label boss. drug culture and they came up with the idea of Total Solidarity which is a compilation of I think right now it's 126 tracks isn't it that we wanted to release in order to raise money for LGBTQIA organizations in Poland And at first it was supposed to be a really small thing, just like maybe, I don't know, 20 tracks. And we thought, oh, okay, we're going to raise a couple of hundred zlotys and that's going to be it. And then we kept getting more and more cocky, I guess, and started emailing and contacting our friends also outside of Poland and asking them for tracks. and the response again was absolutely amazing. Also it got a lot of really good publicity which also started with Resident Advisor by the way. We were just working day and night to make it happen. and also people who have been helping us from outside, like Reyda Murat from Ufelo Studios in Berlin. Who mastered it in one day, right? Oh my God, she's like a titan. Sorry. She mastered over 100 tracks over the course of the week. I don't know, some amazing tour de force in itself. By now we've raised 5,500 euros from that. For Poland, that's a lot, and we're really proud of ourselves. And you guys, because you've been buying it. I can see it in your eyes. So I guess this event for many members of the music community was like a very big rallying cry. And even you were mentioning in your first answer, did you see that there were a lot of people who maybe didn't have a stance before that were able to kind of like rally behind this because it was such a big event. People were putting themselves out there in a way that they maybe wouldn't have before clubs or institutions. I don't really have too much data on that. And I think... If I wanted to guess, I would say that maybe some people did, but right now, the situation in Poland and minds in Poland in general seem to be so polarized that you're... with us or you're like completely on the other side and there's there's not many people who are neutral on the subject right now which is not not good either I guess but I think it's it's really important that we that it got shown how many supporters we have and how many people are willing to actually step forward and put like put in some extra work to make things happen to make it you know our country a little bit better for for SOGI people. I would just add that through all the actions with changing their Facebook profile pics and showing solidarity in some ways, I think that actually some clubs and places decided to, let's say, out themselves as friendly. Because for many years, many clubs here, even in Krakow, forgot that they started with the SOGI community or were not very keen on promoting SOGI events. Yeah, you can do them here, but don't promote them too much. they changed their attitudes and they decided, yeah, we're going to show, we're going to stand in solidarity. And I think that was the biggest thing, to see that, okay, now we're all together. there is no middle ground where we can hide. I think it was quite natural when it happened. Everyone wanted to show their support, so crews, promoters, journalists, media, even really big media outlets like the main ones in Poland, Gazeta Wyborcza, or Noise were changing. either their Facebook covers, which is the most, of course, popular way of showing support in social media now, or either changing their main websites or adding some kind of information on their profiles. So, yeah, it was... For me, it was natural because I'm part of this industry, this world, this environment. So my feed, because we're referring to it, was covered with the words of support, which was really uplifting and heartwarming. And also surprising for me, I saw communities or promoters that I would never think that they would show their support, which was a very nice surprise, which also then I think we're walking towards this topic. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. became like the starting point of another social media outburst. But, yeah. Yeah, that's a perfect transition, I guess, into the social media outburst in question. Shortly after these events transpired, there's a Polish promotional company called Revive who made a post on Facebook, or a member of this company made a post on Facebook, which basically stated that the promotional company and the festivals that they run, like Interior Festival, and they have a festival called Revive also, were apolitical in that they weren't divisive, they were not on either side, and they said something which is the English equivalent of, you know, there's two sides to every story. So basically they were saying, like, this is a place where, you know, we won't take a stance on either political side, we're apolitical, there's two sides to every story, we, like, support everyone, we're going to create this, like, non-divisive environment. So I'll let everybody sit with that for one little second. So can you tell me a little bit about this? It's a now deleted Facebook post, but can you tell me a little bit about when was the first time you saw it and what the music community's reaction was to this? I was supposed to play Interior Festival and when I saw that post, I basically just like saw red and was completely furious with how... irresponsible it was and because let's face it, Revive is a big outlet and they have a lot of people who look up to them with that comes responsibility and If they wanted to stay neutral, they shouldn't have said anything, I guess. Since then, it has been said that it was one promoter in particular who wrote the post and who pushed it. I cancelled my show and then I just put a couple of posts, like outraged posts on my social media. Yeah, and then it kind of snowballed into another post from them trying to rectify the other one, but it did even worse from what I can remember. And yeah, it all turned into this big shit show. Excuse the words. And in the aftermath of that, many, many other artists started cancelling their shows and the interior festival got cancelled. Yeah, well, for me, it was the most surprising act of thoughtless action on social media and especially coming from the festival. that is so big and have so much following in Poland. I wasn't so surprised to be honest. I kind of saw this as an answer to the action of the other festival that kind of stood in support with the cause. From my perspective, and I think like from... a lot of people from music industry and environment perspective, it was like a very low-level act of promotional, a promotional act that showing people, we're inviting all of you who's feeling uncomfortable with the fact that the other festival stood in line with the cause. And actually, people were talking about it very openly in the comments. There was a really huge conversation under this post before it got deleted. It was really, really low, and I think that, as you said, it's better not to say anything if you don't know. what to say and it also showed that very sad sad thing that there is this big part of let's call it music industry that doesn't really understand the foundation of what music is and they don't know the history of music they kind of are are there for different stuff. And I'm not saying it's bad, because you choose your own way and that's your decision. But it's bad if you don't have the knowledge and you don't want to gain it to get the bigger perspective. For me, it was also interesting that I don't know. For me, it comes from a point of privilege of those people because they're from Warsaw or they organized the festival near Warsaw. and it's a very comfortable place to organize a festival. And yet, up-to-date festival that happens in Bialystok did a human library to kind of celebrate the university. A festival in Bialystok that could feel the most endangered with the whole situation was brave enough to do something. And people from Warsaw were like, eh. So for me, it was a lot of privilege that those people showed that, okay, we can be in the middle ground again and we can do whatever we want. We are the best. And I didn't like that at all. And I saw the whole thing because of Kayatan. I was very happy to see how many DJs and promoters commented on those posts. And I remember the coming weekend, all the chats I had in... telling now about this post and everyone was like, what the hell did they do? Why did they do it? So it was a great outrage of the whole community. I think it all kind of stemmed from lack of understanding and from ignorance because I know that promoter still holds his views and and uh and as you said there have been countless people from the music industry have been trying to comment on that and and maybe you know explain what he did, that doing this is pretty much the same as helping the oppressor, right? I think he's just not really willing to understand the whole scope of... of what that meant, you know, and take responsibility. I'd just like to provide some context for everyone who didn't see these. Facebook posts. I spent four or five hours last night reading and translating all of them. Truly horrible stuff. So after this initial post, which declared the festival as, quote unquote, apolitical, there was a follow-up post by the promoter from the company who apologized on his personal account. And there was also a statement which basically denied that it was actually talking about SOJA issues, but was referring to something more general. And it was just like coincidence timing, basically. Obviously, these posts led to cancellations like your own and many other artists from Interior Festival like Avalon Emerson and Shaka. And eventually the festival had to be cancelled because so many artists dropped out. Throughout these three different events, there was massive discourse, basically, within the music community and outside on Facebook. It can all be tracked through hundreds of comments, basically, trying to reason with people on the other side. So when all of these artists started dropping out of the festival, and we saw a lot about this in English-speaking music publications, did you feel supported by the international community when all of this was happening? Yeah, definitely. We had a lot of words of support from outside as well, and outside of Poland. and also lots of good publicity and later also because of the compilation. So it all kind of tied in with the Białystok situation. But I also think it was kind of like an unfortunate thing for Revive because they were the first one to make a major misstep in this matter. they were the ones that got pretty much crucified for it, you know. And yeah, they were like kind of like made an example of, and I don't think someone else, any other promoters will, you know, do something like that anytime soon because of that situation. So I guess, yeah. It was a lesson. But do you think they've actually learned anything from it? Because they're doing a festival again soon. And so I'm wondering, has there been any action on their side? To be perfectly clear, I know many people who are doing Revive and they're people that would never discriminate or never take a neutral stance. So I don't want to generalize. I don't know the guy that we are talking about, so maybe he didn't learn anything, but maybe he just didn't want to. If you are supposed to learn something, at first you need to want to learn it. But the festival as a whole or the company as a whole, have they said, oh, this festival now, we are actually supporting Soju people or we've made this and this effort to try and make it a safer space, for lack of a better word? I think as of yesterday, I've heard that they've put stuff in motion, thankfully. So I hope it all blossoms into a nice supportive action. Yeah, I think we have to wait for their official steps and see. There's a countless way of how they can get engaged and show their support or show that they learned from the situation. So I think we just have to wait and hope for the best. And to bring it back, I guess, to this divide within the music community, I was noting as I was reading through all of these discussions that kind of erupted on Facebook that many of the commenters were repeating, like they were repeat offenders. They would go and comment on every single artist statement, on every single saying, and a lot of them were commenting from... very suspicious looking accounts with like no profile picture and a name that's like Fred Smith or something. The people that were pushing back and saying some really truly horrible stuff. I won't say it here, but please know that these comments are about as extreme as it gets as far as a hate speech. Do you think that these were people that are involved in the music community in some capacity or fans or was it like alerted the alt-right came and kind of like started to comment themselves? Do you know, kind of like, did you know people that you were discussing with like that was on the other side of the argument? How did that kind of play out? I think I know maybe two people that were commenting in a negative way. And that kind of caught me blindsided. But hey, you can't really know a person until you've known them for, I don't know, 20 years, right? But then on the other hand, I found it really disturbing that many of the comments were actually turning back and amplifying the hate that started Białystok. They were like some... keywords that were fed to the public by the ruling party, like "homo terror" and, you know, "homo terror has taken away our festival" or "homo terror has made our favorite artists, you know, yeah, they turned them gay." No. Some people were actually commenting, oh, I'm never going to listen to Shaka again, you know. I'm pretty sure he's crying into his pillow right now. So yeah, it was kind of like the same rhetoric that started the violence, which is kind of unnerving. For me, the saddest part was, aside other levels of sadness, it was that it showed how many listeners of music actually do not listen to the music or are not interested in it. interested in is as a way of relief and finding them and they're just losing themselves for some time on Friday and Saturday. And it kind of like, you know, from my perspective, I worked in the club, I work at Unsound, I also work with artists that are engaged in the issues or take their job seriously. there's more to music, DJing and this world than just partying. And I think that it was really, from my personal perspective, really sad to see that we put so much work as promoters, as festival organizers. We try to get the info to as many people as we can. On the side, it's so great to see so many people here present, listening to us. And then there's this situation, there's this tons of negative comments saying... either very aggressive stuff, as you read, or saying, oh, let's keep music neutral. And it kind of showed that still music is seen more like losing themselves, like relieving act than what it really is. So like part of the art. For me, it is important to learn what Paulina said, that those people do not know. For me, it was more mobilizing, actually, to look how I create parties, events, how I can get the message. across better. And for example, I'm very happy and honored that we could collaborate this year with Anson to create the mutual respect policies so that we can bring policies from, for example, Room for Resistance and other groups outside of Poland here and show other clubs, other festivals. how those kind of policies and those spaces should be safer and should go back to the roots of being safe spaces for expression. And I think that's very good that we have that now and we can spread it around Poland. I'm happy about that. So moving away from the context of this festival and kind of towards what it's like to go clubbing if you're living in a city and it's just a regular Friday or Saturday, you guys have kind of mentioned that some clubs took a positive stance towards this or these things that you were mentioning about making spaces safer. So have you seen the experience of just day-to-day clubbing improve since you first started going to parties? And what are those improvements that have been made? Well, from my experience as a club goer, When we started working in Szpitalna three years ago, one of the goals was to make this space safe for everyone. And it was a hard job, but I think that we did quite well. I remember that... After the first Pride, I was standing behind the bar and waiting for... It was an after-party after the Pride. I don't know if I actually shared this story with you once. It was the first after party and we were preparing the club for guests and there was no additional security, no additional measures of security. And then like five big men came to the club and sat by the bar and asked me to give them a beer. And I said that I can't because I have no idea how to actually open the bottle or just sell anything. And they were sitting and looking at me. It was like really one of the most terrifying experience I had in my life. Because I was actually sure there was like no security button anywhere near me. And I was sure that they will actually throw the club. in the pieces and but one of them just were so uh courageous that just took the uh the pride uh flag uh from behind the dj booth and they just ran out run out of it but uh that was the only act they could do But I think that with this first afterparty, we kind of here on local level set some kind of good example. tried to create safer and welcoming space for all club goers. And I think it's happening all around Poland now as well, as far as clubs are concerned. There's this action that is held by Noise magazine that they're doing some kind of... It's a campaign by Noise that they're doing workshops for clubs on sexual violence in clubs and how to prevent it and how the staff should... behave if they hear a report of sexual violence. Yeah, and what is important, they don't do it just once. They actually have this whole process of checking whether the staff is fulfilling their duties. And it's really important because when I was working in the club, I was actually personally trying to be... responsible for making people aware and educating them on a daily basis. But it's a hard work and it really needs some kind of support. So it's great that Noise is doing it. constantly because when I stopped working in the club I kind of see that some things are changing they're still having the foundation of the of let's say ethics code there but you can see that you need to react at the moment when even minor stuff is happening, like when people like bartenders do not respect the fact that there's a trans person in the house and speaking to them, referring to their natural gender instead of... the one that is chosen and it's visible if the bar staff or managers do not react it doesn't the change kind of fades away because it's It's a constant process of education and this is what is also, I think, that is the foundation of this post that we talked about before. It's a lack of education, lack of knowledge and willingness of people to open their horizons to stuff that are not typical for them. In my experience, especially since I started working with Oramex, it's kind of like a little bit of a Me Too situation. Not like hashtag Me Too, but everybody wants in. Because when we started monitoring the safe space policies and sometimes... just like taking care of how security interacts with people in clubs or like, you know, if you get too drunk or you take in some other stuff, you're not going to get kicked out of the club, you're going to get help, you know, or how you can always go to someone and say, hey, I just got like groped. or molested or whatever. I think it's starting to, pardon the expression, but it's starting to get cool. When the bigger clubs starting doing this and the ones that were... you know, go-to places. And when they started giving you, like, unambiguous communication, okay, this is not good in our club, this is not going to happen, and you're going to get taken care of, all of the other clubs were starting to think, oh, my God, yeah, maybe we should do that too, you know? It's en vogue right now. which is also a valid process. So I guess sometimes even if it doesn't stem from a genuine understanding of the subject, it's still positive. Hopefully it's done right. Yeah, I'm interested in that. Do you think it is done right? I think it depends. I don't know if I can agree on that. If it's part of being involved and if rules or following the thought is not... understood I think it might also backfire in some place because you kind of start let's call let's use this word advertising yourself as a place that is safe and then and then people who are coming, like the public who's coming to the club, can actually encounter the dangerous situation because people do not understand sometimes really basic behaviors of... basic behaviours, that's why even at the festival that we're now at, we had situations like the festival that really communicates well the rules and that's why we also set up the mutual respect programme that gives more spotlight to the issue, we also had this kind of different uncomfortable situation. And UNSAT is a big party, so like a big festival, and it's locally... well known as a place where big parties are being held. And with this recognition comes also maybe less positive factors. Like we have guests that sometimes just don't know what kind of festival they're coming to. They're coming just to a party. And then they encounter drag queens, trans people, and they don't know how to act. And they sometimes act. very aggressively or negatively. That's why we set up just to have like the areas where you could feel safe to speak about or just like hide for a moment and seek help. There's, I think... 40 people will be working at the hotel forum parties to make sure that our public feels safe on our parties. I think the incidents will always happen and that's not like we can't prevent. We can try to prevent but they will happen. But the important part is the response. So having something like mutual respect. team or having something like trained bar staff is the important part. And I'm quite skeptical if this is actually a change that is going on, because I think that most of the clubs are for now just showing the solidarity by changing the Facebook profile pics. And I've had clubs contact thing, like how they could do that. And that's the way to do it. Like ask around. You have local organizations in all the cities, all the bigger cities that could help clubs with providing safer spaces. Ask Oramex how they would like to feel when they play. And it's something like that to start, but they have to ask, they have to make the decision, and they have to make the effort to do something. And for me, there is still a lot. to do for them to be actually safer spaces. I think it's also even coming back to the Revive post, I think it's all a matter of getting to know how much you don't know about the subject. And if there is organizations like Miko's, like mine, taking care of this, then guys, really do reach out. We're here for that explicit purpose. If someone doesn't know how to institute a club-wide or festival-wide safe space policy, just drop us an email. You've all been involved in some capacity in producing events. So I guess speaking from this perspective, do you ever feel fearful or uncomfortable or take pause in inviting international artists or speakers or fans to certain places in Poland? of the conservative and violent nature of the cities, like in places where being visibly soja might result in violence or hate speech or cause harm. You know, that's actually a really touchy subject, I guess, because... I kind of feel that if we're living here every day and we can withstand it, then it's kind of solidarity on your part if you come here and maybe live it with us. Of course, we're totally trying to ensure security at all costs for the artists or for any people that we book from outside. But then what else is solidarity if not relinquishing a little part of your own comfort to help others? I agree with you, but also would like to add that, for example, we always try to inform the guests of the situation. So I'm kind of happy that... This year it was very international media covered topic, the homophobia and transphobia in Poland, because I don't have to talk that much about it organizing next events. But yeah, we try to inform and we try to say, yeah, there are things like that going on in Poland, but at the same time, please come and please. let queer people, sojourner people in Poland be happy and be proud. I can say that I'm quite lucky to be working during the festival. I was working in a club of the promoters that are not afraid to take a stand. And the festival, how it grew. curated and who we invite also has a backup of a lot of people who are working really hard for our guests artists, speakers and public to be feeling safe here. So this is like, this is comfortable a bit that we are doing the best we can and won the decision on. whether to invite someone doesn't relate really on the, if it's dangerous, because we work really hard for everyone to be feeling safe here. And I'm pretty sure, and I'm sure that also promoters here in Krakow who are throwing parties aside the festival, because there's a lot going on here, and we have quite... and local club scene and promoters I know that they sometimes even naturally just follow the lead. And I don't think that from the people who I know and I know personally they do not make this decision also on the fact. They just want to take a stand and show. They, of course, inform artists, but it doesn't really stand in the way of... fulfilling what you stand for. Maybe I'm a little bit of an optimist and maybe a little bit too much, but I think that you might sometimes actually be surprised of how much people can be elastic when it comes to visible Soji people. Myself, I don't really look very normative, right? And I think visibility is everything. if we want to become a part of society that is equal, we need to show everybody that we're here and we're not going anywhere. And I've actually seen, this is kind of a funny story, but I've actually seen stuff stuff happened like back when I was playing in Saturator, it's kind of like a legendary club in Warsaw that doesn't exist anymore. And we had some really weird bookings there and queer people coming and making like these absolutely crazy performances. And it was located in a very dangerous part of the city, which is Praga. And I remember there was this one guy who is a genderqueer performer who was performing practically naked and with loads of makeup on. He was like, "Oh yeah, I'm just gonna run around the corner and get myself some kind of vodka that I really like and that the club doesn't have." And we're like, "Oh, you're in Praga. Don't do that. You're like buck naked and you might get beaten up." And he was like, "Oh no, no, I need to go, I need to go." And he ran away. And I was like, "Okay, I'm totally gonna have to chase him and ensure that he gets back safe." And by the time I reached the shop, he was already chatting with like three of these huge, bald guys. who I would have been afraid to walk by on the street and they were like best friends and he was like giving them vodka, you know? So I think... Universal language. Yeah. I think it's a matter of how we present ourselves as well. Like sometimes I need to bite my tongue and not... pay aggression back and just like paint myself as the most humane person ever to show these people that were like completely normal humans, you know, we just happen to kiss someone else.
