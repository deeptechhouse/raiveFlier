♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tag editor at Resonant Advisor. This week's exchange sees RA's Andrew Rice sitting down with Richard Devine. one of the world's leading sound designers and a veteran producer of abstract angular electronic music. Recorded at Ableton's recent Loop Conference in Los Angeles, we hear of Devine's obsession with sound and synthesis in particular. Over the past decade, he's become one of the most visible practitioners in the field, especially among Eurorack modular enthusiasts. This year he released an album written primarily on Eurorack systems and we hear how he chained multiple racks together to perform its elaborate compositions in real time. Finally, Devine goes into detail on some of his recent sound design projects for clients like Google and Jaguar, revealing the challenges of working with and emerging platforms like virtual reality and electric car design. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Richard Devine is up next. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ so Your new album that just came out, it's made mostly with modular equipment, right? It was, yeah, contrived on about, I would say, around six, seven, eight modular systems that are at my studio, most of which I built up over about five or six years. Some of them were in cases. Then there's some custom cases I had built, which house some of the bigger systems that some people see in pictures and videos. And then I also used two Clavia Nord G2 digital modular synthesizers, which are basically, it's still my favorite synth. It was released in 2004. It's not a new piece of equipment, but it's definitely, you know. held up over all these years and it's still fairly flexible and the concept with it is also modular basically you're plugging in virtual modules in a software environment and then connecting these virtual cables so it's kind of like you're a rack but in a software format but what's cool is you can dump the patches to the hardware keyboard and then assign the knob assignments to all the knobs and functions per LCD screen. So you have multiple pages you can make assignments to. So it's a very powerful system even today. And I've been using it since the beginning. I just like the sound of it, and it complemented the Eurorack systems that I had built up. the sounds kind of integrated together so that's what pretty much made up uh i would say like yeah the bulk of the record was your process for this record different than the past few because it took you a long time to make it yeah this one was different um in that you know previously i had used compute you know computers um to do most of the sequencing a lot of it was done in the box uh using various environments like Reactor and Max MSP and Logic and among other things, mostly DSP based, a lot of heavy DSP processing and there was a lot of field recordings. So I was capturing a lot of stuff. you know, recording with like contact mics, hydrophones, or, you know, stereo condenser microphones, and then taking a lot of that material and manipulating it in the computer, and then sort of combining that with like synthesis and stuff. Whereas this record didn't use any samples at all. Everything was completely designed from the ground up, all the drums. You know, all the percussion, all the textures and effects that you're hearing were all, you know, using... Eurorack modules, Eurorack effects modules, and everything was kind of going into, my mindset was I wanted to do it mostly by hand and not use a mouse and look at a timeline editor and, you know, think about things. It just, it made me think about things differently, kind of performing the tracks in real time. and driving the changes emotionally by feeling rather than, you know, saying, oh, here at one minute and 20 seconds on the timeline, I want this transition to happen to go into the chorus of the track. It was more of an organic process, so to speak. So that was, you know, I guess one of the biggest differences from how I've worked in the past were the... I was kind of doing everything by hand digitally and placing everything on a timeline. And then this was more about it being like a freeform experience, kind of just building these systems. And then the environment sort of, you create this environment that kind of happens with the modular. And then that environment. I call it an environment because it's basically this patch network of cables and electricity that's controlling various modules that are generating the sounds. And it's this one little thing that's happening that's kind of floating there for this one moment in time. And you kind of have to capture that moment. That's sort of like audio snapshot of what's happening, which I found that really fascinating because the second... you could lose it all. Like, there's just this, like, fine line. You could turn the wrong knob, the power could go out, the temperature of the room could change, and the oscillators could all drift and completely shift the sound of the patch, and you've lost it. So it's like you're riding the fine line of just, you know, it completely being destroyed at any second. So it's almost exhilarating in a way to write music that way compared to the computer where I could save things and recall things. And in that whole process, I would get really lazy a lot of times. So sometimes I'd work on a track and I'd be like, oh, I could go back to it. I'll just open the session. So I have some tracks that I've been working on for years. I'm just sitting on my hard drive just because I'm like... I know I can go back to them and keep refining them and making them perfect and even more perfect. So in the end, I'm not really being productive. I'm just, I keep working on these tracks that never end up getting finished. But with the modular, I had to force myself to finish up because once you pull the patch, it's done. So my goal had been since 2016. I think somewhere in February of that year, I said, you know what? I'm going to record a new track every night and see where it goes, patch up a new track. Some of it might be shit, some might be great. There were things that spontaneously happened that, you know, I never could even imagine would have been things that were, could be used, you know, as a composition. There were lots of happy accidents that happened and there were some things that... lots of experiments that I conducted just to see what would happen that I recorded and later turned into tracks and this is basically what that was an accumulation of was that whole process leading up until where we're at today. So when you're recording these patches and doing experiments every night and seeing what happens, how did you then change them into tracks or work them into tracks or compositions? Well, initially I would get a patch, I would get it to a point where I was like, whoa, I have something kind of cool here. Like if it was something that was strong enough that struck me emotionally, then I was like, okay, I'm going to spend a little bit more time on this and flesh this out. Then decide how I wanted the track to move. So I would draw diagrams. I'd be like, all right. I want the track to move through different movements and sort of kind of evolve from one point to another. So what I would do is I'd had the way I designed most of the tracks is I had five or six cases set up. Each case had its own set of sequencers in it. and sound sources, filters, envelopes, VCAs, and effects, a hybrid collection of digital and analog oscillators. There was all kinds of crazy stuff. So the way that I planned it out for this record is one of the most difficult things to do with modular stuff is to be able to change. from one set of sounds to a completely different set of sounds, which can be really difficult because if you're trying to patch up and set up things and tune oscillators and set up different things, it takes a lot of time to do that. And early on when I was doing my live shows that way, it was just... taking forever to do things to make transitions happen. So I kept trying to figure out ways to speed those processes up by using modules that allowed me to store presets and using multiple sequencers where I'd fill up the memory and then not have to repatch so much. So what I would do is I would set up... For the record, I would set up a part that would play at one part in the track for each case. And all of the cases shared the same clock. So there'd be one case that would basically have the master tempo, and then that clock would be multiplied across all four cases. And then I would have what I'd call transition modules that would be... a sampler module that would play several layers of samples to buy me maybe like a, maybe a five to 10, 15, sometimes 20 second sample that would play, that would kind of give me a few seconds to kind of get the next case ready to perform the next part of the song. So. I wanted these songs to have a lot of dynamic changes on the record. So you may have noticed on Sort Life there's a few tracks where they distinctively go through different movements and then there's parts where things kind of mutate and change and get to a point and then there might be a break where there's some sort of sounds kind of breaking apart. something happening and then it goes into a completely different part so that's how I was able to sort of design out the structure of the tracks and then actually perform them you know perform by basically starting I would start sort of a going from like a left to right configuration like start from the left case is like the beginning of the track and then play through and basically perform through the pieces. On the average, I would say maybe 20 to 30 takes per track. Some of them are more. I went through a lot of takes. And then because a lot of this stuff would spontaneously happen, you would get a couple things where I'd be like, oh, I didn't quite like how something happened here. So I'd perform it again and get a better take of it. Sometimes it'd be a worse take, you know. There were some things, because there were random things happening, some of the rhythms were generated. I used like stochastic sequencing and probability-based sequencing, so it wasn't all like things that were in my control. So it was kind of just like throwing the dice out and just kind of being like, all right. this one might be the one. And so that was, that was interesting, kind of making music that way. And so that's, that's generally how most, you know, how I put most of the tracks together in that way. And, and I spent a lot of time mixing this record, like really trying to get the mixes to sound like really big, but very deep, but there was still lots of subtleness in them, lots of detail. So I'd spent a good, like, I want to say. eight or nine months buying, I've been buying a lot of like outboard equipment and I went just recently, you know, wanted to remove the computer completely. So I went to analog summing. So I'm using like analog summing mixers and actually using like physical hardware, like physical compressors and limiter, analog limiters and EQs. And I really, really wanted to sound the sound of the record. be different. I didn't want it to be this, you know, cold sort of clinical. I've said this in other interviews where it was like my old records, they sounded cold and clinical. They were all DSP based and they were all made in the computer. It was all in the box. And I wanted this record to be completely different in the way it sounded and felt, but it's still, I still wanted it to sound like me, but kind of have a different. kind of sound to it, I guess, so to speak. Do you feel like the way you played and composed the tracks was more traditionally musical in terms of per song or compositional compared to your past work? I would say they're very similar. I was doing very similar things to how I would do things in the computer. I don't know how to explain it. I guess it's just the way that I work. Like I'm basically doing the same things that I was doing ever since I was making tracks like in the mid-90s when I had to do everything with like the Akai samplers and I had really limited memory to use. My first Akai sampler had like 32 megabytes of memory. And I remember having to figure out, okay, how am I going to make this song do all this stuff in this short amount of time? At least for my music, anyways. I mean, I know everybody's styles are different and their sound requirements are completely different. But for me, for people that know my work, there's a whole barrage of different sounds and textures that you might hear in the span of five or six minutes. And it could be... you know, literally like hundreds of things you're hearing flying around. So it takes a bit of work and planning. you know, even back then to do what I wanted to do. And I remember what I would do back then is I would record like maybe one minute, fill up my sampler, record one minute of a track. And then I would glue sections. I would load up my sampler again, play the second minute of the track. glue that part to the first minute and then so on you would do the third and fourth minute to make the full complete piece. And I was just pushing the technology as far as I could at the time. And I'm kind of doing the same thing right now with the Eurorack stuff, like maxing out what I can do with each case to its full capability. And then just moving to the next case, it's maxed out the full capability of what that whole case could do with that configuration and then playing through each one of those and then using. utilizing as much as I can possibly in the short, you know, in that short timeframe. So just really trying to make the most of what I have is the way that I was looking at it when I was composing this record. And, you know, it's pretty much no different. It's no different than how I was doing things in the past. It's just using different instruments and different technology now. And doing things more by hand than doing it with a keyboard and a mouse, if that means any things. What drove you in the direction of doing things by hand and using the Eurorack systems more and moving away from the computer for the album? Well, for me... I actually started out using analog equipment first. Some of the first things I bought were analog synthesizers like the SH-101. I bought a lot of the early Roland XOX series TB-303, MC-202 back in the early... 90s and the first real modular or semi-modular synth I got my hands on was an ARP 2600 and I got that in high school age. I was around 17 years old. Got it at a pawn shop in Atlanta and that kind of like really opened my ears to a whole different world of sounds. At the time, I wasn't really, I didn't have a synthesizer up until that point that allowed me to really do these more sort of abstract, more complex, you know, synthesis techniques like. cross modulation, FM synthesis, amplitude modulation, ring modulation, and spring reverb, all these components that were already built into the ARP. You could work at a really simple level, but you could do more complex things with it. So I started to make a lot of music with the ARP, and then it kind of spurred my interest in using it. analog modular synthesizers. And so I started to buy more in the mid-90s, like the EML Electro Comp. The EML 101 was another one that I got. And then the EMS Synthi. the AKS, which was another really big synth for me, a portable synthesizer. I used to take that thing everywhere with me. I made good amount of music for about five or six years on that synth, and it was just so great because it was so small. It was like in a portable suitcase. Didn't use patch cables that use these resistor. pins that you use in this pin matrix that look like kind of like the game Battleship with different colored pins. So it was really easy to recall patches and then patch things up fairly quickly and see the relationship between what was happening. And you had a joystick controller and a sequencer. So there was a lot of really cool stuff that you could do. I used to remember learning and patching at my mom's restaurant. I worked as a cook at her restaurant. I used to set the EMS back in the food storage room on top of the refrigerator. So in between cooking, I'd go back there with headphones and was making sounds and learning and stuff. Yeah, so for me, I think it's, my story is probably a little different than maybe most people that have gotten into like the whole Eurorack thing. My first analog synthesizers were these synths, you know, that were made in the 60s and late 70s. using very old technology, and that was kind of like the foundation for me. So I'd always been making, that's how I started. And then I kind of went away from that when I started getting into computers in like the, let's say like late 90s. And then I started to go pretty hardcore for, you know, a good solid 10 years. And I still held on to like my analog synthesizers, more for like sampling, but then I kind of just went straight into computers. synthesis and doing it all internally and then I want to say around 2005 I discovered Dieter Doefer's system the his year I mean he created the air rack format that we're at we here today and I was really intrigued by his stuff because up until that point Every synth that I had bought was a fixed system, meaning you'd buy it and the components were pre-configured. You couldn't change anything. You were stuck with what you had. With Dieter Dofer's systems, you basically bought an empty case. And from there, you would look in a catalog and he had, I want to say it was like 150 different. maybe 120, 150 different modules you could pick from. And you basically design the system that you would want to use. So, you know, you could make an effects box, a sequencing rig, or, you know, just a weird sound drone generation box, or really whatever you wanted. It's whatever your mind could think of. What was so great about it is it was modular to the level of you could move the modules around and reconfigure any way you wanted to. So it was really like building your own perfect custom instrument that really worked to the way that you wanted to work. So that concept to me at that time was so revolutionary to me. I was just like, wow, I can design my own synth and really, really fine-tune this thing to the way I want to make music with. So I kept with it. I bought two cases straight away. I filled them up right away, and I was pretty much hooked at that point. continued to go from there at that point. It's funny because I started at analog, I left it, and then I started to come back full circle when I got into EuroRack in 2005 and then I kind of just went back on the path again. There's obviously been an explosion of interest in modular synth, especially because of Eurorack. How do you feel about that? There's a lot of modular hobbyists or people who just collect modules. I feel like there's almost a backlash against modular synthesis now. Yeah, that's interesting. It's funny because like when I was getting into it in the mid 90s when I was buying a lot of these old modular synths, a lot of the old studios, a lot of the universities, they were just trying to get rid of the stuff. No one wanted this stuff. Like so I was getting this stuff for like nothing. And then... It slowly started to creep in popularity back, you know, I would say 2006, 2007. It was starting to kind of creep up like, you know, companies like Make Noise, Tip Top Audio started popping up. Plan B and Livewire, some of the first companies, Analog Solutions, Schweman started to pop up. and started to see these other third-party manufacturers making modules for the Eurorack format. And then it started to kind of, you know, ramp people's interest. And then all of a sudden it just took over. It was like this explosion, you know, like you said. I personally think it's awesome. I think a lot of people were in my shoes. You know, we're using computers. We've been in studios. And, you know, we're typically using like a mouse and a keyboard to run these sessions. And I'm, you know, it's in the same boat as everybody else. You know, using Pro Tools and Ableton and Logic and a lot of these digital audio workstations. And the computer is still probably the most powerful instrument in the world. You could do anything with a computer. I tell people that all the time. But the thing that I feel that lacks with a computer sometimes is the physical interaction with how you manipulate sound in ways with your hands. I think that's still something that... that is is lacking the instant feedback you get when you play like a real instrument or you're working with like a modular synth and i think that for a lot of people is the reason it's a big reason why a lot of people moved over to using these going back to hardware and using modular synths because it's so hands-on the feedback is that you get from it is just immediate and You don't have to, you know, things that you do on, you say, like on a modular system, you do, you know, a couple dozen knob tweaks and turns and things to do those same sort of things in a computer would take you maybe 20, 30 minutes to do with a mouse because you're having to do it one, you know, one tweak at a time using a single. you know, click to change parameters. And then even to set up automation, you have to draw it in or you set up a controller. And there's so many things you have to just set up just to get something happening when you can just do it, you know, right away with a piece of hardware. So I think a lot of people. At least for me, that was one of the bigger things, was just kind of getting back to my roots and then just getting, just tired of dealing with a mouse and, you know, computer keyboard all day to make music just kind of was kind of a drab for me. So I think that was a big thing for a lot of people. And also the sound, too. You can get really interesting sounds. So the popularity of, like... you know, never getting the same thing twice. You know, it's like a endless sample library for people who maybe want to use it as, you know, an inspiration springboard for other ideas, um, for compositions or sound design stuff. And, um, But yeah, but I can see the exact opposite of that, too. I mean, there's, you know, there's people that are doing really great things with modulars, and then there's people that are not doing such great stuff with modulars, you know? I mean, you hear a lot of crap. And even there's people that said that a lot of my stuff is crap, too. You know, there's... Both ends of the spectrum, you know, like, oh, it just sounds like a bunch of random robotic bleeps and bloops and noise and, you know. So, yeah, like I said, I mean, there are, you know, there's people that love it and there's people that hate it. And, you know, I just look at it as just another. tool in my studio, you know, like, like an artist has their set of paint brushes and different, you know, colors of paint that they want to paint with. I look at it just, just as like another artistic tool to use. But, um, yeah, I mean, I think it's a good thing. I mean, in the end, I think it's great. I think it's great to have so many options. Um, when it comes to like all this, this, this resurgence of all this analog and modular stuff, I think it's really cool. Kind of, it's like opening newer generations up to using synthesis because synthesis is so powerful. You can do so many cool things with it. And, um, you know, I personally don't feel it's a negative thing. If anything, I think we have too many things out right now. I think it's hard to make a decision on what you want to buy and use in your studio. I think that's the biggest problem for me is there's just so much stuff out there now. I don't know. You know, I have friends ask me all the time, hey, I want to get a system. What should I get? I'm like, man, there's so much stuff right now. Like, it'd be hard to answer your question. But yeah, I mean, I think it's, in general, I think it's a really cool thing. I think this, we're living in exciting times right now where you're an electronic producer. The tools that we have now to do things, it's just so, it's No matter what you get, you're going to have a blast with it. So I think it's pretty special times that we're living in. Kind of on the same note, I've been reading a lot about your sound design work for bigger corporate clients and products, which are really like... not just making sounds for like, you know, an operating system or even like movies or TV, but you're actually like designing environments. Like you did the sound for the Jaguar electric car, right? For the I-Pace. And I read that you said making the sound for the acceleration was one of the hardest things you ever had to do. Why was that? Because that whole world just seems so completely foreign to me. Like, I don't even know what you're making the sounds out of. Yeah, that's, it is completely a different world. Yeah, it's funny. A lot of people probably think that my job is like sitting in a studio all day playing with like synths and stuff and making weird fart noises. But really, it's quite the opposite. I'm working with a lot of these clients on these pretty stressful projects where I'm having to figure out how to implement sound into these newer technologies. these new products that are coming out that create some really strange, unique problems that you wouldn't normally encounter using audio. Like, you know, the car I worked on with Jaguar, I've actually been working with Jaguar Range Rover for about five, six years. I've worked on a couple of prototype cars. The I-Pace actually was the first car. that you could like that i worked on with them that you could go actually into a dealership and buy but we had worked on a couple prototype cars um behind the scenes and we were kind of like refining the technology and learning we were kind of making mistakes learning things and trying to figure out you know because i want to say about four or five years ago they uh There was a legislation law that got passed in the UK that said that all electric vehicles had to emit a sound. There needed to be an exterior sound that pedestrians could hear from a distance from, you know, I don't know, 100 feet away. If you're blind, you're a person with disabilities who can't see really well, you need to be able to hear this electric car coming through the parking lot. So they had a lot of lawsuits by different electric car companies because of all these accidents that were happening. So they were like, okay, we need to put this into effect. Now it's mandatory that they all needed to make a sound. They were originally presented with this problem. One of the people from the sound, I want to say the sound team at Jaguar, contacted me over Twitter, out of all places. A friend of mine named Ian, really great guy. They said, hey, we're interested in maybe working with you on this project. It might sound kind of crazy, but... we need to put sound in this vehicle, an electric vehicle that doesn't make any sound. It's virtually silent, but we have to create that sound. We also have to create the, you know, the, basically the audio signature. the entire car. So I was responsible not only for the exterior engine EV sound, but also with the engine sound of what you heard inside the car, as well as every other sound that the car makes from the blinker sounds to all the alert notification sounds. There's a navigation. and built-in sort of touchscreen and all the various touchscreen control sounds and selection menu sounds. And there's like a welcoming tone. There's a battery charge, low battery charging sound. Pretty much anything that you hear in the car, I was responsible for creating, which was... a very daunting challenging task um and as you mentioned the the ev the engine sound was probably the one of the most challenging sounds to create um because it's the uh it's like an audio reactive sound that's based on many different things how fast or slow the car is moving how many people are in the car. There's like, you know, weight and load limits to the car. And then, So it was a lot of physical things. And wind noise, I was working with a whole team of engineers where we were just studying how my engine models would work with the sound of the wind, of how the sound of the airflow moving through the car sounded with my sounds. And it was a very challenging project. a few years of trial and error and learning because I didn't have a book for any of this. I didn't have any other sound designer friends that I was calling. Hey, have you ever done this? And they were like, no, Rich, I have not done this. And I think at the time when we started doing research, I think Audi. Audi had started, there was one designer at Audi that was starting to work on some of this stuff. There wasn't really many people that were doing this. So I was kind of really on my own, kind of stumbling through it. But... Very exciting product. Like I said, the project went off really well. They were very happy in the end. And it was exhilarating to see it finally release into the world. And to see, to create something using audio be applied in... And for this type of application, it was really exciting to see this, it's like a physical object that, where they can sit in the car and they can experience it. They can actually drive it. And, you know, that to me was like, wow, if you would ask me that 10 years ago, I would have said, are you kidding me? Are we really going to have cars that are... that we're going to actually be designing sounds for. I mean, you know, this is such a new thing. So it's, you know, I think as we move to alternative energy sources for vehicles, I think we move away from fuel-based cars, we're going to see this becoming more, it's just going to be becoming more common. I think we're going to, you know, like 20 years from now, I think we're going to all be. in these self-driving electric cars. I don't think we're going to even be driving cars anymore. We're just going to get in a car, you type in the system where you want to go, and it's just going to take you there. And emitting fake sound. Well, not fake sound, but emitting sound all the time instead of engine noise. Yeah, there won't even be any engine noise. There won't be any gasoline-based cars anymore that'll be, you know, I think. In my humble opinion, I think that's where things are going to be. I know all the car manufacturers are moving their cars to be all either in the hybrid transitioning, hybrid electric vehicles, or they're fully moving to electric cars. And I just think that we're eventually going to completely move to that. It makes the most sense. Yeah, it was, it was a crazy project. Um, and I think, um, we're already slated to work on another car. Um, I don't know how soon, but, um, that's going to be the next thing. But yeah, it was, um, I learned a lot. There's, um. There's lots of interesting things. It's applying a lot of things that I've learned as a sound designer, but really, really putting your skills to the test in a whole different area. And we ran into all kinds of strange things that were just mind-boggling at certain points, and stressful too, because they were a very particular client there. A client that has a heritage that's been around 75 years or plus years, and they're one of, you know, like a premier brand company where, you know, they're very elegant. Every detail is very well thought about. It's very strategically planned. not there just to, you know, I don't know how to explain it. They're just one of those companies that they were definitely scary to work for, but it worked out in the end. Yeah. Like I said, it worked out in the end. Good experience. So when you're creating something like the, the, the EV, the engine noise, are you using recordings at all? Or is it all synthesis? For this particular project, it was synthesis-based. I used a couple of different things. I would say the chemo system, which is made by Symbolic Sound. Sound computation engine that runs all the processing on this offline box. I have a Pacarena. It's called the Pacarena processing box. And I use basically resynthesis techniques and additive synthesis, combination of... basically it was these like generating harmonics really so when I was working on the EV sound the the most important aspect of it was harmonically the hum and purr of the engine how does it sound it you know it really slow drive a slow driving pace you know to more of like a climax as you're crescendoing up um you know to full speed at higher rpms the that was probably the trickiest part is getting the sound to sound consistent at lower and higher rates but but not be fatiguing to the ears and also distracting. And my task was to try to make it sound futuristic, but also take elements from past Jaguar cars. So I did a whole engine study where I went and recorded all of the current line of Jaguar cars. And I looked at the, I analyzed the engine sounds in the computer and looked at where just, I was basically frequency hunting, looking for harmonics, like listening to where the harmonics, where everything was at. And then I was basically, re-synthesized those with the Kima system and this other application called Spear. And then I was studying those harmonics and then I was basically used those as a basis. I was like, all right, I'll take these as a basis since their customer base is familiar with the purr of a Jaguar. They already know. They're familiar with the sound. I didn't want my sound to be so far removed from what the customers knew what a Jaguar was. I wanted to be able to take that as a basis, but at the same time design something new. Take that and modernize that. That was basically my approach. tackling that situation. And then, you know, like I said, instead of using mechanical sources, we did it all with synthesis. I did it with basically synthesis. So obviously the sounds are changing as the car accelerates or decelerates. So is whatever system the car is using, is it playing and layering different sounds or is it synthesizing it as it like in the car? It's using this sophisticated playback system that's in the car. It's the software that... They created in-house, yeah. So it would take all my synthesized waveforms and then it would layer them and play them. And according to what the driver is doing, the sounds would activate or play depending on, you know, whatever state the vehicle is in. So, yes, you're correct. It was a system that they devised up and took all the content that I created in. I don't know how to put it more simply, but yeah, it was the system that they created in-house. I think they had two German engineers that designed the software that actually got implemented into the car. And then it was pretty sophisticated. It was very complex, used a lot of complex filters and pitch algorithms and all kinds of stuff to make it do what it does. But yeah, so it was kind of a... a lot of stuff going back and forth to get it to, to be just right, I guess, to get all the tuning and everything, um, to sit well. So yeah, it kind of adds a whole new dimension to the manufacturing of a car and what the car needs to run, you know, like. That kind of bespoke playback system is a pretty crazy thing to add to a car. Yes, it is. And I think in the future, we might even have things where you could go to a store and buy different sound sets. You could hot rod your car out. You know how people... but the crazy mufflers and stuff and it makes their car sound crazy. Like I think that this will open the doors even for people to like customize how they want their sound. So you could download, like maybe in the future we'll have. my car to sound like a Ferrari, you know, or, you know, like a Maserati or something. You could pick different sound sets and then maybe, you know, decide how you want your car to sound or if you want it to be more of a quiet car or a really loud car. I think we're going to have... this explosion of like different speaker manufacturers making customized cool speakers where they're going to be outside of the car and you could really like soup it up and put all these subwoofers and i'm imagining this fun audio futuristic world of like these like hi-fi audio car systems that are you know not only sound good inside but they sound great outside too What are some of the other like quote unquote futuristic or unusual sound design things you've been working on? I know you've been doing some VR stuff and I don't know which things you can talk about. So tell me what the things you can talk about. Yeah, the... I worked with Google on their virtual reality platform Daydream, which runs on the Pixel phone. I also worked with them on several apps they released for the HTC Vive virtual reality system. And headset, in particular, I worked on Google Earth VR, doing all the UI user interaction sounds and stuff when you're flying around and all the ambisonic ambiences. UI controller menu selecting sounds and then, for instance, grabbing the sun and moving it to positioning what time of day you want it to be and whether you're at sunset or all the way at night. There's all these different sounds for all the gestures. A lot of the user controller... gesture movements and zooming in on the globe and stuff like that. And so that was also another project that I had no prior experience in working in, kind of like the Jaguar thing. I really didn't know any friends that had worked in virtual reality or mixed in, you know, ambisonic audio. So it was another one of those projects I picked up where I was like, okay, I've got to figure all this out. They've hired me, now I've got to learn this stuff. So I'm going to have to do some research, do some homework, and it's kind of like a crash course through. So I stumbled around quite a bit on that project too, but learned a lot of things as well. So I had to capture a lot of the ambiences with ambisonic mics. So I kind of had to learn my way around. Getting good, clean recordings was very challenging using ambisonic microphones, you know, with the multiple capsules capturing audio. What is ambisonic? So ambisonic audio is basically the most simplest way I can explain it without getting too technical. It's basically just 360 audio. So most typically most microphones are either mono or stereo in the most common configurations you find. You find either X, Y, ORTF configuration or mono microphones that capture instruments. uh, you know, stereo space and, you know, you have all these different variants of, uh, microphone steps. You can do binaural recordings with like dummy heads or the Jacqueline disc. There's, um, And then there are also some surround sound mics, like DPA has the DPA, I think it's the 5100 surround mic. There's a couple different mics, and then the ambisonic mics, which record to four-channel ambisonic audio. So the format is slightly different. and that you get, you have an XY, you've got your XY axis, which is your left, right, but then you have the Z axis, which is your up and down. So you can capture audio information above your head. and below your head. Like I said, it's incredible and also nerve-wracking at the same time to record with ambisonic mics because you basically get everything. So you could hear an airplane that you can't even see. That might be, you know, 10 miles away and you're like, where is this thing? I can't even see it. How is it getting in my recording? You know, whereas I had always used. shotgun stereo microphones or mono microphones, which basically reject everything behind you. So you can single point source capture a sound and it will reject everything else but that. So you're less prone to getting sounds that are unwanted in the mix. But with the ambisonic microphone, you absolutely have to be in a perfect location. which is very hard to do. And for me, working on that project, this probably one of the most challenging things about working on that project with Google was just getting just the absolute perfect recording. to match exactly what you were seeing in the VR world. For instance, on the VR Daydream page, there was a waterfall and a stream, like a babbling brook, and there was trees and birds flying around. So I must have went to, I want to say, between 30 or 40 different waterfall places that look like... the homepage and it wasn't until the very end where I got one that was very close to matching what you were experiencing in the daydream homepage to get just the right amount of every element you know and just like all the elements I had to record separately like the wind and the birds everything, crickets, every sort of element I had to do, and then mix them, place them in an Amazonic mix. But it was just the simplest things that you hear in there, which don't sound very complex at all, were actually very difficult to achieve. And I'm sure most people are just like, oh, these sound boring. It's not really exciting. You put the headphones on. you're moving around and stuff, you're moving your head and you can hear like, oh, okay, it's kind of cool. But, but they were really, really challenging. The wind, I think, was the most challenging. I remember spending weeks and weeks on getting the perfect wind, just the perfect gentle breeze sound was probably the thing I struggled with the most. And in the end, actually, I couldn't get the perfect wind. I had to use procedural audio. I had to use a software program that generates synthetic wind sounds. And then I had to tweak it just perfectly and then take that, take those recordings and then remix them, put them in the ambisonic mix and place them in these environments. So it was... It was a struggle. Yeah, I'll tell you, the simplest things that I thought would be really easy were actually very, very difficult to get just right. So once again, like I said, it was an interesting learning process and kind of stumbled my way through it. But I got through the other side and I picked up a lot of... really helpful information so future projects won't be probably so difficult and now there's better tools too i want to say that when i first began working i want to say it's like 2016 when we first started working on the project there there was not many ambisonic plugins and tools now it's gained much more popularity with like you know sony like you know sony playstation vr now a lot of bigger companies and starting to take uh a bigger interest with virtual reality and augmented reality now apple and some of the big giants like microsoft and their hallowens um they're uh they're all looking to this uh And so we're starting to see much better development kits and software and things that make the process much easier now than what it was back then when I started working on it. But yeah, it's kind of cool. That's kind of cool. I guess my job is. I guess my job could be a lot worse. I can't complain. I could be flipping burgers somewhere in some shitty place or something. I'm like, I'm pretty. I'm really fortunate that I can do what I can do and like sit in my studio in my basketball shorts and work on these crazy weird projects every day. And yeah, it's pretty awesome though.
