Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artist's labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Every so often, we like to look intently into our navels, and this week on The Exchange, I do so with fellow music critic Philip Sherburn. Delving into his past, we talk about how he came to write, some of his musical predilections, and at the time, what was an upcoming trip to Las Vegas for the Electric Daisy Carnival. I know you went to Brown for university, but did you grow up on the East Coast? No, actually I went to Vassar for my undergraduate and I did graduate school for a few years of it at Brown. And I grew up in Portland, Oregon. What was Portland, Oregon like growing up? Um, in retrospect, pretty awesome, I think. Why do you say in retrospect? Because at the time you were feeling like, ugh. Or you didn't know any better. Well, I didn't know any better, and at the time I wanted nothing more than to get the hell away, which is what I did basically when I turned 18. and I went back east for school and sort of in Vassar's in Poughkeepsie New York which is about an hour and a half up the Hudson from from New York City and so I was though I never lived in New York I was always kind of satellite orbiting it which was important to me but Portland was I mean I grew up in the suburbs not not so much like awful, like, prefab suburbs, you know, they were sort of 50 suburbs that had overgrown and become their own little thing. Went to public school. I was a nerd. slash avid student, played piano and other things. And my teenage years really just got into like punk and hardcore and went to a lot of shows. There was quite a good scene in the Pacific Northwest. Yeah, I mean, it's funny, like I can't really speak about a scene because I was never part of a scene. I had friends that I went to shows with. But you were never in a band? Not really. In a serious way? No. I think there was maybe something that played at like an eighth grade graduation type of thing. Sure. Me and my Korg Poly 800. But no, I mean, you know, there were bands like Poison Idea. The Wipers had been there before, although I think they were gone by the time I kind of came up. But I was going out to shows like, you know, touring bands like Sonic Youth, The Accused from Seattle, Poison Idea from Portland, No Means No. I mean, there was pretty much everybody was passing through Portland. Like, it was definitely a stop on the circuit. you had the opportunity to see anything you wanted to. So I did that pretty religiously. Did you get to electronic music in Portland? Or did that come afterwards? No, that came later. The only thing... I mean, I started out with like top 40 radio, I mean, like 70s AM easy listening stuff, which is kind of like the radio station that my parents would let me listen to when I was little. You know, I mean, like James Taylor and, you know, whatever there was. A lot of Chicago and air supply. And then kind of discovered New Wave maybe when I was 13 or 14 and New Order and the Smiths and Suzy and The Cure and that kind of snowballed into an all-encompassing quest to get to the heart of goth. or whatever, even though I wasn't, I wouldn't say I could have identified as a goth. Yeah, I mean, with this quest, was it, were there costuming involved? I mean, there was costuming involved. Not to the extent that I wanted there to be costuming involved, but I had parents that frowned on all black. wardrobes and like black nail polish and uh what like when I was geez we're starting on the confessionals really early but when I was uh 16 I broke my collarbone stage diving uh at a GBH show ironic because GBH stands for Crevious Bodily Harm. And I had worn this pair of combat boots. And I remember before going to the hospital and then calling my parents. from the hospital, I changed out of my combat boots and like hid them in the trunk of the car so they wouldn't know that I'd gone and like. Nonetheless, though, when you left to go to college, you were like, I'm going to go almost as far away across the United States as I can. Yeah, pretty much. I mean, that was that was definitely the plan. And that's what I did. What did you study? I studied English literature. A little bit. Spanish, but yeah, mainly English literature. But there was never the immediate plan to get into writing. No, no. I mean, there was, well, maybe writing. I always enjoyed writing and I think I was a good writer. There was really never any immediate plan for anything. There was no plan whatsoever. Classic English major. Just like today. Yeah, I mean, I think the plan was sort of graduate. go to graduate school and then figure it out, which is basically what I did. I mean, I interviewed in a couple publishing houses in New York in my senior year of college, and those didn't really, I don't think they called me back. But yeah, no real plan. But I wasn't writing about music at that point yet at all. Did you go to San Francisco then after college? Yeah, I mean, after college, I bounced around the Northeast a little bit. I spent, like, after graduating, I went up to Bar Harbor, Maine and worked. in a coffee shop and like organic grocery there for a while and then traveled through Greece and Turkey for I think three months and then came back and settled in Providence because I was with somebody at the time who was from there and it kind of made sense as a place to be. And then I got into Brown around the time we were breaking up. So I stayed in Providence for another maybe four years. And you're still by this time not really that into electronic music or did it finally got in there? No, I mean what... kind of I flip-flopped at some point I mean it let's say my first real musical love was was sort of new wave and very specifically like synthesizer heavy new wave and when I was in high school I bought a couple first a Korg poly 800 and eventually an Oberheim matrix 6 and I had like a little Korg pedal effects rack When you bought the Korg, was it, I've seen X artist, like, on New Order, in New Order? No, I don't know. It's funny, because yesterday I got a Jan Hammer record at a secondhand store, and there's a picture of him playing, like, the keytar, you know, strapped on, and that was always part of the appeal of the Korg, was you could strap it on. I think I had a poster on my wall of like Joe Zawanuel with like the Korg Poly 800 on a guitar strap. But no, I bought like my sheet music, both kind of classical music and also things like the Phil Collins Against All Odds transcription at this like a shop called Portland Music. And they had a selection of synths. upstairs and so I would go and the ones that I didn't buy are the ones that today really bother me you know like the Junos and the Jupiters and all these things and the Korg was affordable and and so that was the first one I used to like send away from the back of keyboard magazine for these Xeroxed they might have even been mimeographed I mean this is like the 1980s you know but these Xeroxed Sheets of all of the parameters that you needed to program like the lead sound from top 40 hits, you know So there would be I don't know like Duran Duran's save a prayer and then you would go through and it would be like envelope 24, sustain, 63, you know, these just insane calculations. It's like guitar tabs, right? Yeah, yeah. I mean, it was specifically to program just the Chord Poly 800 because it was like you had page through menus. There were no, from what I remember, there were no actual knobs. It was all very painstaking data entry. Kind of sucked. But anyway, so I'd gone through this kind of synth phase and I had my little makeshift studio kind of cobbled around the upright piano that we had that was like my synthesizers and electric guitar and some pedals, a weird Yamaha, I think the RX-15 drum machine, and then a four-track recorder. And none of it was... I mean, I really envy kids today who can get Ableton and a laptop and do everything in there because all I wanted to do was make. records like you would hear on 4AD. I really wanted to be Clan of Zymox, but I had no idea how you would, how that would happen, you know? And the four track was kind of the closest that I could come to that. But even then it was like, I mean, I must've used Line In for the synths. I don't know. But I remember everything going through a huge like PV amplifier. So I really don't know. At some point I got more and more into hardcore punk and I decided with like a 17 year old sense of certainty. that synthesizers were false and the guitar, preferably distorted guitar, was the only real instrument and the only acceptable musical expression. In the hardcore scene, it was quite... There was no room for that at all. Yeah, I mean, because I... I don't know, it was just youthful rebellion and a reaction against things that I had thought. And at that time, like, post-punk wasn't really... I mean, I still listen to, like, my Bauhaus records, but I just decided that, you know, overdubbing was false. I didn't even like hardcore records that had, like, audibly overdubbed vocals. I thought that was, like, fake and untrue, and I was looking for this kind of immediate naturalism. And so I sold the keyboards. Idiot. and I went back to college and I mean college was kind of dry musically like it was what the so I entered in 89, left in 93. I discovered the native tongues, hip-hop, because I was back in New York. I listened to Beastie Boys. I listened to a lot of Rollins Band, a lot of Fugazi. I went through periods where I got really sick of music, pop music, and I just listened to classical music for six months on end. But I didn't have any... I don't know, I didn't have any real great passions aside from certain artists or bands. It was in Providence, Rhode Island that I was getting really into the, like, I don't know what you call it, but the hardcore scene of 93, 94 bands like Antioch Arrow and Heroin and Born Against, bands associated with a record label called Gravity from San Diego. And I was like reading Maximum Rock and Roll and I was buying records mail order. I imagine there was also quite a... community for that stuff in Rhode Island because you have the art school there them bringing people in for shows and stuff yeah I mean there probably was although I didn't really know that many people but yeah I remember seeing a poster for a band called A Minor Forest which was a band that I discovered completely accidentally I think I ordered them because I thought it was a side project of something else and it wasn't, but I fell in love with the record. And then I remember to see a flyer on the street and be like, oh my God, there are enough people in this town that know this band, that this band is going to play here. What a privilege. That's amazing. And so I guess if we're going towards how I started listening to electronic music, it's basically this weird accident that I was buying all of my hardcore from this shop called Fast Forward, which was in a building down by RISD, the Rhode Island School of Design, in kind of an old industrial building with a tattoo parlor and a divy Coke bar. yeah and the owners were a guy named ron who had been like in england during punk in the late 70s and then he'd been in England again for Acid House in the late 80s and his partner business partner was a woman named Judy who was kind of like into crusty metal and death metal and power violence and all this other stuff so they had just a weird selection of music very much a sort of hand-to-mouth affair. When they sold enough records, they could place a new order. They were getting in all of the hardcore 7-inches that I was looking for, and then they were also getting records from Warp and Reflex. It's interesting how those things, certainly in the UK, connected so easily. The culture seemed to make sense. You see people like Optimo nowadays totally saying Krusty Punk. actually you know it's clear connection but I think for people like us in the states it was so disconnected from that and you could get into this situation where you're listening to these US hardcore bands and you'd be like if you have a synthesizer this is garbage this is not music anymore yeah or on the other side of things if you have guitars this is garbage you know because I mean I think Simon Reynolds has talked about the way that for many people there was an evangelization process of turning techno and you turned your back on guitar music, on rock. It was this year zero thing. And I think what was really interesting and special about Fast Forward is they, because their own musical biographies were so complicated, they didn't have that either or us against them. kind of thing and I mean I also got I discovered Nick Drake there you know like years before the Volkswagen commercials you know I mean it was a very strange sort of melting pot of stuff and so I was I mean I would go in there and be like oh yeah all that rave crap that sucks I'll go to the seven inches and then little by little I would hear things in there that would kind of turn my head. And I think the first thing that really got me was Aphex Twins selected Ambient Works Volume 2. Although at the time, I'm pretty sure that that's what was playing and Ron was like, oh yeah, it's this thing. And so I bought it and it was the Musique versus the Auteurs record, which is, to this day, I don't like it. very kind of noisy and distorted and odd and I got it home and I was like wow this doesn't sound nearly as cool as I remembered but I'll keep listening to it and then I kept going back and I would pick up other things I'd been in Cappadocia and Turkey And so, Autechre's Amber was in stock at the time and it has a cover shot in Cappadocia and I was like, holy crap, I was just there. must mean something so I bought that maybe like sound unheard and then from there it became pretty much pretty instantly I like my hardcore seven inch budget shifted entirely to dance music 12 inches Thank you. By the time you graduate. from Brown near the end, I think, if I remember correctly. You wrote something. I mean, I started, this is, so this is like 95, 96, and I was really just kind of listening as widely as I could. And of course, this is all pre-internet or pre- P3 anyway, so it was all very much based on the accessibility of records. I went to New York a lot and I went to Kim's and other music and blew hundreds of dollars on... records you know and so is everything like the moax heads box sets like tortoise and the whole post rock thing it all kind of swirled together and I started doing just some little record reviews for a newspaper which was I think called the college Hill independent which was what was the first one you wrote up do you remember I'm pretty sure it was the tour a series of Tortoise remix 12 inches. Like the oval remix maybe in a loop vibrant remix I'm pretty sure that was an early one and and I was also very active on this mailing list a hyper real mailing list called the IDM list which still exists I think I finally unsubscribed after like 15 years not too long ago. I just couldn't take it anymore And I was just kind of posting little reviews or comments on that. And a woman named Marie Kaczmarek, who was on there, got in touch and was like, oh, I'm starting a webzine. Would you like to contribute? And I said, sure, what's a webzine? And the night before they were due, I cobbled together a handful of reviews, probably Funkshturung, and I don't remember what else anymore. And yeah, and those published there, and it was a site called Urban Sounds, which no longer exists. Although you can find it on archive.org. And I just started kind of going from there. Was it love at first review? Did you enjoy it immediately or did it take a while to sort of get the hang of it and get a feel for it? That's a good question because I don't, I mean, I'm not sure that love in some ways enters into it as far as the writing goes, like the actual process of writing. I still kind of hate. Like I'm generally miserable when I'm sitting in front of the computer, which is most of the time. No, I think most musicians are probably not most, but some are also, if I can't just get this right, I can't get this finished. Maybe you feel the same way when you're making music as well. When I'm making music, see, that's when nothing actually counts. So I couldn't be happier than when I'm just making music for days on end. But the writing was, I don't know, I mean, I guess in some sense it must have been love at first try or whatever because I kept doing it more and more. And then it was, so in about 98, I moved. from Providence to San Francisco, I took a leave of absence from graduate school that has now lasted, how many, 13 years? I'm still on the books there somewhere, somehow. And I started pitching magazines. I decided I wanted to do it slightly more seriously. What magazines were back then that you were thinking, okay, it would be great if I could get into? Spin? I don't think Spin entered into my... It's funny because I learned a lot about music from Spin from my teenage years. But by that point, I thought of them as much more mainstream somehow. Looking back, it was a huge error. There was so much on early electronic music and the rave scene and stuff in the early 90s. that I totally just missed somehow. I mean, there was tons of amazing stuff, but I was probably like flipping through looking for the Rollins review and then throwing it aside, you know? But I was doing a lot of lifestyle magazines like Surface because I had a friend who was a fashion editor at Surface and so I would do some really odd things for them. I profiled Touch, John Wozencroft's Touch label for Surface which was strange. And at some point I pitched The Wire, because I was a regular reader of The Wire, and I don't know why, but they said, sure. And so the first thing I did for them was I flew down on my own dime to Los Angeles, and I hung out with the Plug Research crew for a weekend, like Lores and Alan. I think it's Avonessian and John Tejada. I stayed at John Tejada and his mom's house, like somewhere out in East LA. And yeah, and I did, it was like one of their sort of geographical reports. It was like, here's what's happening in Los Angeles, plug research. Global year or something. Yeah, exactly, exactly. And yeah, it went from there. Did you find writing for The Wire slightly imposing just because it has a, certainly back then it had more of an academic type feel, at least in my mind? No. Yes, absolutely. I think it was probably a pretty terrifying experience doing my first piece for them. For many years, and maybe even a little bit today, I find that when I'm writing for The Wire, Sometimes kind of like find myself going through like mental contortions try, you know, like trying to make things maybe More in my perception along the lines of my perception of a wire style than they need to be Yeah. It's funny though. You think, you know, I say that it's my conception, it's your conception, but then you read pages like the hip hop page or Byron Coley's thing. And then it's just like, they own, they just bring American into the magazine and it's totally. different and strange moment in The Wire. Yeah, and awesome. I mean, it makes the magazine, you know, that much better. I wish that I had an easier time, you know, being that sort of natural somehow in my own voice. Was that the big, that was sort of the big first break in a music magazine in your mind, was The Wire? Yeah, definitely. I mean, because then... From that point, somehow, then it became really easy to pitch other magazines like Accelerator and be like, oh, hey, yeah, I write for this little thing and this little thing and The Wire, and immediately they would get back to you and be like, sure, what do you want to do? So, yes, thank you, Wire. When you were in San Francisco, you started... getting involved in the scene there a little bit? Yeah, yeah, definitely. Who were some of the people that you were hanging out with, sort of immediately became friends with? I remember very clearly there was a show when, I think it was Vancouver. and probably another one of the Chain Reaction people, I don't remember who, maybe Mono Lake, Pole came to town, and I went to that. And I seem to have met some people there. I mean, I'm not the most social person in the world, so it takes me a long time to get into things. But I started going to this space called the Beta Lounge, basically. And the Beta Lounge, betalounge.com, it still exists. the archives still exist and there's still a space in Hamburg. but it was basically... It was a space, though. It was a space. It was a warehouse space in Potrero Hill, like in the sort of industrial wasteland there. And they had... Yeah, they had a warehouse. They had turntables. They had a bunch of recording equipment and some video cameras. And basically every Thursday they did... a live webcast that would then be archived, recorded and archived. And it was kind of whoever was in town plus local DJs. It was free. It was bring your own beer. And they had like a roll-up kind of garage, you know, as a loading dock kind of thing. And so in the summer, they would open that up and do a barbecue out on the street. How were they making money? They weren't so much, really. I mean, they tried lots of different things. Ultimately, they had like a video production company that was doing DVDs. Sort of in this first dot-com moment. Yeah, yeah. I mean, this is all like 99, 2000, 2001, sort of just before everything sort of crumbled. And we'll figure it out how to make money in a couple of years. We just got to get up on the web and wow, we can stream things for free. But I mean, it was an amazing, like you look back now and the people that play there, I mean, it was like Derek May, Richie Houghton, Recluse. I was looking earlier to remember who was there, but I mean, it would be easier to sort of name the people that didn't play there. those that did. Plus then all of the San Francisco locals from kind of every corner of the scene, you know, so that meant it was Miguel Migs one night and Sutec the next night, you know, I mean, it was a very, a very open environment. And I started DJing there a little bit. I wish those sets probably weren't archived for posterity, but they are. Yeah, and just hanging out there, I would kind of go down most weeks by myself and just run into the few people I knew and meet other people. You wish these sets weren't archived from a, I wasn't a very good... technical DJ or there were some questionable musical decisions? No, I mean, I think technical. I mean... Yeah. When, I mean, you became a much better technical DJ at some point. I hope so. Like, what, I mean... I feel like there's a certain point at which you really honed your craft. Was it at the Beta Lounge that you were sort of learning in public? No, no. I mean, that was like, you know, just a couple sets. The, let me see, San Francisco, there was Beta Lounge and where maybe I got most active was with a crew. group, I don't know what you call it, called Trouble. And it was this sort of collective of people from the, let's say, more experimental techno scene. So like Kit Clayton. Kid 606, Gold Chains was a part of it, Sue Tech, me, Matt Leshuke, who's now the head of Iris Distribution, who I incidentally knew from Providence, and a bunch of people who I'm forgetting and should not be forgetting. And I'm sorry. Twerk was part of it. And we did kind of... We did like a monthly party for a while. I don't remember all the spaces we used. One of them was a bar named Amnesia in the Mission District. And it was just a little, I mean, it was tough in San Francisco to find a real space. Like the scene we drew was pretty small. And so you could only get into a bar, but the bar was, you know, the sound sucked. And it seems from the outside looking in, you look at the amount of releases and the amount of producers that were doing stuff there, it was kind of amazing that all these people were in the same place at the same time with generally the same sensibility. Obviously, everyone had their own distinct thing. Why San Francisco, do you think, around that time? Was it a dot-com type situation? I mean, were a lot of these... I mean, I know some of those guys were at software companies. Yeah, I mean, I'm sure that that had to do with it. I mean, a lot of... Some of those guys were working... Working in a toy company, designing sounds for these electronic learning toys, a lot of people were doing software development. I'm sure it was in part a case, even though San Francisco was a very expensive city, prohibitively expensive, but at the same time, you had all of these smart computer scientist type people, so they had the paychecks coming in. And, uh... and the desire to screw around after hours. And I guess you don't necessarily, for that type of music, you don't necessarily need the parties to create a scene so much as you just need the situation where you have all this influx of creativity and these people getting together and sharing new software, new ideas in the production. Yeah, I mean, certainly from... the production end of things, I mean, the friendships there were a big part of it. I think it was a weird moment in San Francisco, maybe, because, like, nowadays, the I think there's much more of a space for that kind of music that isn't part of the club or the techno scene or the house scene and it's not part of the rock scene. I think now there's a lot more openness to that if you just look at what happened with Chillwave in the last couple years or whatever. But at the time, San Francisco had a very entrenched house scene. which could be something like Miguel Migs or it could be something like the Sunset Parties and, you know, Stompy and those guys. I guess that makes Beta Lounge all the more. interesting that it would bring in Miguel Migs and also bring in Sue Peck. Yeah, very much so. Or it would bring in a Filipina breaking crew on the same night that Kid 606 was doing something. So you'd have these weird collisions of people that you wouldn't expect to see. You wouldn't expect to find in the same place and it somehow worked. Tell me about trouble. You know, you're going from place to place. It seems like a strange, very loose... Confederation. It was. I mean, it was definitely never the sort of tight-knit organization that maybe anybody had hoped it might be, if anybody means me, I guess. I don't know. I lived briefly in Annapolis, Maryland after college, and I remember really, because I was still into the hardcore Discord thing, and I remember trying to get involved. there and going to meetings at this sort of like anarchist co-op called the beehive which was going to be like a performance space and bookstore and whatever and and i didn't go to many of them because it was just a bunch of people like sitting in a circle and like endless dialogue and kind of accusations like this is the height of like the pc 90s and stuff and so I mean, in some ways, Trouble was a little like that, except not so uptight. But it was kind of, it was never going to be, you know, a highly functioning organization because it was a lot of people with a lot of crazy ideas. maybe only sharing some of them. But we did some really cool parties. We got kicked out of Amnesia, which was the bar where we did a lot of stuff because I wasn't there this night, but apparently they'd found a Stairmaster on the street. And so they brought the Stairmaster into the club. I don't know who was there, but I'm sure Miguel Kitsis was involved in some way. Probably Gold Chains. And they dragged this Stairmaster exercise thing into the club, and somebody went out and got a bunch of Wonder Bread, and they had a bread fight. basically launching slices of bread off of the pedals of this Stairmaster thing into the crowd. Of course. Of course. Velocity, trajectory. And so the next day, I guess the owner of the club got to the place and there was all this stale bread in the street outside and he thought, ah, damn bums, you know. And then he opened the club and went in. and there was stale bread all over the club. And so that's when Matt and I got the email from him. And it was a lovely email. He was like, you guys are great. I'm happy to give you a recommendation anywhere you want to go, but you're never doing another event at my club again. So after that, we... He knew, though, to email you and Matt, because you and Matt were sort of the ones who might have sort of kind of been taking it seriously. I mean, I wouldn't go that far, but somehow we had hooked up with Amnesia, I think. I mean, that was like the space we had gotten, maybe. We weren't there for super long. After that, we did some warehouse parties. Like in Soma, we had the Bunker and Cram organization come through and a lot of things we did I don't really remember because I have not a good memory but it was a good time you know it was like Matt Moses was involved I mean it was a very very creative spontaneous group of people As a journalist at the time, everyone sort of, I imagine, knew you were a writer, writing about things. Did you feel apart from it in a way? As though you were simultaneously participating, but also viewing it from a... outsider's perspective? Yeah, probably. I mean, because I think many of the memories I do have from that time were of me with like a camera or a notebook or something and kind of there. I mean, maybe not the parties that I was throwing, but definitely the, you know, being there and knowing these guys and wanting to know them better, but at the same time, you know, documenting and... And knowing it, at some point, you know, I would have to make some judgment calls as well that, you know, maybe they wouldn't like. So you were in San Francisco until 2004? Yeah, I was there until, like, 2003. In that time, I'd started going to Sonar every year and also going to Mutech. And in 2003, I'd gotten laid off from a dot-com job that I had. That was how I was financing all this, by the way. I was working for a web company. And by that point, I had enough kind of regular contract work. I was working for Flavor Pill out there and stuff. And so I decided, why not get the hell out of Dodge for a while? And so I went to Barcelona for Sonar and just stayed for like three or four months. I got a room with a friend of a friend in the Revol there. What is it about? I mean, obviously, sonar is great. But, I mean, what is it about Barcelona, the city, that's so appealing to you, that was so appealing to you? Well, in part it's because of, you know, Spanish language, and I'd studied Spanish in high school and in college, and I'd done like a semester abroad in Ecuador when I was in college, and so I really, I liked being in a place where I could use my Spanish and really have to be immersed. in it because there's not a lot of English spoken in Barcelona. I liked the weather. I liked the nightlife. I mean, after Berlin, Barcelona doesn't look... that mind-blowing but for me coming from san francisco where like they stopped serving alcohol at 2 a.m and most things close at 2 or maybe at 4 i mean barcelona you know things could stay open till 6 6 30 in the morning that was insane you know and there were parties the beach and and also you could hear techno like your you know house techno whatever you want to call it but the I had always been a little frustrated in San Francisco that the stuff that I really wanted to hear I had a definitely slightly more like Europeanized tastes wasn't really doing that well I mean my my friend Matt and I were doing parties in San Francisco I think a monthly and we would have I mean I know we had Super Pitcher we had Ellen Alien I think we had Ada we had some really cool people come through but we couldn't really draw a crowd In part that's because I'm a crappy promoter, it's just not my forte. But in part it was because it was at a moment where like people in San Francisco didn't really know or care who Ellen Ailey and or Super Pitcher were. So to come to Barcelona where there was much more of a, I mean it was just you know a stop on that European circuit and people came through regularly that was really eye-opening for me. Can you talk a little bit about I guess why, what was it about the European stuff coming out of Europe at that time that was so appealing, certainly compared to what was going on in America and San Francisco? I mean, I understand San Francisco House has a certain tinge to it, and this obviously was before the Dirty Bird guys were really going anyway. I mean, I think part of it's probably just accidental, you know? I mean, some of it was definitely the austerity and the minimalism of the stuff. I mean, you look at guys like, you know, that whole San Francisco scene of like Sue Tech and Kit Clayton and Twerk. I mean, they were all recording for Foursink or Mill Plateau, you know, which was a German label with very German aesthetics, you know? And so I think in a sense it's just kind of coincidence that that's the stuff that I sort of discovered. I mean, although that being said, it's also what appealed to me. I mean, like, in 98 or 99, like... when I was first discovering kind of I went from IDM into like it took me a couple more years to discover I liked 4/4 beats and house and techno and when I was doing that I was kind of sampling lots of different things and I bought some naked music records you know and then and I bought like quite a lot of like paper recordings records you know and those were all things that there was something interesting going on, maybe not the Naked Music ones, but, you know, I was buying records from all over the place, but it was the German stuff that really caught my ear. I think it was probably just the strangeness and the austerity of it and the dryness of it in some sense at that time. I think a lot of what certainly had any traction in the States had to have a little bit of a... some soul to it you know some real like something you could latch on to certainly because america didn't have so much electronic music history so it's sort of like i mean in the mainstream uh sense and that you know is coming more from a disco slant so that And that certainly lived on in San Francisco and I think I do regret to a certain extent that I didn't discover, didn't pursue more deeply the sort of disco influenced house music that was happening in San Francisco at the time because I think there was probably a lot of great stuff there that I just... you know, just through the people that I happen to know, you know, just never really heard. For me, though, I think as someone who's from the States, I always found that always it was the other, the things that I didn't know or, like, didn't come to town. That was the allure when I was certainly first getting into electronic music because... what I had in front of me in the States were the furry boots, the glow sticks, certainly in the Midwest where I was growing up. And so I was like, okay, anything that's not attached to that and is in the electronic music sphere, that's... like an extra helping of where I want to go. Yeah. Pushing me towards that. There was definitely an attraction in what was sort of far away and inaccessible. I mean, I'd had that as a, ever since I'd grown up, you know, first new wave. And then like, Discord, I mean they were all things that were from somewhere else and that in my sort of musical fantasy life that was like Mecca, that was where things were really happening and if I could only get there I would be a part of that and if I couldn't get there then at least I could buy as many records and magazines as I could and you know I mean it's definitely a kind of a fantasy, pop music fantasy. This goes, I guess, to a larger point of something I wanted to talk about with you. I mean, obviously, you're one of the foremost writers about electronic music. But yet, as any writer, you have blind spots. As any writer, you have context growing up. As an American writing about something that's quite a bit more popular in Europe. I imagine there's been struggles in your mind. It's in some places at some points to, I don't know, have there been struggles? Like I should cover more American stuff or... I don't know anything or that you, you don't know if you're coming at it from the right angle because you haven't had X experience. Yeah. I mean, I'd say yes, I, I'm very aware of, um, of the, I don't want to say the limits, but of the specifics of my perspective, or at least I try to be, you know, I'm sure I lose those sometimes. I try very hard not to sort of universalize or anything, but I mean, I'm very aware that like, I've never been super immersed in the world of like authentic Detroit techno or older Detroit. techno. I mean, you know, it's something that kind of I've heard in passing and for whatever reason, it was never like a deep passion of mine. I don't know why, you know, and the same goes for Chicago. I mean, in part, that could be a factor that like a lot of records were out of print for a long time, you know, maybe not so much with Detroit because I mean, Submerge kept everything going for years. Yeah, like that's a blind spot. I mean, it's not that I had no American grounding at all. I mean, I was buying, you know, like Morgengeist records when it was back, like the Driving Memoirs, you know, Unclear. But again, that was coming from a UK label. You know, it's like even the American stuff that I got into, I somehow discovered through this, through the European. UK approved. Yeah, something like that. And, you know, the San Francisco guys, they were Germany approved. You know, they were Akim approved because they were on 4Sync. I don't know why that is. It wasn't like a conscious decision not to explore American stuff. I mean, I came very close to going to Detroit, I think in the year 2000 for... a festival called Love From Beyond, which was, was it 2000 or was it earlier than that? It was, uh, It was 98. It was the interdimensional transmissions label. Yeah, exactly. Space invaders are smoking grass and stuff. And it was this great, it's probably more like 98, electro, you know, I don't know what wave it was of electro, but it was amazing. And I was really, really into that stuff. And I almost went to Detroit for this weekend-long festival. No, it was like 97 because I went out to San Francisco to visit a girl instead. It was over Valentine's. And yeah, and I don't know. It's funny to think how things might have changed had I actually gone to Detroit then. Didn't happen. So you've been in Berlin. for a while now. Yeah, like three years, I think. And it was a choice to move to the epicenter of electronic music so that you could cover it more. Yeah, in part. I mean, in part. I definitely had a desire to get over here for quite a while. I mean, I'd visited a fair amount, especially living in Barcelona. And partly it was a desire to kind of be at the epicenter, so to speak. Part of it was much more pragmatic, is that I was living in Barcelona, maybe not. with elite bureaucratic approval. And I met my girlfriend who's Spanish and at some point was like, oh man, I really don't want to have to go back to the States because I can't stay here. So I actually tried to get working papers. for Spain and they just didn't really exist. I wanted like a visa that would allow me to live there and keep working as a freelance writer for the States and pay taxes or whatever. And it just doesn't exist. So when the Spain door closed, my girlfriend and I decided to come to Berlin. because I knew it was going to be easier to get papers to live here. Seemingly anybody who wants to can get what's referred to in English as an artist visa, which lets you write or make music or do whatever. And you started... writing music around this time that you moved here? No, I was doing that beforehand, actually. I mean, I was making music back in San Francisco just on a releasing level, but I was, that's when I got, you know, Ableton and a little pork electribe and started again, you know, 15 years after I'd sold all my... Do you find yourself surprised at what you're making and what you're intrigued by? That you wouldn't expect that to come out when you write about something in some ways? Yeah, possibly. I maybe find myself more surprised by the things that I did a couple years ago that now I don't have any particular connection to or even fondness for. There are things that came out of me, but I don't really remember what it was like to make them or what I was thinking at the time. you I have very mutable tastes and interests, like many people, I think. And I think because I make music so infrequently, or at least release music so infrequently, it can look a little odd because a record is a snapshot of what I was into at the time and also just what I was exploring technically. I mean, I think... More than anything, what I like about making music is just the process of whatever tools I'm using, whether it's, usually it's, especially lately, sample-based, but whatever I'm working with is just... kind of following that where it leads me. I mean, it's... Do you feel like the way you write or what you write about or how you talk about music has changed since you've released music? made music a little bit more of a priority. That's a good question. I mean, I think I try as a critic to be, and possibly to a fault, but I try to be a very empathic listener. Like, it's very important to me to try and, unless the record is just utter garbage. in which case I would prefer not to deal with it at all. I tried to understand what the artist was trying to do with the music, what he or she was trying to say with it or whatever. And so maybe, yeah, it's possible that the more I've tried to make music myself, the more conscious of that I am, but... You become more soft with age. I mean, probably in general, but I don't think there's a real connection there, though. I mean, do you think you're a hard critic at all? Like, earlier? before you said, you know, you try to be empathic. I don't think I've ever been a particularly hard critic. I mean, I think. Would you, I guess, sorry, let me even like step back from that. Or do you regard yourself as a critic? Because I think that's also an interesting question. Yeah. I mean, I always go back and forth between whether I'm a journalist or a critic or what. And I mean, I think these days more of a critic probably. There was a time when I was doing a lot more reporting, interviews, festivals, kind of being on the ground. And these days, there's a lot less of that, and it's a lot more of kind of listening to records and writing from that perspective. Is that a conscious choice? In part, it's just dictated by... I mean, a lot of it's just my workload. Like I have a day job or a semi day job now, which takes up and other sort of like part time contracts that that basically take up all of my time. And so I'm always at my computer and I have a lot less time to go gallivanting off than I used to. And so it's not so much a conscious choice as just died. It is what it is. Do you enjoy it? What's that? Being tethered to my desk? Not so much. I mean, it's not like I... Being more of a critic than a journalist. Maybe, yeah, probably to a certain extent because I am, I can be a shy person. I don't have perhaps your... facility for interviews i i think um interviews like have always kind of terrified me uh i enjoy them but but i i don't think they're necessarily my forte and so um it's certainly easier to just sit at my computer listening to music and pontificating and you know sure but i think what What I try to do is, you know, I've always thought that as far as my own criticism goes, like I'm very much a sort of enthusiastic writer. Like I want to share my passions and what I think. I mean, I have very particular tastes. Maybe not correct or right, but, you know, I like my taste a lot. And I think what I try to do in my writing is to share my enthusiasm for particular records, particular artists, and particular sort of tendencies. Can you name a couple of these? Because I, whenever... When I was reviewing a lot more, I kept being like, man, I just, I clearly just love minor chords to a fault. And it's really, it's not, I'm giving things way too much credence just because they are melancholic. Yeah. Yeah. That's, yeah, that's interesting. I mean, I definitely have, I'm well aware that the last couple of years I've had a weakness for anything. slightly slower that kind of does something what I think I mean it's not just like anything slow is automatically a plus in my book there's lots of crap at slower tempos but I But I enjoy artists right now who are maybe working in different tempos than the norm or than their own norm and doing something interesting with that. So that's a weakness of mine. And lo and behold, my own music has been a lot slower in the last couple of years too. I mean, I like weird, freaky, kind of uncontrolled. old synthesizers like Onegai Hon or Luke Abbott or something. I mean, I like people that can kind of ride that kind of chaos, but still hold it in check to a certain extent. So that's probably, you know, a weakness or a predilection or whatever you want to call it. Just recently, you told me that you're penning an article for Spin. What have you written for? past, despite your missing the boat on them in general, about Electric Daisy Carnival, which it doesn't seem like a Philip Sherburn type festival in a way. Is it going to be some sort of Hunter S. Thompson-esque romp through Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas Part 2? It's funny because I've actually never read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and I'm like, damn, I need to get my hands on that book. I've never been to Vegas. Yeah, I'm really excited about Vegas. I'm excited in part because it's so not me or kind of my natural stomping grounds, and I do want to kind of push myself as. as a writer. I would very much like to do a book because I would like to reach a broader audience than I've had. I mean, I write according to my tastes very much. I realize that my tastes are very niche and also very particular to my weird interests, you know, and my prejudices. So I guess I'm excited. So a couple things. One is I would like to challenge myself as a writer by writing for an audience that maybe doesn't know or care what Bergheim is or who Michael Meyer is or anything like that. I mean, I would like, it sounds cheesy, but I would like to get it more universal truths. And there must be, if there's a universal truth, it must be in Vegas. I, it's so far outside my purview. I mean, I, I've always, I was, I was thinking the other day about. some of my knee-jerk, or not so knee-jerk, but prejudices. And I realize that, to me, I like things that are done on an independent scale, that are done on a small scale to a certain extent. And I think a lot of that comes from... my teenage years in hardcore and punk. I mean, I remember there was a band called Ignition on Discord and it was Alec Mackay. It was Ian Mackay. Was it Mackay or Mackay? I don't even remember. Mackay. Ian Mackay's brother. I think. And I'm sorry, Alec and Ian, if I'm saying this wrong. And I remember writing, I wrote, I think a fair amount of fan mail as a kid. And I wrote just a letter to them, to the band, to Ignition, saying how much I liked their record. We'll see you next time. And I got a letter back from Alec, and it was like a handwritten letter. This is long before email, you know. And it was a really cool letter. He's like, oh, man, thanks so much. I must have sent what these days we would call feedback. I was like, the record is amazing for these reasons. And he wrote back, and he's like, wow, thanks so much, you know. Most kids just ride in Bs, say like, send stickers. That's really cool. You took the time to listen to the thing about it. And I think, I mean, it sounds silly maybe. Is that where the music review thing came from? I think a lot of it goes back to that and that sense of, you know. Was that just a natural thing though for you? Was it natural to... be like not since I want to get something for free it was like man I just want to tell you exactly what this meant to me yeah that was totally natural I mean it was they had the address on the back of the record if they didn't want to get a letter they shouldn't have put it there you know I mean that it was yeah it just made sense to me and I think It's weird because in some sense, and maybe this ties into my, you know, the fact that I write and make music as well, but I feel like a lot of times I'm, and maybe it's because I write about things that I'm enthusiastic about, but I write as much for the musician as for an audience that's not that, which is maybe, I mean, maybe I'm kind of a fanboy. That could be a problem. So what are you writing to Skrillex when you write this Electric Daisy Carnival piece? See, that's what I have no idea about and what I'm really... I'm just fascinated and eager to see what happens because it's not... I don't have any... I don't really understand the world of like... big money and promoters and managers and all of these layers. I'm used to, oh, if I'm interested in an artist, I can find them within, you know, pretty quickly. Like a Facebook where I know somebody who knows them or they have a SoundCloud and I email them and they email me back. And I'm used to this world of direct access, you know, and now I'm beginning to set up interviews. in Vegas and it's a very different matter, you know, going through publicists, what not. Obviously having Spin behind me helps. But ultimately in Vegas, what I'm excited about is I don't really know what the story is. I don't really know what that scene is. I've been gone from the States for quite a long time now. And this is something that I think has come up, this sort of new rave-ish scene. And there are kind of multiple incarnations of it. I mean, on the one hand, there's... somebody like Swedish House Mafia, who's very much somebody that is being helicoptered in from abroad and playing their set and, to my mind, leaving. I don't see a lot of community around that. And maybe I'll be wrong. Maybe I'll be surprised. You know, maybe... I guess I have... I'm curious about the world of the fans. I'm curious about what they feel aligned with and what they feel a solidarity with. Where is the scene? I come from a world of very local scenes, city-based, specific, kind of self-contained. And Vegas to me, I mean, everything about Vegas is this artificial, constructed, virtual, hyper-real. fantasy world and so I mean to do a mega rave there is almost too perfect and so I'm very curious to talk to these kids and then you know Skrillex is the other end of that or artists like somebody I was just told about Pretty Lights who's from Denver, you know, kind of a dubsteppy glitch hop thing. And from the footage I've seen, like there's a video from Bonnaroo of Pretty Lights playing and the crowd is going crazy, you know, and I want to talk to the people and figure out kind of where this comes from, you know, are they following these artists or are they just going to Electric Daisy and whatever is presented there? But you have to have that moment where you're like, I'm going to Electric Daisy. There has to be some push to get there. I think there has been a major shift in America, finally, to electronic music. And, of course, the idealists... take on that is you know they'll get into Skrillex and then they'll learn about Scream and then they'll learn about Mala and then they'll get to the root of the thing Which is also a really snobby way of looking at it. Of course. Look, I'm not a big Skrillex fan. I'm not going to pretend that I am. I'm a snob. Yeah, sorry. I shouldn't say an idealist view. I should say a music snob view. Yeah, but I'm also very, you know, like I said earlier, I try to remember that my perspective is... is very particular and conditioned by my own life experience. And who am I to invalidate what anybody else is going through? And if their version of electronic dance music is completely alien to mine, like right now, I'm just more fascinated by that disconnect and trying to understand it. Maybe there's nothing to understand, though. Like, you know, my parents weren't into music at all. There's nothing to understand about the fact that they probably went to a couple of concerts when they were young. They enjoyed them, and then they grew up. Yeah, leisure activity. And we've made this leisure activity our job. There could be some truth to that. It's pretty awesome. you
