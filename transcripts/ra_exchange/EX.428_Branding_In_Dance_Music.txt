Thank you. Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the Tag Editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is a recording from the Amplified Kitchen, which is a series of talks organized by the club about blank with assistance from Music Board Berlin. The topic for this edition was the changing role of branding in dance music. Corporate involvement in dance music is certainly nothing new, but it remains a prominent talking point around the communities in which it operates. This is partly to do with how marketing in the club scene has changed in recent years, with brands taking more active roles in influencing and financing the culture. Artist and educator Matt Dryhurst, Boiler Room curator Michael Stangel, and Yuka Asanuma a long-term journalist and jack-of-all-trades industry figure, traded views on the pros, cons, and potential futures of brands in dance music, with R.A.'s Will Lynch moderating the discussion. The talk shows that the questions at hand are much larger than whether a given electronic artist should or should not associate with a brand. We hear how the death of authenticity and the harsh realities of platform capitalism compel us to look at the issue in a structural way. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange on branding and dance music is up next. Hi everybody. Thanks for coming. Thanks to Music Board Berlin for making this thing happen. My name is Will Lynch. I'm one of the editors of Resident Advisor. And we're here to talk about one of the most interesting topics facing not just electronic music, but independent music in general. which is the role that brands now play in our community. To start, I guess I'd like to have the three panelists introduce themselves, just your name and what you do. Starting with Mikhail. My name is Michael Stangel. I am the curator at large at Boiler Room TV, also one responsible for music programming, one of the hosts and run things in Berlin and East. London which involves not only music programming but also project management and also which I think fits to this conversation a lot of strategy and implementation execution of commercial corporations and projects yes Matt? I'm Matt. I mostly make artwork. I teach a class at NYU on tech and art. Yeah, that's about it. Yuko? I always have a hard time describing what I do, but I've been a music journalist for 12 years or so, but I'm doing less journalist work these days. I do artist management and I'm a booking agent. I also promote some events. And yeah, I had a past of working for an advertising agency at On Point too. So I think the main reason this is even an interesting subject to talk about. is because for, I guess you could say in recent memory, I'm not sure exactly when you would identify the starting point or how many years it's been, but brands have played a new role in independent music where there was a time when a brand partnership. sorry, a partnership between a brand and an artist might mean an artist having a track license for an ad or something like that, something quite clear and direct. Now brands have much more innovative ways of getting involved in our community and kind of influencing our community. Maybe the most clear example would be Red Bull Music Academy. But another would be Boiler Room, I would say. Basically, we have cultural institutions and electronic music, which, correct me if I'm wrong, but kind of wouldn't be possible without brand partnerships and kind of a modern form of brand partnerships. So I guess to start, Michael, do you want to kind of walk us through what Boiler Room does and what role brands play in that? I mean, to get back to your point where you said to look at historically when brands got involved, funny enough, we had a couple of months ago, we had with the music commissioner, similar conversations, Zara Farina was involved. a couple of other people, also people who used to work at Rebel Music Academy. It was a researcher named Lorenz Grunewald who presented his PhD, which was actually looking at that, when did brands... step into culture. And funny enough, you can basically trace the history and the rise of jazz music with the sponsorship, a correlation with the sponsorship of soap brands in the US. So a lot of jazz music would have not been, you know, able to exist or to find a bigger platform without a patronage. of bigger brands. So this is actually something that's deeply embedded into music culture, even before radio and about the beginning of recorded music. So that has always been present. I think just the visibility and the way brands engage, which is from, you know, very... distinct way of advertising you know let's imagine it it's a difference between between well that's different stages you know as I think an arena named after a brand you know a stage with a brand logo or the artist wearing you know the attire of the brand you know there's like various qualities to that and to get back to you how we work with Boiler Room, I mean, you have also to look a little bit into the history of what we do. So basically when we started it, we didn't really know what we were doing. There was no business model. There was no money. There was nothing really except the idea of building a platform for music. But how, we did not really know. We had two webcams, a laptop, and an idea. And it was very clear from the very beginning on that what we do at the core of it, which is, you know, providing a platform for electronic and documenting, you know, the growth and the culture is completely unsustainable. It's like there's no way we will be able to either pay for it or pay ourselves, which is a fundamental problem, which a lot of electronic music has. The audiences want the music they want, you know. the diversity of it, you know, they want to live the culture, but fuck no, they will not pay for it, unfortunately. From recording music to recorded music to quite a lot of content, this is a real life issue. So it was also from the very beginning for us clear that we need to obtain some sort of funds. At that time, it was not really a company, so we could not structure it in such a way. And it was also, I mean, you must also understand 2010, 2011 is basically prehistoric times when it comes to culture marketing. The only really, really established culture marketing concept that was, you know, unique, different, scalable and interesting was Red Bull Music Academy at that time. In 2010, the majority of culture marketing activities of brands would be logo on a stage, you know. Then Creators Project came, you know, in around 2012. This is like this famous story where Vice Magazine managed. managed to get us some ridiculous 300 million dollars out of IBM and created a quite interesting, you know, platform. But, you know, for us it was clear we have something that is very dear to us, which is, you know, a music culture that needs visibility, that needs a platform. We have a deep understanding of this, this, this, this, this, those communities and this culture. So we know what are the things that make it work, but also that need to be protected, that need to be amplified. But we also knew that there are brands that kind of want to get involved with this demographic in one way or the other. So for us, it was clear we cannot do advertising because this is not the way we want this to be. Sorry. when you say do advertising. Advertising would be classical advertising, visual advertising, like banners on your homepage, banners on the stream, banners on my t-shirt, you know, that kind of, it was clear we do not want that. From the very beginning, we wanted to be smart about it because at that time there was also a lot of hostility towards, you know, any kind of corporate money and underground culture, but we had not really a choice, but we knew that if you understand what the culture is about and you can lead on an equal eye level the brand to understanding what this culture is about, you can create something that is both interesting for the culture and the brand, which means you can amplify what this artist, this group, this club, whatever, is about. access to demographic but you don't give the brand much more ownership about that than that so you amplify it you create you know discourse you create opportunities that would not exist otherwise but you also create boundaries which are really really important which was always the most important thing for us because and some people doubt it but authenticity and the credibility of that. I mean, we are some of the most cynical, or we were at that time, some of the most cynical underground music people that there were, you know, but we had to face the reality. What we want to do, we have to do. So we set up a very smart way. We basically rethought how we approach brand, how we talk to them, how we work with them. who are the gatekeepers and facilitators that we let into this conversation, you know, on which level they eat. It's getting very complex, by the way, already right now, because I'm now on an agency level. But you had to look at it and decide what is the process that we want to shape, what are we and what can we offer. And this is basically our strategy ever since, which also allows us to create. actually quite exceptional exceptional things that i'm very very proud of that would not be possible with any other money than third-party funding that comes unfortunately or fortunately from brands that are willing to provide that yeah and i mean um to your point that brands have always kind of been a benefactor of music culture i think maybe what's strikingly different today is that Boiler Room books some pretty avant-garde artists, which in another era might not have seemed to have much commercial potential. But, I mean, last night you did the porn-sexual. That was so sick. But, I mean, if you're able to do things like that, then it's natural. Yeah, but this is the thing. We couldn't be able, we could not do, you know, we could not amplify. Basically, if you look at what happened yesterday, any kind of body discourse of the last 20 years and the struggles and the successes were on display yesterday. We could not pay for that if I wouldn't have, you know, done the Valentine's Ballet Room two weeks ago in Valencia, you know, with King. Because one thing, ultimately, you need to look at what is your end goal. You know, what are you trying to achieve? You know, what is literally the overall picture? And the fact is that... Of course, our intention would be to rake in as much money as possible, sit on it and be happy, of course, but that's not what we're trying to do. We try to finance 85% of content that is so obscure, so left field that even, you know, like Resident Advisor would maybe write an article about it, but he would never send five, you know, 10 camera people to the end of the world to create four hours of footage around it that is not even monetizable, you know what I mean So what is the end goal? And ultimately, what are the tools to get there? So this one thing pays for the other. That's the reality of it. We're very proud of it, to be honest. Jukko, over the course of your career and the various things that you've done, you've worked inside and outside this sphere of brand world. I guess, being a music journalist, doing a freelance gig for a regular magazine or newspaper or website versus a freelance gig for RBMA, what are the key differences there? Well, you definitely get paid more. if it's a corporate sponsored program and I actually I didn't mention before but I did work for Red Bull Music Academy for I would say full time for half a year when they had the academy in Tokyo I'm from Japan by the way It took me a minute to decide whether I take this job or not because I kind of started my involvement with music scene by publishing fanzines approximately 20 years ago. And I was totally, I was a hip hop head and I was totally against all this mainstream music press. And I thought they were all commercial, you know, all promos, boring stuff. We should talk about real music and real artists. And I was really, you know, fuck industry kind of, you know, had that attitude. Since after I quit. advertising job. I've been working freelance, independent, and I wasn't sure if I was ready to commit myself to work for, you know, Red Bull. The man. Yeah. And it took me a while to think about it. But in the end, I did the job, not... because I wanted good pay. But I realized with the funding, I was working as a chief editor of the Japanese language website. the online magazine. And so I was the editor and I was able to, you know, commission so many, you know, great journalists I admire to basically I could go to them and say, just write whatever you want to write. We have this money and just pick up any topic and you're free to do what you want. And I never had such opportunity and it was a great experience. So I have to say I really enjoyed the opportunity and yeah, it's not... possible without like nobody's nobody else I know is paying to do that and I actually wanted to I've been thinking about this topic and I wanted to bring up I want to like bring attention to the context of the current kind of environment because I think the From my perspective, the reason that the corporate sponsorship became so important is also due to the fact that Record companies, well, because they have smaller business now, they're not able to invest in new artists. So, for example, 20 years ago, when I got myself involved in music industry, it was still the kind of... traditional record industry structure where big record companies or even big independent labels such as Warp or Ninja Tune they had the financial resource to invest in artists that they think have the potential and advance the budget to make great records and they sell records and they can tour them around and they can make profit out of it. Whereas now, because music doesn't sell, you can't actually... People still do, but you can't really make a living, especially if you're an underground independent artist. It became so important. Performance income became so important. and you have to basically keep creating the content to be... To survive, basically. Yeah. So I think this is why that people started to notice the involvement because it's not a classic advertising as you mentioned that the corporate sponsorship became so important and artists became much more dependent on that, I think. And you just kind of touched on something that I think is an important piece of context here, which is record labels, including, you know, not even huge majors, but... just successful independent labels used to have the ability to sustain their artists or give them a living wage. Now they can't. And it feels like brands kind of stepped in a bit or they filled that void. Matt. I've heard you speak very compellingly in the past about basically the structures of like a music community and which things are healthy for them and which things aren't. I guess when you look at this landscape that we're discussing now. How do you feel about it? Which things do you like? Which things are you worried about, if any? I think the thing for me, I mean, not to bring into question the nature of this talk, but I was saying to you earlier, my most recent thinking about it is I think that independent music actually won. And I think it won, but there were a bunch of romantics, myself included. who missed the point, right? So if you go back to the 80s or 90s, the message from the independent musical community was... you outside of this kind of hulking mainstream marketplace, by the way, mainstream doesn't exist anymore, right? Because we're all marketed to as individuals. So you outside of that can have the agency with a group of supporters to run a career. And the message of independence there was very much one of individuating people, right? And I questioned from time to time, time whether or not had the tools available to people now being available to the pioneers of electronic punk music whatever it might be had they actually formed was it necessary for them to actually form collectives, right? Because at the time, I mean, you were shipping around physical objects, you needed a distributor, you needed this, and they put together very lean operations. But at the protocol level, I always try and think of things at like a protocol level. Ultimately, the message was you in your bedroom... outside of a centralized support system, can make it on your own, which to me is the dominant language of the economy now, right? And so in a sense, we've seen, and so I mean, people don't like it, but I talk about DJs being kind of like the ultimate kind of manifestation of platform capitalism in a sense of like a curator's market, right? It's like if you can bring the most eyes to you through observing the brilliance of your... your individual taste, then you will win and screw attribution or redistribution of payments to the people who put work into making that music or whatever, right? And so what I'm really interested about is when I see brands come in, and I'm actually way more agnostic about this than most people. I think Boiler Room do a great job. I think that RBM do a great job. The thing for me is I like the idea of there being alternative logics competing in that space. And I see no inconsistency between kind of the lore of independent music and where we are today. In fact, if anything, it's just become hyper-efficient. Brands have spotted the possibility, which is very pragmatic. Artists have pragmatically noticed that, by the way, as you put rightly, this would be a lot less complicated if people were willing to pay for culture, which they've... Then they've made that decision. That's not something that's been forced upon them, right? So what I'm more interested in is saying, first off, avant-garde. You mentioned Red Bull and so on putting on avant-garde things. Avant-garde is not a fixed term, right? So being avant-garde is not sticking a comb filter on a synthesizer, right? I mean, it's represented as such, right? But that's, I mean, techno is what, 50 years old? I have 30? I mean, it's fairly... Ripple Music Academy is doing actually a celebration party in September, 30 years of techno. Okay, but it's a little... I mean, it's a little peculiar to describe the avant-garde as identifying with a musical movement that's been around for decades and has weathered multiple economic shifts, right? So this idea of the avant-garde as this fixed thing is kind of crap. It's bullshit, right? So the question for me is to say, well... you know, it's not necessarily like our brands, you know, coming in to disrupt avant-garde radical club culture. The alternative question is saying, are we really that radical if a shoe company is interested in us? And what, no, it's true. It's true. Because those are the margins by which we determine these things, which is saying nothing of the fact. that I support a lot of people and I perform with a band. And we take that money and we do it with no real, no huge concern because we understand what we're getting into and we understand the role of the market. But if you're talking about avant-garde or radicalism, I'm particularly curious at what logics could not be supported. by brands. Not to deform what you guys are doing, not at all, but simply to present an actual alternative at the protocol level, at the ideological level, right? And there are certain things that brands cannot support, right? For example, I'm particularly interested in group equity. I'm particularly interested in the idea of decentralizing ownership. time convincing Red Bull of that. I think they'd actually be more amenable to it than some people would describe. But these are the ideas that I would consider to be actually on the avant-garde. And these are the ideas that I find are very rarely supported in these ecosystems. And I'll just finish with this. I was just at Sonar. talking on a panel about the future of the internet. I was talking about China almost exclusively because there's a whole other conversation to be had, which music tends to lag, honestly, in these conversations. And sitting next to me was Ian Rogers, who used to run Apple Music and is now the head of marketing at Louis Vuitton, a very powerful person in branding. Super gracious guy. I got along with him really well. But it's super clear. He grew up in skater culture. This guy, there is no logical inconsistency between the ideology he grew up around. that was this radical individualist self-expression, look at me, like that. There is zero inconsistency between that and Instagram or that and a shoe company. And that's just a maturation of the market. And a reality that particularly under platform capitalism, and I'm just quoting my tweets now, the more niche your interests are, happier it is. So we see a movement away from the mainstream, because the mainstream is boring. They have all that data. I am a, you know, I have a mouse fetish and I like to, I enjoy, you know, hanging out with 15 people in barns somewhere such that my, that's expanding their model, right? So when you move away from kind of market segmentations of mainstream, outsider culture, independent, it's all bullshit. It doesn't mean anything anymore. We are now in a time of individualized, personalized targeting, right? Where if you have something that you think is special and you are advertising it through those platforms, they are stoked, right? Which is to say nothing of the value of, you know, identity or any of these kind of issues being kind of milked or within the commercial realm. That's to say nothing of the value of that. We have to reframe our understanding of what radicality is, of what will be supported and what won't be supported. And naturally, there's going to be people on the margins who are experimenting, and I can talk more about this at some other point, experimenting in things that could not be supported. fundamentally because brands will not want to. But the interesting question for me, and a lot of people gripe about brands and music, when I come and say that to people and I say, well, you know, would you want to do this? They don't. So, you know, then you have to ask yourself exactly, like, is what I'm doing or what I'm associating with really that radical if the shoe company is interested in it? I feel like... a subtext to a lot of what everyone's saying is there's an idea of mainstream versus underground that is maybe dated at this point. Um, but kind of before we venture off into more philosophical questions, um, in terms of how this stuff actually works. One question I often ponder, especially with regards to Red Bull Music Academy, is what's in it for them? How is it possible that spending has to be tens of millions of dollars or more over the decades and these incredibly elaborate events flying people from around the world? to attend these academies, which, as Yuko pointed out to me earlier, is actually one of their smallest projects in a series of similar projects that are even bigger and more expensive. How does that help their bottom line? And I think maybe a place where some of the suspicion of this comes from is that most people couldn't tell you. There's a feeling that, you know, if Red Bull's official line is, well, we just love independent music and any rational person will be thinking, you're not telling me the real reason. And I think there's that introduces an element of doubt. which that sort of ill-defined punk DIY ethic flares up being like, you're full of shit. I'm not down with this. So I guess my sort of my honest question to you guys is how do brands actually benefit from projects like these? How does it help them sell their product? We need to talk a lot about the things that you just said. And we're going to get back on China in particular. But it's very easy. You know, there's a thing called market and partnership activations. You know, a brand does not only have a relationship to its customers. It also has a partnership. to its clients, which means, you know, the venues, the markets, the, if you look at how brands activate certain markets, it's usually always driven by some sort of strategic interest that might be, you know, I mean, drinks business, drinks business is that if you sell a certain amount, you know, of drinks by a particular brand, you amass a bonus, you know, some brands paid out, you know, every club. gets that, you know, from the most clubs in Berlin even get started with a prepayment from a big brewery because they get like 300,000 euros in advance or 200,000 euros in advance because then there will be for five years exclusively selling Astra or whatever is being on tap. And this can also be, you know, fragmentized and be used for individual activations like hosting an event that is part of a campaign that this brand is running that creates additional revenue for that club. that is not as monetary, like giving you 3,000 euros, you know, it gives you a lineup, it gives you the ticket revenue, it gives you, you know, a good relationship with that particular venue, which will only stock then this particular drink for the next five years to come. And the audience comes and it's like, oh, this is a sick place. This is a sick lineup. Oh, this drink is actually quite tasty. So it's a combination of ideological but also hard monetary and relationship goals and values. I mean, I'll be honest. I kind of personally lost you in there with, you know, I trust that what you're saying is totally sound. As a person not that well versed in how this all works, I still don't completely get it. in terms of something like fragmentation, market activations, things like that, I guess I think me personally, and I think many people feel the same way as me, I still feel there's a kind of fog of the actual transaction, the specific dynamics of where the money's going and where it's coming. and how these artists are instrumental to it. I can't actually explain it. It's completely arbitrary. It's completely arbitrary, to be honest. Like if at that time, I think, you know, not so. For example, the founders of Ripple Music Academy, Torsten Mani, two of the most unique individuals you will find in the sphere of music and brands. They're geniuses. and they're committed to underground music culture. You know, if their thing would have been in 1998 not techno but contemporary classical music and it would have had the right sales pitch then half of us would now listen to you know to completely different music it's a lot of this stuff is really really arbitrary and what one mistake that's a lot of um when you look at it as being made is you detach it a little bit from the people behind it Because ultimately, any kind of conversation is in the greater scheme of things, complete random exchange. We talk about the thing because we happen to be in a situation where this thing is appropriate. But if you shift one parameter to the left or the right, we would be talking about a completely different thing. So the outcome would be a different one. So a lot of it is really, really arbitrary because somebody in a position of... power, decision making, has the right sales pitch to steer the conversation into that direction. It happens to be resonating with what's at the moment hip and culture, amplifying it and taking it in the same direction. But I feel quite often Often that kind of interest is really arbitrary, why some brands get involved with techno and some brands get involved with the Bayreuther Festspiele, even though you could switch it. There's no reason why Audi is supporting the Bayreuther Festspiele and Red Bull Music Academy techno and not the other way around. Sure. Yuka, you worked for RBMA. How does that project result in cans of Red Bull being sold, or does it? I can't really say much about Red Bull, but I can... I think I can give you like a simpler answer to your question from my experience of working for an advertising agency. Because at the time, I mean, by the way, I only worked for two and a half years and I worked for a very big cigarette brand. I was assigned to a very big cigarette brand at the time. Not by my choice, but, you know. I was doing that and what really kind of fascinated me was that a packet of cigarette cost something like 20 cents to make and I don't know of course there are a lot of taxes and everything added on top but They sell it for a much higher price and the profit these companies make is just enormous. And I think you can say the same with Red Bull because there's not that much in the can. It doesn't cost a lot of money to make a can of Red Bull. And if you think of it, a lot of these really big brands that are already very successful tend to spend a lot of money into promotion, basically because they make too much profit. And they have to, well, they don't have to, but unless they spend it on expenses. this profit will be just taken away as tax. So typically they seek for something they can spend their money on towards the end of fiscal year. And they hire a creative agency or advertising agency to come up with something that they can spend, I don't know, $3 million. And it could be anything. As long as it maintains the image of the brand, that's fine. And a lot of the times these marketing brand managers are quite clueless about culture or music. So they often hire a third company that, you know, specialize in that, whether it's creative agency or production company, event promotion company. This is like the basic kind of financial reason they do, as far as I understand. There's also, you know, like to go maybe back to the practicalities of it. One of the main reasons why we, for example, decided, you know. As you said, a lot of brand managers are blessed them, but they are very clueless. I mean, you can't know everything about everything. So you need to, you know, give it to someone. Unfortunately, the process is traditionally structured that the clueless brand manager gives that budget to a very clueless advertising agency that then gives it to a... even more clueless sub-agency and they then find you know the person on the ground and then when it trickles up back to the brand a distorted monster of the original idea arrives and this is why we get a lot of really awful event concepts um so for border and first was important to exclude as many of those gatekeepers because in the end we felt very protected about the original idea. We didn't want that our idea of a really dope get-together of artists becomes just a branded shit show, where basically between every transition a jingle has to be played. Which is the extent of... what some brands think they own of culture when they give their money is sometimes frightening. So the job of a lot of the kind of players that understand the process is basically this expectation management, but also the boundary, the kind of setting boundaries to protect the, like to give, of course, they paid for it, you know, they should, you know, get. what they got promised, but also to protect those who don't know how to protect themselves, which is quite often artists, which is audiences, which is, you know, just to help them to protect, not to get sucked into something they might not understand, because it's a very complex process. One of the kind of more ideological things we brushed up against earlier is, I guess, what you could call the notion of authenticity. What is it that we feel is being compromised when an independent artist works the brand? And to me, when I really drill down to that idea. I guess it's, is an artist, is the artist's kind of original message being compromised in some way? That certainly has happened kind of in the old school, in the days of MTV and major labels and things like that. Do we think that this world of brand partnerships is friendlier to authenticity or is more tolerant of... the artist's unvarnished ideas than that old world. Yeah, but for the reasons I tried to articulate, it's no longer about one hulking message that's going to convince everybody. It's about... establishing territory or establishing new territories and getting the jump on other people. I mean, there's something arbitrary about this too, but there's also probably a very competitive environment where people are saying, we better fund this because we don't want them to fund it, right? And so there's a degree of flexibility there and people get away with some interesting things in that context. But I don't think that large companies in the context of our niche culture are particularly, like, they're looking... They're looking for that. They're looking for... something else. They're looking to get in early and that most likely justifies the investment. Yeah, but in terms of authenticity, I mean, as I say, authentic to what? And that's the question that I'm curious about with this is I do believe that there are many ideologies one could espouse that would come into conflict with taking money from a drinks company. But I don't see that many of them, actually. And So that's why I find the framing of this question to be somewhat confusing or sticky because I don't see there to be too many inconsistencies there past a certain point, obviously. There's obviously a line that's been established and things now are more flexible in that way, but they're flexible for a reason. It's not that people just chilled out. There's benefit to that. I think maybe the change that took place... I mean, there's a certain authenticity. For example, let's say it's an event-based collaboration. You can do events in various ways. You can, on one hand, try to... create, not reproduce, but basically maintain the structure, the kind of social interaction, the kind of experience of, let's say, a club night. Or you could do a red carpet, a photo wall, a VIP booth, a table service. tables next to the you know like it stays for sure but the thing is where I think things changed and I think they changed inexorably is that my understanding of authenticity at one point and this is like like pre-globalization, this is pre-the flattening of the earth where everybody plays the same music in different cities and we try our best to go further and further out and set up the servers so that we can convince kids in Egypt to make trip-hop too. This kind of flattening of the earth. Before that, authenticity meant... I'm going into Mississippi and there's people who have agency and equity in this area and we are aliens to this right that over time and this is a conversation way bigger than music that over time has eroded across the board right so authenticity now is okay these kids have a Facebook group and every now and then they get invited to play in a club that is owned by someone who's 50 years old who bought it with their parents money or something like that you know like Like, authenticity in that context is a very low bar to jump, whereas authenticity in the classic context was like, no, you're coming on our turf. And what I think is interesting, I mean, this is a bigger conversation about territory generally, but what's interesting about this is who has turf anymore to claim, right? And on the protocol level, this is what I think is super interesting, like a Berghain, for example, Berghain never comes up in these conversations. Why? Because they have a core protocol, they stick to it. They're against the dominant ideology of the web, which is that of the image. They don't let you take pictures in there, and it works super well. That is an example of something that we'd be very, very resilient to. And people try their best. You see advertising campaigns that allude to it or they get the bouncer to participate or whatever because they want a piece of it but they can't quite get access to it. It's possible. But there's very, very few examples where there would be something that would be classically authentic, not to overvalue that term. to corrupt. And a lot of that has more to do with just the way in which cities have gone. People don't have territory to claim anymore, so it's kind of shooting fish in a barrel. And people are looking for opportunities for visibility or to make a career for themselves. Well, then if we abandon the concept of authenticity, let's say... protecting the interests, I guess. Maybe authenticity is not the right, it's a very philosophical, very thinly spread term nowadays, but in the end, it's about understanding what are the interests of the people involved, of the stakeholders, and how can you protect the interests of those who... have less power in that and leverage in that conversation over the interest of those who have that leverage, you know, that have the money, that have the platform, that could technically, luckily we're gone, you know, those days are gone where, you know, like, drink or cigarette brand you know can put you know the holly herndon ensemble into like glitter suits and hunt you down you know like some some tv show stage playing playing you know Samba versions of your tune. Yeah, for sure. But that would also be bad business practice for exactly the reason I articulate. Well, that used to be in the 70s, 80s. That was the way it was. But that's the tricky way in which these things work. And this is for better or worse. But the tricky way these things work, as I said, is that the stranger you are, the more benefit. And I don't think that we've metabolized that. I don't think that we've, these conversations haven't quite metabolized the idea that things that, and proud traditions that I identify with and have identified with for a long time. they aren't resistant in this way. There was something there that allowed for them to be co-opted in this sense. And many people might well be happy with that so long as they lose the critical reflex of immediately thinking that this is a bad thing. And I just keep coming back to it as like, what are the lines of things that can't be supported? And how do we focus time on sporting those? Because you learn a lot from that, irrespective of, you know. You mentioned earlier something about, I forget exactly how you put it, ideological inconsistency or logical inconsistency of a skater ending up running the branding department at Louis Vuitton. Look at Vice. I mean, what is Vice but, you know, skater, hardcore culture. manifest through new tools. Sure. Yeah, and I guess to me, I feel that it's rooted in a time where having a big platform or being on a major label or being on TV or something like that necessarily meant watering down anything but the most vanilla offering, you know, the advent of the clean version of a single, things like that. maybe that's over and that logical inconsistency is no longer there. or you can be a former skater branding for Louis Vuitton and not without being a hypocrite, basically. Um, I guess my question at this point in the conversation is what's the catch or, you know, what's, what's the thing that we need to be wary of if anything, or is, you know, I mean, one thing I've thought about is, um, I guess for me, what I mentioned before, for it's not clear threat or anything or a risk, but it makes me uneasy that, you know, if I see a celebrity on an ad hawking a product, I pretty much understand how this works. I still don't get how RVMA works or what is really going on back there. And I feel that that... kind of disconnect in information, even if there's nothing wrong in the end, makes me uneasy. And I've thought before about, interestingly enough, I'd heard this quote. I researched it yesterday. It turns out it was actually just a comment someone left on Metafilter that built up Steam and has been quoted many times, which is... if you're getting something for free, you're the product. And so when I think about the crowds on Boiler Room, that they're the actual product that, you know, you're serving up to the brand and the cameras and the DJs are the tools the same way. farmer uses tractors and whatnot to harvest his crops or whatever. And maybe there's nothing wrong with that. But I guess part of me has a feeling like. there's something about it or there's a lack of awareness on the part of the, you know, the role, the person, the people in the crowd aren't completely clear on what their role in this transaction is. And I wonder if maybe that's fine, but I'm not sure. Usually they are aware because you have to have a disclaimer. entrance of the venue that kind of states you know the use what the intent is and what the usage of the content is intended for but you know before we get too positive positivistic and start to hang up banners Budweiser banners all over about blank there is actually quite a big danger. You mentioned China, you know, and I've spent quite a lot of time in China in the last couple of years because we've done a few shows there that were... actually pretty awesome. And what I saw there was that the brands have tried out all the strategies in Europe and America. They learned how to market music in new ways. And China, which is an emerging music market, like traditional music industry did not exist there for... unless until like 20, 15 years ago, really still doesn't really exist. What happens now is that audiences are being built up by brands, which means before underground music culture, and this is what we ultimately talk about, you know, so all those wonderful places for all the wonderful weirdos that we call friends, before the infrastructures can grow naturally and organically, the brands come in and they terms. So the audiences are used to the fact that the Budweiser logo is bigger than the actual stage itself and that creates realities. You know, that absolutely creates realities. This is You see in especially, you know, Beijing, Shanghai, that the way the audiences relate to club spaces, but also to the brands, you know, within the club spaces quite, you know, completely differently just because they got educated by the brands to accept their presence before the music culture itself could do this education. You know what I mean? So, and this is a day, this is a day, I mean, I'm not, I don't know, I mean, it's similar on a lot of, like, the growing African music markets, you know, as, for example, MTN, which is a very big mobile phone brand that basically takes in a lot of that, you know, because they have the network, you know, they have the platform, they have the money, and they kind of... what is music culture across East and Central Africa, really, because there's no infrastructure for that. And that is the danger, really, because there's nobody who protects the interests of music culture because music culture doesn't have the leverage yet. It doesn't have the spokespeople. It doesn't have, you know, the boundaries, the gatekeepers, nothing. There's only brand money, really, because nobody else cares. And that is not cool. One argument I can get down with about the value of music, particularly live music, is this idea that it's a relatively cheap and efficient way to prototype congregation. It has a history of... being a meeting place for different... It's a place to find the others. That was always why I became interested in weird music. It was like a dating service or something where you can kind of like, okay, just cut the crap. I know that there's going to be some people I can talk to about some things. There's a complacency that sets in. I get frustrated often. You'll go on Twitter. I'm like, there's a correlation between the number of mixes, just infinite mixes, just everyone mixes. I always mix it. I don't know when people get the time, but I'm like, oh no, I do know when people get the time. It's because they're not working. There's this kind of leisure industry, this hulking leisure industry of people constantly, offices of people, you don't know what they're doing necessarily, but they're listening to some techno or whatever it might be, is in some way displacing a sense of real agency in the world. And you can kind of be lulled. And there's big articles about this with the video game industry, like how the video game industry saved the US administration from all this pain because the number of people under 30 who just spend all their time playing video games and not complaining is ridiculously high. It's like jaw-droppingly high. So this role of culture as being somehow just a solve to... to kind of smooth things over. And it's like, well, what more do you want? And again, this comes back to the protocol level. What more do you want? If you want to, if your idea of expressing yourself or of manifesting something in the world is to go into a room and dance with a bunch of people, then that protocol does not discriminate such that the people with the most money and the most interests are going to win that game. Period. Because after all, we're talking about countermeasures. you know, I mean... But, I mean, and are we talking about counterculture? I don't think it's necessarily, I think this is, like, actually the common thread. Like, this is the common ideology espoused by most people now. It's not necessarily a departure. I don't know what we're countering in that context. And the only question for me, and I don't know whether it... I don't know necessarily how I feel about it, but really is this sense of agency where you say, look, centralized market capitalism is a hyper, hyper efficient thing, right? Over time, it will find ways. It doesn't care. It doesn't have an ideology. That's what's brilliant about it. It's parasitic in this way. It will change and mutate to its environment to satisfy the demands of its environment. And it will ultimately win, right? Where this gets really interesting in the context of China, that's adopted this kind of hybrid capitalistic model, is, you know, many people have talked about this in the tech world, like the West will lose in a centralized internet war, which is happening, by the way, right now. Like in the developing world... The WeChat WhatsApp wars are very real. There is very real territorial conflict happening right now to try and get the developing world to use either a Chinese app or a Facebook app. The logic with that being is you have these developing economies. They haven't quite matured. it's all to play for. And as you say, these are people who don't necessarily have a background of cultural institutions to refer to in terms of their own agency. They don't have a background of deep kind of musical subcultures. They have a musical folk tradition perhaps. So there's a lot to play for. There's a lot of eyes. Now, the attitude from the Chinese government ultimately is that everything, because the Chinese government and Chinese corporations are basically one and the same. same thing right it's a centralized kind of capitalist system those eyes are going direct to Beijing right so they're looking to put in place the one belt one road for example right now where you have a new Silk Road they're looking to take over vast territories of the earth to establish their dominion this is this is a new empire that's being established and in that their understanding of individual agency is a very, very different tradition. It's a completely, completely different tradition. And the individual human rights of people involved are not necessarily at the forefront, right? It's not necessarily something at the forefront. The reason why they will beat the Western Internet is that the Western Internet has been very slow to develop, actually. for many myriad reasons, like the main reason really is that the West had to negotiate, the Westerns had to negotiate with incumbent institutions. So you can't just pay for everything on your phone because banks exist, right? If you go to China and you hang out with WeChat, they didn't have to negotiate with anybody to push this forward. Centralized capitalism... very, very efficient system. And so if you bring this down to music as being, if we can all maybe, part of the reason we're here is that we place some faith in music as being a kind of petri dish or prototyping environment to think about how we want to be, right? Then that issue comes up of are we complacently consuming something? to pass time because our 20s aren't what we were told our 20s would be? And we're also being told that this is a manifestation of our individuality and our political beliefs and all this kind of stuff. Or are we saying, wait a second, what kind of... or structures do we want to put into place to establish a very, very concrete set of demands that can allow for us to develop equity in the world and push that message. And you can still do that in parts of the world, but I don't see that necessarily being evoked much in these conversations. And generally speaking, most people want to go out, listen to techno, hook up, whatever. go back to work, get a promotion, if they have a job. So there isn't really a conflict there to reconcile, I don't think. I mean, you asked, for example, when I tried to inject counterculture, counterculture, it's like, we're people of ideology, we're dreamers. You very agnostically said, what will I be countering? So that would be maybe a question to you, if you would perceive yourself as somebody, and I perceive your art as counter-cultural in a very meta way sometimes. I don't want to ask a question about your values, I'm not going to do that. But in the example of China, for example. Since there is no platinum, there are no platinum. We got in with Boiler Room. We subverted. We were the first... company that managed to send out of the great firewall of China. You know, because I found a media company that had service in San Antonio that was half government owned, found, you know, the loopholes within that company. How could basically send a bunch of Chinese kids celebrating music and values that are completely against what the majority of Chinese society accepts as decent and show that to the world and also to, at the first show, five and a half million Chinese viewers, which gave a lot of those artists the first national exposure they have ever had. because there's no SoundCloud, because SoundCloud was forbidden, because the Uyghur, what's the English word for the Uyghur minority? Is it Uyghur? Because the Uyghur minority was using, you know, SoundCloud for their kind of religious podcast, so no SoundCloud for the Chinese audience, you know, and then in the end, you know, what ultimately, you know, what you counter. is that and ultimately you maintain an element of subversion. I mean in China it's particularly quite real because there is not much room to breathe for a lot of those kids. And I think that's a very compelling argument. I think that's a compelling argument for existence is saying that counterculture is actually something that happens elsewhere. And I do think that that's to a degree true. So I support that. You looked like you had something to say. This discussion just reminded me of this book I read a few years ago. I think the title was Rebel Cells. And it basically argued how rebellious being a rebel or rebellious counterculture. became the tool of marketing over the years. And I think Ian Rogers is a prime example because he comes from, I think he was, I read his interview a while ago and he was basically supporting Beastie Boys, you know, build their website. helped them publish Grand Royal. You know, he was like the very key individual in the emergence of Beastie Boys, whom at the time was seen as, you know, subculture heroes. And they were skaters, they were, you know, rebellious, and everybody loved them. And over time, this skate culture, so brands like Vans or Converse, whatever, they started using, for example, on the cover of this book, it had the portrait of Che Guevara. Having Che Guevara or Bob Marley became such a popular thing and everybody wanted to be rebellious and everybody wanted to be alternative. And I think it... you know it relates to your argument of authenticity or how radical you can be because you know being a fan of skater culture or being a techno raver is no longer anything alternative like everybody does that And I think it's important to acknowledge that we live in the era that being alternative is actually mainstream. Or in the absence of a clear-cut mainstream, it's unclear what it means to be alternative. I guess I'm sort of interested in... homing in on whatever flaws there might be in this current arrangement because basically the general consensus seems to be broadly quite positive um i'm curious do we think that is anyone uh unfairly left out in this situation or is are there voices that aren't being given the same platform as others? Or are there threats to legitimate forms of art that there wouldn't have been in the previous paradigm? Matt, you mentioned something earlier in passing I didn't quite catch about collectivism, I think, or group equity. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, well, no, I mean, the hippies created the internet as we know it, right? I mean, there's good books. There's good books about how that particular ideology was vulnerable to extreme capitalism. Yeah, I... I think my bigger point about this, I think market capitalism generally is primed for dominion. It's primed for monopoly. We've seen that with the web, right? Things, when you allow people to beautiful little flowers to go out and express themselves, ultimately they coalesce into something that can be purchased by a bigger. flower, right? That's kind of how market capitalism seems to have worked. I was talking to someone about Zalando earlier and this kind of greater dominion scenario where there's this core tension between what you're sold as individualism as being the ability to branch out for yourself and then what you see over time is that rampant individualism leads to these clusters and monopolies. And so... If you were to connect this to greater... On a political level, there's more stakes for me when it comes to... the ownership of the internet than there is to club music particularly. It's important to always establish that too, of like not conflating the two, like one is more grave than the other. Democracy is more grave than clubbing, right? But you do see that market capitalism and democracy is also a little bit at odds, right? And you can see this kind of more accelerated in the United States where they have more of a free market capitalist system. and you see the more that you protect the interests of individuals or companies as individuals to express themselves, over time that starts to butt up against the freedom of information, the accuracy of information, the ability for people to vote with clear mind. And so if you were to connect it to some kind of a political project, the thing that I'm particularly interested in is in equity. And this doesn't necessarily have to be in a hippie way. I just simply like the idea. I see resilient, very important institutions, take a Berghain, for example, and their model is really quite simple, which is we're going to own the space and we're going to determine what happens in it. And I think that... I love the idea of there being a hundred spaces, also for aesthetic reasons, that would make that step. What I'm particularly, because the aesthetic reasons is also, you know, Yuko said it earlier, but, you know, if you look back to the golden era, the Halsondes or whatever, of independent music, there was a lot of money to come into fund these little factions, right? So you had Warp 4 AD, there's a million you can talk about. And using that cash, they got to, over time, like, establish a fairly distinctive ideology, right? They supported certain things over others, and over time, that clustered into something that you would consider to be of aesthetic importance, because you got to see an idea mature. over time because it had the confidence of his convictions in the sense because it wasn't dependent on saying, oh yeah, I'll take that gig, I'll do this. There's something good about that. And what I'm particularly interested in now, I've done some work in the kind of crypto decentralized internet for a number of years now, is... how much easier it is, and there's still legal issues that need to be finangled. There's actually a bunch of work happening in Berlin around this. How much easier it is to contemplate a scenario where a group of people who were all in cahoots over a particular ideology might be able to share equity over... virtual physical space. And that group of people, the co-op system exists here and is actually fairly mature here. There's people I know here who know more about this than I do. But I'm particularly interested in that being decentralized beyond location. So this idea of saying people aren't willing to pay for music, I've kind of given up on that. Honestly, I've been dragged into conversations because I know a lot about it. I don't care about selling music. That has never been something that I'm particularly fetishistic of. But I do care about supporting resilient organizations. And I do wonder if with new frameworks in place to... to distribute equity and give people a different logic by which they can participate and support culture, I do wonder what could be done to create a few resilient organizations that might playfully antagonize the dominion of the RBMAs and the boiler rooms. And as I say, I'm on... I'm actually far less angry about that than many people because I don't see there being inconsistency there. And I think they do about as good a job as they could do in those circumstances. I think they do enforce and make sure a line isn't crossed. They do support weirdos that wouldn't be supported otherwise. But in the spirit of agency... of this idea of saying, no, I actually quite like the idea of coming up with something with a group of people and having control over it and making it weather resistant. I think there's more that could be done. I wanted to make a comment about your question. I've been thinking about it. What the danger could be in the current arrangement or the landscape? things and this is something I've been feeling working as a booking agent recently and related to what I've said you know everyone wants to be alternative. Everyone wants to find their own niche. And because of that, I think a lot of the platforms or the curators tend to jump on something new and maybe something extreme. And as a result of that, I see a lot of artists, you know, get like instant hype for maybe a year and then just completely forgotten the next year. And I feel like it's possible that this climate of... corporate sponsorship is accelerating this trend or changing of the trend much faster than it has been so that a lot of the artists who are, you know, who have probably been around for a long time and get this instant hype. and then completely forgotten and it's very difficult for them to come back and Yeah, I know a lot of artists like that and I don't know how we could help them in the current. Well, I mean, it's about sharing knowledge. This is, for example, as I referred to the Berlin Music Commission panel that we've had, there was actually a more hands-on panel with artists. providing strategies, how to get involved, how to protect and basically understand your own interests and how to engage. It's a learning process because ultimately there is a lot to be discussed about possible futures, but at the moment... It is the reality that there's very few revenue streams for a lot of artists. They have to find new revenue streams. But a lot of artists are not very knowledgeable about how to play that. So actually it would be the role of those knowledgeable to... There's no 2018 type of guidebook of how to work with brands if you are a musician. Nobody has written such a thing. We discussed knowledge database, but unfortunately we couldn't find the funding for it. But this is actually a reality that there are strategies. It is a reality. You can provide artists with knowledge, know-how and strategies how to protect themselves. Utilize it for growth so you don't burn out. By the way, I can tell you, I get a lot of agencies and brands pitching me, asking me, and I can tell you the moment. fact magazine set goes up within the next two weeks I will get you know a request and strangely enough this really before then obscure artists all of a sudden front left and center for a really basic marketing agent "Yeah, this is somebody's really cool. We really want them!" It's like, yeah, because your intern, you know, listens to Fact magazine and this is how you get your know-how. And this creates very unhealthy dynamics, which you said. And we can actually do a lot to protect the music community against it if we kind of share that knowledge. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen. too often. Not at all, really. And I think Eucharist is a really good point. And I feel for this, because I say this, I mean, Holland and I say this sometimes, I feel like, you know, having like Mission Impossible or something, there's a door closing. and you slide under the door just at the end. I feel like when we caught a bit of a break with the music, we just literally slid under that door. I have two big concerns about this kind of turnover. One big concern is it basically turns into a monarchy. If you were famous in the 90s, you'll be the most famous person until you decide to quit, right? Because you have this long tail effect of like you're... everybody whatever right the the second part is there's again a core conflict and a contradiction where on on the one hand we talk about individualism everyone has an instagram account you're you're out there to define yourself from everybody else who happens to have ableton right let's be real right i mean i mean because like and there's crazy interesting subcultures within edm like whole other like bass music communities of you know of really weird, interesting things happening around the creation of music that the virtue is not at all to distinguish yourself. The virtue is to meet an arbitrary level that can help you access something else, right? So sharing production packs, sharing production tools. There's something quite beautiful about it and like non-proprietary. But on the other side, there's this odd kind of shift of emphasis from doing something that perhaps is not common to... having a clear guideline, ambiently kind of derived from just participating in culture, of exactly what you need to do to get here and there, right? And so I see a weird conflict where, you know, and perhaps now I'm old, I mean, perhaps this is like an antiquated way of looking at things, but I see the most professional 18-year-olds, period, right? who, having grown up in this, and I teach a lot of them actually, super smart, super switched on, not stupid people in the slightest, very aware. I know what to wear, I know who to talk to, I know where to turn up. And again, maybe I was an idiot, but I certainly wasn't like that at that period of time, and I'm fucking grateful for it. because in that, the peculiarities that led to things that I think are particularly interesting about the work that we do were incubated in that environment of people not being like, hey, you're cool. Similarly, you see a trend of people, and I say this with DJing because I give DJs hell. I mean, there's good DJs, whatever, but like... this idea of immediately zeroing in on that being the path, right? Where the music itself is now pretty much, and this is economically derived, this is the way the economics of music history went. The music itself lost value. The value is you turning up. It's your specialness. If you're a bit taller than the next person, you'll win, right? Of immediately of kind of creating music simply as a means of accessing opportunities that have all kinds of other benefits. And I think that in that you lose a bit of a thread of, you know, the value of music as ultimately kind of the genesis of our culture and language. the idea of music as an evolutionary tool, the idea of music changing and challenging things, you lose a little bit of that. Because in a sense, there's a lot... And again, it comes back down to this idea of the avant-garde, of this being this kind of fixed thing. It's a fixed sequence of things that you can do in order to qualify yourself as an artist of note. And I do worry about that. I don't worry about them because most of these people are super switched on, very savvy, know exactly what they're doing. But I worry more about the cultural or aesthetic fallout of that. Are we just permanently in this zombified 90s state? in which the radical artists sound like Ortega or FX Twin and the ones that make connections with people make house music. These forums just become very, very codified and solidified also by the monarchy of these characters who are basically going to be headlining festivals till the day they die because the long tail of the internet led to a scenario in which... nobody else can sell as many tickets as them. So even the whole festival structure, most of the things we understand to constitute the music industry as we know it, is wholly dependent on this kind of, you know, there being someone at the top. And yeah, anyway, so there's all these kind of issues. And not to also forget about this, but we live in a culture of very, very depressed people who don't feel... necessarily like they do have a sense of purchase on their future and I think those two things are coupled. Not to say that anyone has kind of malevolent intentions but if you have a source of money and there's a kid out there who's talented who wants to access that money they might communicate that they're happier with circumstances than they actually are. You know, so that's another kind of meta responsibility of everybody being like, are we providing opportunities for them to do what they want? Or are we providing opportunities for them to do what we think they want? You know, and that's where the avant-garde line stands. Yeah, to pick up on this avant-garde thing. You mentioned a few times the idea of the avant-garde as a fixed thing that at this point that term could describe. legacy acts like Autechre or something. Someone mentioned something about if a shoe brand is interested in what you're doing, how radical is it really? Is there a musical movement that is genuinely avant-garde in the sense that it's too new, too hard to understand to fit into this world? Is that possible? Or if there was, you know, the next iteration of young Autechre, would Ray-Ban be happy to throw them, you know, on Boiler Room? Or would you guys, would Ray-Ban be happy to... have their logo in the background on boiler room or basically my question is is anything too too advanced too new too weird for um brands today i think that has less to do with the brands but you said you know of the sequence of things that one has to go through to become an accomplished um artist is this basically you know what you decide I can say, so basically, you know, you can actually create art, you can create culture and keep the brands out if what you expect from creating art is not connected to money. Look, for example, at the free techno scene in France. Festivals, there's like sound systems, 10,000 people. People writing music, everything wonderful. There's no brands, there's no money, nothing. Everybody's still happy nonetheless because they have decided that this is the way they want to live, create culture, and they create their environment and also their life accordingly. to that because this is how culture creation is perceived. Like Psytrance, the other day it was the first time in years again at a big Psytrance event. And just the way this scene is structured, not like the commercial tail end, like infected mushrooms, we're talking about what do they call it now? High tech. High tech is the new thing in Psytrance. It's very wonderful. It's very radical. It's completely not accessible, I think, to brands. Also because the people don't really perceive the community and what they live and how they create music and what they create this music for as applicable or conclusive compliant or compatible with that, you know. So we're discussing actually something where everybody has decided, well, I need to make music as a DJ. I need to make money with this, you know. I need to, you know, tick those boxes, you know. I need to be on this platform. I need to play this festival. It's a choice, you know. We're discussing a system that we've opted into knowingly and now we have... to find a way how to deal with it. You could as well opt out. And there's plenty examples of musicians who created magnificent pieces of work would have never spoken to anyone about it. But they were very happy and content with the fact that they created the music because it happened on the terms they agreed with themselves on creating this music or this art or the literature or so forth and so on. So, it's literally what is the sequence of things that you agreed for yourself on. We're discussing at the moment a very particular sequence of things, which is market capitalism and how do we survive within that. We could also, and I think about Bank as a space that tries to navigate that in a very unique way, how you can actually try to survive outside of that in a utopian type of way. But we should also not... glorify the virtue of the artist. Oh my god, they're struggling. Many, at least in Central Europe, have decided to live a certain way with certain goals. there's a lot of opportunity to live in a different way. For example, look at how a lot of art was created in the Soviet Union. You worked as an engineer in a missile factory from Monday 8 a.m. to Friday 10 p.m. And then on the weekend you wrote... songs, you know, and this was the reality, you know, there was no money in it, it was just, you know, whatever you did with your free time, so we should also not over-glorify a few things that we talk about right now, because ultimately, these decisions that I made consciously, I made the conscious decision, you know, to play this game, because I want to create a platform that... that creates visibility for people who don't have a platform yet, but nonetheless I have to play that game in the rules that are laid out of me, you know, and also accept, you know, the consequences of that. But I don't really have to, you know. I could also run a stream out of my living room that nobody fucking cares about, but at least my friends that I like play it, and then that's... That's the goal that I set myself. So we should not over-glorify a lot of those processes. That's what I'm trying to say. And go to more psytrance parties, as I found out two weeks ago. I guess what I'm wondering is, if you take hip-hop in the 80s, there was a period of time when hip-hop had fans, had essential artists, was popular. the mainstream as it was then wasn't ready for it. It was too threatening to the audience of MTV, too threatening for brands to get on board with. Would that happen now if there was some modern iteration of hip hop? would there be a quicker learning curve? Would anyone feel, would people still think like, ooh, that's too dicey? Or is the difference that today they would have gotten behind it straight away just because they could sense that it was vital? There's, you know, there's, I know that you may say a thing that is a thousand times smarter than me, but we're lost. Matt, like whenever I talk to you, a month worth of thoughts come out of that. You know, somebody who I really, really admire and I think that shows how strong and how powerful we actually, you know, positions of, counterculture is not the right word, but you know, how strong one can build. a platform of agencies, Monroe Bergdorf, for example, the way she got into, as a black trans woman, she got into a very commercial space, but how she took an incredibly, incredibly hard, radical, and very, very sincere position about what her interests are, what the interests of her community are. how she stands in for that, and how she made brands long for that, you know, to be part of that conversation, to amplify that, you know, to adhere to her terms, changed for many people their situation for the better, you know. It's like, she is, for example, an example of somebody who I tremendously respect, how she basically alone managed to change the whole conversation around, around, around, I think. the rights of trans women, their visibility and also their voice. And she did it, playing that particular game, but nonetheless also creating in a very smart way, just like the kids that you said, knowing how this works, how this media landscape works, but still had her interests in her mind and protected them and utilized the platforms that are there. what I'm identifying with her is L'Oreal is like, yeah, we can get on board with this. And then she said basically that all white people are complicit in racism. And they're like, whoa, that was way more than we bargained for. Never mind. So to me, that sort of is, but maybe it's different now. We're looking at the fallout from that, you know, what's happened, where she's now, you know, where she's present, the kind of fashion and and she became also advertising persona but also a political activist, you know, because there was a brand that was like, didn't understand what they, what, they didn't understand what they were, you know, getting into because they saw only in the surface, you know. Oh yeah, that is, that is, that's like what people like right now, right? Diversity, you know. Let's throw also female DJ collective into that and then we're fine, right? No, but that's not how it fucking works and people are luckily much smarter than that. And now the conversation has changed, you know, there's way more awareness for that. There's... the world became a slightly better place because of that. To answer your question of do I think there's things that people aren't touching, yes. I mean, I think one awful way in which this has gone, in a sense, is the rise of... the rise of online fascism spawned from 4chan. I mean, that is one of the defining subcultures of our time. Let's not be like, let's not be. Unfortunately. Unfortunately. Yeah. But I mean, Wait until the brands get on that. Yeah, but it meets all of the criteria, and that is something that... I mean, I'm sure there are people trying desperately to capitalize on that, but that's a real... But then on more positive ends, using similar tools, the point is that people... People who feel disenfranchised in some way, particularly young people, will find ways. People are very pragmatic. They will find ways. Again, the reason why I keep coming back to... I'm a lefty materialist, like, for my sins. I keep coming back to the politic of space, right? The scenario you have now is that you have many, many people developing what could be understood to be ideologically driven. utopian or dystopian in that particular circumstance communities online. The challenge is that's the only space that they have dominion over. Online space is virtually infinite. And so part of the reason I like the idea of emphasizing congregation and being in a room with somebody is that then you actually have equity in the world. Then people actually give a shit. Then you actually have a say. If you sit on a piece of land, sad to say it, this is the world we live in, then you have a horse in the race. If you don't, you're kind of a serf. surf within this new economy. And so I'm particularly interested in this idea of saying, well, you know, what would it look like to see spaces that were manifesting the different potentials of interactions or the different kind of reward mechanisms or incentive mechanisms or different forms of creativity that are being explored online. But you actually own a space and you can see them manifest in the way in which people go out. And so, for example, myself and a group of people were jokingly talking about crypto raves. Yeah, which was kind of like a dinner table conversation that turned into a real thing. But the whole idea there, the initial kind of manifestations of that were super easy. You're just like, okay, let's have a party and let's have people mine their tickets. And then the more work they do, the more... tickets they get and it's all totally anonymous and then you turn up and you assume a character and so you know the whole idea is to keep it somewhat cryptographic and so nobody you know you aren't exposing your identity in those environments that was like one like super cute easy way to do it but where it gets really really interesting is the idea of again on protocols this idea of saying How would you imbue a ideological system into the structure of how we go out? What is the user experience, so to say, of clubbing? Because people pretty much congregate in exactly the same way as they did for a really long time. And now you have bigger screens and there's graphics in the background. But generally speaking... it kind of looks the same. And so the idea of kind of manifesting a different way of interacting with one another, a different way to exchange value, and a way to also encode aesthetics into the way in which places work and the way in which things work feels like a new frontier for me. And I think part of that can also be spawned from the fact, I mean, this is Holly's point, but... but something we thought about a lot around Platform Era was, you know, there's also kind of like a poverty of the gesture, right? Like, we've got to a point where we discovered, lo and behold, loads of people are talented, right? Like, people just didn't have the tools or the time in the past to share that, but loads of people can make decent music or take a decent picture, particularly if you... democratize those tools right so you kind of have this like there's kind of like a an abundance of stuff um that has the sad this this kind of the the sad uh um the sad kind of counter uh effect of it just becoming kind of bland you know you're like everyone can make decent trap music now it's kind of a folk music of its time techno is kind of a folk music so everyone can make it but do we value any one of these people any more than the next person to support them for a career of experimentation? Probably not, because why would, you know, I got a hundred decent techno mixes today and fucking perennial mixes. But so in that circumstance, like... The point being, the gesture for a particular period of time of rampant individualism in subcultures was, I'm going to go and be Hendrix mutating the American national anthem in protest to this thing, and all the press is going to be looking at Woodstock or whatever festival it was because there was a centralised music industry and there was a centralised dominion over people's attention. And so that... That gesture went really, really far and resonated really, really far. And now we're in a weird scenario where it's kind of like, you know, that tradition, what would the contemporary equivalent of that be? And Holly's argument, which I think is fairly sound, is, you know, we live in a time now where... You could make tracks on your computer, by all means, if it's therapeutic or if you get pleasure from it and if other people get pleasure from it, absolutely. But if you have genuinely transgressive aspirations with this, you can also do lots of other stuff with that machine. And in fact, the material impact of people navigating and mastering a laptop, particularly a laptop, connected to all the computers in the world in order to manifest a particular vision, whether it be a good one or a bad one, kind of has a more powerful recent track record than the idea of someone making a protest song, right? And so, you know, a protest song, there was a period of time in which that had this kind of great potential by a very select group of people, handpicked by a very, very kind of... central authority and now you have a bit of a crisis of a bit of a crisis of narrative because we still talk about these things when ultimately really the you know in terms of like social social issues or you know things that actually do cause a huge fuss you know, my like order of operations pretty much is like the hacker community is almost always at the top. Like whatever they're dealing with in five years time, everyone else will be talking about. You just have to kind of sneak it out. The gaming community, which is the ascendant moneyed industry, right? The gaming, like the game industry, whether it's, the financial crisis. There's a lot of money and tension, so you have things like Gamergate and all these kind of issues that were forebears for other greater issues that have happened through culture. And music finds itself, you know, once being this kind of source where people at the dinner table would talk about the record and the gesture that Janet Jackson made. This kind of stuff almost relegated now to a less kind of powerful political device. But I don't think that necessarily need be the case because the one thing that music has really going for it and why I keep going back to it is congregation. And that as a political actor, as a space of potential. has the jump on all these other atomized kind of fields like gaming or whatever. So that's, I'll leave it there. I was, to answer your original question, I think, I can't really imagine anything that can escape the reach of brands. how new or revolutionary their expression is. Because as long as it's considered cool, there's a value to it. And this is what the brands want to benefit from. I was also going to say the only exception I can think of is when something is... obviously politically incorrect. That's what any company's corporations want to distance themselves from. And I think we've seen the example of Red Bull, for example, and I was thinking of Raider Radio with the scandal, how it... You could see that a brand, no matter how big it seems, is actually quite fragile to this kind of scandal. And if you associate yourself with one brand or... two brands too much then if the brand goes down this could also bring you down as your artist image because of the affiliation and maybe that's something that artists need to be a little bit conscious about when they you know associate themselves with brands
