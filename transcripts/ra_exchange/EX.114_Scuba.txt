you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Paul Rose records under the names Scuba and SCB. He also runs the record label Hot Flush, an imprint that most RA readers will no doubt be familiar with. Rose was raised in London, and the city's varied musical influences is what still drives the label today, even though it was officially birthed during his stay in Bristol for university. Currently residing in Berlin, he said of his substance nights at Berghain that he tried to bring the UK capital to Germany. His music, on the other hand, has been named in recent years at the biggest audience possible. His latest album, Personality, is full of enormous hooks and anthems for the big room. A bright sound seemingly at odds with his often acerbic persona. The last time we talked to you, you spoke about your goal the past few years has been to have an identity with your music. Right. Okay. And I'm really interested in what you think that identity has been because you have all these different names and you have all these different things that you're doing. What unifies, at least, scuba music? It's funny you say that because I think probably I've probably got less of an identity now than I ever have done musically. I was thinking about it actually on the way over here. I was thinking about the album, you know, the way it's been received and how I've obviously changed, obviously having come out of doing the dub set thing and, you know, the couple of singles that came out sort of between Triangulation and Personality that were, you know, quite housey. And then obviously, personality isn't a house album at all. So, and I don't really play, I mean, I suppose as a DJ, I'm pretty straight up house and techno these days, but I definitely don't, you know, like I said, the album isn't restricted to that kind of stuff at all. So yeah, I don't really know what my entity is. I think it's kind of, I've been slightly... One of the things you said though in the interview is that even though it wasn't 4/4, you looked back to 80s, 90s dance music that kind of had that feel and that vibe. Yeah, I mean in terms of like, if you look at influences, then yeah, there's quite a lot of consistency. And I suppose that... you know i can look at you know the way i went about you know thinking about the music but i'm i guess you know if you're going to have an identity like people need to know you know what it is like it helps if that it comes from you know the outside as well as you know the inside if you see what i mean um and yeah i don't know what people really think of me now do you know i mean because i still get i mean i played on uh Saturday with Scream and One Man and Jackmaster. And it's probably fair to say that, you know, the music these kind of DJs are playing has kind of converged towards a more kind of... house and you know not so much techno but you know kind of certainly more kind of straight up clubby four four thing but it's it's very different really from you know playing bird kind on a sunday night you know so um we just wanted the next day and yeah so i don't know i mean i'm i've kind of do you like it do you like being you know constantly sort of put in these positions where you're almost able to do whatever you want well i mean on the one hand it does sort of give you a bit of freedom because you're not restricted to one audience which i suppose is okay but then in a sense you know it certainly has a has a negative as well because you know because people don't really know what to expect from you like it's almost like there's always going to be a section of the audience that doesn't like it you know so It's really difficult trying to unify. I mean, as a DJ, I mean, kind of, you know, when you're playing in a kind of larger room, it's really difficult to kind of get that kind of unified thing in the crowd that you see with headline DJs who have got very distinct sounds. Everyone who's come to see them knows what they're going to get. It's kind of a challenge in that respect. because really when you're playing in big rooms that's what that's the reaction you want to get somehow but when people aren't really sure whether you're going to be playing dubstep even though i haven't played dubstep a year there's still a section of the crowd that's probably half expect something like that um Yeah, it's difficult to achieve that. You're kind of at this really interesting moment where you're starting to play these big rooms, but you're not necessarily always the headliner in those big rooms. But obviously you're headlining these smaller club shows all the time and you're almost too big for that. Yeah. It's kind of, yeah, I mean, you're right. It's a kind of bit of a crossroads, I think, that I've come to at this stage. And, you know, I think, I guess the kind of search for identity is, there is a kind of counterpoint to that with, you know, not wanting to stay doing one thing. And that's something that I've really kind of always felt. since I started DJing not even since I was producing I'm going back to you know playing drum and bass even after I played drum and bass for a couple years when I was sort of 18 19 I was like okay I need to go and do something else now and really that's really carried on and it comes back to the point of like how do you create an identity if every two years you're doing something completely different So, yeah, I don't know. I mean, I don't really know how it's going to, you know, develop over the next couple of years, really. I mean, obviously the trap a lot of DJs fall into and a lot of producers fall into, I suppose, is when you start playing in big rooms, you kind of adapt your music accordingly. And I've always been really, I mean, you know, just from... very early days of playing and you know even when you start playing out regularly and you're used to making music in your bedroom you've got bookings because you're making this kind of esoteric music and suddenly you get put in a position where you have to play music that make people dance ever since you know five or six years ago when I was in that position I've really tried to not think about it in those terms too much but the bigger the room the more pressure you have to get people to dance so and it's one of those things where you make a track like adrenaline which you feel like is just what you want to make and then it you know to this side of things. Suddenly people want more adrenaline. Yeah. That's it, exactly. I don't know. I mean, you can't force these things, I suppose. And I'm never really the kind of person, I can't just, I'm not one of these producers who can just, you know, sit down and just make a huge track. Do you know what I mean? It takes me months of kind of convoluted process to get to the stage where like anything. where things develop really every time i've heard seen you describe your production process the word torturous is used yeah i mean it's it's difficult it really is i'm not saying that i don't enjoy all of it i mean there's certainly you know the most pleasure i get from any aspect of what i do is, you know, the day when you come out of the studio thinking you've had a really good session. I mean, it almost doesn't matter what you've made. I mean, half the time, I think, you know, a lot of producers will probably identify with this. Half the time when you think something's great, the next day it's really not at all. But that doesn't even really matter. Like getting that sort of satisfaction when you come out. out of the studio thinking, wow, that was a really great day. You know, that's, you know, what I, you know, like the most really about the whole thing. I get more of a kick out of that definitely than playing in front of lots of people. For sure. But then, like I say, it is a process and there's bad sides to the process. Downsides. Dark days. Well, come on now. What are the bad sides? I mean, name bouncing tracks for hours on end. Oh, no, I don't even mean that, really. I mean, obviously, that's just boring. I go through long periods where I just think everything I'm doing is terrible. and I have it with gigs as well I mean I've had gigs recently where I've just thought I shouldn't be doing this do you know what I mean I should just give up and do something else and certainly when I was making the album there were you know there were it took a while you know it was like a good 10 months of you know sitting in there day in day out and yeah I had you know there were yeah weeks on end where it's just like this is not this is not working it's not it's not gonna happen Did you know what you wanted, though, out of the album? I mean, was it... Well, that's part of the problem, and that's what I mean when I say that, you know, I have to go through, you know, quite a long period to get to, you know, something like, I don't know, what the previous equivalent of Adrenaline was, but, like, you know, the tracks I was really happy with on Personality, for example. or actually Hard Boiled off the first album. I remember when I made that and thought, wow, this is what I've been trying to do for the last year, you know? And the same with probably, you know, something like Before off Triangulation. when it finally works and, you know, got 80 odd attempts at doing not something similar, but like, you know, what you've had to go through to get to that stage. Yeah. I mean, I think with it now, because I've done it, you know, I've done that whole album processing. I've done it three times. I kind of, I'm kind of resigned to it now. I'm resigned. to the intense frustration and mental anguish. And it's just something you have to kind of ride out and hopefully get to the good part eventually. But the good part makes it all right. It makes it worthwhile. And yeah, I don't know. I mean, I hope the next album isn't going to be quite so bad or not quite so long anyway. what's really been the killer in all three records. It's just taken so long to do it. Have you already started putting stuff together? Or are you just too busy? Not really. I mean, I've started thinking about it. And I've got things that I've, yeah, there's some ideas. There was a lot of it. I mean, because just there was so much material that was discarded. Remember you said 60 or 70 tracks. Yeah, and a reasonable proportion of that I didn't discard because I didn't think it was good enough. I discarded because it didn't eventually fit with the sound of the album. So I've been going back to things and... having a little bit of a play around and stuff again. But I really don't know what it's going to sound like at all. It definitely won't sound anything like personality. Right now you're working on your live set, I assume. Yeah, yeah, I am at the moment, which has meant a lot of revisiting of old stuff. What have you been surprised by? in listening to some of that old stuff. I don't know if it's a surprise, but, um, like how bad the early stuff was technically. Um, yeah. Did you not have monitors or? No, I've used the same pair of monitors for the last, uh, five years actually. I'm just too scared to change them. It's more, I mean, I don't know, I'm probably being a little bit harsh on myself, but, you know, I think with anything, like, the more you do it, do something well, hopefully, the better you get at it. Obviously, it doesn't always work like that, but, and you always, I think as an artist, you always tend to think that your new stuff is better than your old stuff. I mean, you'd be in a bit of a difficult position if you didn't think that. So, yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'm not kind of doing my old stuff down. I think musically I really like a lot of it. And it's been really difficult actually when I've been thinking about getting an hour's worth of material out of... God knows how many tracks there are. There's a lot of stuff I would really like to play and I'm not going to be able to. And I'm kind of conscious of the fact that there's going to be people who are going to want to hear much more of the old stuff than I'm going to play. But then it's one of those ones that you've just got to make something coherent and there's no point trying to shoehorn stuff in that isn't going to fit. How are you grouping it? Is it like 120 all the way through? No, there's a few tempo shifts. But I'm just trying to make it kind of stylistically coherent, really. But also, I mean, you know, like I say, there's tempo shifts, but... But one of the things that I want it to be is danceable. I want it to work in a kind of club setting because the majority of shows that we're going to be doing with it are going to be club shows. So there's no point in having a kind of 15-minute extended version of So You Think You're Special with a five-minute... beatless part in the middle, as much as I'd like to do that. I remember seeing Rekondite play at Panorama Bar live, and it was a brave decision on his part to, you know, do house for a while and then just sort of be like, okay, now we're going to do some down-tempo hip-hop for like 10 to 15 minutes. Yeah, and I think that was the first time he'd ever played out in a club as well. Yeah. Which may explain that decision. Well, and you also played at Burgheim downstairs once live. I did, yeah. What did you learn from that? Well, when I say that I want the new show to be, you know, as club-friendly as possible, that was... A slight result of that. But I don't know. I mean, it's obviously very different to approaching a DJ set. And like I say, you have to try and, you know, represent yourself as an artist to, you know, as full a degree as possible. but while recognizing the surroundings that you're in as well. When you're making music that is essentially made to be played by a DJ, differentiating is in itself a problem, potentially. And you've got to think about what hopefully an interesting approach is to presenting it. I think, I don't know. I mean, there's, and visually is another, you know, can of worms. Right, exactly. And, you know, it's obviously very difficult, you know, to make one bloke standing on stage doing stuff with, you know, electronic machines visually interesting. And, you know, the obvious answer to that is to throw a load of money at it. which is um it's sort of becoming a i suppose a little bit of a cliche but i think there's you know what else are you going to do you know i mean there's i think if you have a interesting visual concept which hopefully we do for the new show, I think that there's still a lot that you can do with it. And I think that if you do it, like I said, in an interesting way, it can add a lot to the music as well. I mean, that's the whole point of playing live, is that it's the music, but it's got something else about it, you know? And it's the first time I've done anything visual, this show and the subsequent shows. So it's going to be, well, the whole thing has been quite a steep learning curve for me as well. Who are you working with for it? With Immersive, who've done lots of different stuff, including some stuff on the Olympics opening ceremony, which is... yeah i think quite a lot of work for them yeah i know that trying to get your project uh pushed ahead yeah it's a little bit tough in that scenario But we kind of worked on the concept together with them. What was your, in the beginning, you know, were you like, I want this or I don't want this? More, yeah, it was much more of a, much more of the latter. There's, you know, so much has been done with the kind of visual mapping stuff. and just kind of traditional kind of you know projections and vjing it's just like that's yeah it's almost a bit pointless i think doing that stuff now you know because it's been done so well by so many different people um with much much bigger budgets than i'm gonna have so tell me about the label these days it seems like hopefully finally People don't think of as a dubstep label at all in any context anymore. Maybe. Well, you'd certainly hope not. But it's been a long time that I've been saying that for. So, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I think if you wanted to, you know, if you wanted to stereotype us and put us in a box, you'd have to say we're a house label these days. But, you know, there's... A house label that's releasing a techno album in a couple of months. Right, yeah, exactly. And then some esoteric down-tempo EP just for that as well. So, I mean, I don't know. I mean... It's really what I kind of wanted it to be. But it has been that for a while, to be honest. It's like we've been putting out all kinds of different stuff. You wanted it that way from the beginning, I assume. But when do you feel like you actually got there? When do you feel like you... Was there a release or a year that you felt like, okay, this is closer? Yeah, I think... uh sort of between sort of two between 2008 and 2010 it kind of gradually sort of became what I wanted it to be well I mean certainly much closer to what I wanted it to be than you know it had been previous to that I mean as I think, I don't know, it's really difficult to... It's obviously a combination of things. Yeah, I mean, I think that probably I felt more confident in myself, you know, in terms of... how things were going to be reacted I think since I moved over to Berlin in 2007 and that basically putting myself giving that distance between myself and what the scene I had been you know really so closely intertwined with and identified with I think gave me a lot of I suppose confidence was part of it, but just to, you know, it gave me a bit of perspective, I suppose. And just kind of a feeling of freedom. which I didn't really have before, being in the kind of early dub set thing, which was such an insular group. It was such a, yeah, it was so closed, partly because the scene was so small, just in terms of audience. And I think, you know, moving and kind of getting out of that, those, you know, breaking out those constraints. Yeah, just kind of, I guess I started to think bigger. and just, you know, give myself, like I say, give myself a bit more freedom in terms of like, you know, the A&R stuff. I think, you know, the whole Mount Kimby project was really important in terms of if you wanted to pinpoint, you know, a set of release or a set of string of releases. I think another really important... point was putting out the remixes to my first album getting people like surgeon and marcel detman uh involved which you know was a something completely different to what we'd done previously and i think it was just a bit of a statement and it's one that people took notice of do you know what i mean um When you asked them, was it immediately like, yes, like I've been waiting to remix something that's not... Do you even remember? Surgeon had been following the label for a while. I would have expected that. I remember being very, very happy to learn of that because I was buying his stuff in 95 sort of thing. I've been a massive fan of his for ages and ages before I even plucked up the courage to ask him. Marcel was a little bit different because we'd done a release... been on opposite sides of a release on concert music a year or so before that so I kind of knew him a bit anyway I thought he'd be up for it but it was just um yeah I wanted to do something something different and just you know basically say to everyone in London that I'm not part of that anymore you know look I'm doing this stuff see you later and I think it probably worked in that respect But yeah, but the Mount Kimi thing was a bit different because it obviously, because it was so successful and, you know. Were you surprised at how successful it got? I mean, I was. Yeah, I was amazed. I mean, I've, you know, I'm on record as saying this lots of times before, but, you know, the first demo they sent me was two minutes of silence and then a snare drum for 30 seconds and then another two minutes of silence. And that's a slight exaggeration to how it was, but it wasn't far off that. So to go from that and to going, you know, to what they... Have you ever asked them why they sent it to you in the first place? What did they hear in hot flush that they thought, whew, that's a label we could be on? Yeah, they haven't actually had that conversation with them, to be honest. I think it was that demo was just Dom. It was before they'd started working together. see where your interest in anything that sounds weird and slightly different like yeah i mean i was like that was a great demo to receive you know that was like wow this is something because i was getting just you know mountains of cokie ripoffs at that stage i don't know what it's a good question you know i think don was just into the music but i mean god knows why he thought that I would like something like that. I mean, we hadn't put out, put anything out previous to that, that would kind of hint really that I would be interested in something like that. That's the thing I'm most interested with labels in that it must be so hard when you're getting this enormous mountain of demos that you're like, I don't like any of this right now. So it's signal to the outside world. No, no, no. Here's what we want to get those things. Yeah, I mean, it's impossible because after Mount Kimi got, you know... we've got man kimi clones literally we still get them now um or joy olsen clones or you know or whatever it's impossible and the problem with demos is like you try and listen to all of them and you have you know you have to make an effort to do it but the way you when you when you're like you know you sit down it's like right i'm going to go through this massive folder of demos And you spend like an hour doing it. And after 10 minutes, you're like, you know, this is all rubbish. And after 20 minutes, you're like, oh, but that one sounds all right. But if you listen to it first, like, do you know what I mean? And like this, yeah, it's such an easy trap to fall into. And it's almost like defeats the purpose of listening to them in the first place. Because if you can't listen to everything with a clear head, then, You should listen to 15 minutes of demos every day. And that's it. It's the same way with promos. You begin exactly, you lose perspective. Yeah, totally. I have a similarly bad one. I had it for them. I leave them until I build up and then, yeah. Really bad. You do listen. listen to demos though still and you're still enormously hands-on with the label i mean everything's your final yeah i don't listen to all the demos anymore but some some other people do i listen to as many as i can and um yeah i do yeah i mean it's like you know it's my label so i'm definitely gonna um call the shots in terms of what we put out completely I mean that does you know it's it's not like a foolproof thing um I've missed out on a couple of things recently which I probably shouldn't have done But you've gotten demo-wise. We've gotten demo-wise, yeah. And there have been some very, very bad misses in the past as well. But, you know, you can't beat yourself up about that. I mean, you're not going to get it right every time. And, yeah, I mean, I don't know. I mean, it's been... What is, not without naming any names necessarily, why have you decided to pass? on something recently like what was your thought process on why you didn't pull the trigger on it well what i was going to say before was that, you know, when a label of this size, I mean, I think actually probably any kind of electronic house, whatever label, you know, there's only so many things you can put out. And it's actually, it's really, you know, taking the decisions, at the stage we are now, taking the decision to cut something is much more, you know, it's much more of a kind of big decision almost than something... actually releasing something and uh i think well because what really what i've tried to do in the last i suppose that since in that period since 2008 since we've thought so since we started releasing albums what i've wanted to do is assign people that we can then build up into long-term projects that's something i've really kind of been conscious of that's probably the only thing that I've really consciously tried to do with the label much more than you know more than any kind of like you know stylistic kind of emphasis or anything like that my only kind of like real conscious goal has been to sign people that we can you know build into album projects And just so that you can build to an album project, not necessarily you're going to be with Hot Flush for the rest of your... Well, it's obviously nice if people do stick around. Fair enough. It doesn't always happen like that, unfortunately. Not naming them. But again, I think it's the same thing with your DJing situation, your labels and this like... in this really weird moment where it's really big and not at all big. Yeah, well, that's quite right. Yeah. And it's knowing how to, you know, push it that step further or knowing even whether we want to push it that step further because obviously pushing it that step further has implications. But, you know, as I was saying, all I've wanted to do is, you know, do longer projects, do album projects, because the album is, you know, as a kind of medium, is something that I think is really important and in a kind of completely old-fashioned way, it's how I judge other labels. Do you know what I mean? So that's really what I've wanted to do. Why do you still believe it? in it in 2012 though I probably shouldn't It's completely counterintuitive, really. Although having said that, I've talked to numerous executives of much larger labels than ours, and it seems to be quite common, actually. And I think maybe that's part of the problem with the music industry, generally speaking, is people who have responsibility not recognising at all the important trends. and looking back way too much about what it was like when they were kids. Which is completely, you know, it completely explains my preoccupation with albums. Because that's, when I was growing up, that's how it was, do you know what I mean? And I still sort my music by albums. I don't think there's many 18-year-olds that do that. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm guessing there probably aren't any anywhere. So, yeah, it's not the right way of doing it, but it's the way I have been doing it. So the reason that a lot of the time I think we've missed out on things that probably we shouldn't have done is because I've listened to it and thought that's never going to be a fucking album. I mean, that's not the case every time, but I'm sure that has been the case in certain instances. You're DJing. I don't want to sound like a fanboy, but... really do think you're an amazing dj and i wonder thanks well it avoids uh fisticuffs at the very least Do you feel really comfortable on the CDJs specifically? That, you know, something that you really enjoy? Or is that, is it any sort of format? Well, I've completely got out of the habit of playing vinyl. Although I did play a vinyl set not that long ago and it was okay. And I think any DJ, I'll tell you that it's a lot easier playing on CDJs. But just from a technical perspective, I think, you know, the technical side of it is like, I mean, obviously you've got to be able to mix. I mean, that's, you know, that's a kind of... really uh basic thing obviously but i don't think that's you know the reason why a good dj is a good dj and obviously you know it is you know part of it of course but um i don't know i think building a set is is a different skill entirely again it's not something i you know think massively deeply about uh i think do you practice on No, I never practice these days. I used to a lot. I actually always beat myself. The single thing I beat myself about most these days is not practicing more and not going through promos and reading out the good stuff. and bothering to have a mix of it I really should do that a lot more but I think it's just fun DJing you know especially when you're in Panorama or Burkine or whatever I mean it's not actually yeah it's not always fun I've had a few gigs recently which haven't been fun at all and actually it's funny Someone said it on Twitter the other day to me that, oh, you should be glad that you get to do DJing for a living. you should be grateful for this. Actually, I don't really feel grateful for being a DJ for a living. I feel grateful to be able to make music for a living, for sure. That is a real privilege. But, you know, having to go around in clubs and, you know, perform. This sounds really bad, I know. But I just don't see that as a privilege at all. Having to turn up and do stuff, like, you know, stand up on stage and, you know, it's not always fun. But it can be a lot of fun. Definitely when, yeah, a good gig's a good gig and, you know, you get massive buzz out of it, for sure. Do you think if you're yourself as a producer first, then, for sure? I think they're two completely different things, to be honest. I mean, I think we've, you know, I said that, you know, DJing is performing and it is performing, but it's not, you know, it's not the same as getting up on stage and playing guitar or whatever. which I used to do. It's almost like a, yeah, I don't know. I mean, I don't even know what to compare it to, but it's very different. I see it as being very different to actually making music. That said, there is obviously a musical element to building a set, especially when you play long sets, which is kind of a different challenge to the traditional UK one-hour thing. You've been doing it for long enough now, when you feel... comfortable. I would imagine the problem at Berghain, though, like this past weekend, as we're talking, would be like, okay, I'm building a set, but I don't know when it's going to end. Yeah, I haven't had that before, actually. Not in that particular context, anyway. Because when we do substance parties, there is a kind of vague closing time. But yeah, this recent weekend was on a Sunday and there isn't a closing time on Sunday. So yeah, it was kind of like, yeah, I was kind of aiming for a certain time and then it got to that certain time and it was still really packed. It's like, okay. Played all my good tunes to try and dig around for some more. But I mean, that kind of thing is just an experience, isn't it? And I suppose that is a privilege, you know, to be able to play at that place and for them to let you do the last set and, you know, get on with it. Yeah, that's a massive privilege. And I am, yeah, I'm genuinely grateful to be able to do that kind of thing, for sure. I would be remiss if I didn't bring up Twitter. Do you play it up? Yeah, I mean, obviously, to a certain extent. You're obviously getting more followers than you're losing. I'm losing quite a few, though. You are losing, of course. I try not to look at that who's unfollowing you thing. It's just too depressing. When you immediately got onto it, did you immediately just start like... is amazing or did it take a while for you i was trying i was thinking about this the other day i i don't remember when i signed up um and obviously it's nowhere near as fun when people don't reply to you it becomes this kind of perpetuating thing where the more you know more responses you get the more angry responses you get the more you want to get more angry responses so Yeah, I mean, I do. Yeah, I definitely do fan the flames. I can't deny it. And I, you know, obviously, you know, sometimes you get into trouble, but, you know, there's been certain. points where i've thought well maybe i should turn this down a little bit but um i think there was a recent one that said if i'd thought for 30 seconds before every tweet i'd probably tweet a lot less well yeah get into a lot less trouble anyway um probably yeah but it's um i don't know and i think uh does your management like this or not like this actually they're pretty much completely behind it actually yeah yeah they're on board for sure which I was actually because I you know I didn't have a manager until really recently and you know one of the reasons why I didn't want to manage because I didn't want people telling me you know that I shouldn't slag off Calvin Harris on Twitter but actually no it's been no I haven't been had any problems with like that at all really I suppose there's the element of like any publicity is good publicity which I don't necessarily subscribe to you know I think You can get people talking. And I think, you know, what really kind of like actually kind of spurs me on with Twitter is how banal the vast majority of tweeting is, especially from my direct peers. And it's like, do you know what I mean? It's like, it's just boring. Do you know what I mean? And it's just, not it's just boring. It's just cliche after cliche after cliche, you know? And I'm not saying that I'm completely immune from this, but yeah. I think you'd directly fall into the DJ's complaining cliche. However. That may, that has recently become a cliche. Yeah. I'm aware of that. but you're exactly right i mean i can count on i guess i would say both hands the number of djs that i actually really enjoy like following on twitter because it's they're either really witty or they're not talking about you know how great their last gig was i mean it's not just djs to be fair i mean there's i think yeah there is a bigger world yeah And the vast majority of people are, you know, given that kind of platform, not going to be very interesting. And I don't know. Why do you think you took to it so well, though? I don't know if I have. I don't know if I have took to it well. I'm not sure if this is good. The fact that we're talking about it probably says it's not. It's actually not that good. I mean, I like arguing with people. I can't deny that. And if it's something that I can, you know, do over the course of my day while still achieving other things, then that's so much the better. It's certainly better than... Do you remain as productive as you were before? Well, what I was going to say, the analogy I was going to draw is it's not like when I had a real job, I used to have... basically sit on forums all day and it's definitely different to that it's a lot so you can you can you know it's not as bad in terms of time wasting and just general yeah i mean i i i should have been sacked from every every job i've ever had for just for being on forums it's not cool um And it doesn't achieve anything. Basically, you think, I think, and this is the problem with the internet, obviously, generally. You think you're part of this world, and it's like a much bigger world than it actually is. At least with Twitter, I don't know, it obviously completely depends on how many followers you have. But if you have lots of followers, then it is, yeah. reasonably big world sometimes. I don't know. It's bad. I mean, yeah, I should stop. I should stop. Well, you won't. It's addictive. It really is addictive. It's terrible. You mentioned you just got a manager recently. What was the idea behind it? Had you just released the last album? Or was it before you released? Yeah, it was just after I released it. It kind of comes back to wanting to do different stuff, really. I've, you know... Like I say, every couple of years I've felt like I've finished doing this thing, now I need to do something else. Having management was something that I'd never really considered before because I figured I can do what I want to do. And in terms of how we've run the label and how the kind of musical approach I've taken, I haven't really needed to engage with anything other than something that I'm fully capable of engaging with on my own. I mean, I'm not, I know nothing about the music industry at all. I've never engaged with it at all. I don't know anyone from major labels. I don't know anyone. I mean, I'm just not part of that whole thing. I remember you talking about your first distributor in the Red Bull Music Academy. Right, yeah. But I've only ever had one distributor, do you know what I mean? Yeah, exactly. I mean, my experience of this stuff is just so minimal. Arrangements have been exactly the same since 2003. And I figured, well, let's try and get someone in who actually knows that side of it and see what difference they can make to anything, if anything. I was still completely sceptical about it, though, and I interviewed loads and loads of different people. It's nice to be in a position where lots of people want to manage you. The danger of doing that kind of thing too early is that you just take the first person who comes along and they don't do anything good for your career or don't understand what needs to be done with your career. So, like I say, it's good to be in a position where I could talk to lots of different people and make a decision from a wide range of... skill sets what were you looking for i mean what was it that you know i wanted someone who could do stuff that i couldn't do do you know what i mean i think that's you know i i think i've done reasonably well to get to where i've got just with you know a musical industry knowledge of absolute zero um and i figured that i wanted to um yeah i wanted someone who knew the industry And so, yeah, I'm not really sure what we're going to do with it. That's the sort of next question. I mean, you'll have gathered that there's not a lot of, you know, overt strategic thinking that goes into my career. Decisions tend to get made in an ad hoc way. But I would think with the management, especially in the interview, you would have said, you know, either you would have said to them. what can you do for me? Or you would have said, I want to do these three things in the next five years. Can you make that happen? It makes sense to me to kind of kick on from doing underground stuff, but not in a sense of going pop necessarily. I don't know. musically this is the kind of fourth album process that I'm in right now in terms of trying to you know make something interesting that I like I'm happy with that is going to go into bigger rooms but obviously it's important for me to keep an element of the underground in there because it would make, you know, just looking at it from a commercial perspective would make no sense to, you know, say, oh, I'm just going to, you know, bring in a load of vocalists. Right, yeah, exactly. So I'm in the throes of working out what I want to do with the next couple of years. You know, I wanted to know that you've hired them and it's been a couple months now. You're like I'll probably just decide to just make Burkine Techno again and cut them loose. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I just think that it's good to have a good team around you and have a team that has as broad a range of experience as possible. What's been the most surprising sort of thing that they've brought to the table or that they've said to you that you didn't even think of that you can say? I don't know. Well, yeah. Yeah, that could be a problem. Maybe if you just follow me on Twitter, I might find out. No, I don't know. I mean... I wouldn't say I've been surprised so much by anything. I mean, you know, I think all it's really confirmed to me is that, you know, having these kind of contacts and having these kind of ins is the way that side. of the industry works and i'm you know expected that to be the case and it is the case yeah um but and he gets his emails returned right yeah exactly yeah and what i figured was that you know if we if you want to kind of have any kind of activity in that side of things then you need someone who he knows it i mean um and it's not something i particularly want to waste my time getting to know you know i mean i'd rather just hire someone to do it you know at the basest possible level so yeah i mean and if i could that means i don't have to talk to record industry executives and those kind of people and that's so much the better So, yeah, I don't know. But like I say, I mean, it's far from clear what is going to come of it. Apart from, you know, not having to fill out immigration forms and that kind of thing. Someone else can do it for me. So it feels like you're kind of at a crossroads moment almost. Oh yeah, completely. I mean, I, but the thing is, I've, it's almost, I've been at a crossroads moment for the last five years, really. There hasn't really been a point where I could have said. this is what I'm going to do now. Or this is what, you know, this is the path. This is what we're going to do for the next three years or whatever. Like I say, there isn't... It's not the way you were. No, it's kind of... It's always been really ad hoc and, you know, on the hoof. but I don't know, I don't really know any other way of working, really. And, you know, it has its advantages. You know, I'm pretty restless musically as well as personally, and, you know, the way the kind of, for want of a better word, scene, especially the UK scene, has changed in the last five years. it's been probably an advantage to be musically restless. I couldn't make a guess as to what people... going to be listening to in London in three years time I just haven't got a clue um does that matter to you no I mean well I mean I suppose in terms of making a living it matters but in I don't know I mean certainly I don't try and second guess what's going to happen and then you know get in the studio and work accordingly I kind of you know I think it's important to be open-minded um as a producer as well as a as a label owner and obviously as a DJ that's true and I think I don't know I mean it's it's actually I feel really lucky to have been doing what I've been doing in the last five years because it's I think been really interesting time musically especially for stuff coming out of the UK and it's yeah it certainly compared to what the scene was like in London in 2005 dancing not just the dubstep scene i mean ironically i suppose it was kind of a vacuum that the dubstep thing was able to happen in but um it was grim like you know clubs wise there was just nothing happening and then if you look at that you know london now it's great i mean i think you know it's actually where do you love in london right now clubs wise i mean i think um What's been happening with the kind of secret warehouse thing, which has actually become a bit of a cliche now, I suppose, but that's pretty much where all the really cool parties have been happening, not specific club venues. And it's actually quite surprising that the police in London have been allowing that stuff to happen because the police basically killed grime. as a clubbing thing. Why do you think the warehouse, I mean, obviously you wouldn't live there. It would be stupid for you to commentate on it, but why not? Why do you think these houses, is it just the location of where they're going on? Well, there aren't that many really good purpose-built clubs in London. I mean, Fabric's obviously great, but it attracts a bit of a funny crowd sometimes. And there's places like Corsica Studios. and capable, which are good, but like, you know, I think they're not, they're not amazing, you know? And I think that's one side of it. The flip side of it is people in London. are so focused on the new thing so it's almost like even though all these venues get used multiple times the fact that it says like secret you know warehouse i think continues to kind of tickle the average londoners fancy just in a really kind of yeah base this is illicit base kind of like yeah hipster london kind of way um but i think um From a promoter's perspective, which obviously drives it as well, I think being able to call the shots a lot more, which obviously, especially working with Fabric, you have to work with them so closely to do everything. And if the police are going to give out, and the council are going to give out, licenses to do one-off parties at these kind of places, then why wouldn't you do it as a promoter? So, yeah, I think it's been pretty cool how it's developed. Like I say, it's become a bit of a cliche now, I think. I'm sure people are going to start looking for the new thing soon if they haven't done already. And actually, generally speaking, the whole thing in London has got so big, it's almost like it's starting to look like a bubble, to be honest. I mean, you can say that about the whole dancing, I suppose, worldwide. You know, I think people, I mean, there's so much complacency at the moment about how it's going to go in the next five years. Not just in London, but certainly in America. It's just like, you know... You can almost chart out how things are going to progress in the States because of the people who are buying stuff up. Well, I mean, people seem to draw different conclusions about it, though. I mean, I've heard so many arguments about, you know, saying... because it's kids liking it now they're going to be into good stuff in five years time which seems to me like just the most you know just most I don't know like complacent like I say complacent argument I've ever heard seems to me far more likely they're just going to start liking rock bands again which is not probably something I should be you know arguing in an interview but like i think i don't know i just think that um everything especially in the u.s it really looks like a bubble to me and what happened you know bubbles burst it doesn't never sustains itself um especially when you know when the kind of money is getting thrown around that is getting thrown around in the states at the moment it's completely unsustainable and you know audiences are fickle especially when they're really young audiences But anyway, that's a slightly different point. I think... Where do you fit in in the States right now? Well, I played a bunch of shows in July. Wildly differing shows. And I think that's probably the thing in the States for an artist like yourself. It's like in certain cities, here's this venue that works and other cities, there's no venue. What was really good actually about this trip was that despite the fact that I was playing all these different... kinds of shows i mean including dubstep shows i hasten to add and even at the dubstep shows you know i wasn't you know playing any dubstep i was just playing my regular you know i basically went there with a set that i basically played you know 12 times or whatever you know, not exactly, you know, a very similar thing anyway, each one. And people really got into it. There was no place in fucking dubstep or any of that stuff. So I think it's really changed a lot. The kind of grassroots scene anyway has changed a lot in the States, but what you have to remember about that is that it's really small. The grassroots scene is small. It's so far removed from these big kind of multi-million dollar festivals and the rest of it. But it was a lot of fun. I've been going to the States since 2005. And it's always been fun. It's always, you know, the majority of the shows have been small, but people have always, you know, been quite into what I would hope to be, well, what I would hope to describe as the more interesting side of it. whatever you know the music that has been i mean you don't you only get that the argument goes you would only get that sort of trickle-down effect three or four years from now of the 18 year olds so yeah i guess you have to wait another three or four years perhaps yeah i mean i personally i just don't see it happening but i don't know maybe no i suppose Thank you.
