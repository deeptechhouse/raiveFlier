Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Toddl Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Over the past half decade, Dusseldorf's Loco Dice has become a major force in the world of house music. He began his musical journey via hip-hop, however. There have been many preconceptions about how he got from one to the other, so we asked him to walk us through his early days as a German emcee, his legendary residency at DC10, and his working relationship with production and Desolat partner Martin Budrich. you With someone like yourself we should just begin at the beginning. You were born in Tunisia. No, no. You were not? No, I'm not. There is so much wrong information going on about me. That was my first experience with the English press. How strong an English press is. When I did my first compilation for Mixmac they put by mistake I'm from Turkey. So, I'm a Turkish citizen. Okay. Till now. Finally we're clear in the air. Yeah. No, I'm born and raised in Germany. I'm the new generation kid from Germany. The immigrant parents came to Germany in '72, I think, or '71. And I'm born here in Dusseldorf, not far away from the place, like three blocks away. Wow. So it's funny that my office came back where I was born, where everything started. And I lived almost my whole life in Germany. I spent the summers in Tunisia. Why did your parents move? My father, what I remember, was working in a boat, on a boat, as a restaurant chef. Not chef, more like a manager. I really don't know how it comes to be. chose Dusseldorf, but I know that they get married and he brought my mom right away here and Right away she became pregnant and right away. I was born all the typical old-school stories, you know And they stayed here. I think it was in the time when Germany opens the borders to the immigrants and ask for people to come and work and help after the fifth war and everything. Yeah, we were one of the first generation of immigrants who came to Germany, I think. What do you remember about Düsseldorf, you know? Everything. Everything. My memory back in the day, I remember everything. I remember even my first cigarette, I remember everything. That's why I'm so in love with this city, because the city gave me a lot, as much. I never hated this city that much. What do you find that people do hate the city? Some people hate Dusseldorf, even people from Dusseldorf. Why is that? I don't know, maybe they had a bad experience in their life. But I have to say also more than 50% of the Dusseldorf people, we are known as the arrogant Dusseldorf people because they love their city so much and everybody put a lot of effort to represent. city in a good way but I think it's just really rare just few people who hate Dusseldorf and what they did they went to the to our lovely city Cologne It is... I think most of the people didn't like it because we don't have that much party scene, nightlife scene. So if you're looking for party, you're wrong here. We don't have, in a way... The people from Dusseldorf are strange, are weirdos. You know, when I see how many artists come from here, it's a craft where I go. Heartfloor or just to name a few you have so many artists but they're not that connected together. It's not like Berlin or Cologne where some artists say to the other let's do something, let's work on something. People are working in isolation. Yeah, yeah and if you are connected to them it's I mean me and Oliver Bonzi for example never talked Talk about PlayStation, movies, new brands, Bopping Ape, whatever he likes, whatever I like. And with Ramon the same. It was never an invitation there or somebody say to the other, hey, let's do something together. I think we respect each other a lot. We know what everybody's doing. I don't think there is jealousy involved, but it's just, I think I like this climate. It's nice. You see somebody, you can just say, what's up, how you doing? So there's never been... really an appeal to move anywhere? For me, never. Never. I moved. I lived in Ibiza. I ran away from home when I was a kid. I lived in Rotterdam. I lived in Barcelona, New York. But it was always my hometown and I always said... This is my place where I want to raise my family, where I want to die, where I don't know, and all these thoughts that you have. Because this city is giving me everything I need, the quality to live a good life. and to be secured, not to have thoughts in my mind while I'm traveling. And I never lived a nomad life or a gypsy life. I like to be, I'm very old school. I mean, I'm very old fashioned in a lot of ways. Even I look modern, I'm very old fashioned in the way of my work, in the way I'm thinking. And I like it this way. It gives me the grounding, you know? It gives me stay real. You mentioned you ran away. Do you mind talking about the circumstances? No, no. It was a time, you know, I was really what you can call a loser. I dropped, I not really dropped school. I moved from many schools. I was a problem child by that time. I was doing a lot of stupid stuff. I grew up here in Flingern. Flingern used to be a problem quarter in Dusseldorf. A lot of immigration, a lot of crime, a lot of everything, but nothing compared to the US or to England or whatever. But we had our own problems. Also, I grew up just with my mom and my dad and my brother, without a dad, and that was more difficult. And for my mom to raise up two difficult children was a tough game, you know. And for somebody who's not accepted as a German, even you have a German passport, is also a tough game. And I'm, my generation... had to face this problem. The new generation now know. I mean a lot of people come to Berlin and they say wow this is freedom. Man I can tell you it was not freedom ten years ago you know it was really tough to have black hair and having a wrong name or wrong accent and well grow up in this situation try to find a job try when you become 18 you face the reality that you are now. a man so they can sue you you are if you're not part of the game you pretty much nothing and it was tough for me and then you become you have troubles with your brother with your family with your mom with everything everything goes wrong everything you want to touch goes wrong and i was like you know what i had by that time a lot of friends from holland do the hip-hop scene and I found it clever to run away and start maybe a new life in Holland which was totally wrong I had to go back after two weeks to be honest. Two weeks? Wow, okay so that didn't take. No it didn't take and that was my early experience to find out I cannot I'm not the person who run away from something I have to stay there face something. And it was good for me to learn all these things because it helps me a lot to what I am now. If there is a problem, you have to solve the problem somehow. It doesn't make any sense to move it away. It will come back. So these are tough things that I had to learn early days, and I'm thankful for this. Was the music hip-hop sort of the first? Was it an escape from childhood? Hip-hop was a part of my life. Do you remember when you first heard it? What were the circumstances? What was the moment that it took hold? I hear it the first time in a friend's cellar. We used to have cellars in the houses, obviously, normal, dirty cellars where you put your body. and the old stuff and it was the time I knew music from my uncles my uncles will listen to Santana, Shakakan, all that funk, Soul so forgive me if I misplace some times now but my memory is 100% but not that good you know and they were listening to a lot of funk stuff and everything And then I was in the cellar, I remember, and it was a friend, some Italian friend, who was going, you know, we have every two weeks you can... put like kind of garbage like old tables turntables boxes chairs whatever on the street and they collected and that was the time when he was running around and tried to find out in this garbage things that he can repair and make them work and he had all these beautiful things in his cellar and he was the first one who dropped a hip-hop record for me and I can't remember if it was Public Enemy, if it was Ice-T, if it was Grandmaster Flash. It was not... I didn't jump really on that train when really hip-hop started. It was already there. But for a German kid, hip-hop was not there. So I had to discover all of it. I'm looking for the steel. And I remember when I first heard the beats and that rap, I was like wow. With the environment that I had, it was such a feeling in my head which changed me completely from day one. And from this day on, hip-hop, I lived hip-hop. I was everything what I was doing, the way I dress, the way I talk, my thoughts. my dreams, everything was in a hip-hop way. What were the defining ideas about hip-hop that really appealed to you? How did it change, how did it transform you? It transformed me to a good and a bad thing. Because hip-hop started as a good thing, but it had also a lot of bad things. I mean, the first thing you wanted to do was... I had something, I had a reason in my life. It was like a religion. I had something to believe in. And the dream that hip-hop can take you out from the position where you are was there. Because the rappers, they rapped it for you. They told you, hey, it is possible, you can do something. And that was for me the goal. Like, hey, I can achieve something in my life. I can be somebody, not the guy who dropped school, who lost this and that. I can do something. I only have to work on myself. But also on the other side, it teaches me a lot of bad things. Bad things that I saw already, stealing, this, that, and hip-hop was a part of it. So I was like, wow, so the combination is right. And that's the dangerous thing. to see it from another point. You can see hip-hop in a positive way or you can see hip-hop in a negative way. And I have to say, to be honest, I saw hip-hop in a negative way. first you know, gather around with a lot of people, being more powerful, being in a gang, going around, spray your name everywhere, tag it everywhere, everything, every bit of information that I got through records. Back in the days you had beautiful vinyls, you open up a vinyl and you had the whole history, the whole lyrics, everything was there, so perfect information. Thank you. And this is what I was looking for. I was like, wow. And later comes what is behind hip-hop, actually. Later you meet some other people with more knowledge, where they tell you, well, Ice-T is cool, but why don't you listen to Tribe Called Quest or this and that? And then you're like, okay, what is this now? What are they talking about? ♪♪ A mirror for Cerbera, who was four feet high. I pulled over to ask where he was at. His index finger, he tipped off his hat. El Segundo, he said, my name is Pedro. If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto. Need a civilization, some sort of reservation. He said a mile south, there's a fast food station. Thanks to y'all, as I started the motor, I leased it. Damn, Tim, what did you drive so far? You're the first artists that you all mentioned or seem like chroniclers of the ghetto. Like Ice-T, obviously, in the West Coast, and Public Enemy is raging. Grandmaster Flash is talking about the streets of New York before that. And then you mentioned Tribe Called Quest, which of course is like a totally different kind of uplifting sometimes thing. Was that the kind of like move that you made in your listening habits? Yeah, it opened my doors. more, it opened my doors more and why it's true I'm really really still into that West Coast flavor because when I started to understand what they are talking about it was pretty much what I can identify myself you know growing up somewhere where nobody likes you and to be more dramatic that was the dream that you had then hey it is like South Central. from LA. New York was not that thing for us. New York was just more political. And we were kids. We were not so much into political rhymes. I mean, of course, public enemy, amazing. But I mean, we have no problem here. Black power was for us the same problem as they had there. But it was not just black people. We are like from Morocco, from Italy. So we were one nation under this. So everything what they told us, we put it in the way we want it to have a parallel to them. And yeah, later, like I said, I mean, you learn more and more. And we had no chance through magazines. It was impossible to go through what are they talking, what they're doing. So you go to parties. And the first parties I went to were in München Gladbach Soul Center. And this was a small club for maybe 200 people, mostly GIs who are stationed here in Germany. from the United States, English people. So you see the variety of culture and music was more, was there. And like I said, when I met like this kind of other music, I learned it from more German guys because they were not listening to that kind of music because it was giving them nothing. They understood it obviously more than me. My English by that time was not that good. good you know and this is a part of my life which opened more doors and let me be more open-minded to understand there is more than just one thing even it is the same it is different and it's a different message and it can give you different vibes or different impulses to your life to your own own thing and yeah just triple quest was just a name you know there were many more uh if i go now through my itunes library i can tell you and it started to make me think like hey it's also positive and here we are again negative positive and I start to see it on the positive way. It is the dancing. It is the positive message that you want to spread out. It means escape from the bad things and try to make something positive to show what you got, you know. And it was a great time. So when did you make the move from, you know, listening, enjoying to... making, DJing was directly there. It was the media, but it was not DJing. It was, like I said, the whole culture. Even before rapping, I was dancing. and with a lot of gypsies you have this hip-hop movies like House Party, Class Act and all that stuff, Kid and Play and you have the B-Boys movies and Beat Street and all that and Michael Jackson was a big part, even hip-hop was big, Michael Jackson was bigger than everything. She says I am the one. She's not my son. So every time a new video come out, I went with my Gypsy friends and we tried to learn the moves and everything. Obviously everything what a young kid does when he's into hip-hop. And everything comes to a part when I started to say I want to I want to do something like this. Not only dancing. I want to do something like this. Like I said, you open up the vinyl and you have all the sheets with the lyrics. You start to rap like them, try to rap on different beats, try to pick up obviously what I'm doing now. You take a piece of this, a piece of that and you mix it. And I was never thinking to be a DJ. It was always somebody else who had the... and saying, "Hey, do something." I picked up the mic and I start to shoot bullshit. But it sounded so cool that it obviously came real. And who of my German friends would understand what I was rapping? - Obviously, just picking up the mic is like the ultimate DIY. You literally have no money to have to invest. start talking. Just talking, just doing something, performing. But everything I did in that time was still now no meaning of I want to be a rapper. It was just, I have something I can do, I have a hobby. Let's name it this. I have something in my life I can do, I can show, I can do it. School didn't work out, work didn't work out, I can rap. Was it also, I have something I need to say? There was, it comes in the beginning, it was like, I have something I need to say. I have something to do. And then it was, I want to give a message, I want to say something. I want to be the voice of my clique. I want to say something. But it was difficult because nobody understood it. So you had to really, then comes the technical part where you have to sit down and you're like, okay, what I'm saying here, maybe two people will understand. thing is the hook and the hook everyone will sing everyone will rap everyone will scream so this is the hook and it was like coming from D-town everybody D-town what is it this is of D-town That's it, you know and pretty much I understood as well the power that rap got Damn Wow, that was really hardcore like the first days it you don't realize it when you're a dancer when you dance and everybody gather around and everybody you are like they show at you hey, you have new dance moves and then you pick the mic and it's like Yeah, you know and And it was in a time when hip-hop was totally underground. Who were you sounding like? You said you were learning from rappers. It was always the West Coast guys. I sounded maybe like Ice-T. that I can do without. I love ladies. It was the guy for me the easiest way to rhyme Chuck D was impossible impossible and also That was maybe also a mistake by me because I was really a lousy rapper by the After because I was too lazy to learn more about the New York skills of rhyming I was pretty much more the country country country rapper how they call the New York the West Coast guys because it was easy rhyming for me it was about to express the words very easy to make it understandable and also choose easy English and not New York become one more far away for me become it was too intelligent too underground too dark Wu-Tang came in a time when I was already in New York. I was in New York already. But, you know, you had all this difficult stuff. And New York was always cold. New York was always big jackets. New York was always... problems you know I didn't want this problems anymore the family problems the drug problems whatever it was more iced tea was like singing rapping for me positive things in my way that time driving a car the sun is shining West Coast flavor the the beach hanging with the homies smoking a joint how much more easy how much more Disneyland can you get for, you know? sitting in cold Germany. In your bio it famously says you've opened for all of these guys. Tell me how that sort of began, how that started and did you meet these people or was it just like... No. Everything what I do or something it's never to show off or something. Maybe I made a mistake in my life the first time I wrote my book. first bio or people told me you have to write this because it was the first sentence he starred early in the 90s as a hip-hop kid performing for likes Usher Ice Cube and this is following me now my whole life but I'm proud of it it's a part of my life but this is something I would never ever do it again It got me some good things and some bad things to where I am now. And back to your question, yes, I was hanging with Ice Cube. He came here in Dusseldorf, he was performing in the Philips Halle and they asked like... the second time, the first time he came, it was Ice-T, Run-DMC. And because I know a lot of the guys who were producing these parties and everything, or I knew the people of the club, I had the possibility to go backstage and hang with those guys. And by that time, I was pretty much forward to more of the other kids who were there, because I was sucking all the information that... I got about West Coast or hip-hop or R&B or new jack swing all the movies I even got the movies in English even I couldn't understand them I tried to figure out what are they trying to tell me so these guys saw in me a connection or a bridge to the German scene maybe or they just saw one one of them maybe but then wait a minute what accent do you got where you from who are you It was always this, you know? And I was like, for me, because I lived it so much, it was, who was Ice Cube? "Yo Ice, what's up?" "BOOM!" "Give me five and yo, have a drink." And it was like a normal person to me. And I never saw them as big hype stars or something. And I think when you give somebody a feeling like this to a cool artist and he feels that, maybe he comes down and he says, "Hey, okay, let's have a smoke, let's talk." What are you doing next week? Outro Music Being a groupie like most of the other kids. I mean, I never saw guys being so bitchy, you know and being like It wasn't me because I had no idea. For me, a superstar is a football player. When I see him, then I get starstruck and I say, wow. But a musician is something I respect. Anyway, everything, I was hanging with him. I was obviously hanging with Snoop Dogg when he did this tour. I was really, I was successful. as a DJ, I was spinning everywhere, I was known for doing records more West Coast orientated, I was sampling a lot Roger and Zap which is the king discipline of West Coast flavor, I was on all Roger and Zap concerts whenever he came here, I made pictures with him and for me it was then a dream that There was this guy called JC Entertainment. and he was the connection between Germany and the Netherlands. So you have to understand all the groups, the small, by that time there were small groups, hip-hop was not a big market. So when they came from the United States, they came of course to London or they came first to the Netherlands. And this guy is an American guy, he bought the shows and then he tried to sell them to Germany. In Germany... You cannot sell them to Hamburg, Berlin or something. It was here, it was Düsseldorf, it was Cologne, because all the stations were based. Of course Frankfurt, Mannheim, this was where everything started. and maybe the other cities, but I don't know about this. And this was the connection. And he was the one, for example, who started to install me into the support acts because he knew me as a DJ, he knew me as an artist, he always was laughing about my rap lyrics, but he said, "Hey, don't worry, go ahead, man. You rock, just do it." And after that I understood that even most of the US guys don't even speak a perfect English grammatical way. That gave me like after 20 years really... Anyway, and this is how it comes and I remember I had a record deal. It was Arcade. They created a sub-label called Flavor and I had my first single out which was coming from D-Time. and it was good. I mean, it was selling a lot, was in the charts, was not in the German charts, was in the black music charts, top 10. And it was something where I was like, wow, this is great. And that was the time when I remember it comes a fax into the office and saying like, it was by Sharita Knight, Shagnite's ex-wife or whatever, saying that Snoop Dogg is coming on a European tour and he wants support acts who are more West Coast orientated and that they hear about. us through JC and they want to invite us to do the German or European tour with him. It was a pretty big party then. So you say Dusseldorf had a pretty big scene as far as Germany went. Not really, it was not Dusseldorf, it was the area. You know, you had the guys from Wuppertal, you had the guys from Cologne, you had the guys from Dusseldorf, from Neuss. It was gangst. You know, this cruise, you know, Cologne people were always 50, 50 or 80 people, crazy. Wuppertal, 40. Our scene in Düsseldorf was really tiny and little, but we were so compact and so good that we were somebody. Most of the parties were going on here. You had at the main station, Rheingoldsaal, which becomes later one of the most dirtiest techno clubs ever, Poison Club. And this was Thursday nights was the jam there and then you had Cologne, Kaurikella, you had in... In Frankfurt area you had the GIs in the Casern, I don't know how you say it in English, where the troops are. The fort. At the fort, yeah. And Eagle's Nest in Wiesbaden. So you have to think, every weekend these crews travel by train. to these parties and then it was really amazing standing at the door and you saw the train from Cologne the Cologne people come the train from Wuppertal the Wuppertal people come and this is how it comes so it was not really one it was a big scene yeah not one scene okay for a while I assume it was all hip-hop just you were Strictly hip-hop, nothing else. When did things open up a little bit more? It was strictly hip-hop, but this was the side effect that I didn't notice by that time when I was young, that I was listening still to pop music, I was listening to Latin music by my mom, she was listening to Jolio Iglesias and still to Santana. whatever jazz band it was, I was still, my ears were still open. And I recognized these things after a while, that I was indirectly influenced by those things. Even I had my, like, of course, you know, the claps on, I see just hip-hop, hip-hop. And... And everything comes together to that point when hip-hop became boring to me. Hip-hop had its peak, it was in the 90s, beginning of 90s, mid 90s. But then it was pretty much dull. I don't know what happened to me. in a point when I was also influenced by New Jack Swing, Teddy Riley. Through Teddy Riley, you had CeCe Peniston. Through CeCe Peniston, you had those kind of house records. Bet you didn't gave a name house music because house was house party was also hip-hop in my ears or in my point of view so I had those kind of elements around me without noticing that I have it and with the soul and the funk which was already totally house music by a time you know And slowly, slowly I came to a point where I was like... I had a really down as well with hip-hop. I was like after all this Snoop thing and everything I thought I'm the man. So I was... pretty much an asshole to a lot of people as well so all that stuff came as well and I was not really... I lost my head. I lost my head big time and this is something I learned. My best friends who had nothing to do with all that hip-hop cliche and everything they were starting to tell me "Hey, we're gonna leave you now. You're on your own." Thank you. And it was a moment in my life where I said, hey, I'm about to lose everything what I created. I'm about to lose the most important thing what I always wanted to follow is my people, my crew, my friends, true people that I trust. This was always the most important key or thing in my life till now. And that was a moment I woke up and I'm like. Hip-hop? What is hip-hop at the moment? What does it mean to me? Who am I? What am I doing? Is it really true? What am I doing here? Or is it just show? Am I honest to myself? And I realized a lot of things went wrong, also through drugs and alcohol and girls and this and that. So everything, the cliche, I was in the middle of the cliche. I was one of it. I'm like, fuck, what is going on? Also, my relation to my mom became very bad by that time. I was just traveling, I was just partying, I was... was the cool dicey you know and this is how I was behaving and I think I had a lot of haters by that time and you know it comes a moment in my life where I was like hey I have to listen to the people that I know from day one and I was again with them I stopped everything almost I didn't hang with the old people with the people from the hip-hop times, from the party, from the club, and I was back to my real people. And that time also hip-hop became... Me as a DJ, I had a really depression time. Hip-hop... There was this music channel Viva, which came out. And I remember it was the time when Coolio Gangsters Paradise became number one in Germany. And that was pretty much the stamp for me. Like, hey, this is going totally in another direction now. not what it was or what it is and I cannot lie to myself and say this is me I also find myself very stupid rapping to people that actually just wanted to be entertained and you know how can I explain it without being now very arrogant something which was underground and and cool and nice became so normal and so you have to. No, this is not it. And Puff Daddy started to cover all the 80s songs and hip-hop was... blasting from all radio stations and everybody who was who don't even know the history about hip-hop was hip-hop everybody the clothes you could start to buy the hip-hop clothes in the stores sneakers was nothing special anymore to have the special bks or reeboks Everything was there and it was a time for me to search for something new and in the beginning it was not the music or the hip-hop it was go back to reality, go back to your friends, go back to your family, find out who you are and who are you actually. How long did that take? I was lucky it took like maybe a year or half a year because I really understood it. very fast that I'm about to lose the precious thing in my life which was my friends and it was beautiful then because I was like a newborn without following any religion or something and I was proud of myself because Because again I showed myself that I could do something new or I could escape from something bad. I can go a cool direction, a good direction, a positive direction. And it sounds pretty much spiritual and all that crap now, but it was a spiritual way for me. I was clean. I shaved my hair, I threw away all... all the clothes that I was wearing. I quit rapping because I had to figure out, German rap become big, I had to figure out that I was actually nobody because whatever I was texting or rapping, it had no audience that understood what my message was or what I wanted. Plus, my message was stupid. Because the people would rather listen to immigration problems like Fresh Family did, Ahmed Gündüz, which was a big hit. Or with all the respect to the Fantastic Four, which are my friends, but Dida Dida was just nothing, nonsense. But it was hip-hop for the Germans. What these guys represented was all hip-hop and what I did all the years and the other people was shit. And I had to face as well a lot of German guys that said what I'm doing is fake. What I'm doing is just being a wannabe and it's just ridiculous to pretend to be somebody like this. It's gotta be tough. I mean, especially... you know, doing hip hop in Germany, because it's a very American art form. - Exactly. And this is what I found out at that time. And I'm like, hey, whatever I'm doing here, or whatever I'm trying to change, or whatever I wanna change, it's not gonna work. At the end, bottom line, I am a wannabe. Because I am not, I cannot, I can't. It can't be real. It's illusion. It's a dream. only certain people can understand and the rest will not understand it and it makes no sense to be a revolutionary guy and try to keep going on and every time I had to find out that it's kind of ridiculous what I'm doing, what I'm wearing, what I am and my world starts to break, you know, and it was really sad somehow but you make always some people who are still on the same movie like you and when I see now people like Bushido or Argo Berlin or something it is actually the same what I was doing they just do it in German and they do it a little bit more extraordinary but this is hip-hop you know and he's now a big big cat in the scene a respected guy and I'm like okay Is it, I mean, I don't know how much you're paying attention to the German hip-hop scene these days, but is it, for lack of a better word, better? Is it more true? Are they doing something that's distinctly German with it, as opposed to sort of copying? what they see in it. It is a copy, but the lyrics and the way they are living it is pretty much German. But, you are right, it's still a copy. We don't have ghettos in Germany. We will never have ghettos in Germany like we have in the United States. We have other problems. We have other ghettos. We have other things. And some hip-hop groups, they bring it right. Some are just doing what I was doing, pretending, dreaming, to have something to do, you know. It was a time when Rödelheim Hard-Ramquist came out, Moses P. Okay? Whatever his history is, or whatever he does, we put it away. But when he... When the song starts to rhyme and he starts to talk about things, I understood him. Because he said it in German and he was pointing problems that I had. On the other thing, you had advanced chemistry, they put out the song "Ich hab' 'nen grünen Pass mit 'nem goldenen Adler drauf" which means "I have a green passport with a golden eagle on it". Thank you. And they were rapping about the problem, an immigrant guy living in Germany. But it was so super high intelligent and super well chosen words and that it was so far away from me. So you understand, you have always those two camps. You have the ones who are actually... rapping or giving the truth, but in such an intelligent, nerdy way that a normal guy who really needs this information already after the second sentence say, stop. And then you have the agro guys who are always bringing the hip-hop wannabe posing into the problem what they are talking about and this is what you follow them you forget that it's actually a copy or it's too dramatic or something because you pick the little things that you see on the street so that's it you know and at the end if a jazzer in Germany do jazz is he copying jazz from the States or is he copying brass from New Orleans or something you know I stopped after this thing in hip-hop I stopped thinking too much about am I copying me I will never ever invent something new impossible Because it was already there. I can only follow some rules, some steps, experiment a little bit. And if I'm lucky, somebody will say, oh, that's new. I cannot. invent something new you know we see now all the techno artists and everything i'm happy i have a position where i am now you know but it's also nothing new i took a little piece of this a little piece of a piece of that i mixed it i the way i mix is different to the others thank you but you know i will never be a richard horton who is inventing something special or a sven because you have to be In the beginning, to invent something new. Coming 20 years later. Did you find audiences when you first started DJing more house music really responded to it because you brought a different perspective to it? Obviously, you say they do now. Yes. Was it first as well? Yes, it was. When I moved to electronic music, house music, it was a time when house music also just started in Germany, or let's say in my area. I cannot talk about the other areas. I know that house music was big in Hamburg through Boris Lugosch. House music was big in Hannover through Moose T. House music was big in Munich through other artists. Dusseldorf. I had house music but also there it was, man, my whole life I had to follow this what is real, what is not real, what is wannabe, what is not, what is fake, what is not. It followed me the whole time, you know. Starting here as a house DJ, man, I just wanted to have fun. I wanted to play fresh tunes. I wanted to escape from the hip-hop, you know, and play for a new audience. I brought half of the audience I brought from hip-hop to my new style, you know, so it was my audience. And when was this? This was also... 97, something like this. 97, 96, 98, something like this. It was a transformation. I was still a hip-hop artist, but I was doing my house nights. I called them boogie nights by that time. It was, I think, in 96, no, 97, 98, in a house club called La Roca. And it was on a Wednesday when the kids had the holidays. from school and it was the owner by that time he had this concept saying okay we do like you pay 50 marks and you can drink all night long or something can you imagine playing something commercial like no I don't play commercial but what I can do is I can combine hip-hop with house music well that sounds interesting I'm like, yeah, if you give me the opportunity, let me try it. And it worked out perfectly. I started to play in the beginning my chill-out music that I was collecting. by that time I was playing then some hip-hop, R&B, some new jack swing and then from there it was pretty much easy to find a way to house music and after that by that time I was going to techno and house parties I was playing really hard techno records at the end the last half an hour or something and I had maybe 20 people on the dance floor but these 20 people were the people who came from the other restaurants So it was like the face of the clubs, you know, all the bartenders, all the security guys, the rest of the fest, as we say. And they pretty much liked this kind of music. So it was really a great time. I was feeling free, free, free, free. Nobody would point a finger on you. You cannot play this. You cannot do this. It was just freedom. You were playing the entire night? The entire night. So was that the first time that you were playing such long sets? No, as a hip hop DJ you're always the only guy who has to perform the whole night. It was now these days a hip-hop artist comes and plays one and a half hours. But I guess it might have been the first time that you were playing such wide-ranging sets. It was something like this, yes. On a professional basis, yes. I had my booking and I was playing eight hours. And it was, yeah, actually all right. I guess it was a helpful education to be able to figure out how. How to move between these things. Everything, this is when I learned how to move people from the first hour, but keep them dancing to the last hour without dropping all your bombs. Stretch it like a chewing gum. And having a plan in your head already, and I have to be honest, I never prepared at all. I always had a small preparation. My preparation was my record box. Blocks. This was in hip-hop as well. I had my blocks. Bombs. Play before the bombs. play for the girls and this and that and you could see like okay I have just two three records left so play them longer or play something different in between to stretch it to play the bomb later and keep them and this is the education that I got that I brought myself and and yeah it was pretty much amazing by that time I was still visiting a lot of hip-hop parties. I was hated by some hip-hoppers. Started to be hated because it was fake what I was doing. More fake than I was. How much more fake can you be? Now you're extra fake. Now you're 100% fake. But people like Tomek, Odessu, by that time they were respecting me for that. They're like, hey, you're doing the right thing. You're doing the right thing. And we were all... saying the same: it's too much. Too much aggression, too much shootings. I mean the drugs changed. People were starting to do cocaine and hip-hop parties. Cocaine was like... I know that hip-hop acts through Tony Montana, they do it very quietly. It was a drug you don't talk about as a hip-hop guy. Because as a hip-hop guy you cannot lose yourself. You have to be aware what can happen left or right next to you. And all this stuff changed and happened. And by that time, I was more and more hip hop, like I said, become more and more commercial. I was sharing rooms with Westbam, Sven Fitt, Paul Van Dyck, Mark Spoon, whoever their names are. When MTV dropped those big parties, I was in the small room with Tomek, Desu and like these kind of people playing hip hop. Did you ever have any connection before you really grew into the techno scene with those artists? Oh, yeah, Mark Spoon was one of them. Mark Spoon was also the first artist who said, "Hey, you gonna change." I tell you this now. These guys... When did he say that? Why? It was... Everything was around this '97, '98 era. It was all about this time. Because this was the time when also my friends, like I said, had become aggressive and my friends started to move scenes. They didn't go to the hip-hop parties anymore and I didn't even realize it. I saw them going now to techno parties, like in Düsseldorf you had Gattinger Hof. They started to fly to Ibiza. do a proper holiday not like me going to Mallorca with the football team and pretending hip-hop is cool you know and going to I remember there was this club in Playa de Bosa chocolate the only hip-hop club between Ru Palace and DJ Sammy and whoever they are you thought it was the center of the world yeah you know no it wasn't no no it was cheesy by that time but it was the only club no no no no it was we had no center the center of the world was so unreachable it was New York. It was some place I didn't even dream about to fly there and to be there because you had no connection to be honest and also all my connection to the hip-hop acts that I was touring with without internet and telephone forget about it I was sending two three facts back and forth and then the connection stopped you know and that was pretty much it but you know you had like this connection when MTV dropped this party so big promoters did this party they always had a hip-hop floor and they had like the the electronic floor and I I was going always to these floors and checking out what's going on and also through a lot of parties I went through I met one of the first person I met was Talida she was managing Sven Fed and I met a lot of people that are in the electronic scene but they came from hip-hop and they were dancing on my music and dancing so extreme and having so much fun that they couldn't be one of us you understand so you're like hey what's going on and this is how the connection started they started to invite me to rave on snow go to the air rave go here come here come there and i started to first dig what is going on here The atmosphere was peaceful. You could talk to normal people. Even their eyes were big. You could talk to them. A lot of people were extremely friendly to you. And it was for me a nice experience because it was, first of all, I could just, I could go first time to the club and put a smile on my face and not mad dogging. You can't go to a hip hop party and smile and show positive. feelings in the 90s. Otherwise your ass gets kicked. So you had your summer of love, basically. Basically, without drugs, without anything. It was amazing. I loved it. And then I was looking at the atmosphere, how the music was this bass drum. But it was an atmosphere. every track had a meaning, every part had a meaning. Like after 15 minutes it was, I was somewhere else and it was an amazing experience. I'm talking now I get goosebumps. I remember it was so amazing and every party was different. When I went then listening first time to Sven Faith it was too hard for me in the beginning to be honest. I didn't... Techno, even now I love techno. Techno didn't give me the information that I wanted. It was maybe too intelligent or I was too stupid to understand what is it meaning, what does it say. So it was more the usual stuff, you know. It was the house between trance, between I don't know what it was. I can't tell you what it was. But it was an atmosphere which was amazing. And then I saw the DJ. The DJ was not the center. The DJ was a part of it. And I loved it. I loved it so much because it gave more freedom. So basically I was looking for freedom in music, in my mind, in what I was thinking, what I was living. And I was searching for something new. And this new thing was in the electronic music. And well, then my first party, then not my first party, but my first experience under... Something else was in Dorian Gray. They invited me to Dorian Gray and I remember it was DJ Klee working in the second floor and in the first floor it was Mark Spoon's birthday. It was Paul Van Dyke and Mark Spoon. And I knew Paul Van Dyke through other friends. It was Pascal Radon, he was running a label called Orbit from Hamburg. And through hip-hop I came, I was playing in a club in, I forgot the name of the club in Hamburg. I don't know, I was Gaswerk or something like this and they were coming and this is how connections started, you know, they were like... inviting you to their parties welcome you have fun and they saw me i was starting to be really crazy like drinking a lot climbing on the stages and and just being crazy you know just having fun and the electronic music or the electronic scene was allowing me this and i i i took it too much of the freedom being really wild and the beautiful thing is nobody gave a fuck ♪ ♪ The more crazy I went, the more they ignored you. They didn't give a f***. fuck or people like haha yeah cool whatever I'm like okay some people are living in their own world but most of the people really come here to be entertained to listen to music to have a good time to share a drink with people that they don't know and it become more and more mystic more and more interesting and you could spend a night talking to 20 people that you don't know and find out what they really are. Of course, a lot of talks were fake. Here we are again. But a lot of the talks, it's always on you how much serious you take it. And it was for me so interesting to meet doctors, to meet lawyers, to meet... drug addicts, to meet gangsters, to meet all this variety of people who come to a nightlife. And I was sucking all the information and it become for me, wow, I want to stay here. I like it here. And slowly I started to learn about this music where I was in this environment where I was. I was starting to read magazines, I was starting to read mixtapes. I was working for an agency called Blitz Promotion by that time. They helped me doing my parties. to organize the hip-hop parties and they were also doing a lot of techno parties and a lot of being musical director for clubs and by that time they understood that I was moving directions and I was diving more and more and the booker, the musical director by that time, he was too much into party while I was too much into information and the day come and they substitute me with him. I don't know, he didn't show up there more and more. I understood later why, because he was lost in party. And I was there on time and I was hungry and I was fresh and wild. And I never wanted to be a techno DJ. Never. Are you crazy? Never. I was doing my mix match parties. I gave up hip hop. I don't know if it was a career or not. I was really successful. I could live from it. I had pretty tough times by that time. I remember no more credit cards. I had to pay the banks money. I made a lot of debts. And it was not a funny time, to be honest. So I needed a job. And this agency gave me the job. They're like, you know what? You sit here. You make lineups for this. You make lineups for that. We tell you what to do. We help you. It's easy. I'm like, yeah, but it's technical. It's easy. Believe us, it's easy. You only have to understand what the DJs are doing. You have to listen to it. and the rest is feeling. It's pretty much experimenting with things. Things can't go that wrong. Trust us. Okay. Man, day and night, rave line parties. on groove, this, that, boom, boom, boom, what is this DJ doing? I still have my books out. I made plans, like group A is playing this music, group B is playing this music. How do these lineups fit together? How does it fit together? It was like Tetris, it was like a puzzle, but it was so interesting, so beautiful, so amazing, diving into this new thing that it becomes. a new part of my life. We had three record shops by that time. Who were some of the DJs early on that really struck you as being inspirational techno and house-wise around that time? It was Smetfit. How can this motherfucker move so many people? Why do I not understand his fucking music? You said it was too hard for you. It was too hard. I couldn't understand it. I had no connection to his music. And I was scared. Because it was so powerful seeing this guy spinning in front of all these people and his scene, the Frankfurt scene, was hardcore pretty much that time. Old people, Hell's Angels, all these people that you know from hip-hop, there but with white skin, so more dangerous. You know? Of course, of course. You know, it was like... This is the real underground. What you was having was just not real, you know? And bikes and... I'm like, fuck. And it was always Talida, she was always like: "Don't worry man, don't take it too hard, it's easy, just dive to it, like I dance to hip-hop, you dance to techno." And by that time, yeah, he was the one who... You had by that time the big German scene with Talar, Taucha, all this trance thing was big. I found it ridiculous by that time, because it was for me... I didn't find a sense into it. I like the beats, but every time this part came... Was there a set or a moment with Sven where you were like, ah, I get this now? It was in Ibiza, the first Cocoon Days. So I was standing there and I was trying to understand what is track by track, what story is he telling me? And then comes the magic moment of Sven Feth. This is what nobody in this world can ever make the same. Same like Sven does. Playing six hours, giving you non-stop... And then the first sun comes. You feel that the light is coming. And this guy turned a fucking techno madness party into such a love party. So much feelings and emotions with music. He was known for meeting the king of after-hour. Man, I had no clue. And after-hour for me was also boom, boom, boom, boom. But he played so different. And this was the moment when I'm like, I understand. You have to be here six hours to hear that now. It doesn't work the other way around. And then all this gather around a community. having all your Parsi with you. So it was pretty much what I was having in my hip-hop days. I was seen. Was it 99? It was, yeah. 99. 99, 2000, something like this. And I was like, wow. I like this. And I was with the people. I was with the flow. I was accepted pretty much fast. accepted not as the hip-hop dice or something, just accepted as a person, which was in general electronic music or techno music. You are one of everyone. There is no "you are cooler than me" or whatever. He was playing his after-hour music and I liked it, I liked it. I remember it was FX Twin by that time, it was Matthias Schaffhäuser and all these hits that he made big. It was, I remember Tony Senghor, "What about love" or something, was a remix with the vocals. Man, he played six hours just electronic music and then... vocals, people screaming, the sun is shining, all that Ibiza cliche. But I loved it. I needed something to dive in. And then he was trying to find those records. How to find those records now? You cannot go to the DJ and ask him. I was too scared. Are you crazy? Even though you were putting... him on lineups for stuff. I was not putting him on lineups. Sven Fitt was Sven Fitt. He's doing his thing. That was the first rule they gave me in the office. This number, you never ever call this number when they gave me the sheet of number. You never ever ask. this number. Like why? If we book this person, I do it. I'm the boss. Different story. All the others you can call. Go ahead, do whatever you want. Find your way. It was some difficult artists as well. And also another nice thing for me to learn about artists, how the artists are. Some of them I'm like, I never ever want to be like you guys, man. How can you make my life so difficult? You know, how can you give me the fuck finger right away through the telephone? What assholes are you? And I understood there was also this rock and roll thing, like in hip hop, so it was pretty much the same bullshit after a while, you know? Also people talking bullshit here, tomorrow they don't even know you, they don't even recognize you, hot air. Good experience. Good experience, you know? So somehow... Now, like I said in the beginning, you cannot invent anything. Everything was there, everything. Even if it's techno, rock or whatever. And now I'm 36 and I pretty much lived in all scenes and I experienced a lot of stuff. And I have to say, everything is the same. So live your life, have your good people around you and then everything is cool. I guess the first time I ran into your name was the Green and Blue compilation. And I was like, I apologize in advance, but I was like, who the hell is this guy with Ricardo Villobos? As an American living in America, I was like, I... I don't know this other person doing this mix CD. How did you get to that point? You know, where you were on the other side, you know, on the other disc? It was, you know, I think I was different to a lot of artists by that time. It started in the year 2001, 2003. I started to... Find my style. Okay, I'm a not respected artist in electronic scene. Maybe I will never be respected because I come from another background. I had a lot of help because I knew certain people, they were big fans of me as the person dies without even knowing what I'm doing. So I had to work hard and I had these three record stores here in Dusseldorf which was Flipside, Voices and Soundsgood. And Soundsgood was a progressive label but the two gay guys, they were pretty much New York and London. They went to Studio 54, they went to Tunnel, they went to Limelight, they went to all the places that you can name. And Wilfried and Dieter, they... saw something in me, I think, because I was hungry and I came without any "it has to be this way or that way". I was just "okay, give me a direction". And I have to thank them so much for this education that they gave me. They teach me a lot about the gay scene. They were the guys who showed me, even if it's progressive and trans, they showed me They showed me G-Man, they showed me Plastic Man, they showed me Victor Calderon, they showed me Denny Tanagria. They gave me all the input that I needed and I was so thankful for them. because it was the other side. Later they showed me Sasha, John Digweed. They made me buy compilations by DJs, listen to what they are doing. I became a huge fan of Danny Tanaglia. Danny Tanaglia changed my life in many ways because he was combining techno with house music and the other. And Voices was helping me a lot to find the records I was looking for. Klaus was the one who was selling me the first hip-hop records. Then I was looking for Bubbling, which was... reggae records pitched on 45. I know what you're looking for. I try to find it for you. And that was the magic power of a record store. Helping you define your style with records that nobody has. Because you are cool. You are his friend. So he will get you this record. Because when you play it, it is his goal. You bought it from him and he's the leader. the glory days of a record store. Then, you know, I learn and learn and my music was always: I have to earn my respect, but I have not to be fake! and not to be a wannabe. How can I do it? And then I found out that all these people, what are they playing? And I'm like, yeah, I have to be different. And I discovered the B-sides. I discovered old records. I discovered NRK. I discovered Nervous. I discovered so many labels. basically American labels that a lot of German artists didn't play by that time. And we are talking about the early days when Ricardo was for sure by that time far away from all the other guys. With Atta, with Playhouse, with all this. To me, too difficult. Another difficult person to understand. But he was house music to me. Because what he played... I was never into this Ricardo thing. I never was. I come from a totally different scene, from different other people. And I met him. And... I think maybe he liked what I was doing because it was maybe without pressure, without I have to, without I could drop old records without being scared, can I play them? I think, yeah, it's quite, obviously you came in without a lot of context of like, oh, I can't play this record because five... years ago it was cheesy or something exactly and then people in the audience must be like wow he's went to you exactly it's a good record this is fresh to me yeah totally right and this is it and also the combination of bringing old english jams with old american jams together in a I say the terrible word progressive way, you know, but come on, man, this was cool music. And my goal was I never played the headlining spots. I just I was the warm up DJ. What do I learn from the hip hop days and boogie night days is the night is eight hours. I have no bombs. If I come, I know there are certain bombs, but these bombs can be too cheesy. Because I started with French vocal house. I started with Sneak, Armand Van Helden. All this was a different world to the world of techno. So what can I take from here to there? I can take some... Armand Van Helden beats, I still play them. I can take some sneak beats without the piano and the guitar or just play the beginning of it before it starts to go in another direction. And I think this was my secret and what helps me a lot and discovering old records, discovering Ritchie Horton. This motherfucker changed me as well again. What is minimal music please? What is Robert Hood? Who is Daniel Bell? What is Detroit? I had no clue there was also Detroit. For me it was London, it was Bristol, sorry not even London, it was Bristol and it was New York City and it was Chicago. Wait a minute, that was Detroit, you know, what is this? And you know, and I sucked all this and I tried to see it from a hip-hop way, you know, being friendly, playing with the mood, creating a vibe and finishing as close as possible. to the peak as possible without driving them crazy that the other DJ can easily dive and continue what I was doing and also playing music that you pretty old-school bass drum in bass drum out kick in kick out creating an attention by the people letting them dance groove And then at a certain point, this certain record, when the bass drum comes in, you see the hands in the air and it's like a moment of joy. But bring them down again and play. And I think some people discovered that I was different, that I was by that time playing maybe quality music without even knowing that it was quality music. And I got the chance and slowly I started to have these jobs and then yeah, I mean Green and Blue was already late. I had already something before. You were at DC10 2002? I think DC10 2002 was my first gig. Was that, I mean obviously it became a big thing for you but you know even the first couple of times you played there, were you like this? It's kind of my element. It was the place. Because now we're going back in 2000 when I was in Ibiza already. It was space. Sundays at Space was there. magic thing you go if you go to Ibiza there was no cocoon there was no nothing it was Sundays in space yeah you go there and you listen to Morello Sasha Jeff I don't know if Jeff Mills were there by that time you listen to all this music which was for me Man, I was drunk by that time. Let's go crazy. Let's rock and roll. But I came early because the magic started early and I found this out. And because I was always hungry about this. It was this guy called Jose de Vina. And Jose de Vina was a Spanish guy who... played the records that I wanted. He played the records that should be played at DC-10 in the beginning. And let's be honest, DC-10 in the beginning was an underground place, but you had people like Lotti and Piton and all those people played there. It was very much English. So to explain you how it was, it was... I came early to space to listen to cool music, get drunk fast to have a good time, and after space, where there's after hours. You had the jockey club at the beach and this and that. Now just to explain you, because a lot of people say Ibiza. Ibiza had also its underground side. And this was the underground side. It was the other DJs who were playing what's been played maybe in techno clubs in Germany, but more Balearic, more soul, more drums, more percussions, maybe some vocals, without being cheesy. being really raw and dry and beat driven. And I was hunting for this because the rest was there but the others was underground. And you know partying instead of coming like a stupid tourist with all the English and Germans and wearing this chic Nike things going then to an after party being with... normal people actually, people that you have more all these tattoos, beards, freaks, hippies, people who are not showing off with clothing or this and that, people who are there because they love the music. And the music was so different. And again, I saw the DJ was not the center. The dance floor was the center. It was Mark Spoon. who said to us Germans by that time, guys, we gotta go to that place that I discovered. And another friend was like, fuck, that's a whorehouse. We cannot go there. That's horrible. We get arrested. They're going to fuck us. They're going to do everything with us there. Don't go there. And my eyes, I remember, cling. I want to go there. This is the place I want to go. And Mark Spoonhole said, I know you kids, we can work. I knew it. I knew it. Come with me. And we went there, man. It was my first time. what was his name, Gary, he was the tour manager of Carcox, Robert Zakic, the tour manager of Sven Feth, and Mark Spoon and me, like pretty much super hardcore party guys together, crazy guys together, going to DC10. I arrived there and everything went fast. To remind me to my first hip-hop club. You come in, this fucking huge bouncer, no line, everything fast. Go in. We didn't even pay. And all of a sudden I was inside this dark cave. And Cirillo was playing dark techno. It was so slow. It was so dark and so intensive. It was something I never hear in my life before. And seeing all these people there was like, whoa. Mark Spoon really gave us the best introduction. Straight to the bar, a bottle of vodka. and try to understand what's going on here. Did it feel like you weren't even on the island anymore? No. I was not in Ibiza anymore. I was in this no man's land. I had this again with Panorama Bar. I had it again with some other clubs in my life. And this is, when you say, this is the zone, the zone, free zone of whatever. It's another land. It's another dimension. It's totally different. And some people from the Sunday parties, I recognized some people I knew from the Frankfurt parties and everybody was on his own, doing his thing, partying. No, Hawaii, simple. And then the terrace opened around 11 o'clock and they pushed us all out to the terrace. And it was, yeah, Jose de Vina and then Tanya and some other DJs playing this beat. And I'm like, wow. And I recognize my style in it, in the kind of way what I was playing, but a top better, because it was records that I didn't know and that would make my set complete. I'm like, wow, hey, and this is how everything started. And DC-10 was the top secret thing ever. I brought by that day Timo Maas, I brought him in. I'm like, I have to show you something. I was bringing all my DJ friends to there. I'm like, God, you have to see it, you have to see it. 50% said it's totally rubbish and boring because the music was slow. The music was a lion. And what I didn't understand, but I understood there was the DJ team was playing for the end. So you start at 11 o'clock. You don't pump it because there are... six other DJs playing after you. And it was about the finishing. The finishing was Cirillo, who played the oldies, and the DJ before, who could play whatever he wants, was the guest, and the resident who can pump it up. And another education for me, how can it be that DJs can work so nicely, hand in hand together? And that was for me a nice education when I dived into the Circo Loco thing and DC Ten. without talking to each other, but being there. Don't come just to your set. Being there. You knew what records you can play and not. Some certain records were Clive Henry's records. You don't touch these records. It's his records. Either he played or not played, it's his records. And it was again for me a challenge to hunt for more tunes, for more having your own style, but combine it with the whole collective. What were some of your records? By that time I was playing Nick Holder a lot. All the Nick Holder stuff was my secret weapon. Nobody knew it by that time. Maybe of course somebody knew it, but for me it was... I was the one who was playing that stuff. I had... I started then to dig deeper into some... call it minimal stuff. Like I said, G-man. I was playing a lot of G-man, Kuwades and all that stuff. and I was playing then by that time, I don't know, Daniel Bell stuff, and things become more, became more a form, more different to what the others are doing, but connected to what the others are doing. Some records were like by Peace Division, by Clive, he never played his own records. I knew that Danny Tenaglia was a big fan of his album by that time, and I did two, three songs. songs which were not popular, which were like very short three minute songs, but they fitted perfectly in my set and they were so different and unrecognizable that it was something special for me. You know, going on and on every Monday and presenting something where you know 50, 60, 70% don't have a clue what it is, but they are jamming to it. Amazing, amazing, amazing. And it was like, you know... How did you get the gig there? I mean, obviously, it went quite well. that you became a resident for a while? I was, like I said, I was doing mix CDs and my mix CDs were based not in playing the records which were on the wall of the record stores, other records. creating something different. Like I said, I have no pressure. I can do whatever I want. And for me it was, I understood I have to do something which was for the radio. Till now, I try to make compilations or records which are for your boombox, for your iPod, for home, for an after hour, before you go to work. Nothing which can irritate you or after a while can be... like annoying so it has to be some beats with moods and vibes which I hate to say timeless music kind of way you know and what I didn't know is that the actual girlfriend of Cirillo by that time she's from Dusseldorf and she had one of my mix CDs and by that time I was also working for Timo Maas and I don't know and I came and Cirillo asked me by that day do you please come and play with Timo in Rome at Goa in Rome and I'm like I will not do it because I will not start to play with Timo Maas here in Europe because people might think that I'm getting my job because I'm working for Timo Maas. I have pretty much my bookings without Timo, even before Timo I had my name somehow, and I don't want to destroy it by that. And he's like, listen guys, you're my, he's like, I like your sound, I listen to the CD, you are really true supporter of DC-10. I was not a DC-10 resident by that time, it was before 2002. I'm asking you to come. I don't give a fuck what people think or not. And it was really a conflict for me. And I said yes, somehow. I'm like, okay. I don't even remember if my name was on the flyer or if I wanted to be on the flyer. But you know, it was something... I'm like, hey, I built up something so nicely on my own, I don't want to destroy it now by this thing. And later the time will teach me that even this, this doesn't give a fuck. People will always find something. They'll always find something. Sure. Anyway, and I played there. I played the first hour. And Giancarlino... the residents supposed to play before and he was so excited by hearing me play more than Timo that he said go ahead you I play now he played three songs and he's like you start to play now so I started to play and it was amazing and what I didn't know is that the both Circo Loco guys Antonio and Andrea were behind me listening the whole session and The party went very well, amazing. And after that, Chelo came to me and he's like, yo, it's another three months till the season. He's like, I want to invite you to come to Ibiza. You stay in my house and I want you to come and play. Cool. I had my jobs already in Ibiza. I played space. I played manumission after hours. So, but this club was magic. I'm like, wow. And I'm like, but with Timo or something, no. Not Timo, you! And that made me proud. I'm like, okay. I will be the first one who played there. Ricardo was already there. He was the German, but for the Germans he was always the strange guy. So it was mostly Spanish DJs? Spanish Italian DJs. No other DJ was in the circle. The only English was Clive Henry. The rest, Spanish, was Tania Vulcano, it was Cirillo. It was José de Vina, it was Fabrizio, it was later René, System of Survival, Clive Henry, and later comes the French guy Danganassia, but it was pretty much one team. And we... it was like a family. And Andrew Grant. My man. He's for me an amazing artist, an amazing person. And yeah, this is how things started. I went there and I played in the beginning, like 3 o'clock or something. It was cool. And then Cirillo asked me if I want to play with him at the end. and I should drop bombs. I'm like, what bombs? He's like, if you have hits in your back, you play them. And I was scared. I'm like, wow. And I tried to make it different. Tried to make hits more... techno based, more drumming, more harder and it worked fantastic and the owner said to me like, "Hey, what are you doing next Monday?" I'm like, I can be here. My ticket was Wednesday back. So yeah, I cancelled my tickets. I didn't even book a new ticket. And it was like pretty much every Monday they said they asked me if I want to come the next Monday, if I want to come the next Monday. And it took me two years till I become an official resident. This is typical Chocoloco style. Keep you hanging. But it was good. Another education in my life. And then everything started. And the Germans, the Germans, started to look at me. I was always at Cocoon. The only DC-10 artist who goes to Cocoon. You have to understand that Cocoon was totally something else on that. It was kind of revolutionary. It was not going well for Ricardo on the Terrace. It was empty. People hated the music. People didn't understand what it was. It was Ibiza, don't forget. And what Sven Fed was doing, he brought his fans. So it was pretty full. He had a full room because they took the plane to come to fly and party for him. No Ibisenko. And maybe some Ibisenkos who knows him from the past. And I was pretty much there to see the whole evolution, how everything was going on. And then understanding this phenomenon, Ricardo Villalobos, for me, he was just a DJ. and who performed really well in DC Tandem because he was playing pretty much like I was playing, like the others were playing. Why didn't it translate in the beginning at Cocoon? You said it was quite empty on the car. Because people didn't understand it. Because also Cocoon had the concept to bring every Monday a club as a host. They had M1, they had Monza, who are hosting the... terrace. They had What's Up with Mr. C and all that. It didn't really work well. People came to Cocoon to go to Sven Feth, not staying on the terrace. The terrace was just... I remember Josh Wink when he played for M1. Nobody! Nobody! The sound system was shit. It was nothing. The bartenders with the face like this, not being happy, what the shit music is this, you know? Come on, it was the devil coming to the island. Techno and... What was the other music? "Haus"? We don't like this German "Haus". And Ricardo? What is he doing? And yeah, they didn't understand it. And the people from DC-10 didn't go to KUKU. I mean, hey, two o'clock, you were happy that the daytime party was finished, you know? But I was going, I was supporting, I was with Talida, I was with Robert, I was with those people. Never VIP, always on the dance floor, listening, what's going on? I wanted to learn techno. What is techno? And slowly I get to what was going on. When did you feel like you got to the point where, I mean, of course you're still learning, but when did you get to the point where you're like, I understand. Do you feel like the mix CD was kind of like a... culmination of that like early education in a way? It was pretty much a lot of things. It was the green and blue and it was this what the English called the minimal explosion which started to be I started to be recognized as an artist. I was, English people start to come up to me and saying, we like what you are doing. I remember Carl Cox when he was in DC-10 in 2003 or something like this. He stepped up to me and he's like, I like what you are doing. I like it a lot. And I understand what you are doing. And it's totally different to the others. It doesn't give me anything. It was just cool. Thank you. Wow, Carl Cox. Don't get me wrong, but all these artists, they didn't mean anything to me. My heroes were solely other people. If Ice-T comes to me and says to me, "Your rap is dope, man!" I would be like, "Yo!" What? I don't know. But he was such a cool guy. When Danny Tanaglia came the first time, he was like, whenever you come to New York, I want you to open up for me. DC-10 opened a lot of doors for me to show what I was doing. DC-10 also made a big mistake, which was the key to my success. It was a time when I was... I was pretty much fed up after the first year from drums and percussions. And I took more and more of this German music. which was not German music but it was techno and Steve Buck came out with Loverboy long time ago and I had it but I never played it because it was so different to what I was playing and then it was the time in 2003-4 when I was like hey I can combine these things a little bit together and it worked. And I had to learn how can I go out from percussions or go into percussions again or solely house music and changing the mood without interrupting the flow. And DC-10 was for me the best place to try it and do it because the people they didn't give a fuck what you are playing. pressure again and then they banned me from a good time which was the opening time to the time three o'clock which was a bad time because 12 yeah three o'clock because this was the time when the people who came from the app We're about to leave the place and fresh people come in. So you had this balance. So it was so difficult to create a vibe at that time. We call it the dead time. We hate it this time. And people like Ricardo. played love to play this time I didn't know why I thought he was also banned like me and I was banned because I he's they started to laugh at me and doing like Hitler when you say ban you mean they made you play yes they said hey you have to play this time And why? Because it was too German for them. It was too teutonic, it was too techno. I don't know, they made really stupid jokes. Some of them said "Nazi music". It was really people without being stupid saying "Hey, this is shit what you are doing now". But the owners, they didn't say it was shit, they said "You play it this time". And it was the biggest mistake because also by that time, and this I found out later, this is what Ricardo knew because Ricardo was Ibiza. In the corners, you had 200 gay Spanish people. In the other corner, you had those crazy Italians from Naples. And you had... You had only to read the dance floor. Don't look in the middle, but look in the corners. And then you can have fun. And I understood this. And I'm like, fucking Ricardo, man. He knew it. Or maybe he didn't know it. I don't know. You know, he was a mysterious guy. Okay. The times changed, people started to come earlier and then I had my crowd. First time I had my crowd and people were really coming to hear Loco dies. How long did it take? It took one and a half years, two years, maybe three years. Even then when I thought I got it, it was not really there. It was maybe an illusion. You cannot... you don't know, you never know. You know it when it's obvious, you know? But then you forget how many years you worked on it. And then I get my first guest appearance on Cocoon. Johannes asked me like, "Hey, come and play." I think my first gig was with Steve Buck on the terrace and it was cool. And I really, I always stick to what I can do best, warming up. Perfect, perfect. I felt so comfortable, I felt so 100% sure with what I was doing. I still had no pressure and I was playing in one of the coolest clubs in the world. It was DC10. Even it was not recognized or noticed by that time from the big audience. It was already. And it was a time when we created something totally new on Ibiza, like Cocoon. And still, we didn't come together. It was still DC-10 music and it was still Cocoon music. And DC-10 still had the progressive acts coming, or the English acts coming, and Cocoon was pretty much... Carcox was playing by that time. It was really hard inside the room. The terrace started to be... I think through Chirco Loco, the terrace became its face in Cocoon. Both clubs helped each other somehow. The music starts to merge. I started to bring more and more people with me. I remember it was Tanya, Andrew Grant, System of Survival, even Cherelo. "Come, let's go to Kukun." The owners came and then the crazy Ricardo was able to move his crazy people to the terrace. It took him also two years or something like this. And then the terrace was... A small tip, underground. But I partied on the terrace, but I was always looking at the main floor, man. This main floor, fucking Jeff Mills. I think Jeff Mills played there. So many artists that I only know from magazines. Wow. This is what they call this kind of music. Ah, this is Adam Bauer. This is Marco Carolla. I remember Marco blowed me away. He was playing a warm-up set for Sven and Napoli was on the dance floor. It was Italy! This day, Circo Loco became very early empty. And I didn't know why. And the Italians told me: "Marco Carola is playing in Cucul." Like, wow. And I was for them Italian. Even for the Cocoon people, I was not the German. I was the Italian. I was the Spanish. I was the other guy. I was one of them. And I'm still I am. And I have to say, I have to thank not the club, I have to thank the people on the dance floor a lot for who I am now and who I became. Because at the end, the people allow me to educate myself and they give me the education and they help me and they support me. And till now, I always say the best moment to experience music, to learn about music, to learn about all the scenes is you have to... on the dance floor, not dancing and listening, living this lifestyle like I lived in hip-hop, hanging with these people, going with them to the after-hours, listening to what their conversations are, listening to what they like, what they don't like, how do they see techno or music in general, because it's not about being a nerd and following... all these rules and systems and all that. At the end it's a lifestyle. It's something you follow and you want to live and you want to escape from your reality into it. It's the freedom, it's the dreams, it's everything. And I discovered that it's not mainly about music so much. It's mainly about the atmosphere, the vibe. I guess for a while you were putting out records on a lot of different labels. You were just sort of cherry picking, giving things to, you know, something to Minus, something to 2020 Vision. When did you feel like you were at a point where you could be, for lack of a better word, the brand? You know, when you wanted to, you know, create your own label. I never had this thought of being a brand. I had to realize that it worked this way or it has to go this way. The day you make the next step, your whole life will change. And it's not. about being any more hot. It's then about, fuck, you have to deliver. It's a job. You are responsible. Do you have a date? Or, you know, you said when you take this step, was it when you started the label? Right now. It was right after the releases. You know, I had an amazing time. I was able to work with the best producer, in my opinion, one of the best producers of the world. A producer who allowed me, without being the general mind behind the computer, but allowing me to be a part of the production. Not sitting just there and saying, I want it this way or that way. telling me, "Hey, it's your track. How do you want to produce this track? How do you want to make it?" And learning everything and going through the whole process and to be 100% behind every record I make, saying, "It's my record!" And it reflects what I experienced on the dance floor, or it reflects the movie that I have in my head, the story that I want to tell. And it was in a time when my DJing became very successful in a small scene. Some eyes were looking at me. It was when Ricardo and all these people came and said, hey. "Wow, it's cool what you're doing." And I was in the studio and I was... sucking all this information and I'm like Martin look Martin but Martin but it has to go this way How dies I'm like, okay, I show you this records This bass drum I'm looking for and he was like a pretty easy. Don't show me. Here's the library. Let's go through and I was able to learn how does the bass drum sound naked? You know? And by that time you know exactly what bass drum you want, what snare you want, what drumming, what... percussion kid, what do you want? Because he didn't know which world I was living in. - Had he watched you DJ that much? - Yes, he was a fan of my DJing. He was a big fan of what I was doing before. He loved the way I was performing. He loved the way I was. We found a lot of similar things. He's also hip-hop, he's a skater, I'm not. But we found a lot of things we are together. Also, I think he liked the way I am and what I wanted. I wanted at the end really just being a DJ, making music at the end, you know. And never being annoying, I want to produce or I want to follow, I want to do this kind of sound or that sound. I've experienced it so many times where he looked at me and he's like, "Fuck, you obviously know exactly what you want every time. Even you want to change the mood, you know which direction it's going." And he worked with Timo, he worked with a lot of artists and I gotta be happy because he sticked to it. with me you know and after the first call come the second call come let's do something together and I realized that I was giving him a lot of input from the dance floor and and every time we made some beautiful records together he had it was a time when Martin wanted to escape you know and want wanted to make his own thing as well you know And it was for me very important because here we are again. I'm doing records with somebody who's on the record but obviously it was not Loco Dice and Martin Buttrich because For Martin, it's a Loco Dice record. And when Martin does something and I help him, it's a Martin Buttrich record. Even we do the shit together. He saw it from a hip-hop way like me when Dr. Dre works with Eminem or Jay-Z works with the Neptunes, you know. And even then, it's still not, of course, it comes from his computer, but it's not his beats. It's our beats. It's our music. He understands what I want. When I come with this face... And you're pushing him to leave it alone and keep... And he's kind of very precise in it. When you do the interview with Martin, he will tell you exactly the same. It's always, for me, the track is already finished after three hours. But then comes this magic word. It needs one sound. And I look at him, I'm like, Martin. And by the years, I know it's not a sound. It's another three hours. It's another five hours. It's something. Because I come from the hip-hop, so I know the arrangement. I know exactly how the song, how the structure should be. I made already the arrangement. When I did "La bicicleta" with Marco Carolla, I already had the arrangement. He was looking at me: "Fuck, the track is ready!" "This is the worst thing I hate: the arrangement!" I have the loop, but I don't have the arrangement. And Martin is a song guy. Man, this guy produce songs, not tracks. And for him... It's a big help that the arrangement is there, but for him a track needs hooks. It needs the song character. And when I start to look for a sound, it's not what he's looking for. He's looking for this main thing, which is maybe hidden, but it is the main thing to make the song complete. I remember interviewing Martin a couple of years ago and he said that The label, when it was beginning, was certainly just like tracks that you two were just sort of like, oh man, we've got to have this release. This needs to get a release. And now you have a family of artists that are involved with the label. It's evolved a little bit, but you still have these moments, I think, sprinkled in that are total left turns. total like that doesn't fit into what I'm supposed to think Desolade is. The Pasorani record that just came out. Räuber in the Prince, Pusar. Yeah. Just to name the lately ones. But it started in the beginning already. After Rip Cage releasing Rosario and Tenulu with Sentimental. Yeah. What, I mean, does it feel tough to be like pushing almost two ideas at once? Almost schizophrenic in a way. Like, you know, because I... do feel like you're you know bringing some of these artists up like Guti but at the same time you're also following your passions as a record collector totally I never wanted to have a label in my life never never Martin had already two or three labels so I don't know and it was a disaster as he said with 420. We never wanted a label and in New York we didn't think about the label. We were thinking about doing this album and having a good time and live, live in New York. To say once to our kids we lived in New York. Even it was a short time we lived, it's so intensive it felt like three years. And like Martin said we had these tracks and every track had a funny story. Rip Cage was there already a year or something in my hands and I never recognized it until I go to the party where Dubby was playing and I was like: "Wow, we like this track! You fuckers, you had this track a half year ago!" And I sent this track to another label, I don't want to name it, and they said: "No!" And we were sitting and it was actually Martin's idea to be honest saying: "Ma, Dias, you have all these cool tracks that we love and every time we play these tracks and party before we start productions or when we play PlayStation, play this track again and it was by that time we had uh danny ocean and we had rib cage and um yeah two different things you know and and he was like saying hey we should we should bring it out oh my martin a label not again a dj with his label and this and that And Tom, my partner, was all the time saying, "Hey, you have to bring your ideas and feelings, you guys have to bring it together and you can only do it with a label to show the people what you are thinking." I don't know, Martin was like, "We can do it." I'm like, "Well, we can do it. I have pretty much no idea how to run a label. I know it from hip hop and this and that, but well." As much I learned techno, I can't write about how to run a label somehow. And we decided together, how should it be? We want to make money, we want to... What we want to do. And it's not what you said. Actually... It's our record collection. This is our collection of music without giving a fuck what other people can say, might think or whatever. We don't care. Because at the end we both come from two different scenes, you know, not really respected artists. We just want to bring out cool music where we think we stay behind it 100%. Desolade should be really just a mother who have all the... little kids around and they go to the playground and they do something. Nothing really specific, no direction, no nothing. I don't know, maybe one day I will release a hip-hop track. When the time is right and the track is right. I can't tell you, I don't know. It's feelings, the time must be right and this is how we pick the tracks and this is how much love we put in the tracks. without thinking it can sell this amount? No. It deserves to be released on record. Thank you. Thank you.
