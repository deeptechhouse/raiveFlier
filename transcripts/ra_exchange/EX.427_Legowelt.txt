Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resonant Advisor. This week's exchange is a recording of a conversation I had with Danny Wolfers as part of this year's RA Conference program at Deckmantel Festival. The Dutch artist is best known for making houses Lego felt, but the project has managed to encompass much more than music. He's managed to become synonymous with esoteric synthesizers, a few of which he picked out and explained during the interview. He's also something of an underrated artist, so we had him describe some of the methods and thinking behind his bizarrely imaginative album covers. Then there's the visibility he's given to cyberzines and pre-internet subcultures in general. I asked him about some of the influences on his own excellent Shadow Wolf scene. and heard about its most recent issue, which was made by Wolfers with a class of students during a workshop he gave on the topic last year. Overall, it was a chance to hear him shed a light on the constellation of interests that have shaped an artist who's much more influential than appearances may indicate. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with LEGO VELT is up next. You know, you get credit for a lot of things, but I feel personally that one of your talents, which is maybe a little bit underappreciated, in my opinion, is the artwork you've been doing for your label Nightwind Records. It's all really vivid stuff which gets the imagination going. And, you know, some of it looks like it's made by software, some of it looks like it's pencil, some of it looks like it's paint and stuff. I just want to start with one example, which is the Rising Sun Systems record. You gotta check it out. It's like... Igor Stravinsky, I think, this Russian composer in a landscape in front of a snow-capped mountain with pastries of some description. Croissants. Yeah, that's the pastry and it's Mount Fuji on the background. Yeah, as I said, the texture of it is extremely vivid. I was just wondering if you could tell us how you made that specific artwork. Well, that artwork was just made in Photoshop. I first drew the pictures, like the black and white pictures with a fine liner. And then I scanned it and colored it. in Photoshop so it's not really exciting stuff but actually last week or two days ago I actually repainted that picture because that release is going to be reissued on vinyl of course four years ago when I made that release I saved it like in the lowest quality possible so it was not possible to use that for a LP cover so then I just used watercolors again to paint it and made it a little bit better with some more depth in it. Dare I ask where images like these come from? Do you have the idea for floating croissants around Stravinsky before you start drawing? Or is it used to start drawing something and then it appears while you're doing it? No, it is very influenced by the music. So the music comes first, the album is created basically, and then also the title and stuff and maybe the whole concept. But yeah, this album doesn't really have a concept. It's a lot of different characters or characteristics and emotions or whatever put together. Yeah, then I just think, well, it needs some artwork. And the track title of one of the tracks is, of course, Croissants with Stravinsky or something. I don't even know. And yeah, so then I just... make that you know and oh yeah so yeah but but sometimes it's the other way around then i i paint something uh just just random like and then i think what this would make a really good album cover and then i'm just make a release around that Can you give an example of one of those where it's gone the other way around like that? Let's see. I don't think I didn't release an example of that yet on my label, Nightwind Records. Something is going to be probably released next year and it's going to be called The Golden Age of Flying Boats, about old Pan Am 1930s flying boats and that. kind of interbellum atmosphere and I got a lot more paintings that could be releases but of course I can make the music like in I don't know three days probably for an album but I shouldn't also not I call it extort that or squeeze it out too much. You know, I gotta be a little bit timid with releasing stuff, else the audience will get tired maybe, you know. - How long have you been drawing and painting for? Is this something you've been doing since childhood or? - Well, I actually studied animation at an art school or sort of art school. So I'm trained to draw and stuff like that. And when I was a kid, I really liked to draw. And I always wanted to be like a, how do you call it, like a comic maker, a graphic novelist. But that didn't exist that turn. I was young. But then I got a computer when I was young and I stopped drawing. I got interested in electronic music, so this hobby was in the fridge, so to speak. But yeah, it came back like four years ago. I just started drawing again and I have so much fun drawing. When I draw, I'm really laughing out loud and stuff. It's a bit weird, but yeah. You can sense the joy in the images. Like there's the electronic music from the Faroe Islands, 1993, where it's a dolphin or a shark. Yeah, it's the dolphins that get killed on that island every year. He's got a big grin and he's wearing sunglasses and holding a synthesizer. He looks like he's having a great time. Yeah, it's kind of like a fake tourist advertisement for the island, but with some, yeah, maybe some kind of animal rights, how do you call it, to question the Faroe Islands, but also not. Did you ever manage to make it there? Because I know in the notes... It's that you felt some kind of gravitational pull to the place. Yeah, but so far I haven't been there yet. It's also quite difficult to reach, I think. You have to go to Norway first. There's not really much to do there, I think. And with that whole animal rights thing, I'm always afraid if I go there, they will think I'm an animal rights activist. get kicked off the island or something, you know. Speaking of animal rights, you made a record for a real film, a film about a beast called the Skunk Ape. Yeah. Also known as the Swamp Cabbage Man and other names. I'm sure the audience might not know about the skunk ape. Can you maybe fill them in? The skunk ape is the Florida version of Bigfoot. I guess most people are familiar with Bigfoot. It's a cryptozoological creature that people think exists, but it has never been proven. And I think it doesn't exist, though, because Elsie... found already but maybe it existed like one time you know and this whole world from cryptozoological people or that scene is very interesting because these people really research and really believe it exists and some people think they have seen it and I always am very fascinated with this thing, you know, that people believe in something. It's basically like fantasy. And this documentary was made by Brett Abrahams. And yeah, it's about the Florida version of it that roams around in the swamps there. And he interviews some very strange people. try to capture it and stuff and I was asked to do the soundtrack for that and of course I think that was a good match I think so yeah I did that I released it on a cassette on a Twin Records label so yeah There's another really interesting record on Nightwind. I won't disrespect the audience by trying to pronounce the Dutch title, but it apparently translates to rustlings from Somberville. And you did this with Jimmy Helenga. Yeah, he's here too. He's an expert in medieval instruments, hurdy-gurdy and stuff like that, and also in harmonium, which is not medieval, but he can play that very well. That release started when I bought a harmonium from the late 19th century. And a harmonium is kind of like an air organ. And they're beautiful instruments, like with lots of woodcarving and huge... Yeah, it's almost like an antique closet with mirrors in it and little doors where you can... closets where you can put stuff in and i saw it in the local thrift store and it was 70 euros so i bought it immediately and it worked perfectly yeah i thought well it maybe it's cool to do uh do something with it and i involved jimmy with it to to make a a release with that and It was kind of based by the very melancholical darkness in our local seaside town. And the harmonium is also a very nautical instrument because for some reason it sounds like a wooden ship that's creaking. If you play it, because there's so much wood, it really sounds like you're on an... old wooden ship so yeah we made that album it was actually made for the concert center which is a local classical music station on the radio and they uh how do you call it they um they said yeah you you want to make this and then we said yeah sure there's a real fancy word for that Commission? Yeah, that's it, yeah. I always like to use that word, because, you know, like we're commissioned by a classical music radio station. That's something your parents would like. So they think, oh, he's a real musician, they think then or something. But it was a really fun project. And yeah, we combined it with a Mixtur Troutonium, which is a very strange German instrument from the... and invented in the 1930s by oscar sala and um i i built like a copy of that using the dubfer which is a german brand and they're the only ones i think that actually make a cheap version of it because you can buy a real mixture tritonium for a lot of money but it's a very interesting um it's basically one of the first synthesizers kind of made in in germany and you can play it with like two metal wires Because I want to ask about this, because the Dupfer one, he said he replaced it with something more like a ribbon controller. Yeah, with a normal ribbon controller, yeah. Because the other one's so unreliable or something like that. Well, I don't know, but it's very expensive. Then you already pay €4,000 for just a controller or something, and then you have to pay €10,000 for the synthesizer itself. The Dupfer one is a lot cheaper, yeah. So what do you think gives the instrument its character? I know it has a lot of formant filters in it and things like this, but is it mainly the interface, this ribbon controller style thing? Yeah, because you can, with the wire controller or the ribbon controller, you can free float between normal notes, you know? It's not like a piano keyboard. whatever but you can play normal notes because they're on the original there's like a metal kind of spring or metal pieces that that are the notes but in between you can do like all kinds of weird stuff and the the most interesting thing of the mixture tritonium is that you can very harmonic sounds, basically kind of, I can kind of compare it to chord memory on a modern synthesizer, like if you press one note, you can have a whole spectrum of different notes at the same time, and then play a melody with that, which gives a very surreal atmosphere. The mixture of tritonium was very much used in early film soundtracks, you know, like in the 1950s and 60s. The Birds is the most famous one. Yeah, The Birds is the most famous example, yeah. I don't think it's not even so much the music in The Birds, but the sound effects. So they're weird, like, wow. It's very psychedelic. It's a very ethereal sound that immediately sounds very old for some reason. and if you have a modern synthesizer, there's no way you can get that sound out of it. And also it's because of the spring reverb that's in there, so then it automatically sounds old and from a different era or something. Have you ever had any ideas for designing your own synthesizer? Well, I kind of did that like last month with the Star Shepard, but you cannot buy it. It's just basically, what's it called? It's a one-off piece. Yeah, it's made out of old guitar pedals and an old Casio 403 keyboard and I just hacked it or circuit banded it a little bit. put it in a nice uh or it's not nice looking it looks very uh makeshift and horrible but uh yeah so i guess that's an urge to make something yourself i had but of course i have no knowledge to really make like an analog synth or anything so I just approach it with a more do-it-yourself punk attitude without much knowledge and then yeah like circuit bending you know and I finished it that's already something that I'm of proud but like you know that's normally when I would start something like that I would just throw it in the corner after like a few days because this time it's finished Speaking of which, do you feel that there's these big breakthroughs like FM synthesis or granular synthesis are all decades old at this point? Do you have any sense of where a frontier might be for something new or something that would interest you? I'm very much interested in late 80s and early 90s digital synthesizers. don't really use per se an interesting synthesis form, but they're just called rumplers, you know. And the magic of those machines is like they put like waveforms in it, like digital waveforms that they just recorded, you know. And then sometimes they're really weird. For example, you have the Yamaha TG-33. and they put so many weird samples in that, like, of, like, rainforest sounds, or somebody holding a metal plate, and stuff like that, and you can combine all these sounds a bit, and pitch them up, and then you can also, you can, I think, it can get much more... interesting sounds for me then as an analog synth because of course I've been using analog synths since the 90s so for me it's kind of a boring predictable sound and of course I use analog synths a lot still but I don't you know for me this whole thing oh it's analog then it's cool of course i understand it because it's it's the same as like guitarists with like a guitar like yeah that's a rock and roll or something and for some reason in electronic music having an analog synth is cool but why is that i don't know why do people find analog synths so because you can i'm pretty sure it's just because you have to filter up and you can and just go filter, you know, like, wah, wah, wah. People just need a filter on their DX7 and then they'd be laughing, you know. Yeah, yeah, and then it would be like 5,000 euros nowadays, you know. But, yeah, I'm also convinced a lot of people just only know what the filter knob does, you know. And, of course, a filter's cool, but there's so much more, you know, in sound design and stuff. these things exist, you know, and it's the same with guitars, you know. Yeah, we just gotta do it with that, you know, and there will be people that will use it in a completely other way we haven't experienced yet, you know, and it's maybe already happening, you know. You see that because there's always new music coming out and then you think, wow, this is, does it like this, or, you know. Speaking of which, I think it was in a Sound on Sound issue recently. Novelist said he was using your sample packs and I forget which track he was talking about. I was interested with the sample pack thing because, you know, sample packs are like a big industry. You do them yourself and give them away for free. It's time consuming. Why do you do that? There are probably many reasons for that. First of all, it's really fun to make these sample kits, because you can just sit behind a keyboard synthesizer or whatever and just go all wild. It's very adventurous. You design new sounds and stuff, and then you just record like half an hour of you, you know. just pushing all the buttons and playing weird chords or sweeping filters and whatever. and then you cut them up and then you give them little names and so it's really fun to do and another thing basically what maybe I started with it is so I had some content on my website it's a very boring thing but also maybe because it's like a kind of musical... how do you call it? Progeny? Is that a word? Like you make the sounds and other people use it, so you kind of spread like your... your own thing. So when a novelist uses these sounds, you know, they're just, yeah, that's really cool, you know. And I don't think you can make a lot of money with sample kits too. There's people trying, that's for sure. Yeah, I know. I always get like emails from sample pack companies like, Jesus, man. It's much more fun to just give them for free. Also, when I was a kid and I... I started on my Commodore Amiga with Octamint, the music program. You know, samples were so cool, you know, and it was kind of difficult to, you could of course sample stuff from like your own vinyl, but of course I didn't have much vinyl. And then back then you would buy a sample CD or something from England and check or something, or my mom would do that. give my mom some money and then like two months later you got the sample CD and yeah so I think it's something you can give to the to the you know to to to artists to inspire them or something and that's also a really cool thing to do you know I don't know if this is reading too much into it, but it sort of reminded me of early BBS era, sort of like, you know, everyone's just giving their software to each other. There's kind of like pre-commodified. idea a public domain yeah yeah definitely um yeah i'm i'm not like an anti-capitalist or anything but i mean some some you know maybe i will release a sample pack that's gonna cost money maybe in the future but then you know just maybe it's all uh something that to get people addicted and next year I will ask money for it, but no. But yeah, definitely. It also stems from this whole do-it-yourself kind of punk-style attitude to... to just do it like that, you know? Yeah, this whole BBS thing. I've said BBS twice without saying what the acronym stands for. Could you give us just a very brief rundown? Well, not a brief rundown, as long as you want, but for us who don't know about it. I'll try to be brief. A BBS is a bulletin board system, and basically that was... a computer network before the internet. Before the internet existed, you could use a modem. It was a thing you attached to your phone with your crappy 80s computer, like Commodore 64 or Commodore Amiga and also PC or Atari ST. And then you could deal up... a bulletin board system which was basically somebody's computer that had a little menu like welcome to my and then they had they gave it weird names you know whatever and then you had a menu and then you could select like read text files or something or download software or send a message or chat with a other other person and this was all like on a black screen with only characters, you know, like esky characters. And these BBSs would be people run it with a subject like their hobbies or something, you know, like every hobby could have a BBS. And of course, there were lots of electronic music. BBSs. So we're talking about the early 90s now. And of course, to do that as a kid, like being 14, 16, it was very exciting because not many people were doing that and it was, it felt so cutting-edge on technology and you were it really felt like a like a cyberpunk you know and like hacking and stuff like that and would call like yeah you would enter the number and terminal program and it would go like bleep bleep bleep bleep and then try to you would hear the sounds of the the phone going over and then it would connect and then you would see the yeah the menu coming up and then you think oh yeah It was so exciting. And then some of these electronic music BBSs would have articles about underground resistance. Of course, these people were not real journalists, so it was written in a real amateuristic way. Or sometimes it were not even articles, it were just like the releases underground resistance had. that was so exciting to read for some reason, like in a text file. And I hadn't heard these releases, you know, and I just looked at the names and I said, wow, this is so cool. And then I went to the record store in The Hague and then I thought, oh yeah, Underground Resistance, they would have... it and then I would just buy them without even listening you know and then yeah so I guess that yeah that really helped me especially in the beginning days to to know a little bit about stuff like that you know Were you able to connect with America over BBS at that time? Yeah, definitely. Maybe not so much in the beginning, but for example, the artist Stinkworks from Down Low Records and stuff like that. But then it was not directly, I think. But I think there was some communication. And then also a real cool thing about this BBS culture was... you would meet random people that were into electronic music online. We would exchange cassette tapes and make mixtapes with stuff you had. So we would send that also transatlantic. So that was, of course, also very exciting. Did you rack up any big phone bills then? Yeah, my mother was always very angry. Yeah, you really had to use the phone for that. didn't necessarily have to call America because the system was that you would call a local BBS and then the messages would be transferred to the local BBS. Did you have a sense that there were people in your vicinity who were on to the same sort of thing or was it very much like connecting with people elsewhere? Yeah, definitely not, because at my high school, it was like, you know, these people were like, when you get all excited, they said, yeah, I'm going to be like a house music or techno music producer, and they would be like, oh, that's stupid, you know, and I thought, okay, well, there were maybe like one or two people, like we had a little, like... nerds gang or something you know and then they would be like into star trek i liked it too but they really had no idea what i was doing with electronic music so i did i was very alone in that at my school there was not really uh into that yeah but yeah these people ended up as being like an office worker or something nowadays yeah you've had the last laugh yeah probably Back in 2014, I just had this idea to maybe it would be fun to have this vibe of the old bulletin board systems in this modern internet age. So I just thought, well, I'm going to do like a cyber sign or a zine. You call it zine, yeah. And everybody knows what zines are, I guess, right? Like self-published. yeah little magazines and with like freaky information in it and back in the BBS days you had like cyber signs like electronic magazines written purely in text and then the graphics would also be in text the pictures explaining something would be like in really crappy text characters and so yeah in 2014 I decided to do that and put it on my website yeah and for that I use a very obscure browser called SeaMonkey which is an open source browser which has a built-in web designer and uh called composer and with that i can really uh easily uh make the yeah make the cyber design and choose the colors and draw and so it's not really drawing you type you know but yeah yeah so and then i put it online and then i hadn't i thought nobody's gonna care about this this is so um niche but then people really liked it and then I thought okay that's cool I'm gonna make another one you know so now it's like every year at Christmas I make the cyber sign or a cyber zine The funny thing is that I interviewed lots of interesting people that were influential to me, especially for this thing. I interviewed Iassos, the new age guy, and I interviewed Man Parish and stuff like that. you explain yeah this is for this thing for the for cyberzine i'm gonna interview you and they said no that's cool you know yeah so were there any cyberzines from the past which were particularly like influential on the style or the content that you have in your own one well yeah there have been many like in the early 90s but uh that there were always quite amateuristic or like really like kind of minimal so um yeah i'm i'm probably made it a little bit more readable or acceptable for people you know I guess you still gotta be a little bit of a freak to really read everything but yeah some great recipes in there oh yeah that was the last issue but that issue was made during a workshop I did in Rotterdam at a warm And they asked me to do one afternoon workshop where I... or where we made a new issue with like 20 participants that were there. Like what sort of demographic of person was going to this? Were they all like people your age or were they young people? No, I was surprised. Of course, they were very freaky people, kind of like not... no jocks or bros but they were yeah differed quite much in the in the age spectrum I think the oldest people or oldest person maybe was like in his 60s and also very young people like yeah so everything in between from all all different walks of life yeah and so what was the content of the seminar Like what were you teaching these people? Basically, we made a new issue together. So I first introduced them a little bit about the history of the bulletin board systems and then I showed them pictures on a beamer, you know, how these things looked and then said, yeah, now we're going to... make a new issue and i teach them a little bit how to make a esky art you know and um and yeah they could download the sea monkey program and then they started and it yeah i was very uh um proud of these people because we we got a new issue in a in a yeah in one afternoon yeah i don't i'm not sure what the um the nature of this worm place that you did this at. But I'm curious as to find out whether, is there any like institutional support for, you know, like recording or documenting this culture? Because the people who are part of it, you know, it had like a really profound effect on their life and, you know, a lot of like great. art came out of it as well but it's um you know it hasn't had a maybe a trendy re-evaluation where it's all turning up in art galleries and stuff like that do you think there's any kind of seeds of a um it being reassessed or anything like that It's funny because there was this organization from Miami. It's called the Dale Zinn Library. And they actually made a printed version of... I think the second Shadow Wolf issue, and they had it in their gallery, and they even brought it to the, they showed it in the, what is it, the MoCA in Los Angeles. So they showed a copy of that there. They had that somewhere there. So yeah, I guess there was a little bit of interest so far, but... Maybe in the future, you know, I'm going to make millions selling an ASCII art, you know, in a museum. That would be cool. I was just wondering what year you got your first computer and what type of computer was it? Because I know people were very, they almost thought about their computer as a sporting team or something like the Commodore people would be like, Atari is a trash. And the Tandy was referred to. the Trash 80 and stuff like that? Were you like a flag flyer for any particular type of computer or anything? Well, in Holland, basically the only computer back then was the Commodore 64, at least. But that was also my first computer, I think in 1989. And then, yeah, my parents saved up. a lot of the money and then I got my first computer, Commodore 64, and that changed my life, you know. What were its capabilities back then? What were you using it for? Well, just to play games as a kid, you know. But also, of course, the thing with the Commodore 64 is that you can program it because as soon as you turn it on, it says ready. And you can program in BASIC. So as a kid, back then, kids started programming also, you know. It was really easy to learn and it was a very open computer to learn about how to program. And, yeah. I don't think that today with computers you don't really have that. But of course you have other software you can use, so maybe it's better these days. But then you could just make a game by yourself in your bedroom. So it's very inspiring. machine but a music of course the commander 64 had the sit chip but it's difficult to program the real music thing came with a commander Amiga which I had in the early 90s and that opened so many doors for almost a lot of musicians started with the Commodore Amiga I guess it's like also music styles like jungle drum and bass and hubber and stuff was a very important machine for those music styles How did it compare to the Atari? Was there like vying for supremacy one or the other? Well, the thing with the Atari was because the Atari was always seen as a music machine because it had MIDI. Because when you had an Atari, you still needed a synthesizer to connect it or a drum machine. It was a computer made to run a sequencer studio. But with the Amiga... You didn't need much else. Only the Amiga and a little sampler, a cartridge you put in the back, and then you could make tracks. A lot of early 90s techno houses are just like only the Amiga. It's very interesting. It's kind of... What's the word for that? or made it equal for people to use. There was no barrier to, or they didn't have to spend a lot of money to buy expensive synthesizers and stuff. it was an Amiga and you could make a house record. you Imagine... Still... Living... Silence Silence That's all you really want you you
