Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Back in May, RA and NTS Radio teamed up for a day of programming from the ICA in London. The idea was simple. Bring a handful of RA's writers, favorite artists, and promoters down to chat and play music over the East London Broadcaster's airwaves. We kicked off the day with a Critics' Roundtable. It's the first one we've ever recorded live, and the first roundtable in quite a while to feature a proper mid-year roundup. RA editor Ryan Keeling led the discussion, with associate editor Will Lynch. news editor Aaron Coulthait, myself, and longtime contributor Stephen Titmuss, each coming to the ICA with a list of favorite events, albums, and artists from the first half of 2014. We kept it pretty loose and hope you'll forgive a couple of rough moments in the audio, but as you can imagine, everyone had quite a bit to say. If you missed the live broadcast, here's the roundtable presented in full. you Yeah, this is really painting to be like a one-dimensional character. So my favorite party of the last year or so has been Your Melody Club Night, which is run by Floating Points of Plastic People. Really, the most interesting thing for me about that party was if you get the right people together in the right place, in the right club, it can really be surprising what music can work. It's just about really rare soul music and jazz. And there was one bit where one of the DJs, Jeremy on ground Paris, like a big record collector from Paris. He was playing this record by Lalo Schifrin, which is Middle of the Night. And this is just like really breezy, kind of groovy jazz funk. And people are screaming going, yeah. over this like cheeky little guitar solo. It was really unusual and all the better for it. But it sounds like people come to the event with, or they're invested in the idea that they're going to respond this way. It's like this, you know, this collective idea that we're going to go there and go mental to music. that you would associate with a club like that? I don't know, because especially on the first one, I don't think anyone really knew what it was all about. That's what I wanted to ask you, actually. Yeah, yeah. On one side, it was really nerdy, like really nerdy. Like Floating Points was using these 5,000 pound Electro Mass Technics turntables that were as big as a washing machine and you can't mix on them and the sound quality is like... And then he's got this really expensive mixer that's all rotary and it sounds, you know, really great. And they're playing these super rare records. But it was a young crowd and it was like the crowd itself was just really up for it. They weren't like peering over the decks, train spotting. They were dancing. And I think all those elements together made a whole that was really just unusual and really fun. Who is it that he has down there? OK, yeah. So so for the first one, he he was kind of like a relatively you know up and coming like house dj from paris but he's also a real big record collector and then they had this guy called red greg who used to run like a 80s boogie night in london who's like you know not really anyone's ever heard of but he's a cool record collector then the next one he got his friend over from new york love on the run again he's just like a record collector guy so he's not bringing big names down he's just bringing having a night where people are playing records where they just like to a crowd is kind of obvious but it's really unusual as well and we're just doing fades between tracks as well we're assuming because you're not you know it doesn't have pitch control Yeah, they're just playing them from start to finish and people were like applauding at the end. So yeah, it's brilliant. I love listening to the recordings of these because you can just hear how much the crowd is getting into it. I mean, I guess the turntables pick up a little bit of the crowd noise. Yeah, that must have been it. But, you know, they've done another one with Hoonie the other night. And again, it was meant to be amazing. And you're right, all the It's just, you know, not normal, right? You never thought you'd see the day, right? Oh, God, yeah. I guess it's probably the sort of flagship event for people these days because, I mean, that club's been home to some pretty amazing sort of seminal club nights like Co-op and Ford, but... Theo Parrish still plays there pretty regularly and they do have some really good nights but I think Floating Points is probably the person who embodies the club better than anyone these days. Yeah I think that would be fair. So Jordan fairly recently was at the parties that you selected? Yeah, so RA went to Offenbach outside of Frankfurt, did a party at Robert Johnson, which is by far the most famous club in Offenbach, probably the only club. Probably the only club in Offenbach. But I'm a little biased in this, you know, R.A.'s putting on a party there. But this party really blew my mind. Fortet was the headliner, but Gerhard Janssen and Oliver Hoffenbauer, who were two residents of the club, also played. And it was just great. I think for me, the kind of fourth headliner was the club itself. I hadn't been to Robert Johnson, but it was such an exhilarating place to see music. It's a really simple room. It's not super big, maybe 300 people max in there. The sound is perfect. And the vibe is just really great. Gary Jansen kind of played this like chugging house. Fortet kind of just busted out the tunes. It was just tune after tune after tune. I think my favorite set of the whole thing, though, was from Oliver, who's, I believe, the booker for the club or one of the bookers for the club. And I guess he kind of played from house into techno and back in the house. It was just. kind of about as varied of a set as you can get with doing 4-4, but it just had such a nice flow to it, and the sun was kind of streaming in through the doors. The crowd had thinned out to kind of just the true ravers. In Berlin, we get great parties all the time, but there was something about this that just felt like we don't get parties like this in Berlin very often, and I don't get parties like this almost anywhere. It was just a great night. Will, you were there as well. Yeah. Similar feelings on it. Yeah, yeah. It was my second time at Robert Johnson, but this one was much better than the other time I'd been. I was sort of thinking about the fact that... I feel like it's sort of a club ideal. People say like, you know, just a room, no lights, really good sound, you know, but like how you barely ever actually see that, you know, realized, um, I guess maybe plastic people on, you know, um, form is sort of the other version of that. I mean, would you, would you compare those clubs? Well, I've been to plastic people, but I've never. seen it really go off or i don't think i fully get plastic people personally but um i guess overall i sort of i mean some of the stuff steve was saying like robert johnson too um places an incredible emphasis on just the quality of sound in there they also you know have a extremely good rotary mixer like there's obviously kind of a similar philosophy and also fortet played the party and he was able to play lots of stuff with like live drums and it sounded really really fat you know it could slot in neatly next to like a recent house track well and for not being like a very big room you could play pretty big tunes in there yeah I mean Oliver was playing i mean a lot of it was pretty aggressive like yeah you know and there's something about that that is you know he played a few he played at least two ben clock tracks in a row and it's in a room filled with sunlight and when the sound is that um enveloping you know you'll kind of roll with whatever they're dishing out i also selected nari party unfortunately goodness What are we like? I went over to Austin a couple of months back for South by Southwest. It was the second time that we'd, I was going to go to say event, but showcase I think is the correct terminology out there. I guess the first thing is someone who's never been there and as it being an event that's not traditionally known for electronic music, it's kind of, it's tough to get your head around a little bit to begin with. Like, even this idea of showcase and people migrating and people treating DJ sets very differently. One of the first things I saw was Kashmir Cat at Pitchfork at the showcase, which was an outdoor type of affair. And people's body language was as though he was a band. People stood stock still waiting for this performance to take place. Readdress how you think about DJ set almost. So, yeah, we had a stacked lineup. a club called Lyceum which is on the main drag and is a rock club ordinarily with all the smells and the production that goes along with that. I mean it was I think for me probably musically the most exciting RA event we've ever had. Started off with Rabbit who was playing kind of like dislocated grime jams and it was Seth was afterwards which is just like little known project on Uno which is ordinarily Gobby and vocalist whose name I'm forgetting now it's Jamie it's Jamie Kay isn't it yeah but Gobby must have flight so I mean again that kind of was spaced out in a similar way that Rabbit was but then I think when the whole thing really caught fire it was this kind of a run where everything seemed to come together and became really busy which is by no means like a given but South by and Jesse Lanza who's an art we've kind of featured pretty heavily and been supporting on our own, played live and it was striking. I mean, I think there's two schools of thought between like the recreation of an album, you know, whether it's a good thing and maybe whether a performance should be more flexible and, you know, bring something new to the table. But she just used an incredibly simple setup and just sang in a very measured and controlled and confident way. It wasn't... you know, it was as exciting and as kind of well executed and composed as the record itself is. And then Machine Drum, who followed, was also like striking in that he was performing a concept out. so his latest album was based on this idea that every track was a different zone of an imaginary city I mean to say it out loud it sounds kind of naff and you know and there was a visual element of it as well it was just him and a drummer but I guess I don't remember um like a visual component and a music coming together in a way that made so much sense. Like you were hustling through a different zone of the city and to kind of see what was going on, it felt like it made perfect sense for that piece of film. And yeah, they just built to an amazing crescendo. Like by the end, his drummer was kind of like stood up on his kit. Like Travis was at the front of the stage, like banging something and singing. And important thing to bear in mind is he's playing, you know, most of his stuff's like jungle or footwork tempo. And it's an hour long set at which they're keeping time at that pace, 160, 170 BPM of like live drumming. And then following that, kind of on a similar tempo to it, was Spin and Rashad, which I think everybody agreed was like the standout set of the night. It was funny to see them come out with towels over their heads and there was a definite vibe and they knew what they were going to do. And Spin was kind of getting down the front of the stage, hyping everyone and Rashad was just keeping things going. I think he was playing no more than 60 seconds of a track before smashing the next thing in. He wasn't wearing headphones, he was just queuing stuff up. like getting in and then I don't know if anybody like ever investigated it afterwards but there was like a stage invasion where all the people in their wider group like put on heck life t-shirts and kind of invaded the stage and it was like incredibly awkward like dancing around to all this like super fast music I'd like to think they orchestrated it but yeah I mean obviously that one has a bit more of a special resonance with Rashad's passing recently so I think Getting to see him recently in his full pomp, full tilt was really special. I think that will definitely stay with me. And then Shlomo brought down really expertly. He was a little bit more mellow and melodic. But yeah, really cats out for the night. So how long was this showcase? I mean, how long were the sets? I also actually haven't mentioned Jacques Green and the Ranger Lee Bannon who played as well. Epic. Yeah, it was a stacked lineup. But I mean, most people were doing like 45 to 60 minutes. I think we got started at 8 and finished about 2. But you know, a 2 a.m. finish, it's great for me these days. I guess the general narrative of South by Southwest is that each year electronic music sort of plays a slightly bigger role being on the ground there. Did you get a sense of that at all? Yeah, I think very much. But I think the observation that was sort of encapsulation I made in my review was that while it is on the rise, that doesn't come along with club culture, the DJ culture as we kind of know it. it seems like the crowd there needs like this hip hop lens almost even in the way like I know someone like Jack Green for example he's playing like lots of well he's playing lots of house and related stuff but just even in his body language there was something very hip hop about all of the performers and Shlomo is kind of the same so they may not be playing hip-hop tempo or playing hip-hop but there's something more of the spirit of that performance style and that culture in the music than there maybe is like you know spirit of 88 rave and like club culture as we kind of know it. Aaron I was going to come to you next it was also a recent event for you was it was last week wasn't it? Yeah it was Charles Cohen performing live at Cafe Oto in London. Basically, the rundown of the night was Morphosis opened and then Charles Cohen played solo and then there was a bit of a jam session at the end. But the reason I've selected this as my favourite event of the year so far is really because of Cohen's solo set basically his signature instrument is the the buckler music easel and he's been playing the thing since 1976 so as you can imagine he's pretty good at it and it was just you just got this really obvious sense of someone who's mastered the instrument which you don't really see very very often he was just so at ease with it just to go back to what you were saying what does playing this instrument look like? What is this instrument? Well, that's a question I might pass over to Jordan to explain a bit more thoroughly because he interviewed Charles. But basically, from what I could see, he had the easel and a couple of what looked like kind of effects units plugged into it, and he was just sort of gently coaxing sounds out of this thing. you couldn't really see exactly what was going on but he was just he was sitting there like super calm just making really gradual adjustments to the easel and the sounds that came out of it were just really beautiful yeah I mean basically Stephen to explain what it is I mean it's a It's a synthesizer. It's almost modular. It kind of has a set signal path, so you would call it semi-modular, I guess. But the Vukla is this sort of fully modular synthesizer that Morten Sabotnick made famous, Silver Apples of the Moon. It's kind of famous for having this really weird workflow and making these really incredible sounds. The music easel was more, it's smaller. It actually like fits in a suitcase and it was sort of made to kind of be the performance instrument. And it's extremely expressive. Like when I went to Charles Cohen's apartment in Philadelphia, I guess earlier this year to interview him, he kind of like let me play it a little bit. And I did a feature on him. And I think I mentioned this in the feature that it has this kind of metallic keyboard. And I. touched it it was just like immediately it just made this crazy noise and you kind of move your finger around the keyboard and it makes all these other crazy noises and um i was just kind of making noises i had no idea what i was doing and then he sits down he's like i'm like would you show me what you do? And he just kind of starts manipulating it in this way. Like he's playing a, you know, violin or a harpsichord or something, you know. I'm thinking of something like a minority report or something here. It looks a lot less high tech than something in minority. It's more like it's from Brazil. like it looks like a retro vision of the future kind of thing. Yeah. Also as a lay person, um, I saw Charles Cohen perform with two other lay people. Um, and, um, we were just mystified by, okay, so, you know, the plugging stuff in, putting it in different ports, like that's a normal modular thing. But then he also had, um, these like cards he was inserting different cards yeah you put the patches on these cards it's it's yeah it's totally terry gilliam it's crazy how would you how would you describe the sound that's coming out this thing i mean what i've heard so far is like weird okay well the first half well firstly he started off by speaking as he started sort of getting some sounds out of it like spoken word borrowed from like Chinese philosophy or something like that. So he kind of set this kind of cosmic tone. And then the first part of the set was very much sounds that you'd probably associate with a modular, like sort of bleeps and bloops. And then as it went on, the sounds kind of smeared out a bit more. And... Then it became a bit more ambient, I guess. And then he finished it off by, with another sort of spoken word segment. So it had this really nice arc to it. And yeah, I mean, there's a thing like the 10,000 hour rule, which is kind of like a school of thought that if you spend 10,000 hours at something, you will master it. I mean, I've... I'm pretty certain he's done that. He's probably chalked up 20,000 hours with that thing. And yeah, it really showed. Will, you have selected another, well, I guess it was a few months ago now, in your hometown of Berlin. Can you tell us what you've picked? Yeah, Berk Hines' Sylvester Party, which is the New Year's Eve party, which part of me naturally thinks that's a bit of, an obvious choice, I guess. I was going to say that. But I would just basically be full of shit if I chose anything else because it was, it just made a huge impression on me as a party. And I guess I should make clear that that was the fifth New Year's in a row that I went to Bear Pine and go there countless times per year. So it wasn't like I was, you know, being blown away by it because it was my first time there or something like that. Obviously, a lot of the music was fantastic. I saw Function, Luke Slater, DJ Pete, Nick Haltner, Marcel Detman, Tim Sweeney, Answer Code Request. They were all great. But I guess the thing that really kind of... made an impression on me was like, I guess there's kind of a, a rave ideal or like at a good party or good festival or something where there's an effect that it's like a kind of alternate reality has been constructed and going into this event is like slipping into some kind of parallel universe. It sort of has. different norms, just different codes of behavior. And it just sort of feels like, you know, you've slipped through the rabbit hole kind of. And I've sort of felt that way at various other events before, certainly at Bearkind before. But for some reason, I guess, first of all, the ridiculous length of the party, which is, you know, more than 36 hours or something like that. And also just the fact that because it's New Year's, everyone just kind of goes for a little bit more in terms of how they're acting, what they're wearing, which sounds shallow, but it's, you know, people wear really weird shit and kind of take on these bizarre kind of surreal personalities. There's just kind of this effect that, and obviously this is gigantic and it's bigger on New Year's because they have the laboratory, which is normally a men's only sex club. At the time, I was thinking it feels like a mini city or something where different parts have different personality types that hang out there. There's one bar where it's all guys in leather. Upstairs, it's more like hipstery art school. kids and there's the german ravers that you know in the front of the dance floor and and then a few months later the new yorker wrote this article that i wrote a lot about bear kind uh unsurprisingly they sort of put it much better than i just did which was to say that bear kind at times feels like a coral reef um different species of fish like gravitating towards different parts of the reef which yeah is basically exactly what i thought and um There's just this feeling that every single moment that you're there, you know, waiting for the toilet, trying to get a drink, everything feels like very cinematic and just so pregnant with detail. that there's kind of never a dull moment. Actually, a few months earlier, I'd been on a panel with Nick Hüppner, and he kind of smirkingly referred to Berghain as a Gesamtkunstwerk, meaning like a total work of art, like everything about it is like a breathing work of art, which he was sort of being cheeky when he said it, like he knew it was a bit of like a, you know, indulgent thing to say, but it felt... Very, very easy to agree with on that night in particular. Who was the highlight set? for you i guess uh function played the most like jams um but then luke slater was just like i never really gotten him before i'd seen him before never quite clicked for me but um it was just absolutely it was like a monsoon like you know just like a relentless just like avalanche of psychedelic noise and it was just pretty incredible all right let's move on then The next topic we wanted to get into was some of our favorite albums of the year. Jordan, I'm going to come to you first. Yeah, let's do it. Are you shaking your head? No. Well, yeah, the album that I had down was the Terrier album, the Todd Terrier record, It's Album Time, which for me is, it's like, I kind of can't deny it. We played it in the office for the first time, you know, around the time that it came out. And, like, nobody disliked it. And usually in the RA Berlin office, there are a couple of haters, you know, lurking around. But yeah, this album is undeniable. In fact, like... I really think that I'm not sure that I would trust people who don't like it. I think that they're basically full of shit. Did it not catch you off guard a little bit to begin with? Because it is a departure for him in a way. Yeah, a little bit. I mean, I think it shows off his range. There are obviously the big dance tunes. Maybe the one criticism you could level at the album is that a lot of the material on there already exists. You've already heard it. heard it. Seems like a slightly unfair criticism. Like, you know, if you left off Inspector Norse, which is the big single, like people would be like, oh my God, you can't leave that off too. Especially, you know, considering how well it all flows. It's like he kind of took a lot of these big singles and he stitched them together with tunes that I think show off his influences a lot. You know, like the Brian Ferry tune, for example. it's, you basically just get the sense that it's being informed by a lot more than just dance music. But the, I don't know, I guess the way that I've been thinking about it, like it's, you know, there's been so much music that's come out that's had crossover appeal. where it's sort of like dance music sort of trying to speak to pop people, like to get pop people on board with dance music or rock people on board with dance music. But this almost felt like it was going in the other direction, like getting dance music people on board with pop. It's like an impeccably produced, you know, sort of new disco or house record that also plays around a lot with dance conventions, or with pop conventions, rather. Well, you mentioned the crossover. aspect there. I was actually back in Australia in December and listening to a station there, Triple J, and their electronic at the moment sort of revolves around stuff like Deadmau5 and Skrillex, and I was just giving it a bit of a listen and Inspector Norse came on. And I was like, okay, great. I was really kind of pleased that I had made it through to a fairly major sort of commercial station there. I mean, I really hope it does. The music that he makes and the music that he's presented on the album definitely deserves a really wide audience. All right, let's hear something from it. This is Johnny and Mary, which is the Brian Ferry track. Noisy tires easily. The world would be right if a goodbye says he changes his mind. Made a run, run, run when he decides. He's a journey says he'll live anywhere when he earns the time. Mary combs her hair as she should be used to it. Mary always hatches a better thing. She says that it still acts like he's in disgust Scared to deal with her Without a second thought Running around Right, going to Stephen next. Do you want to explain your selection, Stephen? Sure, yeah. Well, my favourite album of the year so far is Fatima's debut album, Yellow Memories. And if you don't know much about Fatima, she's a singer that's signed to Floating Points and... Alex Arndt and Nuts record label, Eglo. And basically, she's been around for quite a few years, actually. She's been around since about 2009, doing lots of different singles for lots of different people, singing and co-writing a lot of the time. People with even as wide as like Scratch the DVA and Dane Funk have had all different kinds of Fatima songs on there. But this is quite weird, quite telling, actually, that she's waited so long to do a debut simply because this album actually feels like a great listen all the way through. If you listen to it from start to finish, there's a definite vibe about it. It's kind of really introspective, quiet. quite interesting jazzy hip-hop soul stuff and funny enough Jordan was talking about oh how could have you know Todd Turley left Inspector Norse off of his album well you can tell a lot from Fatima's album from the records she's left off she's got loads of great singles such as Phone Line which she done with Funkin' Even Mind which she done with Floating Points they're not on there she dumped them she left them on the guy room floor and that's a bold choice for a debut album you know she obviously wants to make an impact but it's all been done for the good of the whole so listen to it as one it's great and again I'm going to talk about Southport again but Fatima was performing there and live she is the real deal like she she has no right to be as confident as she is on stage she's like throwing her hands up hip-hop style she's doing her records completely different than they are on the album doing the ballads like into make them into dance tracks changing the time signatures of other records yeah I am I am definitely in awe of Fatima right now and floating points produced roughly was like 30 40 percent of the record yeah he produced um i think he produced five of the 12 and there's two definite really big standout moments they've done the first track which is um actually written with theo parish too called do better it's kind of big symphonic symphonic climactic it kind of the kind of climax that you don't really hear in a lot of modern soul music simply because it's all live and it kind of builds up. But then the other track that is a real standout is called Biggest Joke of All. And that's just so simple. It's like a boom-bap beat, as simple as it could be, and just floating points on a keyboard and Fatima singing. But somehow together, it's all just fantastic. And you need real talent to make something so simple sound great. And they've done it. Yeah, we were talking about this idea of kind of transcending genres before. And I think the interesting thing with that is if given a slightly different context, a slightly different label, like we just wouldn't be listening to this record. Like it's not necessarily. pointing to stuff that comes from the electronic and dance music world but just this sort of ecosystem that eglo's got around it with um real like rich deep like musical past like someone like sam floating points yeah i mean i'm just very busy it's kind of orbiting in our world i think like eglo more than most other labels definitely feels or looks like a real family and a really kind of tight-knit crew. And I think you can tell from listening to this record and also just the visual look of it and everything that's gone into it that, you know, not only Fatima, but, you know, Alex Nutt and Floating Points and everyone else that was involved in the production side of things have really kind of put their heart and soul into it. So I think that's really nice. So we're playing Biggest Joke of All. Do you remember? who this was produced by Flo Po I'm sorry did you say Flo Co? Flo Po Flo Po alright then everybody knows Flo Po Flo Po Tell me why you had to come so late. I finally can hear the words we spoke for so long. I wonder if it could be bad. Cause I want you. And with it, you smell my hair, you close your eyes, then you pull me closer again. Somehow this don't feel real, I need to pinch myself. Cause anyway, another year or two, till I see you again. I want you for my own, to me your royalty. Why is life so hard sometimes? I feel a bad little tone and aching deep inside. Hey, and did you mean what you said last night? Or was it just one of those in the moment things you say when you had too much to drink? Yeah, and deep on the corner. Oh, yeah. Tell me why you had to come so late. I've been needing you. I finally can hear the words we spoke for so long. I wonder if I could be paid. Cause I want you. But life is messing with us and we fade. It's not my hair you're closer eyes than you. Pull me closer again Somehow this don't feel real I need to pinch myself Cause anyway another year or two Till I see you again I want you for my own to me Your royalty Oh heart sometimes I feel a bad weather Torn and aching deep inside And do you mean what you said last night? Or was it just one of those in the moment things you said when you had them at the drink? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Was it just one of those things? So we're going to you next album of the year so far. It's Hate Rock, Psychic 9 to 5 Club. And? And, well I guess it has a bit of a, on a subjective level, it had been a long time since I liked a new album that I guess you could roughly describe as a pop album, like with, you know. lyrics and whatnot, verses and choruses, that sort of thing. Also, when I was like a teenager, I liked stuff like Skinny Puppy Ministry. And I think the kind of dreary, you know, wouldn't want to say goth, but you know, that sort of like dark side of things, you know, sort of struck a chord with me. But then, I guess more simply, it was just the kind of thing where it was like when I heard the album, I just thought it felt like a breakthrough album. Like I liked Hate Rock before. And I know some of you guys, my fellow RA writers, preferred Work, Work, Work, which I can actually sort of understand. In a way that's a little hard for me to put my finger on, this album just seemed like a huge leap forward for this band. Something about it just felt classy and kind of smart. I thought the lyrics were very understated, but really, really effective. Like the first track, the refrain, she says, this time I'm going to love you much better. which is sort of like, you know, there's not so much going on there, but something about it, there's this implied guilt. There's something very like sort of dark and also erotic about it. I think the album is sort of loaded with these lines that feel like they sort of creep up on you. They're simple, but as you listen to the album, they have these sort of... layers of um implication and everything that make them very powerful, I guess. And then on top of that, I just really liked the production style. Super, super simple. The way they use reverb and echo and delay, it's almost like the beats are leaving like trails in the air or something. Sort of a, yeah, trippy shimmering sort of thing. But generally speaking, something I said in my review of the album was it's a very unusual. marriage of two feelings which on the one hand is this sort of kind of paranormal dark not exactly nightmarish but sort of like a dark dreamlike thing and then on top of that this very very tender warm intimate thing and there's there's something sort of strange and potent about that combination which for me really defines the album it's kind of running throughout the whole album Aaron, I know you've been following the group quite closely over the last however many years. Were you kind of initially surprised at the direction they'd taken? Because it was, I mean, to me, it was noticeably more dub influence. You're talking about the kind of space and the reverb and delay. I guess yes and no. Psychic 9 to 5 Club is definitely more space. and sort of stripped back than Work, Work, Work, which was their previous album. I guess that's to be expected because halfway through making Work, Work, Work, one of the three original members of the band died, Sean. So they went into Psychic 9 to 5 Club as a duo. And a lot of the kind of guitar-y sounds that Sean brought to Work, Work, Work are obviously not evident on their new record. But what I think they've done is made something really interesting out of what they've got. All right, let's go to... Hey boys, give it up today. Talk. Your talk is more than your mouthful. Hey, put it away. I love you. Not my precious metal sideways On my drive to perfection This time I'm gonna love you much better I'm gonna love you much better This time I'm gonna love you much better I'm gonna love you, love you back. So my selection, I've gone for something a little bit out of left field. I've gone for the soundtrack to Under the Skin, which was the new film from Jonathan Geyser, which is easily my favourite film of the year so far. I think it was something like 10 years in the making. As a summary, it's... features Scarlett Johansson in the lead. She drives around Glasgow in a big white transit van. She lures men into the van, drives them back to her squatty apartment, and then consumes them into a black ooze because the twist is she is an alien. So romantic comedy then. Spoiler alert! It's not a twist. I framed it wrong. But the film is, I mean, it's mostly, I believe she's the only actual actor because most of it was shot as kind of secretive cameras, like the van certainly. These are things that actually happened. You know, what you're seeing is a conversation between Scarlett Johansson wearing a wig and a Glaswegian guy who's coming back from the pub. So as a result, the dialogue is kind of kept to a minimal, which means that the music is kind of working as hard as the speaking parts. It gets to this point where in terms of the music and the way that it's being advanced, like, you know that something significant or the next thing is happening by the barest percussion. sounds. Mika Chuba, the soundtrack together, it was the first such project that she did and reading a little bit into it, I think she kind of locked herself away for 10 months and came up with a bunch of what she described as fucked up sounds and then whittled them down to something that kind of, I think the closest thing it resembled to me or something recently that it resembled was something like... Hacks and Cloak, where you get this very, very sense of dread and real like power in the music using you know a ridiculously small number of elements. Some of like the incidental sounds as well just as I was explaining just the kind of smallest little knock takes on just this insane amount of resonance like in the context. of this film. I mean, I'm definitely not saying that the soundtrack is an area of expertise or anything for me, but what it seemed to be, my kind of interpretation of it was there was a wonderful kind of marriage of like quite traditional, like string work that you would associate with something that's kind of pertaining to this idea of horror or. you know, something alien kind of mixed in with more like modern synthesis techniques and stuff along those lines. So I'm going to play a track called Death from said soundtrack. you So after that cheery selection, Aaron, what have you got for us? I'm going to bring it back a bit. Apologies in advance for the pronunciation here, but the album I've picked is by Gesloten Circle, and it's called Submit X. So basically, Gesloten Circle is this vaguely mysterious character who... lives in Russia but is affiliated with the Hague kind of crew and has put out a couple of pretty excellent records in the last three or four years and there's a couple of tracks that he's made Twisted Balloon and Young Magic are the two that really stand out. They're the kind of things that when you hear them at a party, you're kind of like, what the hell is this? You know, you find yourself kind of gravitating towards the booth to find out what's being played. And it is. out and yeah so he's bringing out his debut album this year for me it's the best dance music LP I've heard this year and I sort of mean that in the literal sense like there's been a few really good electronic albums from the likes of Kass and Moss and Joey Anderson but by and large they've been more sort of contemplative affairs. This record really just goes for the jugular and it's you know just chock full of tunes that you could play out at peak time basically. Well you're also feeding this record. Yeah, I would echo many of Aaron's sentiments, but in general I just think this guy, especially on this album, there's just this ferocious feeling to it. This track is actually kind of one of the funkier ones, but yeah, they're just barreling through. forward with this just kind of like wild aggression like this sort of ineffable feeling a lot of techno goes for um i think is pretty much nailed on on much of this album then it still has but on top of that it has kind of like a almost like a sense of humor or something like there's there's a bit of like sci-fi to some of the vocal samples. It doesn't seem like it takes itself too seriously. In a way, I hesitate to quote Hardwax, but their little one-liners said it was straight from the sewer, which is pretty much, yeah, that's pretty much it. I know I can kind of sense where you're getting at. For me, it reminded me of someone like Mr. G, who at some point in their production career found... this like effects chain of like compression EQ that just afforded them this impossibly slamming sound and I get that same feeling from his music you know I think in different hands and with like slightly different production techniques I wouldn't be as excited by his music as I am but there's something in like the way that the lower mid-range like elements come together or something, which just gives it this like impossible playability. Well, there is just something I think exciting is a good word for it. I think I was out of town at a festival when it first came into the office and I was like getting texts from RA staffers like, oh, the best album is playing in the office right now. You know, this like never happens. I think someone making an electro record in 2014. That would be a little bit reductive, but I would say a large portion are going on that kind of broken beat. Yeah, I mean, the ingredients are kind of classic Haig sound. You know, it's got the acid lines. got a mix of like breakbeats and straight up techno electro and there's actually one really killer punky track on there so there's yes they're all big tracks but there is a lot of variation there in sound still I also think for me the real flourish that this guy's extremely good at from his I think it was the first big one was Yeah Magic or might have been Twisted Balloon but the vocal samples are out of control Like there's something about the timbre of the sound on the vocals that's just, yeah, ridiculous. Also, if he's listening, he should respond to my SoundCloud message. So Aaron, what's the track you've selected? The track I've selected is Fete Liette. Fete Liette ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I'm still gonna be able to... Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a he, this guy Nick Curry. I mean, you haven't heard of him because he's not really produced many tracks. I think he has two solo releases to his name. Most of his stuff has appeared on compilation e-books. But yeah, he comes out of the, this guy, Nick Curry, his real name is Ruben Candelario. He comes out of the same scene as DJ Q and Joey Anderson. And yeah, he's just been DJing with these guys. He's friends with these guys, kind of got into production at the same time that all of these guys did. And I remember I was doing an interview with DJ Q about maybe a year, year and a half ago. And he said something, he's like, you know, yeah, we're going to, you know, we've got Joey is doing his thing now, but we're going to, we're going to bring Nick Curry up to the front. It kind of happened on, I guess the big track this year so far is this thing called Thoughts of You, which was on the semester's three EP on Strength Music, DJ Q's label. And it's just a, it's a monster tune. I guess if like, if Joey DJQ sound and like digs underneath it into this like kind of super dark space. Then Nakuri kind of like hovers above it, just massive pads. It's kind of house, but it's almost like too epic and ambient to. really properly be house. I was at Bearkind maybe like a month or two ago and Marco Shuttle played this tune in Bearkind and I mean it was just like blew the roof off the place. It's yeah it's astounding stuff and he's got another release on Mora music that just came out. It's like a proper 12-inch with a couple of his tracks and they're just as good. Really excited to see what he does. I think it's striking to me that although everybody has been as excited as they have about producers like Levon Vincent, Joey Anderson, etc. No one's really trying to do that sound. I think it's almost testament to the strength of what they have as a crew. hasn't been this whole like bandwagon effect where everybody's trying to do those like real stomping like ethereal numbers is this guy on anybody else's radar no jordan you are so cool oh man yeah cutting edge unfortunately we can't play his track because we've had a usb fail oh no i was just gonna say play the tune the way you set it up as well I mean it was going to be fist pumping but we're going to move on Stephen who have you gone for? Yeah I've gone for Max Graf or Graf is how you pronounce it? Graf Graf yeah so he's a young chap German fella 21 years old I believe and I'm just really excited about him because I know that I'm going to be liking his records if they stay this good for a very long time he's got a very Very similar thing to most of my favorite house producers where he's clearly making house, but he's not taking it head on. He's kind of a bit of a hip hop approach, but also sampling disco and jazz records. And the end result is always something really danceable, but also really musically interesting as well. You know, he's got a lot of his tunes kind of have a novel twist halfway through where a vocal comes in out of nowhere that you weren't really expecting. really perks things up his album which Will what was the name of his album again? Rivers of the Red Planet Rivers of the Red Planet it went through a couple of different titles didn't it because the copy I've got is called something about yeah like reclining female nude there was also a boorish chunk and the album itself went through a lot of mutations too it started as an instrumental hip hop album and just sort of there was a complete draft that was instrumental hip hop and then it just sort of morphed into this you know partly house partly hip hop thing but I mean Stephen knowing you sort of a little bit at this stage. I guess it's ticking a lot of musical boxes for you. Yeah absolutely but on the flip side you know I'm quite a house head and this style of doing house with disco samples or soul samples it has been rinsed. It's been you know nothing has been rinsed more in dance music I would argue and to kind of have someone come along that does something novel with it doesn't have happen very often it happens really rarely in fact and this guy has kind of nailed it so what would you say is novel about it well i was just gonna say i had the same reaction to it i mean i listened to this record it sounded like records i was listening to two or three years ago but it was just so fresh and it's hard to put your finger on it it's almost just there's there's a different energy in it i mean i think the thing that's novel about it is him yeah like basically he has only been listening to this music for several years or something and spends more of his time listening to hip-hop and jazz and um he's not that thoroughly steeped in like a house background um so i think his natural approach is um you know it's sort of like not naive in a good way. He, you know, he's, he's not as aware of all the same, like, you know, reference points to other house artists. And, but I think, you know, it's interesting to keep in mind that I think when you hear this album, there might be temptation to think that it's like a house artist mixing it, mixing up a little with this hip hop stuff. it's actually the way around. Like he would have more easily seen himself doing just a straight up hip hop album. The house thing just sort of came out of nowhere for him. But I guess the proof of that is with his DJ sets, right? Yeah. I mean, I think he probably will end up playing mostly house like his time goes on. just because of the clubs where he's playing and sort of like, you know, the way things go. It's kind of sad in a way though, that you would just like smooth out all the kinks of his style. Yeah. Because there was that anecdote, wasn't there, about Panorama Bar, the discussion that he was having with his friend about whether or not he'd get away with it. Right, he got booked at Panorama Bar and he said, which by the way, He said he'd only been to twice, and both times it was just because he had Australian friends in town that dragged him there. But him and his friends don't like Panorama Art, mostly because they're too young to get in. But anyway, so he asked his friend, like, could I play a hip-hop set at Panorama Art? And he said, you know, they probably won't cut the sound, but that would be the last time you play there. But when he played it, he did fit a few, you know, hip hop tracks in there that, you know, sort of, it made sense. It didn't seem too radical. But yeah, I mean, to me, it seems like he has, he's one of these guys, I think there are other DJs like this too, where even if they're house artists or techno artists, they sort of have like an adversarial relationship with the 4-4 beat. Like they'll take any opportunity. to deviate from that, you know, what I've heard described as the tyranny of the kick drum, the tyranny of 4-4. Just like whenever it makes sense to go off into some other time signature or some other rhythm type, he'll do it. All right, let's hear The Way from him. so All right, I'm going to go to Aaron next. Do you want to explain your selection? Yeah, so my selection is Young Marco. He's a guy who came onto my radar in 2010 or 2011. He's based in Amsterdam and part of... part of the city's house scene that kind of revolves around institutions like Rush Hour, Deckman Tool, Red Light Records. He actually worked as a graphic designer for Rush Hour. to involve with them but he he started putting out records for esp institute about 2011 and he put out two really excellent records uh no no no and video days and they both had this really nice kind of melodic new agey house kind of sound i mean as a as a dj and collector he's kind of digs everything from kind of new age to african music to house to disco And I think that really, really shines through in his productions. And his debut album is actually coming out next week. It's called Biology. And I've picked a track from that called Trippy Isolator. All right, let's hear that one. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right, sorry for the abrupt change there. So I'm going to finish off with my selection. I've gone for... mum dance who's someone who I admit I don't have a long standing relationship with his music necessarily his stuff was kind of on my radar a little bit some of the mad decent stuff like the vocal tracks he did with Trim I was kind of digging but I understand he stopped making music for a couple of years and And the style of stuff that he's come back with has just kind of blown me away a little bit. I mean, it very much dovetails with this new kind of wave of grind producers who have been coming through. And he's been producing with Logos a lot, who's another one of my sort of new favourite artists. I think over the selection of music he's released, I just don't remember being so immediately blown away by the kind of inventiveness, just in terms of the sounds he's using, the way he's manipulating, the kind of rhythms he's going for, like particularly some of the more recent stuff. I've actually found myself like laughing out loud a lot. the time just because of like the just the surety the ideas but also like how the fuck do they think to do that, you know, in this kind of way? There also seems to be this simultaneous thing he has going on where he's like as fiercely looking forwards as he is backwards. So lots of the sound palettes, like old, like Hoover sounds and like Eamon breaks and these sorts of things. But then at the same time, the way that they're sort of arranged and manipulated. is just like nothing I've heard before. There was the track It's Peak, which I think was on Unknown to the Unknown. which was like a massive standout of the Tesla set we had. We released as part of the RA event we did towards the end of the year. But the one I've gone for is forthcoming on Rinse. This one features Novelist to give you some sort of indication of like the breadth of weirdness on this record. This is probably the most straight up. track of the release one of the others whose name escapes me has a break that feels like like an outtake from a Arnold Schwarzenegger soundtrack section that then breaks into some like weird dislocated grind thing that's going backwards and then goes into another section so um yeah I'm going to play this one to kind of finish it off I take time and think. Don't roll suits but I might have a drink. But you know that I still have sense. Spitting bars and I'm on that set. What I'm going for them and their. Spending their cash on it. They can have Gucci belts but go home to an empty fridge. I take time and think. Rube wear which can be flashed on gas. When they got a whole bag of bills on a madness. I just do my ting. And I don't watch Face and Ting. I take time and relax. I make my own peas or bread. I don't need to beg anyone for help. Rude boy, that's me. We need my watch face, that's dead. Keep chatting and bragging about things, that's dead. Brother, I'm not one of them. The type of man there get bun like blood. People asking when's the next show, like no. Wait, stop, when? I'm a man, but I'm a man, but it's all blessed. My circle is tight. Outro Music Outro Music
