Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resonate Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Will Lynch, and I'm the Associate Editor of Resonate Advisor. Since 2010, Ron Morelli's made a career out of doing something that's unintentionally radical. He releases electronic music, including house and techno, that has little or nothing to do with clubs. Morelli runs Lies, a label that's electronic and production, but punk in spirit. Its records are scrappy, unpredictable. clearly unconcerned at being liked. While other labels are inspired by the experience of going out, Lies specializes in music for shut-ins, to quote the title of one of its compilations. Many in the feel-good world of dance music find this baffling, but Morelli never meant to be controversial. As he tells it, he started Lies for a very simple reason, to release great music by his friends. Five years and more than a hundred records later, Lies is as popular as it is On a recent Sunday afternoon, I met Marillite to hear his side of the story. *Dramatic music* It's been about five years you're doing the label, right? Correct. April, actually, 4-20-2010 is when I received the first test press of Live Zero One. The only reason I know that is because somehow Tim Sweeney had a picture of it on his Instagram and I saw it. And that was, I don't even, yeah, that's the only reason I have the exact date, because I saw it recently. How many records have you put out? Right now, official catalog number is around 58, 59, 60. But then there's the other, like, 0.5 part of the label, which there's, I think, about 20-some-odd records. And then there's... The black thing. So it's almost like 80 plus or something like that. Around there. In the last five years. And, uh... Are we allowed to reveal the Russian torrent version's connection? Yeah, I mean, sure. There's 18 of those at this point. So it's a bit more than 100, probably. Yeah. Why do you have such a high rate of production? Well, the music is there from the artists that I'm working with, and fortunately enough, I'm able to put out... the music when I want to do it and when the artists give me the music. As a record label, that's your job to put out music. So I'm just doing my job. That's basically it. The music's there. You give me the music. Okay, I dig it. Let's do it. Let's put it out. And we just keep it moving. When Lies started, you're releasing all this music by artists no one's ever heard of. And it seems like there's just loads of these kind of odd characters that you're in contact with and you have their tunes. How exactly did that happen? I mean, did you have like a group of friends just with loads of tracks or, you know, how'd it come together? Yeah, it was, I was speaking to someone about this the other day. It was like really, it was really strange that, you know, there's a crew of people we all would hang out and like DJ and, and whatever, go out drinking and. cracking jokes and hanging around for years and years, you know, for a long time. And I had in, I think, 2006, I had went on this tour with DJ Overdose from Murder Capital and Vuelex and Bunker and Ingmar Pauly. they had a group called Nova Men and I went on a tour with them in the United States it was Nova Men, myself and then Steve Summers and Ari from Beautiful Swimmers they had this group called Manhunter they did only one record so it was Manhunter, Nova Men and myself going on tour And at the time, Jason, Steve Summers, had been making all this Filter House. And I was listening to it all the time. I was like, this is sick. And then I had a CD of it. I was borrowing my father's car for something or the other. you know, some Volvo with like a pretty good stock system or something like cranking like filter house, like driving through Brooklyn or something like that. I'm like, this is sick, man. I said to Jason, I'm like, one day I'm going to do a record label again and I'm going to put out a filter house record. one of these Filter House records. And Jason had so much music he was working on. He had, again, endless, endless amount of music that he was working on. And finally, whenever it was, six years later, something like that, a while after, let's just say that, when I got everything together for the label, I said, all right, man, I'm ready. Let's put out this Filter House record. And we put that out. But in the meantime, he had been working on tons of music. And then... All these other people who I was around had so much music. But it was all unreleased. I was living with Will Burnett at the time, and he had just started his label. Is that Willie Burns? Yeah. We lived together. That didn't last too long, actually. He started his label, and I was like, maybe if you need help. with the label maybe maybe i can like you know whatever you know help help you out or whatever and he got he just like laughed at me and in retrospect good idea i mean that would never have worked out ever that's that's that's for sure why not it it just wouldn't It just wouldn't. Will has his way of doing things and I have my way of doing things and it's different. I had pressed records actually before in the early 90s so I knew how to press records and I had actually run small labels before and it was something I was totally interested in but I, you know... When I started label, I knew what to do. I knew that I wanted to put out a lot of stuff. I knew that the way to keep things moving, have actually have a plan. When I previously put out records, I was just like, here's a record. Then you have to wait three months for the distributor to pay you, sometimes six months. to show you, pay you, and then it's like, there's no momentum. It's not real. When you put out one or two records, it's not real. When you put out three records, it's not real. There's nothing that separates what you do from the rest, like anyone else, because anyone could put out a record here and there. But a lot of these days you have artists running their own labels and like to put out their own music, which is good, where they put out one or two records. That makes sense. But when you're actually trying to like get other people's music out there and have people follow it through, it's not going to work if you just do something here and there. It's going to get lost. And when I started, I think when I started the label, there were a lot of people around me at this time that when we were hanging out for years and years, DJing and just being fans of music and talking and a lot of people who were around me were making music. with no intentions of releasing this music ever, probably, but just because this is what they did and what they enjoyed doing and had passion to do. And at the time of the label, I think there were so many of these people around hanging out in Brooklyn and everything like that. And when I started the label, yeah, there was. kind of this endless resource of people who had hadn't just were sitting on these huge catalogs of music yeah so do you feel like it was a particular moment in Brooklyn where there were a lot of bedroom producers and there was a lot of music kind of there to be released? Yeah, definitely. Everyone, yeah, everyone's like a bit older and had all this stuff that they were just doing. Yeah. And it was just sitting on all this stuff. Yeah, I do. Yeah, I think so. It's also interesting that you said that people were making this music without any intention of ever releasing it. They're just making it like to amuse themselves. Yeah. I mean, I mean, Jason. a perfect example like i mean at that time when i was listening to like this filter house stuff that jason was making he also had he also had like all this like ghetto tech stuff that will never definitely never be released that would sound like you know like dj godfather or something like this he also made some like baltimore club tracks he he also had some of that um rhythm based lover stuff i don't know if you know know that stuff but it's kind of like really nice kind of almost like late era Larry Heard kind of house music, but like kind of boogie also. like someone like Jason was hearing something and then being like, oh, I'm going to try to make a track like this today. I'm going to try to make a track like this today. I don't think he was ever like, I'm going to ever release this stuff. He was just had all this gear and he was like, today I'm going to make a track that sounds like Joe Louis, Love of My Own. Today I'm going to make something that sounds like Thomas Bangalter, you know. oh i'm gonna make a dj techniques track or something like that so yeah it was yeah i don't think he was thinking about ever releasing stuff ever. Do you think that's an important part of the personality of the music is that it wasn't made to impress anybody or it wasn't even made to be sold it was just made? Definitely think that it's it's it's it's real it is very little intention behind it yeah and I think you know when you go back to like the roots of all sorts of like dance music you know when you listen to Cybertron or these guys were not thinking about, hey, I'm going to make this music to make these huge records that have now legendary status. It's, yeah, it was just pure, you know? I mean, for lack of better words, and that sounds terrible, but it's, yeah, someone doing it because this is what they love to do. I guess the interesting thing is that a lot of... while I would hesitate to call Lies dance music, you know, a lot of other labels kind of in the same realm as Lies, there's a lot of intention behind it. You know, it's made to be played in a club. Or sometimes on a more cynical level, it's made to increase an artist's profile so they can get gigs and so on and so forth. Yeah, I think the great thing about the label is none of my artists get any gigs. So it's definitely a true reflection of the music. No one wants to book them. Someone like Luke, Torn Hawk, I mean, come on, man. This guy is like, you know, he was going to do this regardless of, he wasn't like, yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to, I mean, I'm going to make this record with, with me in this black sheet. He was doing this forever, man. I mean, the guy was like. you know, sitting at home, like editing these miserable eighties movies, just because this is, I mean, this is who he is. If you hang out with the guy, he's, he's this, uh, all encompassing freak. And I mean, you know, he's hanging out with his guitar. room like doing what he does and this is the beauty of it I think you know I don't think he was ever like I gotta make this record because it's clearly not the case because the guy sent me like hundreds of tracks like no who does that I don't know man I don't I don't you know it's like it's just it's like OCD you know you sit around and you just sit sit on your guitar and record it and whatever there's some rhythm box and that you know i don't think most people do it like that i think people a lot of people like okay i am doing this i don't do that but yeah this guy was just doing it for for i mean a long time or someone like bo wanzer the same thing the guy I didn't know this until recently, but he said he would make a goal for himself to record one track every day. Like that's, I mean, that's, that's, that's amazing that you did that and that you want to do that. But I mean, he, you know, because that's what he enjoyed doing. He's like, and he was telling me, yeah, okay. One day I would decide, okay, I'm going to use this machine, this machine, that machine. Then the next day a lot of gear and whatever and then he's like okay then today I'm going to use this you know he was just making combinations and seeing what he could do with it just because this is his outlet you know after a day of work at the science lab or wherever the hell he works you go home and just make a track so Yeah, it reminds me of, I saw an interview with Tariq. Is that how you say it? Yeah. Where he kind of articulated what you're getting at. He said he doesn't think of it as, like when he makes music, he's not thinking of it as this is my next record. It's just this is an activity that he does and he likes to record it so that, you know, he can listen to it himself and he can show it to his friends. And that's kind of, you know, it's as simple as that, basically. Yeah, I mean, that's it with like a lot of the guys, for sure. You know, I live with Marcus you know every day you know he makes coffee does his emails and then boom in the studio and just recording you know half this stuff will never come out but i mean and he did that for years and years, you know? What is the relationship between you and the other Lies artists? What's your history with DJ culture, club culture? My personal history with club culture and DJ culture is quite limited. I've been around it for quite a long time now. But I saw the end of real club culture in New York, actually. I saw the beginning of the decline of it. In the mid-90s, when all my friends were going to raves and stuff, I was going more to punk shows and skating and stuff. And I actually thought it was really corny. My friends were going to raves every weekend. Big pants, pacifiers, dyed hair, candy stuff. I mean, by the same token, I always knew of the music. I mean, Latin freestyle, I was hearing on the radio since I was a kid. Little Louis French Kiss, I mean, you know, I remember when... when it came out, you would hear it on the radio just as you know, but for me, the club culture, when my friends would go into these disco 2000s to limelight, to, to all this stuff, to, to, to raves at Newburgh skate park. I was not, I was not into it at all. I just didn't, I was quite close-minded too. I just saw the corny side of it. I'm like, oh, this is real corny, you know? I also wasn't into taking drugs. I thought I wasn't, you know, smoke some weed here and there, whatever, take a little trip or whatever. But, you know, I wasn't, they're like, yeah, we stayed up for three days. I'm like, that sounds terrible, actually. I don't want to be up around 1998, the thing that made sense for me with making a connection with more like club culture was coming across, and I've said this many times before, was Bunker Records. And for me, because Bunker Records, they were these squatter punks from The Hague, and they were just like... If you know the story of Unit Mobius, they were like, yeah, we found all our equipment in the garbage. Okay, that's amazing. Is it true or not? We'll never really know, but it's a great story. Yeah, we found all our equipment in the garbage and we just plugged it all in and then we started making this crazy asset techno. And to me, I was like... My thoughts of dance music was that you're in this, you know, some guy on drugs in a giant studio, like, being like, yeah, okay, now it sounds like this. And then, yeah, I just had a very negative view of club culture. It was mainly because everyone just looked terrible, man. I don't know, man. I was repulsed, man. Like, X-Girl and all this, like, huge pants. I don't know, man. I cringe at it. And I think other people who were around would have maybe... agree to some level it was like this because i asked my friend richie i'm like i'm like be honest i'm like how much of the music you do you feel that you were listening to there stood the test of time and he said yeah less than 50 and richie was like a huge raver and uh going to all these parties and stuff like that but it was really bunker records that that Got my mind open to this. And then, of course, also I was less closed-minded too. I mean, you know, early 90s, I was like pretty damn uptight about things, man. You get older and you loosen up a bit and you want to expand your total self. It was Bunker that got me open, for sure. Well, I guess you said you're listening to... punk um it sounds like you kind of uh even when you moved into even when you started liking techno and stuff you never really let go of that punk ethos it's what makes sense to me and it's the energy too that's there you know if you hear like drop bass network you know, which is like absolutely like insane music, you know, or, or mills. When you hear mills, it's come on, man. This is just like, it's urgent, man. It's, it's, it's very, it's futuristic. It's urgent. It's, it's fast. It's, um, you know, I've checked out, you know, the Perlon stuff when it was coming out, you know, I mean, uh, you know, Alkoffin and this kind of stuff. These are the records, unfortunately for me, that won't stay in my collection. You know, it doesn't hit like... I like the fact that when you listen to Mills, it sounds like the world is ending or is coming to an end or you're going into the future. It's just... It's insane. And this is what connects with me. It doesn't connect with everyone. Some people hate it. Some people are scared of it. But for me, if there's no sense of urgency, there's no power or energy to it. I like very basic stuff, man. I can't, it's very basic, but it's very important to me. I don't know if that makes any sense, but there's something to be, I think, said for the simplicity and urgency of things of this nature. Why do you think that is? Like the world-ending aesthetic, why does that speak to you? I think that's just the kind of person I am. You know, this is my chemistry or whatever. I think every day is going to be, I mean, the next day is going to be the last day all the time. I'm quite scared of every, I'm not scared, but I just think there's so much chaos all the time. everywhere i mean why why does everything is reactionary energy the 80s reaganomics uh iran contra all this is vietnam the whole thing you listen to dri or black flag or any any of this stuff it's just the world around you you know but then and then and then for me it translates into this this dance music you know when i don't want to hear some smooth nice, clicky, I don't know, man. I don't want that. It doesn't connect with me. I don't know. I'm crazy, man. What can I say? I don't know. Does it feel strange at all that you've been kind of thrown into club world? Yeah, it's strange. I don't feel weird going to clubs. There seems like there's a lot of rules that these people who are involved in this world abide by. it's this or it's that or it's this or it's the other thing. And to me, that's the strangest thing is many people are, it's very pretentious. It's also very close-minded and very little is about the music. I guess another way of putting it is like the experience of being at a club. Has that ever been? that important to you? Well, I've been stuck in like venues, you know, going to punk shows since I was in my teens. So yes, I mean, if there's someone playing who I like, yeah, I dig it, man, you know? I don't like to go there. you know, and talk with people. I do like to go into the back of the club and just, you know, let the music hit you if it's dope, you know? It's not so much that I'm going to see stuff or anything like that. But, yeah, I don't know. I feel like, you know, the idea of you as a touring DJ and Lies kind of lumped in with all these a bit more straight-up club-oriented labels. it kind of seems like it's just the best fit, but it's not, it doesn't completely add up. Like, like in many ways lies, as I said earlier, is not dance music, but nonetheless, that's kind of the sphere that, you know, you find yourself. Yeah. That's the, yeah. I mean, you know, it is electronic music, you know, so it does, you know, it's, it does exist in this world. It's whether. people like it or not it's there somehow i mean it's like bunker i mean think of it you know these guys are there man it's not pretty all the time but it's it's it's there and uh take it or leave it. It's like someone like these frack guys too, these guys have some crazy thing going since I think the 80s even. Who are these guys, man? They live on a farm in some desolate region of Sweden, you know? I feel akin to these kind of types of guys, I guess. I don't know. Yeah, it's there for better or worse. You know, yeah, I don't know. Yes, yes, we are there in the clubs. Is there an FU element to Lies, the music you put out? I don't think there's an intentional element of said word, simply because everything that I... put out is just it's what these guys give me you know they don't say i'm gonna record this kick drum really poorly to get people angry they do it because that's what they do you know i would love if you know i could get tarik to you know have a little bit uh higher recording quality sometimes it doesn't always happen but this is the beauty of it you know For me, this is him. I accept him as he is. I'm not one of these guys. I'm not going to say, can you go back and do this again? Can you go back and do this again? It's take it or leave it, you know? So... And sure, it does come off as sometimes reactionary and a bit like, fuck you. But it's never the intention of any of these guys, especially someone like Matt. I mean, come on, he's the sweetest guy, you know? So no, yeah, I don't think so. Not intentionally at that. People can see it as how they want to see it. When he started the label. How long was it before there was a reaction or before it started kind of being broadly recognized? I would say like the third year. The first year, I think we did... records the second year maybe five records and then the third year was able to really I think I did like 10 the third year and that was the thing there was so many issues at the beginning as well with production too that was like such a mess Very, very bad. So, yeah, it was the third year, I think, when people were like, oh, this is somewhat interesting. Have you been surprised at all by the response to Lies, good or bad? I'm completely surprised. Again, I mean, you know, I've just been rolling with it. You know, it's, to me, yeah, just keep going. Keep putting out. records with these guys keep doing it and yeah i'm quite happy with with the end result i think it's i mean i'm i'm humbled that i can put out the music for my friends i mean this is super cool thing to do so yeah it's it's it's weird I mean, I would never think that it would take this kind of turn. Sure. When you say this kind of turn, you mean like it becoming a career? Yeah. I mean, come on. I worked a day job my, you know, my entire life, you know, I'm 38 years old. So this is, yeah, it's somewhat shocking to go to like Romania to DJ. That's, that's weird. Went to Georgia. I mean, I would never think that it would turn into this kind of thing. Cousin tip. Yeah. Oh, yeah. How about that, right? Scary place. What were you doing when you started? You were working at A1 Records? Yeah, I was working at A1. I just started working at A1, actually, at that point. That was great. I mean, that's like, it was an amazing outlet too. I was putting records in people's hands at the shop. I mean, you couldn't ask for a better situation. You know, I start the label, I was just boom, boom, boom, boom. Here, check this out. So that was cool. For me, an interesting part of electronic music culture is this idea of playability, which I think lies kind of... provoked everyone on. Like I remember seeing things on Twitter, DJs saying things like, why would you put this out if, you know, it obviously can't play it more or less like it's too fast, too slow, too crunchy and weird. I mean, that's a fairly common response. What's your reaction to that? hey, you know, if you don't like it, don't buy it. I mean, it's for me, I never put out a record saying, oh yeah, this is, you know, this is going to smash the dance floor in two. If I like the track, I'm going to put it out. You know, again, it's... It's good to have a challenge, you know? It's good if it's all messed up. I mean, some of the best records are the hardest records to play, you know? I mean, that's why all... Come on. I mean, for me, this is why... There's a reason people always will never stop talking about someone like Ron Hardy or Larry LeVon, because they were playing records that were not meant to be played in clubs. B-52s, like a number of names, that's kind of like craftwork type thing. Liaison's Dangerous did not compose their album saying, oh yeah, this is for clubs or something like that. But these DJs heard this crazy music and said, okay, now I gotta play this in a club. It's gonna make people, you know? So the best records are the records that, to me, you're not supposed to play at the club. You know, functional. techno all this stuff this is like this is very boring stuff man this is like it's loop tech it's just straight man it's so there's no adventure to it the that's the stuff that's interesting man the stuff the hard stuff is the stuff that's interesting unintentional music for a club does it seem strange to you at all that Lies kind of ended up being a bit provocative or a bit controversial. It's funny. I mean, these are quite conservative people who have nothing better to do at the time and get upset about a record label, man. It's just, fair enough. Get mad, you know? Fine by me. I don't care. It's quite silly. Could upset people, but that's cool. Puts some people in their graves early. I'm fine with that. When did you move to Paris? About a year and a half ago. And why did you decide to leave New York? I mean, my life in New York was done. I didn't like living there much anymore. It just wasn't a home anymore. Did you grow up there? Yeah, I grew up in Long Island. But I lived in the same neighborhood in Brooklyn for like 14 years. My girlfriend is here in France, so that was it. It's time to go. It's good. I do not miss living in the city. Even though you say that, though, in New York, You obviously, you owe a lot to New York in terms of the music on the label and meeting all those artists and everything. Yeah, I owe everything to them, I mean, of course. Do you imagine something similar happening in Paris? I would never even think that way. I don't know. I don't even know what will happen, you know, in Paris, yeah. I guess what I mean is, like, there aren't many places in the world where you would end up. meeting all these artists and kind of having all this music to release and just sort of crossing paths with all these people, you know? Yeah. Yeah. If, if it didn't happen then it was. it just you know it could not happen there would be no label if that time was not where you know where it was like if I just was living I wouldn't just step back in Paris say I'm going to start a record label and then start searching you know there was no there was no search for it you know it was just like I made a decision that I wanted to start a record label because I enjoyed doing that. Like I said, I had done it in the past. And I was like, this will be a fun project to embark on. Again, it was a very unintentional thing. If I was anywhere at any other time, there's no chance. I don't think there would be. I had to be around these people. But in Paris, I don't know if it would. Who knows? I don't know. You can't say how people that you're going to come across or the relationships you're going to have or why you want to do something or something like this. There has to be a reason. I think one of my main issues just seeing people starting record labels, I oftentimes don't understand why people do it, really. There has to be a reason for it. Of course you enjoy doing it, but... you see certain things and you're just like, this, what is, you know, something like Underground Resistance, this is Detroit, this is what was happening in Detroit, Factory Records, this was happening, you know, over there in England, you know, Mute Records, this was, it's documents, Bunker, these are documents. But then sometimes now when you're seeing record labels, it's just, what is it? It's... Some guy who's like, I'm going to pick this guy from this label, and I also like this guy's thing. There's no feeling. It's just, you know, it's sterile to me. It's just, why are you doing this? I mean, of course, whatever people want to have their little projects and this and that. I'm not saying don't do this or don't do that, but to me, the things that stick out to me... that are important to me, the things that were documents of time and place. You know, you think of Salsoul Records, what do you think of Salsoul Records? You think of New York City, you think of Paradise Garage, you think of Trax Records, you think this is the time in Chicago, you think of Transmet, this is the time in Detroit. You know, these are important, these are never going to die, any of these things, they will stand the test of time. Obviously they have and so much nameless. The best labels are the labels when artists release their own music. These are the labels that are like, okay, this guy's doing this because he wants to get his music out. These are the best labels, not the labels that... pick this, this guy here. Yeah, so this sidetracked, but it also ties into what you asked, I think, somehow. Yeah, it's interesting the thing you say about labels that document a place in time, where the label ends up being almost like a cultural artifact or something. Yeah, of course. I mean, you know, for better or worse, When my label is done, when the doors close, people say, oh yeah, this was this terrible label from Brooklyn that had all this miserable music on it. And yeah, there you go. From year X to year X, yeah. We remember, oh yeah, we remember that stuff. It was so bad. Oh, I hated it. God, I was such an asshole. But, you know, following that logic, so Lies sort of is documenting Brooklyn in that sort of scene of artists in that time. So kind of where do you go from there? Like, has that moment passed or do you have to sort of... venture into something new now? I mean, for me, it's, I feel very indebted to every person on the label so much. I want everyone to me, it's, it's the most important thing for everyone who is on the label to be doing exactly what they want to do as an artist. And I think for me, running the label, I don't think the job is done. I don't feel like everyone is, you know, whatever. If Tariq wants to play in India on the top of a mountain, I want to help him do that. Until that is done, then I don't know, then maybe my job's not done. So I think we just keep going further, you know, with working with everybody and stuff like that. I don't think, as it is a document of that time. And there's still, it's very important, I think, that, you know, there's still many artists that are there in Brooklyn, you know? And it's important that they're there because there's, in my opinion, like just some whack music out there. And for them to be... there is you know it's good that there is there is something else you know there's room for everybody everywhere but there should always be something else and especially somewhere like brooklyn where there's all this change and commercialization and whatever or whatever, that whole business, you know, it's good that there's still some grimy people making some noise out there. That is important. So people to be there and be visible. The job is not done, you know, because, I mean, there was a time in New York, it was flat, man. It was flat. It was boring. And you can ask anyone and, you know, they'll either... They'll either deny it or not deny it, but the people around know there was whack music in New York for quite some time. There was no energy, man. And I'm not afraid to say that because that's how I felt. It was flat, man, for me. So in a way, it's almost like... intentionally or not was kind of an assertion that like there's still weird fresh stuff coming out of this city. Unintentionally so, yes. I mean, I think as a real, there's all sorts of weird morphing of other strangeness coming, you know, there's all these other weird people now out there in New York doing some odd thing or the other. More so. more so than a couple years back, which is a good thing. You never know what's going to come out of something like this. Why do you think it is that weirdness or griminess, as you said before, why does that feel more authentic? Or why is it that that is the most kind of worthwhile cultural phenomenon? I don't know if that is worthwhile for anybody or important for anyone. For me, personally, from the world I'm from and what I feel, it's important. That's what I connect with. When everything becomes straight, man, it's stale and it's boring. me but i mean some people like you know straight pop music some people like polish some people like the glitter some people like you know a wax bmw you know for me i like the beat up car you know cadillac down the block you know so yeah i mean this is just my for me again it goes back to this energy man for me that's where i feel the energy i don't feel energy from from polished stuff. But it doesn't mean it's worthwhile by any means. I mean, I'm no one to say what's worth anything, you know? It's just my taste. - Yeah, I think maybe, I mean, personally, I think part of the reason Lies struck a chord with so many people, 'cause even if you're into, you know, you listen to house music, you like club culture and stuff. for a lot of people, I think there's maybe a bit of like a threat of doubt of, you know, maybe this, like, it'd be nice if this wasn't so utilitarian or, or so focused on the DJ and the club and everything. And, um, there's a kind of ballsiness to, um, with the music that lies puts out, it's clear that it's not trying to please anyone. Um, I guess that's sort of what gives it its vitality or something. Well, yeah, it's just, I'm a fan of music. And again, as I was saying earlier, it's, I put out what the artists offer me. I never tell an artist, oh, change it, do this, do this. You know, then it's not. then it's not real to me you know then when you when you start telling people to I mean of course now and again you say hey you know make this eight bars longer so you can mix it or something you know whatever that that's fine but I'm never saying oh change the kick or do do this or do that you know there's no there's no need it's just you get what you get what's your process for deciding whether or not something is going to be on the label. Like the artists send you stuff and do you feel, do you sit on it for a while? Do you know right away? How do you know, how do you make the call? This, this, this is going to go, this is going to go on lines. Yeah. It's kind of crazy because I'm flooded with so much, so much music. And it takes time. Like, working with Bo Wanzer, Bo has these archives. It's insane, you know. He just sent me another folder of these crazy archives from 2001. You know, there's so much music. Someone like Luke, when we started doing records together, Luke sent me, like, 100 tracks. Someone like... Tariq too. So many tracks. You have to sit with it. It takes time. There's a random record that will come out this year. He sent me these tracks a while ago, three months ago maybe. I listened to them and then I moved on. He nudged me. He's like, hey, what's the story? I'm like, give me a minute. I listened to them and they were insane. Totally insane. insane stuff like genius stuff it's like at first listen it's it's something's not gonna sometimes it doesn't hit you on on the first listen of something like that you know it takes time and then because the in these tracks are like there's like very like you know attention to detail very like small sounds in them and stuff like this sometimes like you know you're going through track you're like okay cool cool cool cool part okay a little boring cool part whatever and move on move on move on in these tracks it is completely you had to sit in and i mean i had to sit on it but they're like not so it's it's tough like yeah the pro the process of like going through through people's things especially with like a heavy release schedule yeah it's it's it's super hardcore and making decisions on this stuff isn't I mean, it's easiest when some artist sends you three tracks and you're like... It's either happening or it's not happening. But when you have a lot of stuff to go through, and especially when you're hearing stuff, also a lot of stuff done in the same session too, it's like you can tell maybe a little bit more of the process or what they were trying to do with the music. That kind of also ends up kind of influencing you a little bit. Be like, oh, he was doing this. That kind of sounds like that. I know you're putting puzzle pieces together and stuff, but that's the toughest, when the artist sends you tons of tracks. But yeah, it's a long process to get the good ones, I think. I guess when you look back on the last year of Lies releases, it's quite a few tracks that you listened to, mulled over, made a call on. Do you feel like you have... sort of like a strong relationship with everything that's come out on the label so far. Yeah, totally. I mean, someone like Esteban. NGLY. NGLY. He came to my house, actually. And, like, we were listening. It was actually me, him, and Svengali Ghost together at my house, like, listening to the tracks and, like, just bugging out on the tracks. Like, oh, this one is crazy, man. Oh. nah, this one's not crazy. Whatever, you know. I mean, I actually had never done that with an artist. That was kind of interesting that we were sitting there together listening to the stuff. that was that was cool so yeah i mean we're like the stuff with eric copeland obviously that was like you know for me he's like a really old friend and to be able to work with him last year to put out to put out that like mini album was like for me super special to do that he's like you know i mean he used to be the bartender at the at the bar I used to go to and we just closed the bar and just get messed up. I mean, yeah. So I feel strong about, about all the stuff that, you know, there's a story, you know, for sure. That's a lot of this stuff. Do you feel like you could keep up this rhythm, you know, for the foreseeable future? I can do it, yes. Do I want to do it? Maybe not as much. Maybe. But maybe also. But it's a lot of work. I mean, it's an incredible amount of work. It keeps moving. working 24 hours a day. I could not stop working. So for the sake of my sanity, I probably should chill out a little bit. But I could, you know, put out very many records every year if I wanted to, yes.
