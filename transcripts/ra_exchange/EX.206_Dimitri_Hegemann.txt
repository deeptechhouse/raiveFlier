♪♪ ♪♪ Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Will Lynch, and I'm the Associate Though he keeps a pretty low profile, Dimitri Hegemon is one of the most important figures in techno history. Most know him as the founder of Tresor, the legendary club that kickstarted Berlin's techno scene and established the city's creative dialogue with Detroit. But by the time Tresor opened in 1991, Hegemann was already an accomplished promoter. Starting in 1981, he ran a festival called Atonal, which played host to everyone from Throbbing Gristle and Eichschen and Leibauten to early electronic acts like 808 State. Like Tresor, Atonal pushed Berlin's music scene forward and demonstrated Hegemann's vision as a curator. These days, Atonal is in the midst of a comeback. Last year, the festival was held for the first time in more than two decades at Kraftwerk Berlin, a breathtakingly enormous space in the same building as Tresor. As he and his team prepare for this year's edition, we invited Hegemann to Ari's Berlin office to reflect on his career in the city's music scene. To start, I wanted to talk about the Atoinale Festival. The first edition happened at this point more than 30 years ago, which I'm sure feels kind of strange. Yeah, it was in 1982, you know, I just moved to Berlin. They're already three years. I came from a small village and I came with a 4-4 beat, you know. I was used to listen to Joy Division and early Q. Then I came to Berlin and I... sounds and noises and they were talking about the genius dilettants and I became very curious what is it you know it was so new I thought I'm more I'm avant-garde you know I listen to the alternative music but then I got in touch with these groups called Sprung aus dem Wolken or Einstürzende Neubauten and or Malaria, White Russia or Notorische Reflexe and when I listen to this music I was fascinated it was so different from what I knew and my plan was to bring all these projects on stage together we did it in November 1982 at the SO36 club it became a very big success it was I use this name Berlin atonal because it was some music for me that was different. It was not tonal. It was not full of harmonies. It was for me music, experimental music. And the festival was announced by John Peel in those days. I did not know that. And John Peel picked it up and I think he liked Berlin anyway, but the entire festival was completely sold out, you know, for an experimental festival. It was a huge success. Thanks God we made some moving movies, you know, we made some screenings about the first big Neubauten performance. when they were young and wild and fresh, you know, and it was different. I mean, the music and the performance comparing two acts like today was much more interesting, you know. It was more passion. It was something happened on stage, you know. They used this, I say in German, Bohrer, you know. made holes in the wall, you know. I remember the situation, I was sitting in the backstage, there was a stage, and behind the stage was the backstage, just divided through a wall. And when the Neubauten were playing, performing, and by a sudden, this boom, this borer came through the wall, close to my friend, nearly killed him. Things like that happened, you know, or they worked with other tools, you know, you use normally for construction work, you know, like they worked with metal and also they did things like body painting or they had super eight filming projectors on stage. It did remind me on this group, like Tuxedo Moon, I did. tour with, you know, they performed more on stage. It was good for the eyes, you know, so the eyes were really involved in the whole festival. And this is a bit missing today, if I see the act and just looking at the computer screen of their Mac. So it was very exciting and then we continued a year later in 1983 and we brought some international acts into the festival like Psychic TV and you must remember The wall was still up and Psychic TV came with, I think, with eight or ten people and they wanted to see East Berlin and they got in, but West Germans didn't let them out. It was really weird. These days, we have not had internet or handies. It was a bit complicated to get it organized. But we were lucky to find a very old factory space in the wedding. It was huge. And we did the festival in November. It was very, very cold, but people were very interested in the festival. It was also fully booked and sold out. And I think it took four days. We came to our limits, you know, physically, and it was too much actually for all of us. I remember when we did the first festival, we... We didn't use big promotion. We just made no interviews or so. What we did was we went to the artists, to the places where they lived, and we made photos how they lived about their living rooms, kitchens and tents and fridges and about their studios. And that without any words. release these images and people really like them. And I remember I was in London before the second atonal in Hackney and I stayed with a friend in Back Road and a few houses on the same street, furthermore, Genesis P. Oritsch lived and It happened by chance. I met him in the street and I said, hey, are you interested to join our festival this year? And he said, yeah, why not come by in the afternoon? So I came by. I knocked at the door at 3 p.m. afternoon. And he said, shh, silence. And I did not know what was going on. So I came into this very tiny house in this apartment. And I saw this huge terrarium, like this table, you know, and this fucking big anaconda snake was inside. Four or five cameras were running and this white rabbit jumped around, you know, just waiting for this moment. It was a bit scary to me, but it was, you know, I was curious. I said, what's happening? I didn't see what's happening that day, but... They came a few months later to Berlin and then I saw what happened. It was the first time we organized a Beamer and we showed this film about this moment of the big... So what was going on with the Anaconda? No, I... You can't say. No, it was... I didn't like it, actually. But it was new, you know, we were just up for something new and... It was, you know, the name, maybe guys who were more really into eternal music, like by Alben Berg and by Bella Partock, Schönberg and so on. They might be a bit disappointed. But for me, it was very important to have a step before you enter this kind of music, you know. I am convinced that all the artists we know also have a second face or a second interest for another format of their music they write. I talk to many of them and they like another thing besides their normal sets to start more experiments in there. actual work and this is kind of a preparation to enter another level or another way of for understanding or for listening to different and so I think the most people came in the 80s listen to the festival and they were really open what was new or what comes next so in 80 we brought psychic tv and other bands and and then the test department came, and later on also in 1990 I did the last one before the wall came down. Oh no, the wall was just open, but we came up with this new dance music. It was completely new for Berlin. Normally Berliners were standing up in front of the stage and they had this attitude, show us something new. They did not move. always in a mean face, you know. That was my reception in West Berlin, that most of the Berliners had real fun. It was a big depression. A lot of people were wearing black suits and so on. But in 1990, then, we invited groups like... 808 State and Final Cut and Clock TVA. That was different. People start moving their bodies and they start dancing. That was completely new. It was like a bridge. It was also this 1990 festival did present two acts and I have released records before by Clock TVA and from Sheffield, this city. where Human League came from, Heaven 17, you know, this British electronic music. And then also from Detroit, Final Cut, including Jeff Mills, we released this album, Deep Into The Cut. And if you listen to this album today, to both albums, you can find out these first elements of techno rhythms, you know, very dirty, you know, reminds you a little bit on EBM, but very rough. street sound. England, on the other side, very nice sounds. But I think the result of both sounds opens this door for the music we call techno later on. For me, the beginning, I mean, Germany was always a little bit late. This 1990 festival was a bridge festival. After that, everything has changed, you know, together with this situation. And one year later, Final Cut, we stayed in touch with Final Cut in Detroit. They, Jeff, left the band and they started the project, Underground Resistance. And we started the club called Trezor, you know. And so we got together again exactly one year later. It was, the festival, I think, was April. 1990 and in April 1991 we opened the club. We did need this time, you know, to get prepared for the big trip. And that we do Atonal now again, you know, 30 years later. 82? Oh, it's 32 years? Yeah. Is it? Oh, wow. I feel really good, you know, that this young generation picks up this idea of performance of music in... sounds and envision you know and there's always this interest you know but we haven't had besides CTM festival that has its own house you know for me also the architecture is very important with concepts of this impact take place. This is very important. I think space plays an important role in the whole context with this music. It would not work so effectively, I mean, a concert by Steve Reich or by Glenn Branca we have seen last year. voices of the lake if the space would not be perfect, you know. Can you describe the space for people that don't know what it is? The space is an industrial ruin, a former power station, and it's a kind of niche space. It is not painted white. Everything is rough, you know. Here's the world speaking to you, and it is kind of a romantic situation if you go in. And you get really, there's kind of wake-up calls happening to you and your fantasy starts thinking, where am I? Many, many ideas go through your head. It's a very special place. It's like an industrial cathedral, you know. It's huge and it's perfect for this kind of festival. I'm interested in the connection between Atonal as a festival and the wall. It's interesting to me that this... turning point where the attitude changed and people started dancing. That happened right as the wall was opening. I see this point you're talking about. But it was also, it has to do with the development of the music instruments, you know, technologies. The electronic music just started, you know, it was the early acid house, Ataris, you know. And also this DJ thing became popular. Before the wall came down, we have seen in Berlin, West Berlin, a few acid house parties. House was not, nobody really took it so serious. Some special parties, but I didn't realize that it was really happening in Berlin. Some gay parties picked up house, but I don't know. More popular were acid house parties. The first keyboards I've seen or the first drum computers and software programs of the Atari computers have been used and it was very fresh and it was a bit complicated and the sound was a bit naive. I remember DVA already played with a Mac 2000 which was just on the market. So it was very young and very, very fresh. this electronic sound. But when I saw the Detroit guys, they still worked with reel tape, reel-to-reel, you know. I remember days at Mark's house, Mark from Hardwax, and when Juan Atkins tried to double some parts of his recording, so we doubled it. We used reel-to-reel and made an edit. and made another edit, you know. So this was really handmade, all these tracks. And I saw on the other side in Berlin the first digital editing stations, you know. So if this machine would have not been there, I think this kind of dance music would not have happened, you know. On the other side, you are right, this enormous euphoria in the city. did expect something new. In those days, when the kids from East Berlin came over and the West kids went to East Berlin, there was no control, you know. And I think we have had music like disco, high energy. We have had rap, we have had punk and rock and so on. this techno thing was fresh and young and new and wild and no words, no lyrics so that everybody could join it, you know, even did work in Poland, you know. So I think for many people it was easy to join this movement, you know, especially the youngsters. I think also kids from East and West Berlin agreed to this music. If they would say no, it doesn't work, it would not have happened. It was a common agreement from both parts of the city. This is our soundtrack for the reunification of the city. This is the music we dance to now. And it was also the symbol of this new generation for this new electronic music. The electronic community did start in this moment when the wall came down and there was no other city like Berlin where it could happen. When I look back today, we have had maybe in the early 90s, maybe 3-4% foreigners on the door. But it has completely changed. It might be 95 or 85% of international guests, maybe also then, and here and work. And this just happened in 20 years or 24 years. If I can say something good for this music is that techno became the door opener for many other formats. We've seen in Berlin for investors who said, oh, something is possible here in the city, you know. Also investors who came up with the idea to establish fairs for art or for fashion. This actually... happened because the electronic music demonstrated such a huge growth and movement. We remember the early love parades. It was incredible. And these were the images they went through. CNN, young dancing people in the streets of Berlin. Since these days, many things have changed. But it's interesting that this has happened without any order by the government. It just happened. And many times I ask myself, why did it happen? Arts was many years before in West Berlin a group of people or West Berlin was this island for open-minded people. They were collected in West Berlin. It was this island when you have had problems to find alternative concepts for your life. West Germany or somewhere else, you moved to West Berlin, you know, and you met so many other. What do you mean about if you had problems in your life or like what would be an example? An example for instance, I was 18 or 17, 18. I really loved my small village, you know, with seven and my radius was maybe eight miles, you know, some other small village, but I really liked it, you know, family, friends, and I knew everything. But then I decided to live on the countryside with friends, you know, to start a community, you know. I was 12, 13 when I listened to the sounds of... of Woodstock, you know, and I liked this idea, this hippie movement somehow, and I transferred it to my small village and maybe asked for an old ruin in the countryside. It was like a small castle or something, you know, but completely fucked up. With my friends, we seriously thought about to live there together and have a band and fix it again, you know, and just live there. And we wanted to be different, you know. I didn't want to have this life like my parents have had. And we were friends, but then we asked, for instance, the landlord, and it maybe didn't sense, he said, fuck off, you know. And this happened again and again, you know. They did not respect us. They thought we are... crazy. So they send us and I tried it many times to stay there because I loved my childhood and the friends. And finally I ended up in West Berlin and it was not easy to live in West Berlin. But the people I met in West Berlin, they have had similar stories. They told me similar stories. Still today it's the same problem. The young generation, maybe who could change something in their home cities, they do not find platforms where they can start. They don't hear this, yes, with you together by a mayor, yes, you are great, we need your ideas. Together we can make it. But most of these people go, or as I say, go today, everything is easier, they can go somewhere else. costs for traveling or for communication are much cheaper and it's much more possible. So young people go everywhere. For me, it was a big, big trip to maybe to go to London, you know, or to Boston or even New York. This was the sensation of five years. If I actually only knew somebody who came from New York or who drove there once to New York. This has completely changed. So this is a serious problem a lot of communities, small communes have to face today still. They do not understand that these young, fresh ideas... come from people they have in their community, in their village. The people are there, but the people who make decisions in the cities, they do not understand, they don't listen to them, to these creative young kids. So they all move to the bigger cities like Berlin. It's actually the situation we have here. For me, it was much more tolerance. And this tolerance was not given in my home city. And that was a reason that many, many people came to West Berlin. In addition, they all formed this relative humus. There is this book out by... Richard Florida, The Rise of the Creative Class, in 2002. And he described the situation about multicultural environment. If a city has this multicultural and can offer this tolerance, many young creative people move there, feel all right. This is the situation in Berlin and this is also the reason why different companies move to Berlin and are sure we find these people we need for our company in Berlin. This is also a key information for cities who may be getting more boring and boring and grayer. They behave more open towards creative young people. that they offer more tolerance. This is, I think, one very important step. We just do a project with friends. I call these friends happy locals. All these are guys that run an own company and started with nothing, maybe a gallery or a club or a restaurant. on IT thing, you know, or they do a network, you know, they run a small agency. But they all agreed to share their know-how, you know, and they would give it to people who need this know-how. So the happy locals intend to make locals happy in small cities. And this was one of the reasons we went to Detroit. with some ideas who might could function in Detroit, you know. It worked out really well. And also smaller cities, you know, Berlin. We have 10 cities, let's say, in Brandenburg with 20,000, 30,000 inhabitants. And they're all getting more gray and boring, you know. We have too much creativity in Berlin. also these surroundings, these suburbs and we should find a form, give know-how to help them. It would be good also for the Berliners, bring more activity and social engagement into these small communities. We developed this plan with the Happy Locals and at the moment we work in one city, but it's still the old problem. The mayor also, they never take this young generation serious. They're far away from reality and they don't know what is the Facebook generation, what they're doing, you know, they're all suspicious, these young 18, 17 years old kids. And we try to take over this moderation between these two different groups and we take this experience Berlin has made when the wall came down. It was give kids space and let it be. Then something comes out. And if we can coach these guys, these young kids from the cities who want to do something like small Dimitri when I want to find a platform in my home city, I would have stayed there. And I would have changed something in my home city. I went back there years ago, but it's really boring there. movie theater anymore, no theater, nothing. For me, art or culture is the only key, you know, to community life, this thing, and make locals happy. I guess it seems like Berlin has, before and after the wall, was kind of a particularly extraordinary example of the platform for art projects and just culture in general. I mean, I feel like... as you're describing the Einzels and Neubauten concerts, just how incredibly wild they were. That kind of thing, I feel, just wouldn't have been possible in another city with a more normal political situation. Berlin was uniquely prone to give rise to that sort of strange stuff. I think, you know, a very simple thing was that we have not had this police hour, you know? And there's very few spots I've seen here in West Berlin. So they were open all night through, you know. This was completely new. It offered a quality for us as young philosophers, you know, to find new directions in our small ideas and new question in music, in our small philosophies. spending hours and hours till sunrise, you know, in bars. And we met two other open-minded youngsters from West Germany. We changed the world, you know, in those days. This was not possible, even in my home city, when I maybe... wanted to hang out with friends 16 years old. It was no way, you know. Sometimes during the holidays we had a fireplace or we had some tents, you know, and that was also nice. But in the normal life, you know, when we went to school, there was no spot where we could exchange our ideas. I remember there was one from a friend. He has a mother and she had an old garage and we fixed it. We were 16, 17 years old, you know, for the first time we met girls and it was, you know, there was no place to kiss and so on. And it was a disaster, you know. It was very difficult. Everything was difficult. Everything was forbidden. So we really enjoyed when we came to Berlin. in the house everything was anonymous you could you had the feeling i can do what i wanted to you know i really woke up here in west berlin and then i met people at the universities that similar story was um i was happy i was really happy and i got all this special passport you know passport when you were registered in west berlin you had a special passport so i was really proud of that. I think we were also a little bit arrogant, the Berliners. But the spirit was different. Berlin was financed by West Germany and by the LR. A lot of military, a lot of Turks, students, laborers. There was actually no industry. A lot of universities were senior. And so it was this legendary Atlantis. I did realize this later, you know, when the wall was down. Today, how great it was. But that we could hang out in the night was very important, that we developed the future. in the night and especially this music also this there were people they could not play even one instrument they just made music you know that's great you know and they said fuck it you know I don't care maybe one riff or nothing but I can make you know I can make noise and also discussion we have had in the bars you know I remember it was also completely new for me. I had the feeling I'm in a paradise. Everybody understands me, has motivated me because Berlin offered artistic freedom for many of us. It was also not this control, you have to function, did you do this, how far are you. It was great. I could organize my life by myself and I realized I don't need so much. And people think like me. And so this was all new comparing to the places I came from. It seems like Atonal and even Trezor are kind of these celebrations of that freedom that you're describing and that sort of open-mindedness, that sort of event, that kind of music. is a pure reflection of the possibilities that that environment gave you. Yeah, but it's still possible, you know. But Berlin has really to wake up, the city has to wake up and show that they can save this kind of creative sense. They're very important for the future, this kind. of Freiräume, we say, free spaces, you know, like what we do at the power station at the moment. This kind of space is so important for this kind of development, you know. It looks that the people who are in charge for culture in Berlin now wake up a little bit and think, okay, this is serious, you know. This kind of attraction brings us the visitors in the city. Looking back, I'm convinced that maybe a big Berlin hype has to do also with maybe just one, two, three attractions in Berlin. People in Europe have heard about when there are these two spots, you can do what you want to do and we want to go there. And it works like this, it's a book of flight through EasyJet and come to Berlin and want to go there or there. But on the way to this spot they find another feeling of being alive in the city and they find other things they really like. They find inspiration everywhere. In small streets it's so different and it's affordable. This was enough. I try to think about Detroit again and they need more attractions. Maybe there's this one festival, but it's not enough that people come over. They have space, but it's also not enough that people come over. They need more things like what we have. I don't know if it works out. But Berlin has all these things. But it was very simple. It worked out. The city did not invest any money into marketing campaigns, come to Berlin or visit Berlin. All these things came. through different channels. And finally it was this alternative, wild, subcultural. that has formed Berlin as it is today, that has changed the image of the city. And I hope it will stay because the city of Berlin or the department called Visit Berlin, the marketing of the city. They want more now, you know, they have seen 25 million people or registered hotel nights, you know, there were more, there's Airbnb overnight are not in, we'll call it, but millions in the last year. Now they want to have 30 million, you know, and that brings this danger that maybe people... who really want to make business, you know. The danger is that we cannot keep, promoters cannot keep the quality in restaurants, in clubs, you know. Generally said it's that this competition becomes really hard. Yeah, the business, the commercial side, that was always kind of the missing ingredient. You know, the fact that... There was never that much competition or commercial interest in the city. I think it seems like that's part of what made its unique culture possible. But it made other things possible. I think the competition, we feel it now, but it also you feel it between clubs and so on. This has not been in the 19th century. We don't know what it is, this competition actually. Now it's became reality, you know, and not so nice, I think. I also think it's not so necessary, you know. But at the moment it's happening. And I think also money is not the most important thing. Many companies in Kreuzberg, for instance, where I live, survive. Have a good time and that's enough. Projects like Carter Holzig, Holzmarkt or one called Bar 25, they come up with a complete new attitude. They just say, okay, do this together, you know, it's a project. We know we never really make money, but we will have a good time, you know, and that counts. And they demonstrate a new quality of... how things can work, even if it's very expensive, how to find fundings for their ideas. And this was great. I mean, one guy, Mario, who was in charge of the business there, he accompanied me to make a presentation how they got finance through Swiss foundations and so on. There are possibilities. On the other side, I must say, even the fashion and the art fairs do not bring the big money. It's okay, it works and brings people into town, into the city, but there's no big business behind it. I think the real estate, these guys, they try to make real business. But it's also a problem that too many forts happen now. in Kreuzberg, that maybe houses are made for residential, but next to a club and so on. And this brings problems. And we have these cases now near the wall. They built this building because the city made a mistake. And these are problems. We have to see what will happen. You feel that this gentrification is really happening now. I feel it also in Kreuzberg that the city becomes more expensive now. Since two years, two, three years, there is a big interest of people just buying complete houses. People with money, I don't know where they come from. But it's just by a complete street. I don't know what it will, what does this mean in two, three, four years. So it's the old story. If something becomes too big, finally. collapse all the cultural activities get thrown out and we have a contract still another 15-20 years with this power station and we expect to make a foundation that tries to buy this building as it is for bigger experiments in art. in music, so that we can keep the stage in the inner city area. So this is my idea and we see what will happen. I cannot guarantee it, but the next 15 years are safe. We have also a new senator, Tim Renner, for art and Berlin is spending just Berlin for... culture, spending like 500 millions a year for the opera houses and theaters and quite a lot just for the established culture programs. I talked to him and he's very open to take care that this kind of spots stay alive and he understands why people coming here, he understands how important this subcultural... work is so i put a lot of hope in his work now and with activities and i hope that we have a discussion soon and we can tell him on our mind what we want to do and what why berlin is still function i think he will understand it and that's very important if he understands it we can expect his support It is not about money, but it's just to help with permissions and to sometimes negotiate with neighbors or with owners. And it's important what we're doing that really needs these places, you know, that he bless us. Locations and people who are in this genre. Me, actually, we do have two new projects. It's like I want to do... I want to establish an academy for subcultural understanding. This is kind of a very small academy where we transfer know-how to people who maybe come from the countryside and want to do start something and they don't know how it works. First we interview these people and then if we think they are alright, they take it serious what they want to do, their plans. Then we... them on another level and we coach them over two, three months. It doesn't matter what they want, running a gallery or a club or an agency. If we can help through the Happy Locals, we do that. So the Academy for Subcultural Understanding, I call it the ASU, it can transport the Berlin experience to other people who need it. excited about it so I can become professor of my life and also other people you know if I look back you know we have seen so many people in our team who have did bring did develop a big know-how in small things you know you maybe to structure and get organized the storage or so you know to tell me how much money the club made a night they just looked at cases. We saw this and nothing. And then they said the turnover must be this. So they have this know-how and talk to these people. If somebody wants to know this, it's brilliant. You learn so much. You wouldn't learn it on the university. So I think it could become a kind of spot where special know-how gets transferred to people. want to know this. Also how to talk to people from the council. We can help, you know, they take us more serious now. They asked me in Thessaloniki in Greece, in another city in South Germany, the happy locals, who are you, what did you do so far, which city did you develop? And we just said, just one, Berlin. And then they said, they were calm and said, I understand it. This Berlin becomes now also a brand, you know, and it opens doors and they say, okay, what did you do? Because members of Happy Locals come from all different parts of cultural business or whatever. And this is also interesting to see that they all want to share their know-how. It's a very social thing, you know. I like this idea. to do this project. That means also for people who became older and do not work anymore in the club or so can transfer their know-how to people who need it. And the second thing is I work on a project, it's called Hamlet. And Hamlet is an old residential house for older people. They didn't fix it, they didn't bring it to an end and we want to make it. residential for artists. How do you want to live when you're getting old? So we're working on this. We got also financial support from the Swiss Foundation. We start very soon. Maybe we have a place for 50 people and also for people who want to have a studio. And we have big co-work spaces there. for you might be interesting. It's in Kreuzberg. And this house has not been built to an end, you know, so we just leave it and we work with experts who know about in-farm gardening or want to build up a garden on the roof and different things. It's a very interesting. It could be also a project that could be somewhere else, you know, take a ruin and fix it for all. 50, 60 people, you know, make a small. city in a house and bring an interesting mixture into the house. And even especially the gold generation are people who are about 50. So what can we do with all these people? I had to face this situation because we had Trezor is now 25 years old and we have some people who still work there from the beginning. It's difficult for them to work in the night because time has changed. It's a young club and it works with young people, young music, young trends, and what to do with these people who have invested a lot of years into this project. So I think maybe we have a solution with this academy or with this Hamlet project, so we see what we can do. It's interesting to me that with the Hamlet thing you're describing and also with Holtzmacht, it feels like there was obviously a time in Berlin where this sort of interesting, spontaneous cultural stuff happened naturally. And now it feels like we're in a period where people like you are... going through a lot of effort to make sure it keeps happening in Berlin because it's not certain that it will. Would you agree with that? Yeah, I think when I talk to mayors sometimes, you know, in Germany we have a kind of, it's called Deutscher Städtetag. It's an organization of all mayors of Germany that are involved. And once a year they meet in Berlin. Many of them in my age, you know. So I can talk to them, you know, or they're younger and it's easier, you know. They take me more seriously when I say, oh, grey hair, white hair, it seems to be okay. And then I tell them, I talk to them. And again and again, I'm so surprised that these problems they have to face in the small cities are actually simple, you know, simple problems, but they're more blind. But I think looking back, it was difficult. Nobody took you seriously, nobody. Even in 2005, when we had to give up the old resort, the old vault, at the old ruin from the Wertheim building, the first biggest department store ever in continental Europe, we wanted to build and we had to invest. We wanted to make a treasure tower on top. Number one address, you know. But they didn't realize it in the city. They just sold the grant to somebody who offered the most money, you know. Such a big mistake. Could stop this thinking, you know. It seems like you have a personal mission to prove to people how healthy and legitimate this company is. countercultural stuff actually is for a city to have. Yeah, I think so. I mean, I belong to a group of people who keep things moving, you know, like what we do. Very important to correspond with some other parts in the city, you know. My job is kind of intermediary. I understand the language, the people talk in the clubs and so on. And I also understand the language. city council speaks, you know. And so I try to make things possible. But I also have to warn people who want to do this because it's not easy. Sometimes it gets really on my nerves. Really, it's very frustrating also because we know some things I have done like Trezor or the Kraftwerk. and some others, but there are so many things that could not be realized because some stupid obstacles or some stupid persons stopped it. One case was, I was in Arizona and James Turrell lied. and he was open to establish first some works of his collection in Berlin. And later maybe there was this chance to start a light museum in an old waterworks, old water tanks in the west Berlin. Everything was done. He came over with his architects. We planned everything. But then it got stuck one year. two years again, tried to find answers and solutions, three years, four years, five, six, seven, eight years, and then it was over. But everything was prepared, you know, and Berlin Woodhams, it's a real light museum. And it was just kind of bureaucratic nonsense. Right, exactly. That's still happening. Same happened in Beijing. We did a great spot in Beijing. We started a cooperation with the Goethe Institute, and this place was never been used before. It was very close to the Lama Temple, and the plants, we got the permissions, you know, and wow, we were so excited. I flew a couple of times to Beijing, and we cooperated with some Chinese people. and then boom, the first financial support by Goethe did not work. They changed mind or somebody was fired and it was a bit too much for us and then it got stuck. And then like two months later, a big flood came, Beijing, and flooded the whole basement. It was difficult. But we were so close, you know, sometimes you're so close on a thing and then boom, it's over. But this makes you strong somehow. But I must say, if somebody wants to go this way, he must calculate it. Maybe 60% never works. I think it's interesting that, you know, you've got this kind of bug for wanting to... make these things happen, these sort of unusual manifestations of culture, whether it's a techno club, an experimental festival, this light museum. I guess what's interesting to me is it seems like this appetite for these sort of things. Obviously, you got that in West Berlin in the 80s. And you said before that in a strange way, part of you kind of misses the wall. And I feel like maybe all of this stuff is in a way kind of like a strange cultural benefit of the wall's existence that created this. bizarre environment in West Berlin where people had a special kind of inspiration that even decades after the wall fell down still lives on and still makes the city unique. I mean, in a way, it's like you're trying to preserve some part of the atmosphere of West Berlin when the wall was up. Yeah, you are right. It's a romantic thing. project so much things into West Berlin, you know, people who have never been there, now they're free to project everything into this part of Berlin once. And I must say, it was true. Everything happened there. On the other side, it makes sense also to keep this old spirit alive. And when we look into these ideas or into this attitude, then it's all about... to keep up freedom, you know, in different ways, you know, what you want to do or what you want to realize. You also see that it's very important to have people who prefer or prepare the stage, you know, or the actual spaces where things can happen. It's so important to prepare the platform, you know, where other things will start. I say no venues, no parties. And the other thing is how the quality of venues, you know. I saw concerts in the Arts in Berlin by the Kronos Quartet with neon light and horrible, you know, it was like. Deutsche Sparkasse, you know, in the opening room or in the lobby of a Berliner Sparkasse. And it did not work, you know, things like that. Berlin by the Wall was always a space for me, my research. City of Ruins, all these films, the movies I've seen, they played after the war, 45, 46, you know, it was played in this. kind of spots. And I personally like I'm a romantic person. It's more than the hypothetics. You know, I accept it. And I think both formats live together. We have these high trash clubs, you know, but we also have the glamour clubs and both worlds exist. But I believe that the trash surrounding The ruin generates more power created for new ideas, for new things, even for new problems. I mean, I guess that's, you know... the way you just described it, it's like a single ruin can create, you know, a creative atmosphere. But it's also sort of true of Berlin, you know, in a broad sense that ruins foster creativity and new ideas. Yeah. I mean, I did my work in the last, I mean, I started in the 80s or so until today. For me, the best moments, again, after all these years and all the things I've seen and also the travels are, these moments in the clubs, you know, where these components fit together, you know, space, music, sound, you know, the people, the shadows, the light. This is great. I'm not a big fan of huge festivals. I still feel right in the ruin, you know. I think also the history of clubs like the Trades Oil has made is very authentic, like a human life, you know. You come up, you rise a bit, and then everything collapses again into a gap, and then you try to start again, and it happens again. Boom, you know, you fall down. We live with this development, you know. Because there is a new generation coming up after this first generation, the next generation. Most people who go to the trisor today, they have not been born when we started. So we are not upset if we make mistakes. It reminds me of my life, on everybody's life, that you do mistakes. But I think you always need people who believe in the success of art, whatever format it is, that you really believe in this. When I met James Turrell, you know, he's older than me. He still works for this masterpiece, The Rodent Creator, since 35 years, you know. Still close, he doesn't let anybody in. It's not public and he really fascinates me. And I asked, where does it take this power from? But it just lived for this idea, you know. And I followed this thinking, this attitude. And it needs just a few people to do this, but they're very important. I can also say it was never the reason to make money, you know. This became when we did the label, the record company in the 80s. We were just looking for a stage where we could perform our music and our groups and artists. And that was the reason behind it. It was not to sell liquor or so. And so the reason why we started this was another reason, like maybe business people do that and need their percentage. And we made so many mistakes. I think we made all mistakes. can make, you know, if you start a business. The belief in this idea was so strong that we, even if we have had a gap, we continued, you know, and I liked it. But I'm really happy about that people of like Lawrence and Oswald and Harry Glass and Paolo, they continue with this idea of atonement, of this early idea, you know, created. A festival where completely different formats come together. I try to push them daily. Bring also literature or bring people who write about it. Bring people with computers and bring more performers. Make it more eccentric, the festival. Make it interesting for the eyes also. Risk something. Some real experiment. And yeah, it works. I'm very pleased that they like this idea to reuse the space and to bring the right content into it. So it's good that I can accompany them, that I can offer them this power station for this project. But on the other side, I'm also convinced that they... over this old idea and bring it to success. And I was so happy that last year, after 23 years, when they started this festival again, so many people enjoyed it, you know, and that it still works. That means the old ideas are still very updated, you know, they're very modern. It's great. And I must also say, since we have this space and we keep on fixing it, I think by the end of the year it will be fixed and then we will definitely do a few great parties. Maybe not every week, but a few great parties in the complete building, the entire building up and down and just working on a ghost train situation down in the basement. It's huge. It's really huge. I have some meetings also with some very important artists, light designers. I don't want to talk about this now. But if this works out, so I bring people from different art genres together to form a masterpiece with a space, that would be perfect. It looks good, and good things need time. I don't want to make... compromises anymore. But I think Berlin will enjoy a good time for the next years as long as they keep these kind of spots alive. This is the challenge they have to face, the politicians. as we have seen that the senator for culture now is somebody who comes more from the rock and roll side not more from the classic opera side this brings hope I see I'm looking forward and I'm very confident. Earlier on you explained how stuff like 808 state, the early techno stuff dovetailed, led directly out of all the avant-garde stuff that had been going on at Atenal. No, it's a situation in those days in 1989, 1990 was that the star, the new star was the public now because they moved for the first time. Normally the Berliners just were steering at the stage, you know. And now they became the stars. They became... They started dancing and moving. This was such a new thing for me. But the experimental thing was also the work with machines. Like when Clock TVA performed with the monitor walls, with the films they did for each track. I was great, or even GTO was greater than one. still work with big projections. 808 said, okay, maybe I was not sure, but it was so new in those days, you know, it was also something new because the toner always intended to bring new developments continental Europe has not seen before, you know, so that was like the first appearance of 808 State, but also the other groups on that day, you know, they came. It was also kind of industrial stuff, you know. We always had different stages. We've had different stages and other stages there was very experimental art groups also. But the main stages have been played by these groups. I must say also the Atoll Narnat. was in a very small spot. We only had 900 people or so. It took place at the Kunsthaus Britannien. In Studio One it was a nice place with an old kind of a cathedral, you know, but it was not... Everything was white. We had to paint the whole cathedral after it. But I didn't like it so much. It was not so much. But I liked more this kind of power station than factory hall. This was my world. The wall came down. This was also a new situation in those days. Everything was complicated. You must understand, when we did this festival in small teams, we never had that support. The first one, we had a bit of support from the Senate. After the festival, the complete team was always bankrupt. We had to hang posters. I had to give German lessons or Latin lessons to get the money. It was normal, but we were satisfied that the festival took place. It was successful, never financial. And I think we lost so much. But we were all happy that we did it and we were proud of it and it was good for Berlin. But it was never commercial. It actually could not cover the costs we have had. So we planned this loss and we never have had bars, income from the bars or so, or the promoters just gave us. Mondays and Tuesdays, you know, the people, not the promoters, the people who run spaces. It was always still of that, this bad conditions. We did it. I feel like when you were first putting on these techno acts in Berlin and when Trezor opened, I imagine that music. had a similar kind of avant-garde feeling to what had been going before. You're right. But that probably doesn't feel that way now, I would imagine. No. You feel like that spirit was lost over the years. Well, I mean, the young generation, they don't know the early days of Trissur, but I think... Sometimes I ask myself, I don't know what counts. Is it the name? On the one side, okay, it's Jeff Mills comes or Robert Hood. And I saw both in Detroit. Both were great, great performance. But I would really like to make a deep cut and bring Mr. Nobody on stage, you know, because there's so many good DJs. I don't know all these names and when I see I think Tresor brings every week 40 DJs on stage or so and 150 DJs or more going. This is different, you know. This is really different. I knew every DJ in those days. They come in, they get out. This business lost control a little bit also, I think. I only can say it was different. When we started, the Detroit people came to Berlin, they stayed here one week, two weeks, they played five times in a row. It was also good. Now it's difficult sometimes to get them on the phone. And it's busy, busy, busy, or I cannot play, I have this deal with them. This kind of business became really strong. And in this moment, I really sort of think, let's start again with a new project. I mean, we made this small tribe with a club called OM, and it's really good, you know. We don't talk about it so much, but people find a way. It is like the old Riziko or a club called Mink in West Berlin, I remember. And people really enjoy that, you know. But this is the Christ love, you know, the circle, you know. You start again. Even the love bread, you know, when it became too big. I also want these guys, you know, but they didn't listen to the basic anymore control. They took off and they sold all rights to these strange TV stations and commercial companies and then it collapsed. That is normal. I'm not surprised. So this could also happen to Berlin if the city wants more and more and more and more. It can collapse and maybe not tomorrow and not the day after tomorrow. It is dangerous and I think we should stay with this success, you know, this reputation. It's good. We all have good living here. We don't need more, I think. Thank you. you
