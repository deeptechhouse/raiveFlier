What is he? Tell me. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Will Lynch, and I'm the editor of Resident Advisor. Kelly Hand used to be described as an unsung hero of Detroit house and techno. Recently though, she's been getting her due. With a production career beginning in 1990, she has a sprawling discography packed with timeless releases for key labels like Warp, Trezor, and her own Acacia Records. In conversation with Matt Unicombe, we hear about how her perspective on releasing music and DJing has changed over the last three decades and her experiences the ebb and flow of a life spent in dance music. As always, you can hear our full archive of exchanges at resonantadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange of key hand is up next. Was Paradise Garage your first club experience? Or you'd been to Thing as Detroit beforehand? Well, that was one of the major first. Paradise Garage outside of Detroit. Of course, we had the Music Institute in Detroit. Not the first, but one of the really built-up clubs that developed in Detroit. Prior to that, I had a residency at this place called Zippers that Kent Collier recommended me to play. So I took it, and it worked out really well. That's when I started testing all my dub plates and stuff. So would you go out every weekend? Were you hooked? Yeah, I would go out every weekend prior to my residency, and then there was every weekend then. So, yeah, we just kept moving, you know, out dancing. And Chicago was another place I frequented. Powerbox and Andre Hatch's parties, house parties, just all the real good stuff. And I ended up meeting all the Chicago. producers as time went on yeah so what are you doing your weekends off now there is no weekends off there's really no time off i'm constantly always doing some thing if I have a weekend off then it's production or just doing nothing regrouping but there's very seldom I have a weekend off I think in a corporate world that sounds more lovely than in the music business world that's the thing because when you're working it's on the weekend I guess you need to have a few I don't know what happens when you get home So you're on tour at the moment in Europe. What day will you get back to the US? It would normally be on a Monday. So what happens? Sunday, Monday. So do you have a few days rest or do you get straight back? Yes, the first thing I do is I get from the airport. Sometimes I go straight to like the workout center. and just start working out. Just like I'm back at home. I can work out and chill. Or I'll just go straight home and just sit for like five hours. Just sit. You know, prepare the home for my dog to come back for the few days that I'm there or weeks. And then get him ready. But most of the time for me, I would just... sit and regroup that i'm at home do nothing go to the grocery store get some refresh the refrigerator that type of thing and so yeah pick up all the mail because you know the mail mail comes in a lot and yeah sounds boring eh that's okay i guess it's maybe it's like some kind of novelty when you're traveling so much you would really appreciate being at home and doing normal things like what washing clothes or maybe i don't know like i can i guess i can just imagine it's like a slightly like it's definitely a strange life well i mean i'm not a couch potato so i don't watch movies sitting all day like trying to catch up with the latest reality shows or you know the latest movies i have ipad i can watch movies whenever i want i'm not an avid movie watcher But I do like comedy a lot. So once in a while I'll sit and watch some comedy. But for the most part, I'm mostly with my dog more than people. Interesting. What kind of dog? I have a little Pekingese. Oh, cute. Yeah, a little foo-foo dog, like for the rich people like me. So that's nice to come back to. Right. I'm looking forward to going back home to see him. I don't care about the people very much. Everyone laughs when I say that. But yeah, dogs are so unconditional. That's where the unconditional love, or pets in general, just not only dogs but cats. And some people are animal lovers, some people are not. But yeah, unconditional love, that's where you get it. I'm always fascinated how, like, I would love to know, like, what's going on. When you can just look at a pet, you can look at a cat or a dog, and it just makes you happy. Like, what is going on in your brain? Like, is it their innocence? Or like, you know? That's a good question. Yeah, it's fascinating. Yeah, because it's their little face. Their little face. And the thing is about pets, in general, dogs. cats whatever you have mostly dogs or cats they're all you have and you're all they have so basically so they they look upon you to take care of them so you're looking at their face they're like you know babies like i treat my pets like family like most people do so you live in detroit that's where you grew up yep yep yep you've spent most of your life there have you all of it i'm there So did you move away for some point? Did I move away? Yeah. No. Actually, my work entails travel prior to music. And now, as well, my mom moved away. I didn't move away. That's where the misconstruings come from. She left Detroit. I didn't. So to clarify all the people who thought that I... Yeah, of course. If your mom moves to Hawaii or Germany, you're going to go there and visit and stay for two or three weeks. But anyway, so that's how it goes. Okay, cool. So what made you decide to stay? If she left in the 90s. Oh, Detroit was my home. I mean, I had just got a new loft and I'm like, oh, I'm running a label. I just didn't see myself leaving Detroit. So you had a lot going on there that was specific to Detroit. It felt like it was important for you to stay there. It felt like it was important. I was like, see you guys later. I mean, I helped them move up there, drive stuff up there. But I was like, see y'all later. I don't want to go to Atlanta. That was my first impression. And it's the last, too. Because she wants me to move there. And I'm like, no, I'm not moving to Atlanta. I don't like Atlanta. I mean, I like it, but it's, let me clarify. I like it, but to a certain extent, I feel like it's for. It's too relaxed. They wear flip-flops. You know, I'm more of a northern type girl. The south, I like country hospitality, the food, but it just seems like it's too relaxed. They need to shovel some snow and throw some salt down, like really put some grind in the ground. Like, Detroit hustles harder. Yeah, as the saying goes. So what did they think about your music at that time? I don't know. Did they see that you were treating it as a career? Or did they see it as like... My parents? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, because my mom was the one who got me my loft. She paid for me to get my loft. She knew what I was doing. They bought me. I wanted to... Back then, everything was switching over to that or mini-disc CDs. And I was like, I was asking my dad, my stepdad. I was like, can you find me this mini-CD? This is the new thing out. I need to record all my music on it. It'll be cleaner. They was like, all right. It was like $500 back then. It was like, all right. So they bought that. So yeah, they were very supportive. My mom helped me out with a lot of pressings, like maybe four record releases. By 94, you would have already traveled overseas. I would have already traveled. Yeah. I did the first tour was all of Germany. All over Germany, like all these little different cities. So that was interesting because I was like culture shock. It's like when I was over here, I was like, wow. Like I didn't know that all this was over here, like where I was. And I was just looking around like it was just different. It just felt different. You know, if you never leave your hometown, you feel like there's nowhere else but where you're at. You see what I'm saying? And it's like, wow. Yeah, so it happens. You get culture shock. And you've more or less traveled every year since then? Multiple times every year since then? Every year, yes. Even though I did not have a booking agency because there was a lot of people who took my bookings. They had my name on roster lists. And that was one of the reasons, I want to clarify, that was one of the reasons why no one saw me on the DJ bookings tours a lot back in the day because my name was on other people's rosters and they were booking themselves. How do you like that? So some agency would have you as an artist? Absolutely. It was more than one. It was more than one. What happens when someone writes to them saying, hey, can we book Kelly? They try to book their people or themselves. They say, no, you can't have Kelly, have this guy. I'm not going to mention names of who the artists that were being booked and who the agencies were. One just closed. And usually the universe pays its dues to the people who... do wrong things. Yeah, karma. So how was it back then? Like, I don't know, from speaking to you, it seems like you're friendly with a lot of people there. In Detroit? Oh yeah. Yeah. I don't know. When you talk about these things, like when you talk about something like that, has that kind of stuff just always happened? I suppose it happens in every scene. You mean like, uh... I don't know, tricky things. Well, there's people who not working regular jobs. They're greedy. They need to make money. They got families. And most of these, of course, are guys. I mean, because it's a boys network. So I can't say it's a whole bunch of women. It's a boys network. And so, you know, agencies all of a sudden popping up. Hey, we'll put you on, try to get you some bookings. And then all of a sudden nothing comes through. Years went by. People were taking my name. I found out later the reason why I wasn't getting any bookings was because my name was on some DJ company's list. They would never contact me. And it took me H-E-L-L to get the name off of that where I saw it was listed. I said, ah, this is what's happening. And so, yeah, I mean, the company, one of the companies just closed. And I'm glad because when somebody told me that they closed, I was like, they should be. Should have closed as soon as they did something like that. Yeah, because, you know, people, I mean, all these people was traveling around for many years doing 50 to 100 or more gigs a year. And but I'm not I'm not irritated about it at all because. all the people who are traveling and doing 100 gigs a year, I have over 300 releases that they don't have. So there's a balance. There's a difference here. I have more music out and these people have done more gigs. Well, you're as good as your last gig. my material goes on forever. Bookings don't. So it's paid off, actually. For me, today, I probably wouldn't have as much releases as if I had. So when you say it was a big boys club, I don't know, were you conscious of that at the time? Were you like, there's not many other girls around? Or you kind of just did your own thing? I was not conscious at all. It wasn't even the words that came across. You learn as you go, as time goes on. Oh, this is boys' network. This is the way it's said and the way it is. So what kind of things would make you realize? Well, everything is all boys, all men. This is not for women. You have these eagles that kick in. on these days, things like that? Or, I don't know, were there comments? No, they would not, because that would be discrimination. Egotistical, they're way out. I don't deal with stuff like that. It's either do or don't. If you don't like it, or if I sense you don't like it, especially today, it's like, whatever. But today is different. So, back then, it just never crossed my mind. I didn't really, it seemed like there was With anyone. I did. I did have. I'm not going to mention names. One person. That I had this offer for Crystal Waters remix. And when I told them. In Detroit. I said I don't have a studio. But they want me to do. Crystal Waters remix. Well I have. I have my own small equipment. But I wanted to take it to another level. For her remix. And at the time, she was real popular, you know, but she's still popular. And so I contacted one of these producers and said, hey, can I use your studio to make my... They were jealous and they didn't want me to use the studio. Next thing you know, they... they scratched the remix they didn't want me to do it yeah so I mean you have this egotistical because it was like oh yeah blah blah blah blah well today you hardly hear nothing about this person I can imagine when things like that happen it can be like quite deflating Yeah, I was just young in the business, just started looking for a nice studio. Well, especially you're quite a positive, like happy person. I can't imagine. Yeah, I can't imagine you doing something like that to someone. So when it happens to you, like if somebody came to me and said, I have a Michael Jackson or Janet Jackson or the Cure Group remix and I have a nice studio and they need. Assistant, I'm there, I have time when somebody's there. What's the problem with helping that person out? I'm not going to say, oh, yeah, I want to do that, because I want to contact the people or have somebody contact me, scratch their reaming, let me do it. I mean, everybody has their time. And if they just wait, which is... It's very key in this business. It's patience. And if you don't have patience, forget it. Go look for another job. Because especially you need a lot of patience in the airports. That's number one. If you want to DJ. That's the uno numero one rule. Get into reading. Get your game on about patience. And just in general, airports, music business. You know, I know someone that I put on to DJ recently. Someone up and coming. I put them on to someone to look at them and get them going. and they were frustrated in between. All of a sudden, they have an RA mix now. They have a new RA mix. It takes time. Like I told her, it takes time for all this stuff. Things don't just happen. Boom. Okay. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Especially considering these days, some people don't get known until they're 40 years old or something like that. Well, no. Even older, like breakthrough DJs. Well, yeah, that too. And then some of the new DJs just coming up. Some of them, some of the young ones, younger, they'll get noticed. If they're good, they got to be good. So there's some out there. But then you have some people out there faking that they're doing this and doing that. So that just don't work. I'm sorry. Somewhere down the line, it's going to end. It's not going to work. Because people know. The fans, they know who people are. Because they tell me they know who so-and-so is in Detroit. They know who did what. They know this. It's all on the internet. Everybody reads. Everybody follows. The people who follow specific artists in Detroit, all over the world, they know. They just don't say nothing, but they know. But eventually somebody will say something. Some of the fans, one or some of the fans will say something. And so, but what I found is that most of the fans are trying, they want to be, most of the fans. want to do the same thing that we do as in dj yeah most of the fans yeah yeah they mostly want to dj or uh which is okay because like i can be traveling somewhere and somebody like oh why are you over here and i tell them what i do they're like oh i want your job Like, they don't even know me. It's like, I want your job all of a sudden. Like, what type, what do you do? Like, sign me up quick. I'm like, yeah, it's easier said than done. It sounds cute. Sounds cute to run a six-hour stopover in Barcelona with no sleep. Exactly. Just like Nina Kravitz says, the hardest part of this whole job is the traveling. That's the hardest part, is getting to the destinations, to the airports. We're like flight attendants, basically. That's what I always say. We're like flight attendants. And that's exactly how I carry myself through the airport. It's like, I'm getting ready to get on the flight. I'm flight attendant. So you still get a lot of time to make music? Yeah, a lot of people. It's difficult. I will say, because I don't do that many gigs a year. So a lot of people think I do because of all the hype. I have hype and game behind me, which is good for today's music world. So you feel that hype? I feel the hype. Really? My fan base is 18 to 34, so that's good. How is it now different to 15 years ago? Now it's different because, one, I have a consistent agency. I've been having that within the last four years. Before there was taking on my booking requests or somebody in Detroit micromanaging my career. They do that a lot in Detroit. And I tell them, you need to stop and forward the information and stop micromanaging people's lives because you're not my manager. And I would tell them directly. I have no problems with that. Reimplementing that sentence. and we'll let it be known because it's ridiculous. You know, why should I micromanage you? And you live here and I micromanage every time someone comes here to do an interview. I don't know where he's at. Ask him this, Matt. Don't forget that. I don't know him. I don't know where he's at. Oh, he's traveling somewhere. She don't live here. I mean, just all the hate stuff. And so all the smiling in the faces, no good. They can keep their smiles in front of my face. But guess what? I'm going to keep smiling, keep doing what I'm doing, stay in my lane. So that's how you do it. And that's how anyone keeps going and just keep smiling and keep doing you. Don't worry about nobody else. Well, it hasn't stopped you making great music. No, I'm not. And to answer your question, I carry a mini mobile system with me when I have the time to get to finishing a track or mixing down something. But it's difficult because you want to go to the main boards. to do the full scale if it's something really big. But these days, people are making tracks off their laptops, pressing A, B, Y, C, Q, W, QWERTY, QWERTY on their keyboards now, and they're making hits. QWERTY House. So it can be done. It's always, there's a solution to everything. But at the same time, if one is traveling nonstop, you know, 120 gigs a year or more, there's no way they can tell me, you're coming out with all this music. And you are making this music. Yeah, you're coming out with it, but are you making the music? Because it's too much rigmarole. I'm only doing 30, 35 gigs a year. And it's too much rigmarole. I'm a high producer for music. It is no way. You don't release so much, actually. I have stuff on my boards that needs to be finished. And it's hard to get to because it's so many. And I only do 30, 35, 40 gigs a year. And it's so much to be done in between. It's difficult to sit down and say, OK, for five hours, two days, three Unless you just ignore everybody. And that's the way you have to do it. You have to ignore people for a period. time. It's not unpersonal. Just ignore everybody. For me, because I don't have ghostwriters, so I don't want ghostwriters. I do my own production. Started from one day one and going to continue. But for the ones who have ghostwriters, carry on. How prominent is this ghostwriting thing? I don't know. I mean, it's cool. I think, like, some of my, a couple of my... Colleen said they don't mind ghostwriting for people. They get paid. I know a lot of people who have been asked. Yeah, I mean, somebody asked me, well, can you ghostwrite my track? No, I don't want to do that. I don't want to ghostwrite for people. I think they would tell it. Your sound is so distinctive also. Yeah, I think they would just slide my name in there somewhere. It's K-Anne. Yeah, you shouldn't ghostwrite people. Yeah, I don't think that'd be a good idea. I mean, I'm trying to finish my own darn job. First of all, so, you know, like to put aside to try to do, I mean, you gotta be it. Ghostwriters are at their studios all day, every day. That's what they do. They're not traveling around DJing. Some of them are, but they don't travel as much. Because again, traveling, DJing, and doing massive production is impossible. It's impossible. Unless you have days off, you say, okay, I'm going to take these next 10 days off or five days off, and you ignore everything and everybody. So how did you produce all these records in the 90s? Were you traveling less or you were faster? I was not traveling. Okay. that was the point. My name was on rosters after this one major tour here in Germany, the first tour, all over Germany, different cities. And when I came home, like, oh, we put you on the roster list. And people were just jumping in, taking it, like taking all my offers and stuff or requests. And I later found out all this. Of course, I didn't know then because you don't know. There was no internet back then. But as the internet came about, I said, ah, this is what was going on. And so I should have actually had, you know, there wasn't that many agencies back then either. And the ones that were there, they didn't want to take on Cahan because Cahan is not big enough. You got Jeff Mills, Derrick May, they had their own agencies. So they just covering them. So it was about oneself. It wasn't about, oh, I'm going to carry Jeff Mills, Kay Henn, Richie Harden. Richie Harden had his group. So, you know, everybody started segregating. And then they just pick and pick who they want. And then the new agencies that popped up, ABC Agency. I have an agency in Australia. Hi, I got agency over here in Italy. Hi, I got agency. Let me put your name on the rest of this. And then you never hear from them no more. And they are nowhere to be found today. Silence. Yeah, dodgy. So it's just ridiculous, but it's water under the bridge. But today it's different. It's all good. It paid off again. I have more product than anyone can even find and more coming. I'm working on how to do more while I'm touring. At some point, the touring will slow down, depending on what type of logistics work I have as we move forward, speaking today, because for me, efficiency is very important, whether you have management or no management. And it's always been that way with my corporate work, and as well, I implement it in the DJ. music business work. So were you working full-time when you were making tracks in the 90s? Hell yeah. You were? Yeah, I was working full-time. I'd pay out of my pocket, pressing records, all my whole checks. Like at the end of the year, I would do my taxes, and 90% of my annual salary was going towards pressing records. So what would happen? You'd go to work in an office all day. Yeah. And you'd go, did you have all your equipment at home or in a studio somewhere? Yeah, I had a studio set up at home. Did you live alone? I had my own house. So you could be as loud as you wanted? Yeah. Yeah. So you'd go home, then just start. I don't know, would you start with the drums? Would you start with a groove? Or would you have a sample? That's a good question. I would come home, and I wouldn't fumble too much on music equipment during the week. What I would do is wait till the weekend. Like, I would line something up with Claude Young. He would come over. Most of the time, Claude Young would come over or some of my other male friends. And we would just, like, the whole weekend, just a new piece of equipment because back then there was no internet. So we would just hone in like on the manuals of this new keyboard, like how it works, what's the sounds in it, and just try to record because I had the Atari back then. or the Lisa's, the Lisa's sequencer. So that was just how it was. And so on the weekends was very key for me to focus on music. And then once I started getting going and recording, then that's when I'd be like, Claude, come over, let's work on a track. Sean, come over, let's work on a track. And just putting out everything, everything. Working on music, putting out everything. No bookings. Because that's how it works. I mean, it's If you can make a whole bunch of music and release it, you're not booked out that much. It's just, unless you have a studio somewhere else on your hub home, second home, and your home there for two weeks and everybody, all your distractions is out of the way. You don't have to answer emails, logistics, this, that. Somebody's messaged you about photos, this, that. then you're good. So who was playing this kind of jacking house? Like this Project 5 or this, or, you know, this Touching Me, this tune. Who was playing it? Yeah, like who would play that kind of stuff in the 90s? I don't know. That's a good question because I was wondering who was playing it too. Yeah, because of course now, well, it's timeless music. We've spoken about it. There weren't that many people in Detroit making this kind of house as was it yeah it's more the chicago sound there was no no one yeah so would you get good feedback on these records or you kind of just press them and send them off those were licensed like touching me was licensed to ospart here in berlin um what was the other track you mentioned? The Project 5 EP. Project 5 EP. I remember very closely, you asked me on the Love Games. Oh no, that was a different record. Project 5, I remember very closely, I went on to play with Kraftwerk with Underground Resistance. And me and Underground Resistance and I think James Pennington, it was a couple of other of us, came to London. And I remember I just had that record press and I was like, I'm taking some of these to London and I'm just going to hand them out, trying to get like, uh, people interested. That Project 5, Project 5 EP. And Mike didn't say nothing. He was just like, oh, okay. And so I remember handing out like a box full of those records. Nothing happened. That's so interesting. Isn't that interesting? It was something like it was dead doorknob. It's a long story. But I know a guy who... made lots and lots of house music in the 90s, had lots unreleased. I went through all the tapes. The tracks that sound... of the best today and that weren't signed were the most reduced like minimal tunes and he said back in those days they're like no there's not enough going on here we don't want this 20 years later these are the ones that sound the best wow kind of like your tracks which are also there's also not so much going on it's a little sample groove right right you know so maybe that's so weird yeah well i guess with all this extra stuff if you put a freaking saxophone in all this piano and all this, like, I don't know, extra melody. Musician old stuff. Yeah, it gets old, you know? Yeah. Whereas, like, Theo Parrish, he has more of a live band sound on it. I mean, I could make music like that, too. I mean, it's not that difficult. It's just lazy, you know, sounding drunk. I'm chilling out, blah, blah, blah. I wouldn't say drunk, but just chilling. Just like, whatever. All the swings on all the drums and everything. Just make it sound live. It's not that difficult. But people are mocking. They're trying to replicate what Theo do, what I do, what everybody does in Detroit. So, I mean, my thing is just get your own sound. Just do. I mean, everything is copied or recopied or you get inspired by such an artist such as maybe myself or Jeff Mills. Then you want to try to sound like them. I mean, it's okay. But just come up with your own stuff. So why do you think you were making this house with such a strong groove? You know, because it's this really rolling kind of sound. Right, right. It's funny. It's really rolling. You know, it's a strong groove. Yeah, because we're irritated in Detroit. That's why. We're always irritated. Detroit is not what people think. It's just a big hype. It's a community city. They make cards there. There was Motown, there was Techno now, and it's just a big hype behind Detroit. Back in the day, there was always some aggravations, plenty of aggravations that make you just want to produce to get rid of the... think about what's going on for the day or for the week. I think my background, no one has walked in my shoes. And anyone, no one has walked in your shoes as well. So the thing is, is that my background with Paradise Garage, going to New York and Chicago, what I do today is bring that to the tables that nobody else has experienced back then and can walk through my shoes and copy. You can play the same record like I just played Love Fest. You could play Been Around the World by Lisa Stansfield, but it's not going to be the same as when I played it. So it's different. People want your track list. Oh, what she play? Oh, yeah. Like I posted on Instagram some clips from Lovefest. And I'm sure everybody's went and Googled the songs and got the songs or bought the songs or whatever. But it's OK because I don't care because the thing is with me is that. you can't be me and I can't be you. So that's just that. Yeah, exactly. Speaking of Paradise Garage, you would see Larry Levan there? Yep. Is there any DJ now you could compare him to? Zero. So what made it so different? I actually don't know so much about Larry Levan. Ron Hardy I've read a lot. Larry Levan. Yeah, sometimes. Ron Hardy from Chicago. That's who I was talking about. Well, Andre Hatchett, too, but Ron Hardy. I used to go to his parties in Chicago. But yeah, Ron Hardy, there's nobody can match him either. Was he this more like a bit more like chaotic? strange kind of sound like playing the same record twice playing backwards you know a bit more like unconventional yeah yeah he used to do a lot of tricks and stuff I used to go to a lot of his house parties in Chicago every time we knew when Ryan Hardy was playing everybody was there he was like kind of like the first like kind of like Larry Levan of Chicago like pretty much for me but um yeah and Larry LeVan there's I haven't seen there's nobody that can to really uh replica Larry LeVan or Ron Hardy Everyone is so just getting back to what I'm saying, you come up with your own. You can't be this other person, but you can you can be inspired by the person and sound like one can sound like that person or get some type of similarities in in their productions or DJ process as well. So there's nothing wrong with it because everyone is inspired by somebody. And so it's just a matter of one coming up with their own way of doing things. And with me, I have something that nobody else has that I know about. Nobody can't replicate me. So, you know, unless they're just making a joke or something. You know, just like, oh, this is K-Han. So you would fly to New York to go to Paradise Garage from Detroit. Yep. So what would happen? You would leave Detroit on Friday night, Friday afternoon? Friday afternoon, yep. Yeah, so you get to New York, go to a hotel, drop your stuff off. Yep, go eat and then get ready for the garage. Sometimes we would arrive. Late at night. The Garage, is that what you called it? Yeah, The Garage, Paradise Garage. Yeah, it's funny you asked me because I didn't realize I just said The Garage. Yeah, so sometimes we arrive at night, and then the garage starts at midnight, 11, 12. So it was cool. It just worked out. We'd go from the airport, check in the hotel, boom. You'd stay there for 10 hours or so? Stay there until the next, until it was daylight. And you'd be dancing the whole time, or you'd go off and sit for a while? Go off, sit. They had a rooftop. Go sit at the spin them. I would go sit in the speakers the bass speakers depending on how you feel you know because everybody I was just pretty much drunk at night. And so what was it? I guess, well, I guess it could be a bit of both, but was it psychedelic, like inner experience or would you be jumping around? Everyone's happy. You're just doing your thing. Okay. You can just go on the dance floor and just stand there. Nobody cares what anybody else is doing. Everybody was doing their thing. There were stars coming in there. It was like, oh, there goes so-and-so. Just keep doing what you're doing. Nobody's excited about that. Ah, there goes a LGBTQ person. Oh, and they look real pretty. Oh, okay. Just keep doing what you're doing. It was just everybody in my own business having fun dancing. It was all about dancing. And then, you know, with the live acts as well, it was very awesome. I didn't know so much about it. Lolita Holloway, Grace Jones. I saw all of them live. right in front of my face, like as close as we are. Yeah. All these big acts. So you'd stay there till the end most of the time? Yeah, till 12. And then go to Vinyl Mania, old Vinyl Mania record store. I'm like, what's that record Larry played? This one. What's that one? I want all the records that he played. And they start pulling out all the stuff. The shopkeeper would know. Yeah, it's like they also came here straight from the party. Yeah, and I bought all the records. All the records that he played, he just started pulling. They would be playing some when you walk in the store. Because the thing is with me is, well, one thing I noticed too, and I have a From that era that I'm getting ready to start listen to and um archive like off the tape cassette tape and I used to always carry a cassette headphone. And when I left the garage, it's like I still wanted to hear the music. It's like it just sticks in your head and you don't ever want it to go away. Like it's just a good feeling. It's almost like a drug or something. Like the music is like a drug. And so I would listen to it. I would have my headphones in my ear the whole time, even after the garage. I was like, this is, like, thinking about this, it's kind of weird. It's always have something like boom, boom, boom. Really, and I used to rewind back to the same exact track every time on this cassette. Walkman, like. Yeah, Walkman, back then. And so, buying all the records, doing that, I'm like. And I still have those cassettes, which I'm so grateful to, because I can pull them up and just go back to that time frame. of what was actually highlighted there. Like we were talking about before, what other field or scene or hobby? So we're talking about Paradise Garage. There's no way for me to understand or kind of experience that. But if I'm a basketball fan, I can go and watch a 90s basketball game and kind of get an idea about how it was. But dance music... It's such a finite, elusive thing. These clubs exist for, I don't know, a few years, a decade or so. Then it's completely over. The only people who know what it's like are the people who know it. who actually experience that but yours your experience of paradise garage i can never access you will never be able to access it i'll never know but you will be able to experience it at my sets yeah yeah because everyone tells me and this is i just i just realized this and noticed this the people have been telling me the feedback is that they feel refreshed after my sets and very refreshing when I come to their territory, wherever they may be worldwide. And what we found was what I'm bringing is experience that I had from the Paradise Garage, the power box in Chicago, the really top, hottest clubs in the world. bringing that same experience to you, to your location, where you're located. And it's a different feeling. You can hire anybody else in the city. This Joe Blow over here, this person over here, this new DJ over here, call this DJ from Egypt, call this DJ from Dubai. It's not going to be the same. Because they did not experience what I've experienced. And there's only a few of us that have experienced this type of... And I'm so grateful to say that I'm happy to experience it, not knowing that I would be in the music business at the time. Didn't I know? Yeah, maybe that also explains why House sounds so much different now. You know, no one can make this, even when they try. No one will ever make a groove, well, in my opinion, there's no grooves that add up to it. Any Dance Mania groove is better than almost any house track that comes out now. Exactly. Don't you think? Exactly. But what is it? Why is it so elusive? It's the same thing. It's why it's so elusive. Yeah, why can't I train with a 909 and make a Paul Johnson groove? It's impossible. You know, what was going on then? Oh, it's possible? Yeah. I mean, it's not that difficult. Well, for you, it's not that difficult. Why can't you do it or anybody else, you're saying? I guess anybody else. Well, anyone making music today. Well, I think it comes from the environment. Like Chicago and Detroit, we come from a certain environment where we can take things out of something or nothing and make it into something. And so that's what has occurred. Chicago came out with the Acid 303. It was just a bass machine for bass musicians. It wasn't made to be an acid machine. They, Chicago made it into an asset machine and then boom, everything starts moving around. Everybody started buying and using and finding out, hey, this is the machine that makes the asset. I even bought one from a guitarist in Detroit for 50 bucks. The real 303. He was like, oh, I was a guitar. I was a guitarist. I was like, why are you selling this? He was like, I was a guitarist. It sounds like shit. Just practicing bass lines. That's what he told me. He was practicing bass lines. I was like, oh, okay, 50 bucks. My dumb butt sold the darn or traded it for something. I mean, I would have loved to have kept it, but I have the new one now. But it's not the same. So, yeah. So the thing is, is that the beat, why do other people want to copy the Dance Mania beat? Why would other people want to copy that sound? Well, yeah, that's a good question. I guess because it's so good. The swing and the groove is just... Oh, see, I know all the secrets. So how would it work? I don't know. When you were making a track, would you just have a loop running for hours? Oh, you just find your groove. See, the thing is, is that you got to have some soul. That's number one. You got to come from the hood. I'm middle class, but I still come from the hood. Now, I could be ghetto. There's south side of Chicago. There's north side of Chicago, east and west. So most of the south side was the very grungy side of Chicago, which is still some of my friends that live there. In Detroit, the east side was always the east side, west side. like that. So we all grew up on the West Side. You had the East Side. They're like, oh, no, the East Side. So, I mean, it's the ghetto. I call it, I mean, not the real ghetto, but just we come from, we didn't come from, you know, ice cream and whipped cream topping neighborhoods with mansions and where there's no grunge. If there's no grunge in your life, basically, you're not going to find the soul within you. And that's really important. Everyone has soul, but you have to find it within yourself. And with our community and where we come from, it's already there. we're born into it. So as we born into it, and then we're like, okay, we, we know our souls. And then, so it just comes out on our, in our equipment. Most of the time, sometimes through anxiety, depression, anger, their environment. I have, I'm bored. I have nothing to do. I don't play video games. I want to, I want to work on this track, that type of. thing so i mean i don't know if that you understand but or anybody understands but yeah i mean it's just it's it's from the soul basically your inner self some magazines have called me to do a 10 minute track well now you can do tracks for five minutes or less i'm not gonna do a video for 10 minutes i'm not gonna give up my tips for 10 minutes for free some people did it you know that's on them but like I said I stay in my lane I don't get involved with some stuff I'll do not say I don't do nothing for magazines and stuff like that I'm pretty open but if it doesn't make sense for what what direction I'm going and where I'm heading and what I want to do with my career then it doesn't make sense I'm not giving up tips We're not giving up tips for Detroit and Chicago. We don't do that. People who do, then that's on them. So what are your experiences? To answer your question, sorry. Yeah. So what are your experiences with Chicago like? Well, I have this right next door to me. It's a sister city of Detroit. So it's easier to get there. My experience in Chicago is I've pretty much been there. That was the second place that I would go every weekend. If I wasn't in New York, it was something going on in Chicago. And the one experience that I really remember from Chicago is the sound. Their sound system was always different than any other sound system other than the Paradise Garage. And it was the best in the world. They would not book parties unless their sound was thumping. And that was the difference with Chicago and Detroit. Maybe that's why the sound is also really reduced. It's got to be thumping. Yeah, well, maybe that's why they didn't need so much in the tracks. Yeah. The sound systems were so good. No. Well, yeah, that could be. That could be. Because if you play a minimal track on Dance of Mayday, it would just sound so good on a big, huge system. I love the sound. It's totally different. The sound in Chicago, I would just go up there. just to be like, I want to hear this. I got to hear this bass in this space. Yeah, and I think Ron Trent, somebody bought some of the bins up there in Chicago. They were selling the clothes years ago. Yeah, I think they bought some of those bins. I mean, I would like this stuff. My sound would definitely have to be like Chicago sound. in my house in a warehouse if I you know like a loft that's how I want my sound it's neck and neck with uh Paradise Garage but Paradise Garage is a little different but similar but those two hands down I have not heard nothing in Detroit like Chicago and New York it is interesting I live in Detroit and I do events and I have not heard the same It sounds gotta be thumping. I mean, you can turn on the speaker and turn it up, but if it's not the right type of sound, the way it's set up, I don't know what speakers they use. I forgot the name of them, but it has... to be the right space. Your mixing board, you know, they always use like knobs and stuff. Chicago was bumping with sound. That was the main thing about me. And then the record stores, you know, we had a couple of record stores there, but mostly Ron Hardy. He had the house parties. The Power Plant. Those are the two I remember off the top of my head. There was some other music box. Pretty cool stuff. So do you see that, I don't know, that age as kind of like the golden era for dance music? Gold. Platinum. So for dance music in America, I don't know, what do you think about it now? Do you still find lots of stuff that you're into? Oh, yeah. A lot of the events I do, they have really good sound systems. And what about just the people making music? I hear a lot of crap out here. I'm going to be honest. Just people just jumping in. They want to do what you do. A lot of crap. Was it always like this, though? Do you think that there was... You think the hit rate was higher? There were more tracks coming out that you liked 20 years ago. Well, 20 years ago, before the digital era, there was vinyl and CDs. So I would say, yeah, because it was less producers. It's a massive amount. Everybody's making music now. not to degrade any of the music companies. It's making all this equipment and making it easier for people to just jump in. people 16, 17, 18, oh, I got this box now I can DJ, or I got this app or this software that I can DJ on my laptop with a controller, and I can just press start and stop and use a USB stick, and blah, blah, blah. Then all of a sudden, get a management PR, and all of a sudden, buy my likes, and then I'm a DJ. So it works for some people, but for us, we came from the hood. Again, I'm going to say the hood, middle class, but we came from the hood and we came from something. We took a little of something. and turned into a big of something. And then now we have people all over the world or parts of the world that want to copy what we do. But we went through H-E-L-L, most of us, some of us. Maybe the time it took you to get to your first gig. or to put out your first record. In those days, you needed a lot more hours. Oh, to learn. The learning curve. Yeah, the learning curve is a lot less steep. Everything is more user-friendly to learn quicker. You can put a track up on Beatport. Right, from your equipment, you can upload it right away. Yeah, just like most softwares, they allow you to upload to their... We'll upload now, as soon as you're done. So yeah, that's been going on for years, upload straight to the forums or the groups. Yeah, but you couldn't do that in 1994. You could not do that then, exactly. So back then we used AOL1. They had something like a messenger where you can upload tracks and send them to your friends. But only us tech heads knew this. And we did this quite frequently. And that's how we were able to stay ahead of the game and getting tracks flopped over to this person, to that, to the next. Once the internet kicked in, AOL won. It was lovely. It's just a little secret scenario you just had to know. As time went on, even before the internet, it would just come over my house. type thing come over this weekend I'm off we can just do music all weekend or all day analog yeah we just and I love analog because I that's what I prefer actually I'm all this computer stuff oh my god but I love my Ableton but I mean it's just more stuff to get into I mean I got the new pro I got so many new stuff I don't want to say the names just keep mixing up names on the mic here But yeah, it's just so much stuff. I'm just personally a gear nerd, and I have a gear problem, so I have to stop. gear problem yeah I have a gear I'm not ashamed to say it's kind of like an alcoholic that drinks too much well I have a gear problem so like you see me over here uh it's like whether it works or not I'll take it I have a guy that fixes the equipment in Detroit. So there you go. But yeah. Was there anything else you wanted to talk about? Yeah, Spotify playlist, man. It's kicking. Over 300 plus hours. 300 hours? Yeah, over 300 hours of music for your listening pleasure. House, techno, everything? Everything you want to know. And did you order the tracks? No, it orders itself. Just play. Press play on Spotify and just keep rolling. You have barbecues at your mama's house. You have a family gathering. You know, you're taking the kids out. Just press play in the car on the road trip. Let's go. ♪
