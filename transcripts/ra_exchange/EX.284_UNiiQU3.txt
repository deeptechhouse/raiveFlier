*Dubstep music* Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is a recording of a conversation I had with the Jersey Club artists unique at Unsound Festival this past October. Unique's part of a wave of artists who have helped turn the highly localised Jersey club scene into a global concern. She was a very generous interviewee and she gave me in the audience a really nice insight into the customs and context that make Jersey clubs so distinctive. As always, you can listen to our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at r8-exchange. The exchange with Younique is up next. This is the RA Exchange at Unsound 2015. I'm excited to be joined by Cherise Gary, or Unique. Hello. She's a key artist in the style known as Jersey Club. Over the last year or two, she's become an international ambassador for the scene. She's been known for her high-energy DJ performances, part of the second wave of Jersey Club artists. It's kind of been helping to broaden things out, if you like. She's playing this evening at Hotel Forum. I think you're in the second room? Yes. Is that right? Yeah, 4 a.m., so check that. Firstly, we ran a piece on Resident Advisor earlier this year on Jersey Club. And one thing you said to us was that it wasn't until a couple of years ago that you'd kind of heard of the idea of a music festival. It had just recently come on your radar. So I wanted to ask firstly how your experiences of music festivals have been so far and how your experience of Unsound has been so far. Well, the first music festival... The place where I went to was Mad Decent Block Party. Just because Philly is so close to us and that's where I first got my experience of leaving New Jersey to play club music. I played Mad Decent Mondays with some of the Brick Branded's crew. They introduced me to, you know, a broader audience that liked our music. That was like the biggest thing I've ever saw. I had never heard of a music festival until then. Since then, I've played a couple music festivals. I've played Afropunk, and now Unsound is my first. European festival that I'm playing and I went last night to check it out and I love it. It's like a big melting pot of a whole bunch of different genres. I could definitely hear Jay-Z Club being, you know, influenced in some of the songs and sets, which I think is dope. I had so much fun. In terms of framing our discussion, it's probably a good idea to start with with Newark and with with Jersey itself so you grew up near to Newark yeah still small town you still live in the area that's correct yeah I do so maybe start by talking a bit about what Newark is like okay it's not the friendliest city it's pretty rough you know It's getting better, but when I was a kid, it was, yeah, it was crazy. And I feel like Jersey Club, we got our influence from Baltimore Club, and Baltimore Club got their influence from Juke, footwork music. Brick bandits were the first ones to bring, you know, club music from these places to New Jersey and incorporate it in their own style, mostly with more vocal chops. That was our focus, you know, to take certain words and make clever loops out of them that catered to the dance floor. And they called it Brick City Club. first because it was just strictly in Newark and Newark is called Brick City for yeah bricks you know and not the ones on the walls so um I mean would you say that um did Newark feel like a musically engaged place when you're growing up was there lots of music around you yeah definitely Newark is big on jazz like we have like the number one jazz radio station in the area. A lot of jazz singers come from out of Newark. I feel like that was the impact that house music, you know, house music derived from that too. And house music was such a big thing. Like people from all over would come to our clubs, our after hours in Newark for that. And I feel like Jersey Club was just like the new age of... that impact that house music had on the area, it was just for the kids. It wasn't for the teenagers and the grown-ups. So this style of music, this local style of music, was on your radar from a very, very young age. age is that kind of yeah first it was Baltimore Club but then that's when they started making Jersey Club DJ Tamil who's like one of the legends that um started creating Brick City Jersey Club used to make these mixtapes and I would come home from school and go down and like hear the music on the block like what is this and they're like oh like you don't know about this like this is how you got to do this dance and I was like okay well I'm gonna get the CD go home practice and some of the songs were cool some of them were perverted my mom was like I don't want you listening to that um you know but we will listen to it anyway and that That's when we would throw parties just anywhere and everywhere we could get a place to, from little boy and girl club centers to house parties, somebody's basement, a backyard, just wherever we could get our hands on and set up shop to have a party and charge a couple of dollars for little rent money, school money. We were young, like 14, being like little parties. promoter entrepreneurs. In what form would you like get the music? Were you buying on CD? Yeah we would buy them on CDs and then that's when you know it was funny because it was just Brick Bandits at first then a couple of DJs would you know spread about like Little Man and Frosty they were mostly like the ones that were really in charge of like the teen scene when it came to parties. And they wouldn't want to give any of the younger kids any music. So they're like, man, they're being mad stingy with tracks. You know, I just don't want to be playing a CD at the party. That's whack. So they started making their own club music. And that's where it started from like J-Hood and Natus and Slank to start making their own tracks. Tamela and Dala would be in Stingy. They were like, nah, y'all can't play our stuff. Y'all got to book us to have us play. Yeah, because presumably you could only get the music in a mixed format. Yeah, in a mixed format. We were like, nah, that's whack. Can't you just be playing a CD? I'm not about to... pay for that like you know try to explain to us what the vibe was like in these situations where you've got a bunch of like 14 year old kids kind of like learning dance moves and throwing themselves around to this like local style of music like paint a picture for us okay dark no lights that's why I like it here because it reminds me of like that time You know, sometimes parties now in America are like so bright. It's like, I don't want to see you. Yeah, so it was dark, like just a bare room because it was all about just dancing, you know. sweaty because it probably wasn't a proper club with like ventilation just some hall or like a basement like I say and um loud music coming from like whoever's speaker system we could get our hands on whether it was good quality or bad quality and just dance all night until like maybe the cops would be like yeah like you guys are mad young you gotta go home Because we really didn't have curfew then like they do now. And yeah, just different, like, club. Like, we would play hip-hop. you know, like what was popular, but like club was the highlight of the party. And like once it came on, like kids used to, you know, girls would grab boys, take them against the wall or like break out in like potluck and our girls just used to like booty bounce. Like it was crazy and it was so much fun. Because the neighborhood, our environment is not the best. And like I said, at the time when I was younger, it was way worse than it is now. I feel like it was kind of an escape from those harsh realities we had to deal with, you know, like with such and such, you know, passing away or like, you know, school budgets being cut or, you know, things like that. So that's why I felt like club music was always like our escape. Like, I don't have to worry about anything right now. I'm about to go to this party and worry about dancing with him tonight. And that was that. Yeah, because I'd heard that Brick Bandits had some strict rules for their parties. Oh, yeah, definitely. Even for their street teams. Once club music started getting really popular, that's when it was like, I'll call it the golden era of Jersey club for us. We would have... street teams popping up everywhere. First it was Brick Bannets and Brick Bannets was strictly throwing parties. That's when DJ Little Man, who was known for numerous line dances, would create his street team and his was called The Movement. And then this DJ created this street team. And then like all the younger kids, Slink had a collective before he had cartel music. So when you say street team. Street team is like a party promotion team. It's a bunch of kids, different ages, all throughout high school. And what we did is we were just all friends. And we were just like, okay, we're going to call ourselves this. I had a team. It was called Vixen. And it was girls because it was always boys and girls or just all boys. I was like, we need all girls. So I would take them. Some girls would be dancers. Some girls would be strictly promoters. I was the DJ. And we would just, you know, pay dues. We used to pay dues, like maybe $2 a week, $5 a week. And we would all use it to rent a hall. or, you know, just get a space, and, like, this is what we're going to use to throw a party, promote it, and have people come. And that's what was going around all around the city. First it was just Newark, then it happened all around Jersey. And, yeah, Brick Bandits had strict rules, though. They were like, no, you have to have, like, this great average. and whatnot you know the kids bring positivity more positivity to like you know the neighborhood yeah like checking people's report cards and yeah that's fine they can't be in a gang and such like yeah brick bandits have obviously already come up a lot so far maybe you could explain like why these guys and well kind of maybe still are so important um because they set the tone And without them, you know, we wouldn't maybe be here. Yeah, definitely. Also, Tamil was the first to branch off and travel to different places. He came to Europe and... When he came here, we were just like, wow, like he went to Europe for Jersey Club? Like, nah. And Timmel was a little older, too, at the time. He wasn't as young as me, Slink and Nadisar. So we were just like, well, he's grown. Like, you know, he's been out here. He made it. So, like, we get it. But then, you know, when Slink went and Slink was like my age, I was And then they just went to Australia. I'm like, wait, you're going to Australia? He's like, yeah, here's my flyer. I was like, wow, I need to do that. I'm sick of being just a nork, you know, because it got a little tired, you know, from just doing teen parties as I grew older and sweet 16s and, you know, like just small events around because you only got paid so much. So it was definitely a hobby and like a labor of love And when the violence would break out, like, it used to hurt us because they used to close venues because of it. So we didn't have as many spaces to throw events at anymore because they were like, no, it's too violent. This is a boys and girls club. at the end of the day. You know, you guys, you know, no. And they just, after that, the city just started, like, not trusting, no, anybody. Like, no, we're not doing teen parties anymore. So, yeah. I wanted to go back to that travelling thing. I mean, when you saw these guys, like, you know, going to Europe, going further afield, was this an immediate thing for you? It was like, I want to do this. I want to get out of here and I want to do it through music. You know, has this been like a long-term aspiration of yours? Yeah, when I was younger, I wanted to be a famous singer because I used to do like Broadway stuff, like Lion King. And I used to try out for stuff like that and dance. I wanted to be a dancer, but I injured myself really badly. So I was like, OK, you can't do that. So when I took up DJing, I was just like, this is definitely like dope. Like if I could get to that level, like I'll try to. So, yeah, I just started following Nades and Sunk around New York City. And like, where you going? You got a gig there? I'm going there. like take me, like list me. And, you know, I was younger than them. I was younger than Slink. So once I turned 21, I was like, it's over. I'm out here. Like, what are you going to do? What initially got you behind the decks? Like, what would you say was your key inspiration? What made you turn that corner? Well, I was always some party girl. I was always the one in the middle of the dance floor. And my ex was a DJ. He used to roll with DJ Little Man. So I was just like, damn, it's never no girl DJs. And at the time, K-Swift had already passed. And she was one of the first to make a major impact. She's from Baltimore. So I'm going to call her the queen of club. And her songs are still very legendary to this day. and she was like the first one to really branch off and take it to the next level, but she passed, so it was just no girls around, and I was like, it's never no girls. Y'all always want us to dance. you know I was just like that's crazy I want to learn so he's like really and I was like yes I used to just play around with his stuff he's like wow you really want to learn so he taught me and it wasn't until one day at his gigs I was just playing around on the decks before the party started and that's when like J-Hood and Natus walked in and they were like that Wow, you're good. I was like, yeah. They were like, yeah, you should DJ. I was like, maybe. And that's when I would just go to Bombard house parties and be like, yo, let me get on. I used to have my CD book with me. Like, yo, let me get on real quick. And they'll be like, okay. Like, what you about to do? I'm like, DJ. And then I kill it. Yeah. So that's how I started. Yeah, but I wanted to ask, how has it been for you as kind of an almost lone female figure in such a male-dominated scene? In Jersey, I could say it was, at first it was kind of hard because none of the guys took me seriously, especially because I was a dancer girl. They're just like, man, she just be partying. Like her boyfriend taught her like, you know, until I really started like out here trying to book or throw my own parties. In Jersey, I got a lot of respect. That's why I made an all-female street team. And I was surprised at the turnout. I was like, oh, my gosh, all these little girls like, you know, OK, cool. Like this could be really a thing. Like that's when I started to believe in myself As far as going out, when I started branching off into New York, it was kind of tough because a lot of guys did not take me serious at all. They were just like, okay, so you bought a DJ, huh? Well, let's see. I'm like, okay, we'll see. And, yeah, just like that. But I've had some support just off the strength that I would travel with, like, Slink and Natives places because they're like, oh, okay, like, I see what Slink does and you do the same thing? Cool, like, I'll check you out. It took a while, you know, because they were still like, okay, like, she's probably, like, one of their girlfriends or something. I started getting more and more cosigns because I just used to go by myself sometimes. I used to go out to Brooklyn just by myself with some shots. Then I'd be like, yeah, I'll just be in the corner just watching or dancing. That's when somebody would come up to me like, hey, you're unique, right? Or I would go up to the DJ and be like, yo, I like your set. They'd be like, thank you. You're unique, right? I'd be like, yo how do these people know me? I don't know anybody here. So I used to just walk in not knowing anybody. Then I'd be like, bye guys. Like, leaving the party, just networking and stuff, that's how, like, I really got out there. Because I was like, I really want this. Have you seen more girls coming up through the scene in the last couple of years? Has there been an increased interest in getting involved in DJing and that side of things? A little bit. We have K-Driz. We have Dana Lou, who's also a female DJ. She doesn't produce, though. like it's something that's hard for girls to stick to you know to really dedicate aside from just djing but like really learning how to produce you know just sitting in front of a computer sometimes and making something out of nothing is not like doesn't sound that fun You know? Yeah, and just because where I'm from, like, it's a lot of, like, teenage pregnancies, you know? So I'm just, like, it's really hard for, I feel like, girls to really be, like, okay, I'm going to do this and focus on this. Because it's a lot of distractions, you know? Like, sometimes I have to, that's why I'm happy I don't live, like, in the heart of the city. I live, like, small town, like, right on the borderline. So I'm kind of, like, distant myself from all that. But I was just focused. I'm like, no, I can't. do that. We should probably talk a bit about the kind of style or the substance of the music itself. If you were to explain to someone what the like key components of this sound are, what would you say? Okay, I always say that Jersey Club is like a can of Red Bull. It's so energetic. It definitely is for the dance, like for the dance floor. Like I said, we took our sounds from Baltimore, but we speeded it up a bit. How fast would you say on average? Baltimore Club is sometimes like 125, 130 BPM, and we're 130 to 135 BPM, but it's sped up to 140 at max. Some of these little b-kids be making like 145 and I'm just like, I can't. It's too fast for me. That's more like the new age of Philly club to me. What made us stand out more than Baltimore club, which was really popular, is that we had cleaner cuts because we used like different producer programs from them at the time. And we started using Sony Acid. And that program would allow you to make cleaner vocal chops. And we used to use acapellas and instrumentals from my... knowledge, Baltimore just used to try to make their own acapellas, which sounds a little bit dirtier, you know? So that's what really set us apart from Baltimore. And we just got, you know, more clever as the time came along and adding, you know, our own little samples that we would find from different songs or just ourselves, you know, saying it into a mic. They have the infamous Brick Bandits club kit. But as time went along, we would mix other genres into Jersey Club. So it wouldn't just be an original. It would be a remix of a popular Rihanna song. And we would still take the instrumental from, say, if we did a love song, we would take another song that was in the same range of the BPM and put it to her acapella and still make it a club song. So it was just a big melting pot of different stuff. And we would remix hip-hop songs. They remix Spanish songs now. You know, so it's really big women's culture, but we know how to make our own stuff too. I wanted to ask about the bed squeak. Oh yeah, infamous bed squeak. That was for the nasty songs back in the day. The people still using the bed squeak now. Yeah, now they made it sound cute, but they used to be for nasty songs. Like the nasty samples. Was there an original bed squeak track? You know what the origins are? Yeah, it was a Trillville Uncut song. Like, what it is, yo, what's up? Yeah, that's what we got it from, the beginning. That's where that song derived from. So why were so many producers inspired to keep using this sound? Why was it such a thing? That's kind of what I'm getting at. Because the songs used to be nasty. So if the song used to be like, you know, put your pee on my D, they used to be put the best weeks on. Because that's how we used to dance. We called it giving rides, you know, where you dance on a boy. was the thing for like a long time kids don't do it anymore um like they used to but that used to be our motive I'm gonna go to the club tonight and I'm gonna dance with him because I like him and yeah we were some dancing little kids that's why they used to try to ban like that dry humping at proms and stuff like oh my gosh If you were to ask someone in Europe, you know, like a house of techno DJ, or thinking about house and techno, like what makes a good DJ, I'm sure the answer would be very different if we're talking about Jersey Club. So things like using the microphone, like we don't have DJs here who really use the microphone. So we wanted to ask, like, in your view, what are the elements that go into making a great Jersey Club DJ? Okay. First, it would have to be, sometimes producers get more credit of being better DJs than just a regular person that is just strictly a DJ because they get to, you know, they get the benefit of being a DJ and playing their own tracks. That's what made Brick Bandit so popular, Slink so popular, Tamil so popular, that they could get booked not just off of their DJing skills, but their tracks. So I would say that was definitely a key factor. Definitely having control of the crowd. We were kids, sometimes we would get like, you know, short attention span. And when we used to make line dances, not everybody knew them. So we would have like key dancers that would, you know, comment, like, I already know the dance. get in the middle of a circle or on top of like, if there was like a little platform like there is here, like get on top of the stage, the DJ will call out what you had to do. So definitely having crowd control and control being a good talker, like a hype man on the mic, kind of bringing it back to that old school feel of like hip hop where they used to have MCs that tell you what to do, except for club music. Yeah, and that was kind of hard for me to do at first. I just used to be real shy. And then little man had taught me a trick, like don't look at the crowd. So when I talk, I don't look at y'all. I look at the back wall or something like that. Or I turn my head this way, that way. And now I know how to do it. I don't overdo it. Sometimes the judges, they overdo it. It's like, all right, shut But, yeah, you know, just when it's necessary, you know, to hype in the crowd up. Because sometimes, you know, people get a little tired, you know, or distracted. Like, you want to keep them involved. Or sometimes I interact them on some funny junk. Like, I see you going in over there. You know? Yeah, so definitely those two. I feel like aside from just... Scratching, which is more old school, we're definitely about mixing, you know, blending. So aside from just making two tracks, like, blending the two together creates, like, a whole different track, you know, and I love to do that. And now since I've traveled, I do that with different genres of music as a whole. So I'll mix, like, a club music into a hip-hop song into, like, you know, a Portuguese rap song, you know. Yeah, those top three. Tell us about some of the popular dances. Obviously, this is a really key component of what we're discussing. Definitely the basics, like a two-step. Some of our dances we got from the old house moves back in the day when they'd have house music. I'm not sure if any of you guys are familiar with that song, Follow Me, but that's pretty infamous. It upgraded to like cookout music. They play it everywhere in the hood and in the summertime. Definitely a two-step. We have sexy walk, which is real popular. And now they're even calling it out in different like line dances, like down South and in Detroit, you know, kind of like on some Soulja Boy type thing. Ride That Wave, and you put your hand up and do like that. That was really huge. It was on Hot 97. That was like the first club song to hit mainstream radio. New Jersey doesn't have a channel, so New York would never play club, like never. So that was like the first club song they played on the radio. So you're like, oh my God. seven you know do they play quite a bit of jersey stuff now they do yeah now they do before they didn't like that was such a big deal that was the first to set it off that and swing that that was like really big too yeah I won't dance no more though sorry I can't show y'all any moves I was hoping you were going to show us Do you feel like the dancers get quite competitive? Is that kind of an element of it? Oh, yeah. How would that kind of go down? Especially with the street teams, you know, like my Vixen dancers, I used to always tell them, like, look, they always have the boys at the forefront because the boys used to be the ones in the videos because it was all guy DJs, so they'd have all boy dancers. And I'm just like, okay, no. So I always used to tell my girls, look, y'all going to go in another circle and battle the boys. If the boys try to take all the spotlight, just go in there and kill it. But things got competitive. They used to have little friendly battles. We used to have battle of the street teams where all the street teams used to come. And it was cool. It was like some high school spirit week crap. But it wasn't. And we would all wear little street team tags. you know, that said our nicknames or, like, all wear the same colors, stuff like that. And whatever street team could turn up the most, you know, like, won, like, you know, some cash or something. Then they used to have dance battles. at the parties, you know, where they would take time, okay, like, this dancer from Brick Bandits versus this dancer from Team Little Man, like that, and they used to just battle in the crowd, but she was like, not him, not, you know, so it used to get, it used to be nuts, it was fun, though, and, like, soon, like, things got super competitive, they started making YouTube videos of, like, Like, yeah, like Teen Vogue Man's coming for like Brick Bandits. What's up? And they'd have like, like people would promote him and be like, oh my. Or they used to have dance battles downtown. Like, at the city, like, we had this little waterfront thingy, and we used to have dance battles there. It got nuts. It was fun, though. It was so much fun. And I guess there's the spirit of, you know, competition in, you know, the production side of things as well, because you had the occasions with the diss tracks, right? Yeah. I want those to come back low-key. Yeah. That's when people started getting super creative. You know, like, when a lot of places closed down in Newark, you know, it was like a little drought. You're like, damn, there's nowhere else to throw parties around here. So we started branching out, started going to Plainfields. That was like the next big city over, and that's where Slink is from. So Slink was like, oh, y'all coming in my town? Slink was living in Plainfield. He's from North, but he's living in Plainfield. He's like, y'all coming to my town, like, trying to take my territory? Nah. So he would make diss tracks. They'd make diss tracks back at him. Diss tracks were really aggressive. Used to have a lot of gunshot samples, rap lyrics, or skits. Super creative. I feel like it was way more creative than the Drake and Meek Mill beef. But then it started to get too out of hand, of course, as things always do. But, you know, before then, like, it was just, like, friendly competition. And it was, like, cool because it really made producers be creative in a different way. You know, like, damn, like, I really have to listen to the lyrics to this song to hear me sing because it relates to, like, how I'm battling against him. You know, aside from just dance floor focused live music or just, you know, dance music. But it made it fun. Like, everybody used to really come to the parties then, like, yo, Slink is battling low man tonight. We got to go. Like, yeah. I'm going to tell my dad to pick me up early, though. I can't stay until the end because, you know, nothing good ever happens at the end of the party. I guess you could classify yourself as being part of a second generation, if you like. Yeah. Were you guys kind of interested and focused on, like, differentiating yourself from the older guys and what came before in, like, particular ways? You know, what was your unique flavour, if you like? Our vocal chops were better. Not better, I would say, but more like we used to really chop the crap out of songs. The vocal chops back in the day were simpler, but now we really chop them up and we could even make it say something totally different than what the whole line says because of the way we chopped it up. Just a little bit more clever, a little bit more fast-paced, and DJ J-Hood made what we call now booty bounce music. And that was like a different beat pattern from what Baltimore Club was, what Tamil and Dollar were using when they first started making club music. He made this new beat pattern, the boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. And ever since then, the game has changed. Yeah. So that was definitely like... our distinction from them. And to talk a bit about your party, 135, is that right? Yeah. And then you've got other guys, like there's Thread, Club Jersey. These are parties that are still going, that's correct? Yeah. Thread is what started it all. Thread is created by Natus' collective, Natus and his friends. And he made it because as we grew older, we weren't teenagers no more. We were all like 20, 21. And that's when, you know, Nadeshead already went to Australia and Slinkhead already went to... Europe and they got just a dose of like, wow, we could really, you know, go out here and play Jersey Club. And they've been playing Jersey Club because it wasn't until I went to Philly that, you know, Dirty South Joe, who is a part of like the first generation of Brick Bandits, but in Philly with, he was like with Sega and, um, I did not know. They were like, yeah, Club Cheval plays your stuff. And I'm just like, who's that? And they're like, oh, you know, Sam T from Paris. And I'm like, wait, Paris? No, they don't. Nah. And they're like, yeah, look. And then they showed me his mixtapes. I was like, that's crazy. Like, really? And I was like, and they're good. You know, like, this is so Yeah, so they made Thread based on their experience traveling. And they call it Thread so that it's all the music, different genres threaded together into one. You know, that's why we DJ as we do now. It's like just mixing different genres in there that inspire us or, you know, our Jersey Club influence. it was an underground party for Jersey. I would say that back in the day, I feel like we were kind of at raves, but we didn't know it, you know? But what we throw now is definitely, like, I guess, a rave in Newark. And those aren't popular because there's, like, so many bottle service-y clubs or, like, top 40 clubs that just play everything that you hear on Hot 97 all day. And I'm just like, God. So we, like our crowd, our friends, get exposed to different stuff that they wouldn't usually get to be exposed to. And I started throwing 135 because thread died down a little bit. And I was just like, I still want to party. And my friends had a loft. And I was just like, yo, let me throw a party here. They're like, what you going to call it? I was like, I'm going to call it 135 because that's my favorite BPM that I use as far as Jersey Club. But I play all different types of stuff. flashback to when I used to practice my, you know, mixing, I used to go to this club called The Globe, and it was a gay club, and my Q used to DJ there before he became international, I didn't even know, because they always used to come up to me like, you need, you need to play beats, and I'm like, what are y'all talking about, like, Vogue remix of Jersey Club, you know, like, or like Heartbroken, and I used to play that, peace by Mike Q. And that's how I got introduced to Mike Q. So I used to play at a gay club and I felt like the gay community in Newark is very separated from the club kids and everybody else at parties. So that's what I wanted to make different about my party. I wanted my party to be more for everybody. Like it could be people of different races and, you know, sexual preference. And I felt maybe because, you know, it's a lot of, like, gang member boys in Newark. So I felt like them, me being a girl kind of made it more comfortable for them to come. You know, like, okay, like, we trust you, neat. Like, that's my bitch. So we're going to come. And, yeah, so I would, like, make Vogue music. They'll go off. And even some of the boys, the straight boys know how to, you know Shabam and all those moves too because we used to make Jay-Z Clever mixes of them. So, yeah. Those are the two main underground parties and it's a couple sprouting about every now and then. It just depends if we have a place to do it. starting to have more DIY places. Once they close the clubs down, we're like, we just got to make our own spot for us where we could do what we want to do. We don't have to be told to play this song or, you know. So, yeah, we just get homies loft. We upgraded from a basement now to loft. and warehouses so so there's quite a specific context connected to jersey club you know from the type of uh parties to the dancers and these sorts of things so i'm interested to know how this is translated into your overseas gigs how's the music being received and you know have you at all been surprised by the way that the music's being received yeah Sometimes it surprises me when people know the line dances. I think that's cute. But that happens. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's cool. Even though it's not something that I mainly focus on in my sets, as other DGs do back home, because that's mostly for, like, when we were younger, like, mostly for the kids. Like, we'll still bust out and do it if it comes on, but it's not, like, the focus, you know? Playing overseas, I've realized that it's, like, not such a big cell phone culture here, which I love. You know, nobody's on Snapchat the whole party. They're tweeting about how poppin' the party is. They're actually enjoying the party. So I love it, and it reminds me of when I used to party because I was just strictly, like... Yeah, I'll hit you. If I see y'all while we get in the water, that's cool. But, you know, just meet outside at 10 o'clock when the party's over or something like that. So I'm just focused on the dance floor. I just want people to dance how they dance, express themselves. Because that's what you go to a party for. And traveling about, I've just picked up on new sounds. I've put them into my sets, too. Yeah, it's been a I play Jersey Club in some places I never even expected to go in my life. And sometimes for big festivals, I'll bring my dancers with me. And most of the time, they just freestyle. I have a Jersey Vogue dancer, and it's a girl. And then I have a... boy that's pop locking and those Jersey Club dances as well and they do have some routines you know just to still have that element in there because some places I go some people have never been exposed to Jersey Club so I don't want to sometimes there's a lot to take in so I'm just like I don't want to overwhelm you guys you know but yeah for the most part I just have my dancers there to hype them up so um as things have kind of gone international this topic of appropriation yeah seems it seems to be coming up increasingly so you've got a situation where you've got guys in Europe who you know presumably have no connection uh to your scene and you know to where you come from who uh you know having success off the back of this of this template how do you respond to that I mean how does that make you feel When the appropriation thing just started happening, it was maybe about like a year and some ago. What was crazy is because at first we didn't realize it was happening. We thought it was cool. You know, I'm just like, oh, I think that's making Jersey Club everywhere. Like, we inspire them. This is awesome, which is still awesome. I don't think anybody should have to be obligated to make one type of music just because where they're from. You know, like, I still branch off and make different genres, too, just like I play other genres. But it was the way that it was happening that we realized, like, nah, there's something wrong. First, they would wear masks. to hide their identity. And the reason of them doing that is because they were somebody else that was already situated, you know, being known for their music. And what was messed up about it is that they already had, you know, managers and PR and a whole team and a whole deal, you know, and money to put behind this project of... their new identity, this person, the club producer, Jersey club producer, you know, and the music was good. I'm not going to, I'm not going to knock them for that. But it was just the fact that they were just doing it as, aside from doing it as a hobby, like they were trying to make a whole, you know, business out of it. And I feel like if you're going to, if you enjoy making that type of music, like you should be open to express that. Like why hide yourself behind a mask like you're ashamed, you know. to make something that you like to do. And then there's like, Newark is not the nicest neighborhood. A lot of the kids that make Jersey Club, aside from just the second generation, there's still like 13, 14 year olds that make it and that are really good that don't have what that person had. And they were getting a lot of credit compared to, you know, helping kids get opportunity too, which they could have did. So yeah, it was kind of... of like a messed up situation like it it made a lot of kids like lose hope like oh this is not fair like you know like they're out here you know and they're getting all this credit more credit they got even more credit than you know slink and like natus and they were like the two main ones doing it at the time so it was kind of just like damn like it just made a lot of kids lose hope it was really upsetting and it still hasn't stopped but I mean I just realized over time that every genre gets appropriated so it's just something you have to deal with and from my personal you know, reasons. I just always told myself, like, don't be bitter, be better, you know, because, I mean, you could talk about it, and you could get, you could be mad, but it's not going to stop them. It's not going to do anything about it, like, you know, so I was just like, let me just be the better person, keep doing what I'm doing, and, like, put myself out here so I could have those things, you know. And that's the advice I used to give to anybody that used to come to me. Like, you know, well, just go out there and promote yourself. Like, it'll happen, you know? Like, especially because they're masked, I feel like you lose that connection with them. Sometimes the reason why people mask themselves is because they don't want the focus to be on them. They want the focus to be about the music. For them, it wasn't that case. But I feel like when the person isn't from Jersey, you do hear a little difference. It's not as authentic. I don't know. You don't really relate with that person because they don't have a story behind it. You know, like they wouldn't be up here talking to you guys about like what I'm talking to you guys about. So that's how I felt about the whole situation. I was like, it'll pass. You know, it happens to everything. It happens to every genre. And yeah, sometimes if it got that popular that fast, it'll go away just as fast sometimes, depending on the artist that's doing it. But yeah. Have you formed any ties with producers in Europe? Has there been like a cultural exchange situation? Do you see yourself collaborating with people in the future potentially? Yeah, I actually have some tracks. with some guys, a couple of people that I was working on from Europe and just different parts of the world. Some of it's Jersey, some of it's, you know, Jersey Club influence, you know, just to keep myself well-rounded. I was always a musician, so. That's how I see myself, not just as a club producer, like I'm a music artist. You know, Jersey Club is just my signature sound. Just to not put myself in a box, because that's really hard to do with dance music. People love categories. So is this your next upcoming project? Yeah, I've been working on my vocal cuts more because that's what I used to do before I got into DJ. I used to be making drops for everybody because they were like, I like your voice. So I used to make drops for everybody. But I want to get back into that artist side of myself, like when I used to do off-Broadway plays and singing rap on the side. So I do that over my songs, which makes me different. I always say that I feel like... Natus is the softer side of Jersey Club because he makes very soulful, ambient Jersey Club because he also makes juke. I always say Slink is the real hype, hip-hop side. And I always say I'm the voice because I talk so much on my tracks. So yeah, I definitely want to get in. to that and just because there aren't that many girls making I feel like there's not enough females hyping up girls on club tracks it's always a guy you know and especially with club music it's not that many girls my age doing it anymore they're all kind of older like the Santee Golds and the MIAs so I want to do that except for Jersey Club so that's my plan that's what I've been working on and I got some tracks coming soon, you know. All my remixes now, I put a verse in there, you know. So it's just, like, different, just trying to make it more appealing to somebody that may not go to the club all the time. You know, so, yeah. So I was on YouTube earlier, noticed the Team Little Man anthem has reached 16 million plays on YouTube. That's amazing. Do you think Jersey Club is at a high point at this point in time? Not yet. And can it go further is really what I wanted to ask. Okay, first let me say I'm super proud because we first started making our music videos. at somebody's house in front of a white wall with four dancers and like the dude Frosty saying like let's go to the left to the right you know just some real homemade shit and now like we got camera crew with the dancers and it hit 16 mil on YouTube like that's crazy to me because we were really I used to be the camera girl for my music videos like I used to be like you know like okay next like okay more energy you know so I feel like we've definitely come a long way, which is something that I felt like Jersey Club was missing from Baltimore, because Baltimore had their music videos on deck, and we really didn't. So I don't feel like it's at an all-time high yet, just because the second generation, we really haven't released any projects yet, because we were, we got more, I guess, attention. at an early start before we were even ready to, you know? Like, I've traveled to Europe and I haven't even put out a proper EP yet. Slink still has yet to release his second EP. The first EP he put out was like four years ago, you know? And Vibrate still knocks to this day. So I feel like, no, not yet. It's getting there. We just had to get used to, like, I guess the industry side of things because, you know, with all good businesses, that's what you got to do. And it's still kind of hard because I still don't know. Still learning as we go, kind of, you know, go with the flow type thing. But yeah, I feel like maybe next year will be like the highlight, especially because people are still getting familiar with what Jersey Club is. So I feel like now since people know and are getting an idea of what Jersey Club is and what it's about and where it's from, next year when everybody actually puts out their original bodies of music, it's going to be ridiculous. And especially because we all have different styles. We've grew as producers since then, you know? Do we have any audience questions at this point? Okay. You've mentioned clubs closing a couple of times and you mentioned a curfew. I was wondering, like, is it harder now putting on parties back at home? And what kind of effect that has on the scene, I suppose, like how easy it is to kind of keep the scene moving at home? There's a lot of clubs now, you know, like I said, most of some of them are top 40. They still play club music, but they're mostly based around like top 40. Now, since we have more DIY spots, we throw parties any chance we get. And they're just not, you know, they'll be parties. I throw a party every chance I get when I'm home. Same with Nades. Sometimes they'll just be events and they'll just have like, you know, they'll have different DJs at the event. Like it'll be an art gallery and event and they'll have like, oh, this DJ and then like a Jersey Club DJ, you know. So they're starting to, I feel like now since they are starting to get more in key with our generation and what we're doing artistically, they're giving us more chances to actually, you know, introduce. the community to what we're doing. Like we have block parties now and like little music festivals in the summer. And now I start to have more and more kids come up to me like, oh yeah, like, oh my gosh, I'm not proud of you. You're out here. And I'm like, wow, like I haven't had this since like I was a kid, you know, and I just be out here locally. So yeah, definitely with the warehouses and the clubs and just buying our own property now. and making it what we want to be. I'm a massive Nicki Minaj fan, and Boss Ass Bitch and the Picklejuice Speech, like two of my favorite Nicki things. I was like screaming when I heard your remix. You said that it was like a statement, not a club track. I'm wondering if you wanted to talk about it. Wait, what track again? The Boss Ass Bitch remix. Okay. Yeah. First, when I heard the song, I just liked it. I was like, this is cute. And then when Nicki hopped on, I was like, yes, Nicki, you know, because she went off. And I haven't heard that side of Nicki Minaj in a long time since she went like pop. That was personally one of my favorite interviews by her because it was. so relatable and that's one thing I always admired about Nikki is that she's like kind of like a self-made you know artist like you really saw her grow and promote herself through YouTube and travel here and travel there and Sometimes with female rappers nowadays, you don't see a lot of that, you know. You just see these girls pop up out of nowhere because they look cute. So I felt Nicki on that, and I was just like, this would be good to put in the track, and I feel like nobody does that. When I used to start going to Ghetto Goth, Venus X, who's like a mentor to me, she would always just play a very instrumental track and put a news clip in there. of like the latest news clip of what's going on in the world. And I was like, that's cool. I should do that on a Jersey Club track. So yeah. It was funny because when I made that track, I forgot to save it. So the whole thing had deleted. So I had to do it all over again. And those chops were serious. And I was like, I don't believe I didn't save it. So yeah, I made that track twice actually. And I was like real over it like the Bye.
