you You Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Ray Phelps and I'm a reviews editor at Resident Advisor. Chloe has been in dance music for two decades, but she's often seemed like an outsider. A track on her first EP back in 2002 was called "I Hate Dancing" and another was led by Acoustic Guitar. Releases for labels like B-Pitch Control aligned her for a time with the minimal electro scene, but her music has generally evaded easy reference points. Among Parisians, she's perhaps best known for her residency at Pulp, a club night for gay women at L'Entracte, that also helped shape the careers of Jennifer Cardini and Ivan Shmag. In recent years, Chloe has embraced projects away from the dance floor. She performed a Steve Reich piece last year alongside the Bulgarian percussionist Vasilyena Serafimova. More recently, she composed the score for the Lydia Terki film Paris La Blanche. I met with Chloe earlier this year to discuss these projects and her forthcoming third album, Endless Revisions. You can find our full archive of exchanges at www.residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Chloe is up. next. I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want I was listening to the single The Dawn from your new album, which is called Endless Revisions, and that's due out in October. There's a spoken word vocal on the track that's really interesting because I believe it's actually your mother's. Yes, exactly. It's funny to start with my mother. It's like the history. But it's true. I started to record her a few years ago. It's just because she was talking about a story. She cannot really speak, actually. She has a little problem. So I just wanted to have this recording to have material from her. I was not sure I wanted to use it on a track one day, but I just liked her voice. I just liked the idea of recording her and keeping something from her. So this is really personal somehow, of course. And then I started to do a track and I thought like this track, The Dawn, and I start this kind of very repetitive drone and repetitive marimba. And I just thought that I thought there was something that. needed to be added more narrative. I didn't want to do any vocal myself but I had all this material from my mom and I just tried few of them on it and this is how the track was built. You know you have like two separate elements that has nothing in common and at one point then you have the idea and the idea just pop up and then you think that what you recorded a few years ago can appear then on the track. So this is how the track was done, actually. Did you always envisage this as a dance floor track? It certainly seems like a dance floor track, you know. Well, actually, when I started to do this track, I never really focused on the club or functionality of the track. Sometimes when I start a track, I think about being more functional because I feel I want to be more functional. But on this track and... Particularly on the album, I think it's the only format where I feel you don't have to be club-focused specially. I mean, I'm part of the electronic music scene since a while. I evolve as a DJ since many years. I party a lot, do a lot of DJ parties and play a lot. But I also produce and produce a lot of different stuff and styles. So it's just a way of finding my balance between these two kind of lives and putting everything together. So in this track, I would say it's an in-between. It's not definitely a club-focused track, but it's a track I played already and that I play sometimes in my sets, but mainly, mostly at the end or something like this. On the EP, there's a remix by Dixon, and probably the Dixon remix is more club-focused, is more functional. and I usually play more his remix on my sets than my own track. One of the things that struck me in a more general sense about your recording career is how often you've collaborated with others. I guess that's been borne out more recently with work you've done outside the electronic sphere. Late last year, for example, you did a project with Vasylina Serafimova, the Bulgarian percussionist, and that was a really interesting collaboration. Can you give me an idea of how that came together and could you describe what that project was? Well, in general, when a collaboration appears, sometimes I just have some nice proposal. Like when I travel, when I DJ, I meet a lot of great talents and great person. And sometimes you have more affinities with some people than others. Actually, you rarely have affinities with people. I mean, you have some, but sometimes it's kind of rare. So when it happens... then sometimes because you're an artist, both artists, somehow you want to collaborate and try to find an idea, try to make something together. And then it can be an EP, then it can be DJ together, back to back, or just sharing the night, just the two of you. About this project with Vasilena Serafimova, she's a marimba player. Actually this was a project that some French producer asked us actually. The concept was to propose some electronic artists to meet some artists from the classical scene. and to collaborate on a project. So there was some... The project is called Variation, and it was made for a French program on Culture Box. And so we were asked to do something inspired by Steve Reich, but there were also Jeff Mills. Pfeier and other artists who collaborated with other artists for John Coltrane or whoever So this kind of project cannot happen just because I just want. Of course it can, but it's a lot of energy. But here it was a bit easy because we were requested to do this. So I never met Vasilena before and I never heard about her before. And also she didn't know anything about electronic music and she didn't know me at all. We had these moments where we worked together and see, I just brought all my live and all my gears and trying to find what I can use technically, but also how we could build something together. So we finally decided to choose one piece from Steve Reich, which is called Music for 18 Musicians, which is one of his greatest pieces. It's normally like probably an hour or a bit more piece, which is very long and there are 80 musicians and we were only two. So we had just to get inspired, but we definitely could never try to challenge and make the same thing. So we just get inspired, which means, I mean, Vasilena played the main theme. And then I recorded her live and loop it and put some effects on it in direct, use some synthesizer. I really try to keep it really like a live play so that it's more interesting even for us and because we were not enough prepared also to prepare something very perfect. But I think with electronic music, this is like something you can really do. Maybe this has something which is very close to probably jazz or... free jazz, where you have one gimmick and then the person can play for hours all together just because they go around this gimmick. So somehow with the electronic music, we're just trying to keep this same idea, like we have this pattern and just see what we can do around. So this project was done last December and it was recorded and it was 30 minutes. And after this, we got a lot of requests actually to play together. So actually at the moment we are... working on some new material and just adding some new music from our own and trying to find things together because we are really, I think there's something really nice between us and she's a great person, really like working with her. And it's really cool because it's something a little bit outside from what I do usually. Very inspiring, actually. Very interesting. As someone who's been DJing a long time and then doing a project like that, did drawing on Steve Reich's music feel natural? Because I guess 20th century minimalism seems to be a source of inspiration for quite a lot of DJs and producers. Yes, exactly. I mean, there's Steve Reich. Philippe Glass, I mean, there's all this minimalist movement from the 70s is a very big inspiration for electronic music. Probably they were the first to inspire all the generation after. They were the first. I was asked before working with Vaseline, if I could work, for example, with other artists and other musicians. But when I saw there was a marimba player and Steve Reich, I was thinking, wow, this is cool because it's something new for me. And it's funny because actually I was... finishing or working to finish on this other track, the dawn that you were mentioning just before. which is like fake marimbas, you know? It's like, okay, I just do with what I have in my studios, but it's like I was trying to reproduce these elements. It seems I was in the mood of working with a marimba more than a saxophonist or string or whoever. The first time she came to my studio, I asked her if she could add a little bit some of organic marimbas, like she just played on top of it. So I have little moments from Vasilena on the track, which you cannot really hear exactly because my track was already done. But I was happy to add these little organics. to make it a bit more living, more dynamic. I guess a big part of your career, besides making music, has been DJing. A portion of our audience will know you for... the residency you did at Pulp in Paris for about eight years until the mid-naughties. Can you explain what Pulp was and what your experiences as a DJ there were like during that time? So when I started to DJ in the mid-90s, There were not so many clubs. It was more like a very small underground scene. There were some raves and maybe two or three clubs, but very underground. It was also with the gay scene. There was the Queen in Paris. There were some other parties, but it was very, very, very small. And I remember there was this girls club called The Pearl. And The Pearl was really like this girl club with music that was really like, not really interesting, like really mainstream, but like the worst mainstream you could have. But anyway, at one point, they just started to invite some, they just asked some DJ to come on the Thursday. And it was more open to everyone. It was owned by girls. Only girls were working there, but it was open to everyone on Thursday. And there were some DJs working there. And I was one of the DJs being a resident there. And then this residency started. around 2000 and then it was until 2007 or 2008, I don't know exactly. But I really grew up with the pub and it was at a moment where there was not so many parties but there were more and more parties and I think this club was one of the only clubs, probably with Rex Club, that was inviting some interesting artists that were not invited in other parties. There were some great new labels going on. So I was starting to go more and more outside of the country to play. My first EP was released in 2002. So after this release, I started to be invited outside of my country. So I was meeting some other artists. So I invited them to come and play at Perlb. And this is how actually slowly, but surely you grew up and built something. But there were some other artists there also that did also amazing thing and great music. was probably at that time very important because like at that moment there was not so many things around probably today if there was a place like this in Paris it would not make sense or it would not be interesting but it was also the only gay club for girls and today in Paris I can't tell you if there's one gay club for girls There are some parties, but there are not, so it would make sense for this. But besides this, it was one of the most interesting clubs because it was open and it was for free and there were great talents and everyone loved to play there because it was so funny and chaotic and whatever. I had really amazing moments there. About 10 years ago, you did a podcast for us, which I think was a recording of a set in Madrid. And I sort of wondered, looking back on that, how much your DJing might have evolved in that 10 years, because that period was in or shortly after your residency at Pulp ended. Well, I don't remember exactly when was recorded this podcast, but as you mentioned, maybe if it was recorded in a club, I don't remember. I mean, doing a podcast and playing in a club is very different. Like if you prepare a podcast, then you definitely would not play exactly the same thing you would play in a club because each party is very different and the sound system is very different. It can be a very small club, a big club. It can be very, very different. So it's very challenging to do a podcast somehow. So if it was recorded for a club and then it's the era podcast that you can still hear, it's a bit of a shame because it's probably 10 years ago now, this podcast, which is okay. But I mean, I haven't changed. somehow my vision about playing records. I mean, I can think there are really amazing tracks from techno, amazing deep house tracks that I really like, beautiful, amazing music, like more electronica. I mean, I really like a lot of music in diverse styles. Then as a DJ, You just have all this and depending on the place you are, depending on the sound system, depending on the crowd and all this, then you focus and decide what would be the way you want to go. But I never decide to play more. I don't decide that I have a moment where I play more techno or more deep or whatever. It's just like in one set it can be all this, but it can be well done and just from the beginning of the set to the end it can be also only techno. I just make a difference each time just not to get bored myself actually. So I'm really open to discover a lot of... tracks. I like to also put some old tracks from great labels I have from the past, from French labels or German labels. Like recently I got into my collection and I was listening to some more like Perlon labels and it's still very nice. I mean you can hear that the production was made really with only gears and A lot of them were at that time were not using some software. And you can really hear it in the way the production is made. And they are really like beautiful tracks. Sometimes I like to mix with some very new tracks that are made like really more functional and more techno. And it's really what I like is all this. textures to be mixed up all together. I think this is what makes the thing interesting, just even for myself and to discover this track also to the people. In terms of your own music, are you... using mostly hardware to produce or are you using a mixture of software and hardware to bring your music together? Yes, exactly. In my studio, I mean, I was always very interested by all synthesizers like SH-101. I have my TR-707. I have a TR-808. I have a lot of pedal effects also, but more for guitars, for example. What I like is that it's small and not so expensive, and you can buy a lot of them and just put them in chain or change. And also you put some synthesizer sounds inside these pedals. And it makes the sound interesting and it gives a lot of texture. But at the same time, there's a lot of progress also with the technology and there are amazing softwares that I like also to mix. And I also like... a lot the modernity of some textures. There are a lot of great things with native instruments, for example, like I like very much this kind of reactor, even the Fender software that I often use. is also giving some vintage sound somehow. But it's like these new gears, like technology can give you some interesting things from the past too. And just mixing all this together is kind of interesting somehow. Something I've noticed about your music in general, which is otherwise pretty diverse, is that there's often... your voice in there or a guitar or some other live sounding instrument. And I wondered if that stemmed from your background as someone who was into sort of punk and rock music when they were younger. Well, I'm evolving in this, in the electronic scene since 20 years and before I was playing guitar, but I was also doing other stuff at the same time. I think each person is very different and we have a lot of different influences. It can be a book, it can be a record, it can be music, it can be whatever. In my opinion, but this is really personal, this is my point of view, what I like is that keeping all these influences and see, I find it interesting to just change and like sometimes I'm in the mood of doing like more functional track and I'm really happy doing these tracks, but at one point I just feel bored, like in the weekend I play for clubs. And I really love it. And because you have this direct moment with the public and it's really amazing to share this moment. But then when I'm back in the studio, I'm alone. I'm not with the public. Sometimes I'm really inspired by the weekend and I'm really happy to record a track that would be really functional or more techno or whatever. But sometimes I feel I just want something more quiet. to keep it quiet for me it's just always finding this balance then this is also how I record an album like I first don't plan to do an album it's just like I have these tracks I put beside and sometimes I don't find I don't find it could be interesting to put them on some EPs so I just keep it besides and then one day it happened that I have like five tracks six tracks that And it seems interesting that it seems to be like the beginning of an album and also because of the sound. But if I was only doing exactly the same type of music since 20 years, definitely I think I would do something else. I need to nourish myself. I need to feel excited by the thing. And this is why also I'm always trying to challenge me a little bit by trying to find more interesting projects in collaborating and trying to find other collaborations also in the performances. Because at the end, it's elements that I will keep on my life, on my personal life. And also, there are some interesting aspects that I find that I will keep in the studio. And then I can bring back on another project. But it's always, everything is helping each other. Everything is nourishing each other. And this is the interesting thing and keeps me passionate about what I'm doing. And I always try to question always my studio, my DJ sets and my performances and try to... build it always differently and to make it more fun just for me this is the point so i guess you're essentially saying that in order to keep yourself refreshed you're constantly having to question your habits or break out of established patterns and sort of seek new ways of doing things yes exactly it's like really just to keep it real for me first and to keep this It's energy. I mean, electronic music is all about energy. Whatever you play, it's about energy. It's about what you give, what you share, the way you bring it. Each artist can have the same tracks to play and they can play it completely differently. It's not just a question of one track. it's really like very personal and this is what I like when I DJ I take it as a performance and at the end I'm satisfied or not by a set but then I'm happy but then I decide that the next time I'd like to play maybe a little bit more techno or a little bit less or whatever I wanted to cycle back to the album Endless Revisions title like that suggests that you've been working on it for a while yeah i didn't want to make it heavy by trying to find this uh this name it's a little wrinkle to this uh work we we all do in the studio that uh like you never finish you you never know when the track is finished and at one point it's just good to stop and whatever at the same time i liked the title whatever it means as a French person. And also I worked just for the cover. There's this French photographer artist called Noémie Goudal, who I really love the work. And she did the cover of my EP, The Dawn. So there's something that I really like in her work. And it's about... Like she's always photographing some landscape and sometimes there's weird elements in the middle and you don't know really where it comes from, but it's kind of an architecture in the landscape. It was making an echo to my work, which was more like the acoustic landscape somehow. The name was also about these landscapes and I thought that it was about also all this space you can have. in a track and I always like to work with different levels in a track like you have the stereo but I always imagine what is behind and how you can imagine music and I mean the perception is very personal from one person to another I really always find it interesting to see how each person feel the music and for all these reasons I was thinking about this title too. Just before we began recording we were talking about how your album was slightly more electronic than your previous ones both of which were for Kill the DJ. Does that reflect the fact that that you're playing out regularly or had you made a conscious decision to make it that way? Well, probably after these two album releases, you know, after one album, then you decide which direction you want to go. Then I start to... to record this album and at one point I mean I was producing a lot of music outside and producing some also some artists of like this Chilean band called Nova Materia and besides my personal projects helped me to think also about my my own production and in a way I think I was playing a lot with organics elements and I was thinking, okay, I love to play with all these organics elements, but I want to keep it a bit more radical in a way and keep it with this electronic sound I have also first. So probably this is one of the reasons it's a little bit more electronic. But this is a way of also keeping all the tracks more like a unity. This is something I was building slowly. It's probably not really made conscientiously. But it's a decision I was making more and more. I was producing the... the album I guess another project you've done that I've found really interesting is a soundtrack for the film Paris La Blanche. And I wondered if you could tell me a little bit about that project and how it came about. Yes, of course. So I was working with the director Lydia Terki on her previous project, which was some short movies and medium movies. I don't know, like 20 minutes. And she was working, I was always doing her music on her projects and she did some video clips for me. And I mean, there's a collaboration that is interesting. I was already doing some music for some movies sometimes or documentaries when I find the project interesting and if I can bring something interesting, of course. So Lydia, she offered me to do the music of her first long feature. This movie was shot between Algeria and France because it's a story between Algeria and France. A woman who is looking at her husband she hasn't seen since many years and he lives in France. And there's a big history between Algeria and France from the 50s. And it's about this past colonization and how some people dealt with it after. But it's not about immigration. It's more about this love story also about this woman that is trying to find a husband during the whole movie. So I was really touched by... this woman that is looking for love just during the whole movie. And so she meets a lot of persons during the movie. But the funny thing is that Lydia, she said, OK, I want you to make the music, but I want you to work with cabal musicians, which I found it a bit weird at the beginning that she was asking me. to do this. I thought I was not the right person because I never did that, you know. I mean, of course, it's challenging, but I didn't see the point at the beginning. And this was what she wanted, like really as it was between France and Algeria. She wanted this mixture of Occidental and Eastern music and see how I can deal with it. So she introduced me to some Kabyle musicians and I discovered a whole world and I listened to a lot of music. I was really helped by one of these musicians called Hirdin Mujabi because he's a musician and he knows all the musicians in Paris. And actually, I met some other musicians. And whenever I was saying, oh, Jardin, he said, yeah, no Jardin. They all know each other. It's a very small community in Paris. I guess in France too, but in Paris particularly. And I was making him listen to some music I liked or some, I was trying to identify. what was the instruments and so he said this is Zorna and then showed me stuff on YouTube and I mean it was a lot of work but very interesting and really funny and at the end okay I was inspired by I had some ideas I tried to record stuff but my way before they come And also Lydia, like she remembered a little melody her father used to play because he was cabal. And so she gave me this little idea. And so this was the point of start of the whole music because it was giving the tone somehow too. So I just reorchestrated and built the track. with her first music from her father, and then recorded with all these musicians. So there was Mandol, there was Oud, Herdin is a percussionist. singer. I recorded also this instrument called the Zorna, which is very, very loud, very interesting, but very, very loud. And I just mixed it with some music I did and tried to find this balance. And at the end, this is how the music was made. And so... we decided to release it at the same time of the movie in April. So it's released under my name, like Chloé Thévenin, because it's very different from what I do. And usually when I do music for movies, I'm named Chloé Thévenin, as it's my name and surname anyway. I mean I was happy also to release it because actually it's one of my, the project I was doing and that, I mean doing the music for movies is very very long and takes a lot of time and it's really interesting but just happy to release it also and it was released on my label so very different but. I guess it has a sense somehow. Were there particular things you learned by working with these musicians that you didn't sort of know before? Well, what I liked, I really discovered a field where they are very... It's all about sharing. And what I understood is like... On the contrary of Occidental music, where music is written, and this is how this transmission is made. Like we read a Bach or Mozart, it's like you give it to some instrumentalist and then they reproduce it. But for... Algerian music, they don't write it. They transmit by oral. So they show to another person what is the music and then they remember and then they play around it. I mean, there's this instrument called the oud. The notes are not very precise. The more they play it and the more they know where to place the fingers. On the contrary, the guitar, when you play folk music or rock music, then you know exactly where to put the notes because you have the bars. But on the wood, there's nothing. So it took us a lot of time to record because they were listening to the theme I wanted. But at the end, we were recording, but they were searching for the right tone. This is what I liked. I mean, it was really a great moment of sharing. You ask something, do improvisation. And this is what I really, really enjoyed, especially because when I DJ or when I'm in the studio. It's a process you do alone. Even when you DJ, there's the public, but at the end you play alone. So I was really enthusiastic by playing with all these musicians because it's completely another field. And it was really surprising to see how they were happy to share like this. I really enjoyed also discovering a whole new music and being interested into the types of music and there are a lot of movements inside like we have in electronic music, I guess. I guess that brings us to talking a little bit about your label Lumiere Noir. I believe you established that about three years ago. At what point did you decide I need to start my own label and sort of bring in other artists and push their music as well? Well, the funny thing is that I was starting to do my residence. I mean, I was a resident DJ also with the Pulp. for many years at Rex Club. Actually, at one point, I changed the name of my night at Rex Club, but I was still the resident and I was still inviting artists. So the only thing I changed was the name of my party and the graphic designer. which was Lumière Noire. I think it was just done step by step. I didn't plan to do a label, really. It just happened like slowly. Because when I travel, when I invite some artists, and because of all this collaboration we were talking about, there are a lot of artists that I really enjoy the music. And I was really happy to... Just ask them if at one point we could do like an EP or a remix or whatever. So it's just Lumière Noire, a way of putting all these things together. It's just very intuitive and the continuity of all this. Because I was meeting some other artists and because I just had some great... tracks that I really liked usually like I was always sending to some friends who had labels but at one point sometimes I mean as a DJ you always You always have this struggle where you want to share music with the people but at the same time there are a lot of music you want to keep for yourself because you like it so much. There's this point where, okay, doing a label is a way of keeping this track for me, like keeping, you know, there's something very selfish also at the same time. So I like... This was also like the continuity of all this thing with the DJing and discovering tracks. Is that almost like a protective thing where if you've got a song or something that's so precious and so personal to you that maybe giving it away to some label might compromise it in some way? Well, somehow it's a way of also building my own thing from like for my own. There are some labels I really like and there are some labels I don't like. And sometimes there are amazing tracks suddenly that appears in some labels we would never expect. In a way, I mean, this is our job as a DJ. always search in labels and I always try to find things even in some labels I usually don't like so much because sometimes you have surprises. So in a way doing the label is just my own selection of what I would give as a DJ. This selection I find in different labels, but it's before the process of doing the label. It's just after when the artist has finished his track. And also because I have a lot of friends, artists, producers and DJs that send me some music just to have a feedback. I mean, sometimes I do that myself with some friends with my own music. just because you need the feedback. And so sometimes I was hearing some amazing music. And so I just wanted to release it myself. I don't have any other words. It's just not, there's no perspective, like commercial perspective or whatever, but it's just like, I want to release it. It's just a natural process, you know. But it has something to do probably with this. The selfish thing with the DJ thing where you're selecting some music from everywhere and that you want to play, that you feel that it's yourself, but at the same time you're sharing with the public. It's an interesting process that happens inside your mind. I looked at your... recent gigs this year and I see that you've played at Robert Johnson and Panorama Bar but on top of that you've also been doing regular gigs at Rex Club So I guess the question I'd like to ask is whether DJing for a place that you visit occasionally versus a place that you DJ at all the time requires a different sort of preparation. Yes, actually, I mean, if you play, like, for example, I have my residency. at Rex Club since many years and usually when I invite DJs if it's my night I do the warm up I like to introduce it because I give the tone also of the night and whereas if I play at Panorama Bar or Robert Johnson I mean Robert Johnson is also a particular thing but Panorama Bar for example then it's more like you play for four hours, which is great because normally you play for two hours, which I think is very, very short. But it's more like kind of peak time. And it's also amazing. What I like is to play at the beginning or to play at the end or to play in the middle. Then it's inspiring. And then you give something always different. But it's really, really inspiring. Robert Johnson is something a bit different too because I was a resident DJ there for many, many years. I did the first mixed CD of the series. when the label started after the Playhouse breakdown, live at Robert Johnson. And I was like really one of the DJs playing there always. And... there's this thing where you share the night with one artist or another, but you know when it starts, but you never know when it finishes. So ending, like precise ending, so it can end very, very late. But what I like is that you can play, like, for example, two times. Like, you can play at the real beginning, then you can play really later at 5 o'clock until 9 o'clock. Or you can play from three until nine. It's really free. This is what I like. I mean, like the clubs you mentioned, three clubs that are very different, but that have very strong identities and that are very interesting because of these versatilities. Whereas in other clubs, usually you play two hours set and book for two hours or three hours, which is also great. But what I like is also to be challenged in these other kind of clubs too. What kind of trajectory would you be able to go in if you were to play at a place that would let you have this sort of longer set time? that you wouldn't be able to have if you were only playing like a two hour set, say? Well, I think I would play all the tracks I really like at the moment, but I always try to go also in my old record collections. I'm always looking for some music, but when I'm saying I'm always looking for some music, I'm not focused only in new music. I always go in my very old collection and always like to pick up some old music from labels that was very important to me and try to add the track in my set. I always try to find this balance and to... I can also, of course, play with only new music, which is great too. But sometimes when I hear a track, it makes me think about a track from four years ago or ten years ago or six months ago. So when I'm playing, I'm always thinking about this, like what I'm going to play. next but it's always like oh I have some tracks that I remember like that was released a year ago or five years ago so the job is always to make it easy to find when you're playing so there's always a good very important preparation before not to get lost because when you play it's very direct very intuitive so I just try to not lose too much time trying to find the tracks because this is a bit tricky sometimes I remember when I used to play with vinyls, then you have a box or two, which is a very heavy tour, but let's say one. And I mean, you have like, I don't know, like 60 vinyls, I don't know how much, but at least it's limited. I also used to like this limited thing like you go away with only a limited selection which makes you the thing challenging so you prepare a selection of how many tracks whatever and then after you play with this track today USB stick with the peony and all this thing. You can have a lot of music. And so I still sometimes bring some vinyls too because there are a lot of unreleased music too with vinyls. But I try to encode them also because sometimes it's just easier, you know, for the technical whatever. Because today sometimes they're just... also some places where they are not decks anymore or whatever. I guess people think of Chloe and they think, you know, you have lots of different facets. There's your music, your DJing and these other projects we've just discussed. If someone didn't know about you as an artist and they wanted some kind of introduction into what you do, is there a particular record or mix CD or something else through which they're best placed to sort of get to know what you're about? It's always difficult to describe myself with one release or one word. Because I have some people that know me only as DJ, for example. Or some people that only know me because of my albums. Or some people just know me because of Run Remix. That was important to them. And I think somehow this is what I like. because I don't have the choice at the end. My music, like for example, if I tell you, okay, my album is electronic, but it's definitely not my DJ set because in my DJ set, I make it more functional, but somehow electronic music. goes into some other fields that are not made for clubs. You can find some tracks that could be played probably in some clubs. But what I like is also this versatility. If a person likes my DJ sets and if they are interesting, probably they would go a bit further and see that I do some EPs, that I do some remixes and that I do my albums. Some people could not like my albums and could like just my remixes, whatever. This is the game, which I totally accept. I don't have really one release. Probably today, this release, The Dawn, as it's the most current one that was released recently, would be the more representative because it's really this in-between thing between DJing, the tempo is mostly... Like it's 120, so it's more like clubby, but at the same time it's not a track you would definitely play as DJ, but you could play. And the way it's produced and what I give, put in the track would be more personal and I don't know, probably this track, I would say. Thank you. you
