Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. On this edition of the Exchange, we'll be taking you live to Montreal, where over the course of the next few days, we'll be talking to a number of artists performing live at the MUTEC Festival. calling it the RA Live Exchange Sessions, and we're hoping you'll enjoy this particular chat with Seth Horvitz, a.k.a. SUTEC, many electronic experimenters in Southern California around the turn of the century. Horvitz has released on labels like Force Inc. and Soul Jazz. Most recently, he reinterpreted Johann Sebastian Bach for the modern era. I talked with him in front of a live audience on Friday, June 3rd, 2011. I read a quote recently from you in a magazine. It said something to the effect of, sometimes I don't have any idea what I'm doing. There's periods where I go through where I don't have any idea what I'm doing. What are you doing right now? Do you know? Are you in a period where you know? I think I'm getting to a point where I know more what I'm doing. Yeah. I guess I was going through kind of an identity crisis as SUTEC. I think that, you know, starting to make music under that name in like 1996. I had a few other projects, but I was really throwing everything under that name. And I think my interest started to branch out so much that I didn't really know what that meant anymore. And maybe at first I thought that was a good thing, that I was just being as eclectic as possible. And I think I've kind of come back to maybe figuring out how to differentiate projects based on something more narrow. I don't really feel the need. to kind of lump everything together under one name, it just kind of, I think it made me confused after a while. Probably made a lot of other people confused too. Well, certainly the first couple records, it was like, this is this, and this is that. But it reflected a progression, I think, in a way. And I think there was a sonic signature through all of these things. Would you agree with that or no? I'm not sure, really. I'd have to let other people tell me if that's the case. I'm too close to it to really figure that out, I guess. Sure. Going back, I'd like to talk a little bit about sort of the... San Francisco rave scene in the early 90s, I guess, when you sort of moved there and started to do electronic music or become interested in it. What were some of the parties that were going on that were influential to you, or was it just the music? I can name a pretty... classic one. It must have been I'm guessing 1992, maybe late 1992, early 1993. I can think of a couple classics, but this was the opening act was, and this is at the Fashion Design Center in San Francisco. Opening act was Cybersonic, Dan Bell and Richie Houghton. They opened for Moby, who was opening for The Prodigy, and this is at a rave. That was pretty amazing. And in the back room was Jonas Sharpe's space-time continuum, and he was playing... the Aphex Twin selected ambient works, volume one, on both turntables. And that was the first I learned of Aphex Twin that night. I mean, I was like 18 years old, 19 years old. It blew my mind. So that was pretty essential. Was that a crew throwing that party that was doing quite a bit of stuff, bringing people in? Or was that just a one-off? It was probably some kind of a crew, I guess, but I don't remember exactly. I'm just wondering if there were regular things going on in the city that you were going to all the time. So that 1992-93 era, when I was pretty young, that was the time when you didn't really know. There were these raves that had silly names like Wacky Citrus and whatever. You knew that this was sort of a brand. There was some group doing this thing, but I never knew who it was. behind those parties. There were some really great parties. There was a place called Mr. Floppy's Flophouse in Oakland that was, I think it was a former brothel that had then just gotten in disrepair and then some people were able to take it over. I saw Psychic TV. when Fred Gianelli was part of Psychic TV there. And there was just crazy stuff in this house. It was like, I mean, that was the day when raves, I think, were... no one knew what the hell they were. And that was cool. They had set up all kinds of weird installations. You went through the kitchen and there was raw meat hanging everywhere and stuff. That's not really... It wasn't like the feel-good rave. It was the what the fuck's going on kind of rave. And I always kind of preferred that. Going to these things, was it immediate that you wanted to become involved on a musical level that you wanted to DJ or make music, or did that come a little bit later? That came a little bit later. The first thing that happened was I got involved with the radio station at UC Berkeley. So I was one of the first DJs to champion techno music and mixing. beats on the air at that radio station. A lot of people were actually kind of were a little bit hostile towards that. And interestingly, one of the other people who was into it at that time, who I was an undergrad with was Drew Daniel from Matmos. And one other friend, the three of us were the ones who were into techno at the radio station. So I basically taught myself to mix on the air because I didn't have turntables. Maybe that's why people were hostile. You were teaching yourself. At first, I mean, they had a right to at first, but I was at that station for like eight years, so I got pretty good after a while. Yeah, these like first... night shows I was doing. I think I was just train wrecking all night. It was probably pretty hard to listen to. And what sort of things were you playing? Was it the Cybersonic Plus 8? Yeah, you know, I was picking up on some of the early Detroit techno stuff and also like UK acid house stuff. And I was also pretty into kind of like the early ambient. I remember that label, like, Rising High and that kind of stuff. I guess. I mean, I was also, like, I came from being really into punk and industrial in high school, so I liked all that kind of crossover stuff with industrial and techno at the time, too. I've talked to Drew before, and that seems to also be one of his interests, punk and industrial stuff early on, so I'm sure that was like a nice bridge for you guys to be discovering all of this new electronic music. have that past at the same time. Did it catch on eventually at the radio station? Did people start to like, did you grow an audience after a while? I think it's, well, I haven't really paid attention to the station in the last several years, but I think there were more and more DJs who were into that stuff and even people who were playing disco and house and trance or whatever. Basically, all those other genres weren't really a part of it. The station, by nature, it's really eclectic, and that's what I really appreciated about it. There are a lot of people kind of really stuck in the indie rock vibe. It's college radio. Yeah. When did you make the jump from DJing to making music? When I finished, it was while I was in school, I bought like a couple of things, drum machines, synths, and played around a bit. But when I finished school, I moved in with a guy, Darren Marshall, who had this label called Belief Systems, and he had a studio, and it was a warehouse. And I'd never seen a compressor or anything. I didn't know really how to use a studio. I just had a couple toys. And I got involved with his label, and my first... track was released on his label and he kind of taught me some stuff at that time and then I think I got a little bit more equipment like I think I had a Mac Centris and I had a 909 and some effects pedals and stuff. This was around the mid-90s or so? 96, I think. That was like the first track that I had. And then the first Sutec thing came out in like 99 or so. No, 90. Well, the first proper Sutec 12-inch was on Dropbeat Records. That was in 1997. And that was an Oakland label that lasted for a few years. They had a record shop as well. Gotcha. You spent a year before this in India, I believe, as part of school. How did that, that was just a school trip or something? It was a study abroad program for the whole UC system. there with like 25 other students from the various UC schools and you know I just it was a great opportunity when I was an undergrad I knew I wanted to spend a year abroad somewhere and India is just a fascinating place with so many different cultures and climates and so much to experience I just wanted to go someplace really different you know i was young and had always lived in california so did you feel like it broadened your horizons a little bit seeing what was you know going on there yeah definitely you know uh i was just Half the year, I kind of worked it so I could just do this independent study type thing the second half of the year, which meant I could pretty much do whatever I wanted. And I just took trains. I would just hop on a train every couple days and just look for somewhere else to go. And yeah, it blew my mind, really. What did you study in college? I ended up with a degree in cognitive science, but that was kind of by accident in a sense. I reached that two-year point where you have to figure out what your major is and just kind of went through the catalog to see what I'd taken and what I qualified for and that seemed like the closest to what I'd already started doing. I guess I really consider the degree as probably would be better called interdisciplinary studies. I took a lot of different things as an undergrad and I never really specialized. But I've always been interested in consciousness and perception, and that's what cognitive science is about. How do you feel like that stuff has played into your work over the years? I think it's coming back more and more these days, and since I went back to get my master's in music, and this piano music I've been working on recently is... where I'm paying more attention specifically to certain aspects of perception. When you make techno music, your priority is to have a good beat and have cool sounds, and that's kind of the top. But yeah, I'm trying to be a little more specific, and some of those things I learned about are coming back. kind of like really testing specific types of experiences with sound and seeing what that does and trying to hone in on that. With the performance last night, which was a player piano, do you feel like that's somehow testing perception in some ways? How does that play into it? Yeah, definitely. With that music, I'm doing a lot of... trying to deal with interlocking patterns where something new kind of emerges from it and also playing with speed and tempo so that you can't necessarily tell or trying to create a balance between a sense of speeding up and slowing down, for example, where as you're listening, you could focus in on both at the same time. So trying to do those, you know, trying to... find those strange kind of gray areas between two opposites where both can kind of be perceived? It seems like listening to something like the work that you did in the early late 90s and early aughts that there was also that aspect though, even when you're making techno that there was somehow like this interlocking, trying to perceive two or three different things at once. Yeah. You might say there's a problem with me having too much density in my music at times. I try and get away. Even though I was called a minimal techno artist, I think that I probably went too far in the other direction a lot of times. made things pretty crowded. Did you find that you weren't functional enough oftentimes for the dance floor? Yeah, I have that problem too. It seems like it's really hard to DJ a lot of the tracks I've made. Even when I really thought I was making something really straightforward, then when you try and mix it, when DJs would try and mix it, it sounded really off to everything else. But, yeah, I guess going back to the cognitive science thing, when I was first starting to listen to techno, I... I was always really drawn to the stuff that kind of freaked out your mind in a way that you couldn't understand. So, you know, I remember thinking of things in terms of like... what music meant when you called it acid. You know, like, okay, you have the 303, that's a signature sound, but to me, I was thinking, like, I want to make music that could be called acid, but for the reason that it just trips you out, you know? And I guess maybe my idea of what trips you out has gotten a little more refined over the years. But I think I'm still interested in that. How do you confuse the mind? Well, how can sound confuse your mind? And whenever that happens, when I'm listening to something and there's just something you can't quite understand, I like that. I'm drawn to that. In the past couple of years, you've moved to doing more things with acoustic instruments, or more obviously acoustic instruments, I guess. The piano, for example, you discovered. The piano, I think, was a quote. read in an interview and I was wondering at what point did this sort of happen, this transformation I think and what you've been doing and why? Well, I guess what happened is I started with machines. I didn't actually... I think most people at least took lessons of some sort when they were a kid. Most people I come across took piano lessons for at least a few years as a kid, maybe longer. A lot of people had some kind of musical training, and I didn't have anything. And then I just started making music with machines, and about seven or eight years ago, I lose track now, but... something drew me to the piano and something drew me to classical music, really. I just, suddenly I wanted to understand that kind of stuff, how it works. Like, someone who studies music, what do you learn? And I just got really kind of obsessed with it. And the piano was the instrument that I... decided to work with and I fell in love with it. I mean, it's a machine in a way. Also, it's mechanical. You know, you're not actually putting your finger on the thing that makes the sound, you're putting your finger on... something that hits a lever that hits something else that makes a sound. So it's still kind of a machine in a sense, but yet this is a machine of classical music. Well, and last night you weren't even hitting anything. Right. You just, for people who were listening, the performance last night, or people who weren't there, you came on stage, turned on the piano. and then left and then it was 50 minutes or whatever of the this player piano playing a bunch of um A bunch of compositions? Yeah, it's eight different pieces. Okay. And this is part of your master's thesis at Mills College, correct? Yeah, this was my thesis project. So I did an almost identical concert at the end of my two-year master's program. And why did you decide to play your piano? What's the way to go? Well... I really wanted to be able to play the piano really well, and I took lessons for five or six years and practiced a lot. And I got to a point where I'm comfortable with the language, but I also know that I'm never going to be a great piano performer with my hands. I knew when I went back to school for music that I wanted to work with the piano somehow. Really, there was one piece that I came across. I knew about this composer, Conlon Nancarrow. I don't know if you've heard his work. He spent almost his entire life composing music for the old role-operated player pianos. He was relatively unknown during most of his life, discovered kind of late. He has this amazing body of work. From the 40s through the late 70s, he was just punching these roles of the most insane music only for a player piano. It's kind of the first frame of reference for that music. But I discovered this piece by another composer named James Tenney. I actually wrote a piece for Conlon Nancarrow. It's called The Spectral Canon for Conlon Nancarrow. And the piece just blew me away, and actually it was what made me say, I've got to make music for the player piano. what the hell is happening with this song, this piece? It's freaking me out and I need to understand it. And it kind of gave me this push towards the instrument. But I also felt like working with an automated piano was kind of a nice balance between wanting to use the piano but also wanting to use my experience making electronic music. accepting that I have limitations as a performer, but instead of, you know, I felt like this is something different that I could pursue. Like the piece, the James Tenney piece, it was not even, there would be no possible reason. to try and have a human play it. So that's kind of where I was coming from. What can you do with this thing not even considering human hands? It's a machine and it's a bunch of buttons, so treat it like that and see what can happen with that. It's funny though, you talk about it being a machine. You were saying to me earlier that it actually crapped out on you near the end. Like it didn't actually work. The problem with those pianos is Yamaha makes these pianos and every couple of years they come out with like an upgraded model of the controller system, new software and all this stuff. I mean, I use, all I do is send it MIDI and that's it. So it's really simple, but they change how it's calibrated. They change how it responds every time. And I think what happened is that it overheated. last night yeah because if you there are solenoids on each key that trigger the notes and um The one I was working on, I knew how far I could take it before it would overheat and shut down. I think this is a newer model, and I think they got a little better at protecting it. I'm guessing they had some insurance claims or something, like people blew them up and said, why didn't it shut down before? So they probably lowered the threshold. It's really disappointing that we didn't have an explosion. Yeah, that would have been more dramatic. Actually, the sound guy in the venue, when I was setting up the day before... when I went to talk to the people there, he told me that last time he worked with a disc laver, it was at a casino, and he said that, he told me that during the performance, some kind of fire thing above collapsed, and like thousands of gallons of water spilled into the piano and all over the casino in the middle of the performance, and it caused two million dollars of damage. I asked them if we could recreate it for my show, but it didn't work out. It's funny you mentioned Casino, because I think there is this kind of, with a player piano, there's this kind of old-timey, or kind of... a most cheap feel to it in a way? Well, those pianos are really expensive, but they're marketed towards either rich people who just want to have some, it's like a jukebox in your house, or... places like casinos and high-end hotels where it gets put in the lobby and they you know it also has this these funny capabilities like there's speakers underneath the piano so you can put in like a sinatra disc that plays the sinatra piano part and then his voice and the band comes out of speakers from the bottom That's their market. They're not really making money off people like me, that's for sure. Was it tough to find one in Montreal? Well, Mutech managed to locate one. The place that they rented it from was just two blocks from the venue. One thing that's nice is those pianos do exist in most major cities. They're available. They have them in a lot of universities, and actually piano shops rent them out. Is there a museum in San Francisco of them? Player pianos? You might be thinking of, there's a place called the Musee Mechanique. Yeah, yeah. Which is a really interesting place. It's filled with old mechanical instruments. They might have a couple of player piano type things. They're all like early 20th century. They have these sort of dioramas, these coin-operated. mechanical things where lots of stuff moves and little people dance around and little instruments are triggered. All kinds of strange... It was like an arcade in the early 20th century. They have all these old machines. You would go in and put a coin in and some stuff would happen. What keeps you in San Francisco? You know, all these people, at least techno-wise, moved to Berlin or, you know, moving all over the place. Well, to tell you a secret, not a big secret, but I don't live in San Francisco anymore. Oh. Last year I moved to the East Coast, and that was for my wife's work. So we both actually really love San Francisco and miss it a lot. I just think it's a great city. It's a great city to live in. There's a great music scene there too. Not necessarily a huge techno scene, but there's all kinds of music going on there. It's small in a sense, but very close-knit. and there's a real sense of community, I think, in the music scene there, and a lot of different little scenes that interact, which is nice. It's not too compartmentalized. So I think there's a lot of great aspects to that city. I still would say, even if I'm living away from San Francisco for many years, it'll be kind of my home. home. So with San Francisco, obviously, back in the early, late 90s rather, there seemed to be a real scene of producers doing things that were quite advanced with Max MSP and things like that. With you, Kit Clayton, the Tiger Beat 6 crew was there in Oakland, I suppose. San Francisco as well? Yeah, Kid 606 moved up to Oakland from San Diego. Did it feel like there was a real, like, there were a lot of creative energy at that moment? Yeah, late 90s, it was like a lot of people kind of came together, got to know each other, and we were doing a lot of collaborating. A lot of sharing of ideas. Yeah, I mean, I feel like... Whatever success I had as a musician, I owe a lot to the community I was a part of. If I was just on my own somewhere else trying to do stuff, I don't think it would have gone anywhere. The kind of interactions I had with all of those guys I think had a lot to do with me having the opportunity to release records and travel and stuff. And we were talking earlier and you said that you're DJing less and less these days. Why is that? Why did you sort of shy away from doing so much of it? Part of it is that I kind of retreated from dance music for quite a few years. I can't ever really escape it. I think techno is probably something that's burned into my soul. No matter how hard I try, it'll probably still be there. But I kind of wanted to take a break. I think I got kind of overloaded with it. And the way I listen to music these days is different. I think that I now listen to less music, but try to really engage with it on a deeper level. And there's some music that that... works better for it than others, but when you're a DJ playing dance music, you kind of have to keep up with a really insane amount of music all the time, and that has become really kind of fatiguing to me. I don't enjoy that as much. When I was more active as a DJ, I looked forward to that trip to the record store every week, get the huge stack of records, listen to them, and like, how am I going to afford all these records that I want? like which ones should I put back and it was that like massive consumption and that was a really exciting time in my life but I no longer get that kind of feeling from listening to like a hundred records at a time I just get really tired so I you know I still enjoy DJing but I think that I'm really picky now. I'm really careful about what I want to play and I tend to put together shorter, more condensed sets. But you're feeling more engaged with the music that you listen to these days? Yeah, well, not necessarily just electronic music, but... I think more than anything, the stuff that I really engage with is a whole history of classical music up through the 20th century and through all of the different avant-garde movements. That's the stuff that I've really gotten into. That music is stuff that you can really spend a lot of time. like picking apart and not everyone enjoys that and I understand that but I actually really like to geek out on on stuff like take a single piece and study how it was composed and figure out what's going on with every little element. Where did that start for you the engagement with classical music? I mean was it something that was always an undercurrent or is it something you came to at a certain point? Well I You know, I think like a lot of other people I was drawn to certain kind of major composers who did experimental stuff, whether it was like Xenakis and his noisy things and obviously some ideas from John Cage and stuff like that. But I never really engaged deeply. It was just like I had some of the records. I knew a little bit about it. But I think when I came to like playing the piano and studying... classical music theory, that's when I was also getting into learning different compositional methods and going back to some of those composers and then trying to go deeper into what it was they were getting at. Because there's a lot you can read about and a lot you can study if you want to go deep with that stuff. Who's really impressed you, composer-wise, that you sort of, on the surface level, you're like, okay, I know that name, whatever, but when you sort of studied and really dug into it, wow, there's something really interesting going on here. Well, I guess one composer who I knew about and kind of has a bad rap from a lot of people is Schoenberg. And I can't say I get into all of his music, but from studying and also from going to Mills, I gained a pretty deep appreciation for what he was doing. He was also really crotchety and crabby about a lot of things. and I'm sure he hated a lot of music. It seems like he probably hated pop music of all types, but I appreciate that he was just trying to, he had this idea of completely reinventing how classical music was composed, and it's hard to listen to. But I did gain a huge appreciation for his approach. Obviously Bach is also someone that you've really engaged with. You made a record last year? Yeah. Or released a record last year called An Bach. So I'm wondering if you could talk about the genesis of the record and also sort of what you did. Yeah, that's a pretty interesting project. Basically, there's a guy in Paris who... was curating a show at one of the opera houses in Paris that was mainly, I guess in the beginning it was supposed to be maybe a little bigger and maybe have more experimental approaches to Bach, but... And he told me about it like a year in advance and asked me to do some kind of a set. And I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. It ended up being mostly classical musicians playing Bach. I was the only electronic musician there, but I made a lot of music just for that show. And I didn't really think it was going to turn into an album, but after I'd gone through the work of making that stuff, over the next several months, I decided to kind of revisit it and turn it into an album. But it's a really daunting kind of task to think of like making a Sutec versus Bach release. I mean, I had to kind of treat it with a certain amount of humor because I think, I mean, there's no way I could put myself close to the level of that composer. And also, if I wanted to do something where I was sort of trying to reinvent the musical material and the con... context of Sutex music, I think if it got too intellectual, it would just kind of get lost. So what I did was I kind of took various incarnations of Bach's music, whether it was certain kinds of sounds of period instruments. or MIDI data and I just kind of like really buried it in so that it would be kind of like hidden in my own music. I didn't try and make it like a remix or make it too obvious. And I tried to treat it with a little bit of humor. as well one of the things about last night i was talking to you earlier that i it was really nice is how humorous some of this stuff was uh in the player piano uh compositions like i remember watching at a certain point uh it almost seemed like the keys there's a graphic that showed the keys as they were being pressed down. It almost seemed as though the keys were trying to catch up to one another at certain points. It seemed very humorous. Is that a big part of what you're trying to bring to what you're doing? I'm not necessarily trying to bring humor to it, but I think there's an aspect of my personality that just comes out no matter what. I see humor in things and I can't get away from that. There's one particular piece where everything is descending and I pause for a while before hitting the last note. That usually gets a laugh out of people because you see this thing that's very mechanical proceeding at a very precise pace and then it stops before the last one. Just making, I guess... little intrusions like this is strict mechanical music but it's made by a person and every once in a while I could do something that kind of snaps you out of that. He says, oh, he messed with that. It's kind of a little reminder, okay, there's a person behind this. How did your time at Mills go? Did you feel kind of... out of your depth when you began in a way with all of these perhaps classically trained people around you and you just studied piano for a little while. Well, yeah, I was a little intimidated at first, but... What's amazing about Mills is that they, I feel like the faculty there, they try and put together kind of this really strange mix of people. It's almost like a social experiment, but a great one. Like, okay, we're not going to just take the top music students. We're going to look for a bunch of people who have all these different interests. can riff off each other somehow. So what happens is everyone there comes from these different backgrounds. You have a handful of people who are conservatory-trained musicians. You have a handful of people who don't have music degrees at all, but have some experience as a musician, people like me. And, you know, there was one guy who had a PhD in engineering who then just decided to go back and make sound sculptures. So you get this mix of people and everyone's working together and you learn a lot from the other people there. There aren't very many other master's programs, I think, quite like it. It seems quite rare in the electronic music world in that it's quite forward-thinking. Each year there's 20-some students and that's divided into electronic music, composition and improvisation. So you have people that are doing really different things but you end up knowing everybody. at some point probably working with most of the people on some project. So you have really amazing improvising musicians who just play an acoustic instrument, then you have people who are really hardcore into the technical stuff, computer programming. and everyone's working together. Do you think you'll be working with more acoustic improvising? You know, you've shied away from the piano performance aspect just because... I haven't necessarily shied away from it. There are certain projects that I have taken on, you know, that don't require a kind of traditional virtuosity, but I did a five-hour... performance of an Eric Satie piece called "Vexations" that just requires really a lot of concentration and stamina. It doesn't require technical skill at all. And another piece by Charlemagne Palestine who developed a technique of playing the piano called strumming, which is using the two hands kind of alternating to play, just to play a repetitive pattern of, you're just sort of playing a group of notes over and over and over, and bringing out overtones in the piano. He used to do that in the 70s, like for four or five hours, to the point where he was bleeding on the piano and stuff. I was really taken by that when I heard the recordings and I ended up even going to Brussels and staying with him for a couple days to learn how to play this music. And I did a concert where I played that. I'm still interested in playing. Yeah, there's a recording online of it. I love to play the piano still and I think I always will. that I realize I have certain limitations or certain projects I could take on, I'm not going to be playing Bach. So unless it's four hours or more, you're not going to do it. Yeah, exactly. Well, thank you, Seth. Thanks a lot.
