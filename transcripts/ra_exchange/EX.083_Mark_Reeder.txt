Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. To tell Mark Reeder's story in the music business would take at least a day, so what follows is an abbreviated two-hour version. Reeder has been in Berlin since the 70s, but he grew up in Manchester, where he became friends with Joy Division and fell in love with electronic music. When he arrived in Berlin, he was looking for the likes of Tangerine Dream, but fell in love with the punk rock scene, which seems somehow more charged and vital in the divided city than it did back home. Reeder went on to throw one of the only punk rock shows ever in communist East Berlin and recorded the first album as well, right before the wall fell down in 1989. Reeder was out of town when the Berlin Wall came down, but when he returned he plunged headlong into electronic music. building a label, MFS, that courted controversy and launched Paul Van Dyke to mega stardom. That's a lot of things to consider and there's still even more, as you'll hear in this lengthy conversation. Van Dyke's move to a major label, Reader's new hope in Corvin Dalek, Reader's entry into making music himself. It's all here and it feels like we've barely scratched the surface of his incredible story. You moved to Germany in '78, I think. Did you speak any German? Only the German that I'd learnt from war films, you know, from being a kid. Hände hoch! Or achten, you know. It doesn't really get you very far when you try and buy a loaf of bread, you know. But you were drawn to it. You knew you had to get out of Manchester. Yeah, I mean, like, you know, Manchester in the 70s was a very, very, very grim, well, it's still grim anyway, but it was a very, very grim place. And, you know, people were... quite desperate. You know, I'd grown up through a series of regimes that had provided us as children with a gradually degrading system, you know, like I had to do my homework by candlelight because the constant strikes which gave us power cuts afforded us to like you know like you could read in local newspaper tonight tonight's area that's going to be cut off you know and it was like you kind of like grew up in this kind of system where i thinking oh god what's going to happen next and just looming threat of margaret thatcher coming into power seemed inevitable and I thought I don't really want to live in a Britain that's ruled by this woman who's going to. who was threatening all kinds of things that she was going to do. And I didn't find it very appealing. But you were surrounded by very artistic people. You were working on the one record shop that was good. Our shop was as small as your office, practically. It was about double the size of this room here we're sitting in now. Which is not a very big room. It's not a very big room. It's quite a longish room. We had the shopping. And it was the only shop in Manchester that sold punk rock records. And so we had a lot of people coming there. And I met a lot of people through that, of course. But after seeing, being involved in that, I just thought, you know, I needed for myself to get away, you know. I'd been kind of involved with that. And I just thought... I could see it going in a more really tedious commercial sort of punk version of what the ideal of punk kind of meant to me. You've said in the past that the Berlin stuff that you saw first was the exact opposite of that. It was very political. It was also very refreshing. Not necessarily political, but sort of group-like. Tempo, for example, were really so political, but it just seemed to be, you know, I'm not talking about Nina Hagen or anything like this, because this came later, but the idea of, say, for example, Mania Dei, I saw Mania Dei, which is the Forerunner to Malaria, the band of Beata Bertel and Bettina Christa and Gudrun Gutt, and I saw them play at the Arsenal, and it just was like... You know, they can't play their instruments at all, you know, they were just making it up as they went along. But it just seemed so different to what I'd encountered in England, whereby everyone was trying to make a hit record. Regardless, you know, like punk had suddenly, people had been able to smell the money somehow, you know, that there was money to be made and there was a way out of their misery somehow. And so everyone kind of strived towards having a hit record. I thought that kind of watered it down. You know, the idea of Boredom, the Spiral Scratch EP by the Buzzcocks, was just an expression of frustration and it just kind of really hit me, you know. and I could completely understand this record. It was like that just shot you in your face, you know, it's like wow. That was kind of watered down much later, a couple of years later, by this like striving towards having a hit record. You know, you had bands like The Police, you know, who were jumping onto the punk rock bandwagon, who had nothing to do with punk rock at all really. I mean, you know, they were just a blank rock band really. And I saw it going that way and I just didn't like that. I didn't like the idea of that. There were other bands, obviously, who were looking to, like, for example, Joy Division, or before there were Joy Division, even worse. I could see that that was something a little bit more interesting, but it was one in hundreds of thousands of... Did you know much about the music scene in Berlin? Did you know any bands? Not per se. I mean, I was interested in the German music, actually, rather than just one particular area. It wasn't just Berlin. It was more pan-Germanic, really. I'd followed various things from the early 70s. and so and so and so it was it was like i was aware of what was happening in germany and um and i made great efforts to find out as much as i possibly could you know i'm like as many as many things i could you know from from being like a a teenager you know i follow things like klaus schultz and cosmic jokers and things like this really strange bizarre rock bands you know and i just and i just I was more interested in electronic music simply for the fact that I was obsessed by synthesizers that seemed to be so out of reach and so experimental somehow and everybody seemed to hate them and it was like, you know, this is a very interesting instrument that's not been really... You can do all these kind of sounds with it that you couldn't do with the guitar or with the... normal keyboard you know and it was like just it just interested me and i just i just saw that most of this sort of synthesizer kind of music came more from germany than from the uk like bands in the uk or america whatever they had a synthesizer but it was like an embellishment rather than being like a feature of of the music and um - You mentioned malaria. Was that a group that you first came across when you got here? - No, they didn't exist when I first came here. They formed in the early '80s. or late 70s, early 80s, I think it was 80 or something like that they formed. Did you find the synthesizer music that you thought Germany was so well known for? Well, I discovered something else being here. You know, I mean, I'd... You know, the Tangerine Dreams and the Klaus Schulzes and the Michael Gotters of the world, you know, they were like, they were there, you know, craft work, obviously, you know, that was also very, very mind-blowing because it was something completely different altogether. That was really kind of like a kick up the arse, actually, for everyone. I found that really intriguing and I came to Germany with this expectation, I suppose, of seeing all these synthesizer bands and discovered someone like Marnie and Dee and Malaria later on, who, you know, they're in mania there weren't any synthesizers you know it was just drums and bass and uh and vocals and then we had to have like a ms-20 cog and it was like making just kind of noises a bit like brian eno was in roxy music and um and i discovered another band called p1e who were trying to be like a more they were trying to be like a British pop band like Human League or something like this you know they were kind of intrigued by that that's all we had in England things like human so so I found them and that was Alex Hacker and Michelle Scheumer And they were really nice people. We met in a club and I was introduced to them by somebody and it was just like a different scene altogether. It was just a different mentality towards, you know, like we're not making this music to have a commercial hit success or anything. We're just making this music because we're enjoying ourselves and trying to express something, you know. At the time though, you... had come over to Germany to do some commercial things. You were working for Factory Records. Well, yeah. Not that you, I don't think you came over because of that. No, I didn't come over because of that. When you were there, it was obvious to them. When I landed here, it was like Tony's idea was like brilliant. It looks great on paper, you know. Manchester. The German office. Yeah. Well, he only told me this like years and years later that this is what, this is the reason why he said, should be our Berlin, our representative in Berlin. And the idea was to promote really Joy Division really because we were mates, you know, it was like, I thought, you know, Rob Gretton had known for years and it was like. here's the opportunity to promote my the best band in Manchester you know to the Germans I thought they'd probably like this kind of sound you know it's a bit gloomy especially here in Berlin which was very clean at the time and it failed really visibly because people were interested at all in what was that's just another bloody rock band miserable bunch of bastards you know Can you please play it on the radio show? No way. Can you only play, you know, Bella Mie? What the fuck's this? Sad Cafe, you know. It was very disheartening to find that I could only find really like two or three people who actually understood the kind of music that I was trying to promote. And I really only had one group, you know. Something like, in fact, we released an EP with Vinnie Riley and Dorothy Colum and Cabaret Voltaire and it just went over people's heads. It was like they had no idea what this was, you know. And as Draw Division were a bit more prolific and a few singles and then an album, it was like I had something to sort of promote, but it wasn't really like people were grabbing out of my hands and far from it. It was like people weren't really interested at all. So I was fighting this constant battle trying to get people to be interested in this music. And then Ian killed himself and suddenly everybody was really interested in it. And I'm like, are you bastards? Six months ago you were telling me to fuck off and now here you are telling me that this is the best band in the world. I was very jaded by that. With New Order was it easier because they had synthesizers? Yeah, well that's... They had a history. Things had evolved and it was a much easier sell. But then after a while, because I'd started playing in my own band and I was more involved with Malaria, doing their sound and being their co-manager and being their support act. And I just thought this is like taking up too much of my time and I could see as New Order were developing as a... as a big band really, you know, I was unable to handle that as a one kind of room business, you know, just as a promoter. And I thought they needed more than just me, you know, they needed to have like a proper distributor in Germany because all the records were just available and import. It was like they need a proper distributor, they need to get out of this kind of like little niche. And so I took steps to find somebody who would be able to handle that and managed to secure them. a deal with Rough Trade as a distributor and then they took over the promotion obviously because they were doing everything for them. And it was literally like just before, you know, as they were making Power Corruption and Lies, I was in London for this session, you know, watching attempts at making Blue Monday and it was like, oh, I've never been there. and there was a lot of acid involved, I can remember that. Out of their heads, all acid. And over the years, I'd kind of tried to inspire Bernard to take a different direction, because after the first album, when the first album came out, it was still this kind of movement, it was still very gloomy, dark. kind of sounding thing and I thought you know you need to you need to have a little bit of energy in there somewhere different a different going different direction as I was like really into this kind of like electronic disco music I was suddenly appearing you know what we later became high energy Did you introduce him to Maroon and Per and stuff like that? Well, I knew that Bernard had always been interested in synthesizers. And that was one of the kind of things that we got on together. He actually built his own synthesizer, which he gave to me years later, which I still have. It's a synthesizer that they had in Joy Division. And this was a hand-built, it was made from a kit, got it in a plastic bag. and it was all these bits and you had to spend like 10,000 hours kind of like soldering every little bit to every wire to every electrode or whatever. And Bernard made this synthesizer. It was a monophonic synthesizer. This is the thing that you hear on all the early Joy Division records. So Bernard was into the synthesizer thing and I was like... you know discovered that there was a few other things in the synthesizer world that were available here that you couldn't get in england like bubble view records and god knows what And I got him a copy of, I think it was EMC squared by Giorgio Moroder. And I was like, this record's just come out in Germany. It's like digital record. It's brilliant. Sent him a copy of this. And then I just constantly like made him cassettes of all the music that I was discovering here. The things that I heard in, say the Metropole as a discotheque. Although I did hear later that there was like. in heaven but started to make like headways in this direction to play this kind of music but I mean living in Manchester you don't get to go to heaven every weekend you know and as I was in Berlin in the Metropole every weekend absorbing all this stuff I'm like listening to it in the club, writing down, the guy who was doing the DJ and his name was Chris, he had a record shop on the Koo first and I'm in the Koo down career and I was like, I'd write down every single record that he played and then just went to his shop on Monday morning and just went, I want all these records that he played and then copied them onto cassette and sent them to Bernard and he was like, you know, and that's copying things like film music and stuff like this And just all this kind of like bombardment of other things and trying to like say, this is the kind of direction he should be going. This is his future. And it wasn't until he came to Berlin and I said, come on, let's go down to the Metropole. And I dragged him down to the Metropole. That was when the eyes opened. That's when he, not only could he hear what I'd been giving him. You could see it in a club, you know. You could feel it in a club. It was that fucking loud, massive sound, you know. And then suddenly it was like, oh, I get you. And then he goes back home and suddenly you get Blue Monday. It's such a different aspect. You have all these people who went to New York to see the clubs there around then. a little bit later and yeah if they come back they're like oh now i understand how these records are working sure sure i mean i went to i went you know when i played in new york in 84. i mean one of the incentives to go to new york and play new york wasn't actually to do the gig of the dance interior at all it was to go to paradise garage and see larry leaving dj And in the hope that I might meet Francois Cavalkian, who was my all-time hero, you know, I was like, I've got to go to New York and do this gig. Even though I wasn't really so excited about going to New York to do the actual gig, I was more excited to go to New York to go to this club. And that's exactly what we did. You know, we did the gig and then we went to that. paradise garage and it was like mind-blowing experience in conjunction with this you were having this kind of very interesting um connection with the east part of berlin yeah i feel like um the story of you finding out about the east um I read in an interview and I just want you to kind of retell it. Have you seen this guy on the train? Yeah. I found it so fascinating. I was fascinated by it. So I went, I went like literally every day to East Berlin for the first couple of weeks that I was there here. And, uh, and then one day I just saw this kid on the, on the train, you know, and I was like, Oh God, he's like, a little bit different to everybody that I'd seen around, you know, like everyone that you'd see around was like dressed in Wrangler jeans and jeans jackets, jeans, suede shoes, suede booties, you know, they all had that longish hair and kind of like three days growth. And I saw this kid and he looked a little bit different, you know, he had like slightly spiky hair and slightly drainpipe-y jeans and it was like, this is a kid who doesn't adhere to the conform, who doesn't conform to the rest of the society. I can see this right off, he like stood out like a sore thumb, you know. And he got off the train and I thought, fuck, I've got one opportunity to ask somebody if there's anything else happening here other than kind of like dreary rock music. And I just tapped him on the shoulder and said, excuse me, can I ask you a few questions? He looked at me like petrified. I said, you know, I'm looking for like the music, sort of alternative music scene here. I actually said to him, I'm looking for the underground scene, you know, which I found out later. meant something else and the alarm bells kind of rang elsewhere. He didn't really fully understand I don't think but I tried to explain to him I'm looking for this music scene here that's not like pop music or anything it's also you know punk rock and stuff. And he went, no, there's nothing happening. So any gigs? Any gigs happening? And he's like, no way. He's like, there's nothing happening here. Well, you know, the way you look. It's like, oh, I'm interested in what's going on. And I'll see it on the TV and watch German TV, West Berlin TV. He didn't really elaborate on very many things. He just kind of like. touched on the surface basically that he was interested in the sound he heard the music on the radio but there was nothing happening in East Berlin and I said well if you hear anything here's my address you know just drop me a postcard I knew he couldn't phone to West Berlin and I didn't hear anything for like So like eight months. And then one day I get this letter from this girl. And I'm like, she says, you know, like, this guy passed me your contact and said that you're looking if anything's going on and I'd like to meet you. And I'll meet you in the Palais de Republic in the cocktail bar there on this day. Can you come over, you know? And so I did, I went over and met this girl in the round cocktail bar in the Palace of the Republic. We sat there chatting and then really she was just like vetting me really, you know, for her friends, circle of friends, they wanted to find out what I was about. And I think also the actual... that I came from the West and that I might be able to bring them music of some kind. I think that was also quite interesting for them as well. But English, you didn't really meet English people in East Berlin. You saw English soldiers, you know, like British soldiers walking around with like huge teddies and stuff, you know, but you never actually got to meet anybody from the West, sort of like real West, like, you know. West Germans you could see West Berliners maybe but you know it wasn't the same as meeting an English person and there wasn't very many of them in West Berlin at the time and so I think they really just wanted to find out a little bit more about me and what I was about you know and explain what I was doing and things just kind of went from there I just met their circle of friends. What was going on? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing at all. It was like groups of kids meeting at people's houses, listening to cassettes of music that they'd recorded off West Berlin radio. John Peel. And John Peel, yeah. Well, John Peel was on. as well you know but like the few radio shows that they had in in West Berlin you know that are played like Peter Katsuna play some music or whatever they'd record that or whatever and all these like Barry Graves and I can't remember all the names of the actual DJs the people who root for like Rias and SFB you know kind of oldish, rocky kind of guys. They'd play all kinds of stuff, you know, but they were just like, they'd record as much as they possibly could off West Berlin radio. And then, you know, they'd tape all the programs in the hope that one DJ might possibly play a Cure record, you know. And they'd tape them, they'd go through loads of all these cassettes of like Spliff Radio Show and Joyrider and all this crap. you know, PVC and stuff. And then suddenly, you know, get one like Sisters of Mercy or something, you know, something. Three and a half minutes. Oh, finally. Oh, somebody played something finally. And they could compile these cassettes, you know. And so it's like, oh, there's a real passion for this. They're really, really passionate about their music. All I could do is just help them as much as I possibly could and take stuff in as much as I could. Obviously, you can't take in loads of records because every time you go to the border, they'd be saying, where are you going with that? So it meant that you had to smuggle stuff in as best you could. I'd sit there and record. What was your best way of smuggling things? I'll tell you that. That would be telling. But, you know, I'd sellotape, you know, stick cassettes to myself. In the hope that they'd only take... Usually when they search you, they'd only search your pockets, your trousers and your jacket. If they search you, they'd make you take your jacket off and search it. Very, very rarely would they give you a full-body sort of hand-on search. Absolutely... Virtually never. So it meant that... you had the opportunity to be able to smuggle stuff in on your body rather than you know in your shoes or something because you need to take your shoes off. I had unfortunately once had this really unfortunate accident. I was living in Schöneberg in what was going to be a house that was going to be torn down and I'd met these people and they said there's a beautiful apartment upstairs on the fifth floor. and the house is condemned to be torn down, and we can let you stay there. We've got the key, and you can stay there until we have to leave, and we can give you a supply of electricity, even if you don't have enough supply of electricity. I thought it was quite attractive, you know, prospect, because I didn't have an apartment at that point on my own. And I lived there for quite a while, and it was gorgeous, you know, marble bath. room and everything and I lost my key and so these guys gave me this Dietrich as it's called in German it's like a skeleton key for getting all these old buildings and I went to East Berlin And there was one border guard on Checkpoint Charlie who was a real bastard. He was a real, you know, stickler for like, you know, I don't like your face, I'm going to search you. You ran into him multiple times. Oh, many times. And he knew, I think he suspected something because I've been going over like every day for a week, you know, and I think, you know, like. He'd see me then, I think, every day. And consequently, going over to Checkpoint Charlie, he'd see me quite often. And I'd try and avoid him by trying to work out the shifts that he was doing, you know, like, I don't want to meet this guy. Because he always searched me, always wanted to know what was going on. And he found this skeleton cave in a pocket, and he was like, right, in this room, you know, in this room. And unfortunately, I had sellotape to my leg on the inside of my leg I had like all these photographs that I'd taken in Prague and I thought oh dear this is really bad news because I knew this guy was going to go right to the bone so to speak And he did, surely he did. He was like, right, you know, get in this room. And he got his superiors and they came over and they were looking at McKee and they were like, right, you've come in to break into people's flats in Eastborough. What do you think I'm going to be stealing? You know, like some 25-year-old technology telly or something, you know. crazy. I tried to explain to them that I'd lost my key at home and they were having none of it. So it's like, right, get your clothes off, you know, start to systematically go through all my clothes. And I'm thinking to myself, like, oh God, you know, I've got to take my trousers off and I've got these photographs stuck to my leg. What am I going to do? I'm not going to look good. You know, I could see myself on this train going to Siberia at this point. You know, I was like, how do I explain this to my mother? And suddenly, like, you know, I get my trousers off and see these photographs stuck to my leg. And it was like alarm bells. everything you know some call some other general or something some bloke comes in he's got this big guy comes in there with loads of gold on his shoulders and it's like this is a very serious matter you know and they're trying to look at who are these people in these photographs all my dissident friends in prague you know good god what we're doing i'm like oh dear and uh Kind of like talked myself out of it. Talked them out of it. Told them, you know, it's like just nothing. Why have you got them stuck to your leg? I said, well, you wouldn't let me bring them in anyway. If I tried to bring them in normally, you'd have taken them off me. You're going to take them off me anyway, you know. So how in the world do you throw a rock show in East Berlin then? Oh, well, that was years of like kind of And this girl, she, you know, being kind of like connected with a small group of like punks, you know, like most people don't understand that punk rock officially didn't exist in the DDR. And the reason why punk rock didn't exist in the DDR officially was the fact that punk rock, in the eyes of the East German authorities, was a sort of throwback of unemployment. The failure of the capitalist society, you know, like the failure of the capitalist society to provide. Nobody's unemployed here, so why would we have punk rock? East Germany doesn't have unemployment, you know. So if we don't have unemployment, we don't have punk rock. because we don't have this throat. So anyone who looked like a punk immediately was taken away from the scene. Punks weren't allowed to walk across Alexanderplatz because Alexanderplatz being this kind of showcase meant obviously people could see there's a punk in East Berlin. Oh God, take him away. So punks had... Alexander Platts for butt. They could, you know, if they had like a spiky armband on or something or a dog collar or something like this, you know, they were taken away. What I found ironic later on was like, you know, secretaries and women kind of working in kind of like administration or whatever, they could dress up looking like Nina, you know, with red hair and looking kind of like bizarre, horrible makeup on. you know they weren't classed as being punk it was classed as being new wave you know but like if someone wore a dog collar you were like you were doomed you know um so so so you yeah you know under this context of this this idea that punk rock doesn't exist it was like how do i get croc band from the west into east berlin to play this gig now The whole, I discovered through somebody else who had no connection actually to these people that there was such a thing as a blues, was known as a blues messer. I'd met this hippie actually who told me this. He told me about this blues messer, that this blues messer existed and it was like, oh, that's interesting. I wonder if my friends could find a little bit more, get a bit more information about this. blues mess and find out a bit more about it so they went and found out as much as they could about this blues mess which was like a mass in this church church You know, the church being a thorn in the side of these German authorities, you know, it's seen as being this kind of outlet. It was like, you know, Christianity and stuff was a bit kind of looked down upon in Eastern Europe in general. The only religion was communism, you know, so it was like Christianity was a bit... But with Germany having this Christian tradition, it was very difficult to erase it all from the society. It was tolerated, but they knew that it was an outlet for, like, silent opposition to the regime. If you were a Christian, it was kind of, you were, like, opposing the state, really, you know, if you were, like, overtly Christian. But it was tolerated nonetheless, you know, and he had this, like, blues message, which meant that someone could sit in the church and play a few songs, you know. where he would normally not be able to play in front of an audience because in East Germany, you couldn't just go to a shop and buy a guitar and an amplifier and then suddenly go to a youth club and kind of like strum it out, you know, your frustrations about how you hated the society you were living in. That wasn't possible. You had to go through a process of like... being vetted by men in brown suits who would evaluate your proficiency as a musician. Can you play? What are your lyrics about? Are they anti-state? And all these things. And then they'd give you a performance certificate that gave you the... means to be able to perform in front of an audience, whether it be a youth club or, you know, you're not on stage yet, you know, you're just playing on the floor of a youth club. And the Blues of Mass kind of like gave people the opportunity to be able to play outside of those rules, you know. And it was like, oh, that's interesting. I wonder, I wonder. You can ask the priest if it would be possible. to do something. And obviously being kind of anti-state, he was like, possibly, could possibly happen, you know. What is it? And we just said, we'll just bring some guys over from the West and they'll play this, we'll invite 100 people and that's it. It'll be very closed, very secret, no one will know, only this small group of people will have this little gig. And the question was like, okay, how are we going to do this? We can't bring any instruments in. So it means that these kids are going to have to ask around and find out who can supply a guitar, a bass, an amplifier. I mean, this stuff must have been terribly hard to get a hold of. Yeah, because you couldn't just go into a shop and buy an electric guitar. Although there were shops selling electric guitars. you know, later, later in the later 80s, it was a little easier, but like in the early, like early 80s, it was impossible. You can just go into a shop and just get a guitar. You know, you have to have like this proficiency certificate that showed that you are allowed to buy an electric guitar and a cable and an amplifier. you know but then oh sorry you know we haven't got any strings for your guitar they're coming in the next five year plan you know fantastic get your granny to go to West Berlin and buy some You know, this was all very difficult, finding people who could supply us with instruments, drums and microphones, virtually impossible to find, you know. And through, you know, like, various bands who'd, like, bought things second-hand. And, you know, there's like the guys who eventually became Rammstein, you know, they had a few instruments and they let us have some of their instruments for this event. And we put on this little... little gig, you know, in this church on Sunday evening. And it was like... I can't imagine... It was so bizarre. Someone didn't hear it from the outside. Well, probably they did, you know. I mean, you know, it didn't really matter. It was a blues messer, you know. it was a blues mass they had they had you know this hippie would go there with his Stratocaster imitation and play you know like like Hey Joe or whatever you know to an audience of people who wanted to hear that kind of music you know I don't think people were really, really that aware of what was actually going on, you know. Certainly, we were infiltrated, obviously, you know, the friends who had been invited, amongst these friends, there were like two people who were working for the, as inofficiale Mitarbeit, you know, inofficial members of the Stasi. Both of them probably didn't even know the other one was in the Stasi themselves. You know, they didn't know who was who was who, you know. And they took photos and made reports and... Members of the Stasi were there. Yeah. Inofficial, unofficial. Well, you know, the kids who were there, you know, they were infiltrated by... I mean, it's quite difficult to imagine, you know, like you do some, yeah, you're a young wannabe punk and you make a mistake in your life by maybe walking across Alexanderplatz with a dog collar on and like makeup and spiky hair and suddenly the police come and arrest you and take you to the police station and decide, you know. You've committed some horrible, heinous crime of some kind, you know. You can go to Siberia or you can take pictures of the smoke rock. You can tell us from time to time what your friends are doing. And here's a great opportunity suddenly. Oh, God, you know, these people are organizing this gig. West Berlin band, you know. This is going to help me no end. Obviously, you know, people kind of like are put into that position. And I don't say, you know, that's terrible or whatever. It's understandable. You know, I don't hate these people for doing this. It's like... because you've seen your file. Yeah, of course, yeah. How did that come about? How did you get it? Well, I applied. I applied after I'd been invited by the Bundesnachrichtendienst for an interview about my file. What... What was the most surprising thing you found in there? There's quite a lot of surprising things. There wasn't just one surprising thing. The fact that the KGB were really on my case was quite surprising because I didn't really think that they would be. If anyone was interested, it was the East Germans. But the KGB were really, really on my case. And I didn't realise that, actually, until I read my file, that the KGB were kind of like, who is this guy and who is he working for and what's his job? Because they considered me as a really heavily subversive element that was, like, trying to corrupt the minds and the youth of East Germany, which I was. But... And they were very correct. But, you know, they thought that I had some kind of like a mission of some kind, you know, that I was working for somebody. And what I found quite interesting is that they'd obviously... asked their contacts in London to find out about me because they thought I was working for the British Secret Service. And I was like, oh, they've obviously got somebody in England and probably that person may still be there working for them. I thought that was quite interesting to discover this. There were no names or anything mentioned, but it was just obvious that they'd asked. around and discovered that this is like, hey, I'm not working for the British Secret Service. And all the questions came about, you know, I've been going over quite a lot with a US Army personnel and they're like, obviously, it was like, if he's not working for the British, then he must be working for the Americans. What is this? I mean, But then on the other hand, I'm being asked by the Bundesnachrichtendienst to come in to talk about my connections to the Czech people that I know who were all involved in the dissident movement of the Czech Republic, Czechoslovakia. Charter 77. One of my best friends was the press spokesman for Charter 77. Were you that political? I mean, like actively? I'm very political, but in my own way, you know. Because I think it just... I don't adhere to any particular party or any particular ideology. I think it naturally follows that you would be friends with guys from the dissident movement, but not necessarily be... actively like supporting them well I was supported them in a different way you know I mean I knew that their drive was freedom of speech and freedom of thought and freedom to choose and I was able to kind of like bring them as much as possible that bit of freedom you know bring them records music whatever because because because their their driving force believe it or not was that It was like they wanted to hear music from the West, the music that they liked, the music that they'd heard on John Peel, you know, shortwave radio, listening to John Peel's radio programme, in the middle of Czechoslovakia. They'd heard this music and it was fascinating and they wanted to have that. They wanted to be able to buy that. freely listen to that on their own radio shows or whatever, you know, it's like just to have that choice to be able to have it. And I brought them that. And I guess I just, I'm saying it from the perspective of that is a political act in some way. Of course it is. At the same time, it's not what many people would say is a political in quotes. act? Yeah, of course not. I mean, you know, it's not like I'm not going on some kind of barricade or anything and proclaiming something. I'm doing something for my friends, you know, to make their lives a little bit more tolerable, I suppose. And at the same time, the actual act of taking this stuff in, bringing it to East Berlin, smuggling it to Czechoslovakia or whatever. And it was important for me because I thought I was doing something good for these people. And I thought that they only want to hear the cure or something or enjoy the vision or whatever. That's all they want to do, really. But because they can't do it, they have to be in a political movement to be able to force that change. And it was like, how do I help them in that way? You know, I played in Czechoslovakia, a secret gig in this barn and it's like in this little kind of what used to be a hotel, if you like, or what do you call it? Like a transit on the road that led from Dresden to Prague, the old road before they built the motorway. There was these kind of like little stop-offs you could stay in. And one of these places was this like in the middle of nowhere. And my friends, they had this party there. It was kind of disguised as a wedding reception. And we had this like... We played a gig and all I could take was a cassette. I had to rely on them providing a cassette because I couldn't take a drum machine with me and sequences and stuff. I could only take it all on a cassette and play it as a backing tape. And they brought the guitars. Same thing, same difficulty in getting instruments as the East Berliners did. it's like finding these instruments but they brought them to this place and and we played this gig in this barn for all these kids you know and it was like it felt so different playing a gig you know you get you get a gig in the West and it was a gig it was just come something completely normal I don't know it was significant but it wasn't really so like mind-blowing I used to do a gig in front of all these cakes who gave kids who were starving or something that wasn't state served on a plate, you know. It brought tears to your eyes, you know. It was like, it was a really different feeling, you know, playing in a place like that. I never actually got to play in East Berlin. I never strived to actually play in East Berlin for some reason. I don't know why. Now I kind of regret that we never did. But, you know, I played in Budapest and played in Prague, you know, all Czechs like you. What happens when the wall falls down? Well, I wasn't even here. I'd gone to... I was actually in Poland. I'd just decided that... I'd been making this album in East Berlin for the state-owned record label Amiga by this... band called division just before we go into that the fact that the east german label was that a sign that they were already loosening up to a amazing degree? Possibly, yeah, possibly. I mean, I'd seen this happening around the late 80s, like 87, 88. You could see things kind of like getting a little bit... You know, we had the 750th anniversary of Berlin and it was like after that, things started to become a little bit more relaxed. Maybe because the West German government gave the East Germans a couple of million marks or whatever. I've no idea. But things started to get a little bit easier. Not that easy, but you could sense things were a little bit more relaxed. And this band... being they were singing in English because the singer was studying English in the university Humboldt University so they were singing English which was quite unusual for an East German group because you're not really allowed to sing in English they kind of wanted to be the East German joy division and so they asked me if I would produce their record you know and I thought, you know, the fact that they're following in the youth club scene of East Germany was growing. This image of this band was getting bigger and bigger. The authorities were either in this dilemma, you know, do we ban them? Or do we give them a record contract? If we ban them, then they're uncontrollable. We can ban them and they'll still do what they do and we can't control it. And their status will grow probably even bigger and that's it. If we give them a record contract, we can control what they do and we can manipulate them. So that was their decision. It's like, okay. The band wanted to do some kind of like joint venture, I think, somehow. So they had this idea that they would get me to produce this record because I'd known the band's joint event and the new order. So something might rub off. And I think also later on, I think that they also, I came to the conclusion that the Stasi wanted to see if I could actually do this job, you know. If you claim to be a producer, then you've got to produce this record. Okay, all right. So I end up going to the Brunnenstrasse. Finally you can clear your name. Yeah, finally. I get to go to the Brunnenstrasse recording studios, which was like literally on the wall, you know, like the end of the Brunnenstrasse was the Berlin Wall and there was this like old cinema, which was the Brunnenstrasse tone studios, which was like... The East German equivalent of Hansa Studios is where everybody of any name, rank, played, you know, made their albums. All these groups like Silly and City and Karad, they all made their albums in this studio. And here's this little group, Division, who had no idea about making a record. They'd never been in a studio before. the studios they'd been to to record like demo cassettes for the radio or whatever it was like making an album was a completely different thing and it was like oops yeah this studio was like nothing else you'd seen in your life before it was like self-made frankenstein's monster of a mixing desk which was humongous huge thing you know what had no relation to a westernized music like a mixing desk at all you know they'd made this from from themselves i know it's like this is fascinating this is really this is technology you know it's like completely bizarre And I thought, okay, I've got to make this LP here. I'll try my best, you know, with what I have here. And I realized it was, they had all this stuff, you know, like they had fantastic microphones. They had a Fender Stratocaster from 1966. They had a Mellotron. They had a Steinway Grand Piano. oh, this is bizarre, you know, all this, like, really expensive and really high-tech stuff, you know, like, this Mellotron, where did you get this from? You know, there's no studio in the West that you find a Mellotron in, it's worth a fortune. Oh, yeah, we've had this since 1966, you know, we bought it in a five-year plan. Right. And it was just like, literally the studio had like a switch on the wall, which like in Frankenstein, you know, like a power switch that you turned on and all the power would go on. And I had to work in shifts initially when I first started. They made me work in shifts. They said, you know, I said, I'll work. I want to have six weeks to make this LP. And they were like, no, you can't do that. It's communism. You have to work in shifts. You can work from eight o'clock in the morning until one o'clock, eight o'clock in the morning to make this LP. Who's going to get up at eight o'clock in the morning? I've got to get up at six or seven o'clock in the morning to come to the studio to do an LP. Who does that? not in the rock world doesn't exist but this is what they wanted me to do and so for the first like three weeks or something like this i kind of like struggled through these shifts you know going in this is impossible i mean i discovered that everybody in this studio before me there were some people who wanted to make folks music you know this kind of music and then there'd be someone else who wanted to do this classical kind of aria or something you know And I discovered these guys, they all really wanted to do the early shift so they could go home and have the rest of the afternoon off and the evening off. And so I kind of systematically went through everybody's schedules and kind of went over and said, hey, do you want to swap your late shift for my early shift? And they were all really eager to do this. And so I eventually was able to swap everybody's shifts. and work in the late afternoons and evenings. And all around me, you know, this is what we're talking about, like, middle of, like, 1989 now, you know. The Hungarians are taking down their border and everyone starts to disappear. People are disappearing and turning up in the West. Everyone in the studio is talking about this. Or somebody's mate's just gone to Austria. And this feeling kind of like was filtering through all the time. I'm trying to be as neutral as I possibly can because I can come and go as I please. I had a work permit. I could stay in East Berlin. I could go to West Berlin, which I did. I'd go once a week, go over, do my washing, come back, buy, bring some food or whatever. I could do all these things. And all around me, these people are kind of losing their... friends and their relatives and you know they're all disappearing it's like this drain of like friends and relatives and it obviously colored the kind of atmosphere in the studio you know people what is the the the guy who sat at the main desk would be what was sitting there with his feet up you know he'd make cups of coffee whatever for everybody at zack's cafe but he'd be sitting there watching west german television you know watching all these kind of events unfolding as it was kind of like a day-to-day kind of like things happening and it and that really colored this making this album and it's hard to make a gloomy album joy division-esque album well i tried not to i tried not to make it too gloomy although you know us but we you know with a friend of mine dave rimmer who's a writer the singer had kind of like gone we'd gone through the lyrics now the lyrics for the lp had initially been vetted by the amiga and everything was okay it was all calm it was an english ease this lp yeah It was bollocks. And it was like, this is impossible to sing any of this. It's like, you want to make a statement, but you're trying to make it a bit ambiguous, but it sounds like rubbish. So my friend Dave, because I've sat there with Gaia, and we sat there with a singer, and we kind of like tried. to get the lyrics so that they were somehow singable but also had some kind of meaning and we changed a lot of the meanings in the lyrics you know as we went along kind of made them a bit ambiguous or double meanings and things And tried to put in like secret messages in the vocals, knowing that the people, they wouldn't realise what was going on anyway. And as they'd already been vetted, I thought they're not going to go through it twice. You know, they don't know what we're doing actually. And we just went through this process of like making this album. Fortunately, I think after a third day, the drummer left. So it meant I had to, like, first of all, get a drum machine and smuggle that in. So I got my US Army mates to smuggle me a drum machine into East Germany. And we went through the process of trying to make this LP, and it dragged out for months and months and months, you know. And I'd already planned prior to making this LP that I was going to go in November. my friend Dave and this other guy Trevor Wilson and a friend of his we were going to go to Poland Czechoslovakia Hungary and Romania on a sort of like a tour And we got all the appropriate visas and everything in advance. And I thought, well, I'll just make this album. When I finish making this album, I'll have a break before producing the final mix down and have a couple of weeks break and go to Eastern Europe. So I finished this, making this, recording the actual album, this division. recorded it finished that on the 2nd of November 1989 and then on the night of the 8th of November we went on our holiday to Poland to Krakow the 9th of November was in Auschwitz actually And then, you know, we travelled down through Czechoslovakia and everything was really weird and really tense and no one was talking to us and it was like... We stayed in the Tatra Mountains, you know, very beautiful scenery and no one talked to us at all and no one had any information or anything and it was like, this is really strange and we were the only people in this hotel. Everything was completely empty. It was winter, out of season. It was really like the Overlook, honestly. This place looked like the Overlook. And it was, you know, the few people who were there just kind of stood around, like, waiting for us to finish our meals and our Esatz meal. And we travelled down then through Hungary. We got down to the Tokaj, you know, like, going on the way to Romania. And suddenly, you know, we decided to stop at this kind of, like, roadside, like, hotel restaurant for lunch. I just had to decide that I'm so starving for information. You know, what's happening in Berlin? You know, things have been going on there, you know. I have to find out what's going on. And I went to the front desk and asked him if he had any newspapers, any current newspapers. And he went, no, I don't. I've only had old newspapers from like a week ago or whatever. He gave me this newspaper and on the front cover was a picture of this guy drinking a bottle of champagne Ostdeutsche Truppen begin Teilhaberister Mauer. And I'm like, what Mauer? What's this? This is bizarre. This is some kind of like Hungarian private eye, like satire newspaper or something. Reading through this and I'm like, oh my God, they're taking away. They've taken away the Berlin Wall. I don't believe it. It's like it's over. And I went to Dave and Trevor and John, they're sitting there in the soup and they're like, you're not going to believe this. And they were like, well, we're not going to believe. And I just read out the newspaper to them. We're in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of Hungary, and this has happened. And we were like... No one said anything to us at all the entire time we were there. No one said, hey, have you heard about the Berlin Wall coming down? There's like no information whatsoever. And we found this out like 10 days later. We immediately went to our, like, stopped at some little, like, pension somewhere in the middle of nowhere and asked this woman if we could come and watch the television. And the news, you know, there was obviously going to be something about it on the news. And there was nothing on the Hungarian news at all. You know, we sat there watching, like, two hours of pig farming. It was like, is there anything happening? And, you know, she got... Oh, Berlin Wall? That was two weeks ago. Forget about it. It's happened. It's over now. And so we went off to Ceausescu's Romania and kind of experienced full-blown Ceausescu's Romania in the throes of life. clamping down on any kind of western influences or any information or whatever you know I think they were quite happy to find out that we didn't really know what was going on you know but with the security were like on our like literally everywhere we went you know they were watching us as we drove past every single village someone came out in the blizzards and horrible weather and to watch us drive past so they could say we're on the road and we're going there. We'd go in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of a forest. Suddenly a police car would just suddenly be stuck in the middle of the road, you know, like stopping us, like get your papers out. You know, it was very bizarre, very bizarre. And then in the middle of like, you know. On our way to Bucharest, we were in Brasov and they were celebrating the first anniversary. They weren't celebrating anything actually. The place was clamped down. There weren't any people on the street apart from policemen. because this was like two years prior to this. They'd thrown the local party boss out of the window and they were trying to have some kind of revolution which had been put down. So there was no normal human being on the street. All you could see was cops everywhere and just some kind of gay meeting. Groups of three guys walking around. And then the security guy comes over and goes, oh, you know, by the way, you know, like tomorrow they're closing the border at five o'clock. And anybody who's in the country stays in the country. It's like, ugh, all right. No, there's no motorways in Romania. You know, you can't drive at like 200 miles an hour to get to the border. You know, it's like, you're lucky. If you can go 80 kilometres an hour anywhere, it was like the roads were built for horse and carts, you know, clip-clop, clip-clop. If anyone's ever seen that film Borat, the opening sequence where you see him driving off to America in a kind of like a car shell driven by horse and cart, that was what it was like in Romania. exactly like that so the roads were built like this like mud tracks you know so you couldn't drive very fast it meant that we had to literally travel like 24 hours you know as fast as possible to get to the border before they closed at five o'clock so we set off immediately and drove through the night and through the day and you know it was like very bizarre And we came back to Berlin and, you know, we actually weren't slap-banging to the middle of the Czechoslovakian revolution, the Velvet Revolution. All my mates are like, you know, suddenly like freed out of prison and they're all standing there on this balcony with Alexander Dubček, you know. I was like, what's going on here, you know. like slap bang in the middle of that. And then we come back to Berlin and nothing's the same since, you know, it's like, God, this is bizarre. So now that we've talked for almost an hour, why don't we talk about techno for a minute? Yeah. The world was never the same after that. Had you. Listen, yeah, I mean, you talked about listening to house music, Francois Kay, and all of these things. I listened to Francois Kavokian before he made house music. Yeah. You know, it was when he started, when he was doing things like Go Bang and stuff like that, you know, even before he did Kraftwerk or... You know, he made a lot of these like Disconet remixes and things like this and these very strange sort of like experimental things like Beat the Street, you know, Sharon Redd and stuff like that. It's like, this guy's amazing. And kind of following the idea of what he was doing, you know, always wanted to emulate what he was doing in some kind of way, you know. kind of inspiring i didn't want to copy him obviously but i just wanted like the idea this idea of making this kind of really trippy kind of club music was really like fascinating to me was there were there clubs in berlin west or even east when the wall fell down that were playing things that you were going to on a regular basis well the thing the thing well you know they had discotheques in East Berlin. You know, there was like the which was a gay disco. But if you went there, you'd hear things like modern talking, CC catch, things that, you know, Peter Bowlen, you know, that kind of thing. I remember that in the funny story about Bush Alley actually is like I went there with Dave Rimmer and we'd been given, Neil Tennant from the Pet Shop Boys had given us a cassette, sent us a cassette of their new album, Behaviour. And we thought, let's go to the Bush Alley and play it. It's the first presentation of this album anywhere, like in a club. and we'll go to the Bush Alley and give them the honour of being able to play this album. So we went to the Bush Alley, got in, and went to the DJ, who only played from cassettes because he didn't have any record players or anything. He played from the cassettes that he'd recorded using off the radio and cut together, you know. And we went to him and said, this is the new Pet Shop Boys album. No one's ever heard it before. This is the first time ever that heard in a club and he looks at it and he's like alright put it to one side did you understand what I said this is the new Pet Shop Boy album and he's like okay okay that's going to be the next single Domino Dancing that's going to be the next single you have to play that Eventually, after a couple of crappy songs, he eventually played the song. Dan's floor was actually full, quite full at this point. And he put this song, Domino Dancing, on. And it cleared the dance floor. Everybody left. And we were like... So he knew better. We were completely devastated. We were like, what is going on here? This is ridiculous. And then I went back to him and said, like, you know, I can't believe that people, you know, didn't realise, you know, this is the Pet Shop Boys. It's not just any old band, you know. And he hadn't actually realised at that point that it was the Pet Shop Boys until they actually, like, maybe say 10 minutes after they had talked to him about who it was and what it is. Like, he's reading the cassette box and he suddenly goes, it's the Pet Shop Boys. And then he played it again with this great speech in front of it, you know, this is the new Pet Shop Boys single, kind of like emphasis. Get on the bloody dance floor. And then they all came on. And they'd already heard it like half an hour before. And they all thought, oh, I know this song. And they all got on the dance floor. But it was so bizarre. Anyway, that besides. You know, in West Berlin, we had the UFO Club. Yeah. it really. A couple of house parties, we'd had acid house parties obviously in the late 80s and this kind of like development from the disco high energy into this acid house, house music whatever. You know I've been actively following that myself you know buying as many records as possible. um i had a a friend she was a a radio dj monica detail she played on the sfb obviously she was obviously you know higher into this music as well but like you because you couldn't get all the records i got a lot of my records from the uk i got my mom to go to record shop and buy for me and send them over so i had I'd bring them to her so she could play them in a radio show. Your mom was one of the coolest. This is something that you can't buy here, but you can hear it. So different mixes that were only available in the UK and God knows what. So you were already running your record label at that point. Yeah, well, I started the label. I founded my label in December of 1990. I finally got like the, the okay to do it from East German. I'm eager to do it because. Why did you need the okay from them? Well, I need their facilities, you know, I didn't have any money, you know, I was like, I'd made, you must imagine, I'd made this record for these people under the premise that I would, I would get paid for doing this record. And I did get paid for doing it, but. And there, as I was a kind of, not just a producer, but I also co-wrote some of the songs on the album with the band as well, as the process went along, you know, I ended up writing half the music with them anyway. I was going to get royalties for making the music and also sale music for, money for making it. the record itself as a producer, but also from the record sales, I was going to get royalties for this. And so, you know, if East Germany would have been still in existence, I'd be a millionaire probably now, you know, because even before we'd started making this LP, we were like two or three weeks into making this LP, they already had like 32,000 pre-sales. And this is like people who'd paid about one East German mark deposit on the record. Intriguing in itself. Because when the wall came down, those 32,000 pre-sales that they had suddenly became zero. You know, it's like... People who'd been eager to buy Pink Floyd and King Crimson and Deep Purple records, you know, or Sisters of Mercy and The Cure and Joy Division, God knows what. Suddenly they weren't interested in buying Divizio records. They weren't interested in buying anything from the East. In fact, they wanted to... go and buy western records with their hard currency and so the sales of this record suddenly just evaporated and they ended up that the amiga was disbanded in fact literally overnight all the all the bosses were couldn't suddenly suddenly sent on holiday permanent holiday transformation, you know, gone is the old guard, in comes the new guard. We're going to change our record label from the Amiga to Zong. horrible name you know amiga is such an established name everybody knows it why do you keep it oh no that's connected to east germany and eastern europe and all you know communism and everything i was like oh god you know so at least name it call it zony at least it'll have some kind of like ironic like twist to it being You're from the Zone and you're known as Zone Zombies anyway. And Zony being kind of like Mickey take on Sony, you know, they didn't want that either. I even designed a logo for it so they could see what it looked like. Kind of similar to Sony's logo with Z-O-N-Y, Zony. They didn't like that at all. And then I was also, you know, having made this album and they produced a handful of CDs and a couple of like maybe 2000 vinyls. That was it then. It was like a game over. And I thought, well, now you've got this freedom to do what you want. You've got this massive apparatus of a record industry of East Germany. You've got all these shops, you know, where all the shops are in East Germany. You've got great distribution within East Germany. You've got your own studio. You've got your own pressing plants. You've got your own cassette copy plant. you've got everything that you need, you know, to do, to do all these things, you know, like you've got to get the, the West German record labels, like EMI and Teldeck, as they were then, you know. CBS. They don't have these connections in East Germany. They don't know where your shops are. You have to use that. They didn't even listen to me. The first thing they did was they disbanded their distribution in East Germany. Then they sold all the microphones in the studio. They had these 9-man microphones, 20 9-man microphones. They sold those and bought new Sennheisers. And gradually I was sitting there just watching them dismantle their fantastic kind of like... That industry was being dismantled bit by bit. We don't need all our pressing plant machines anymore. We're going to sell the pressing plant bit by bit. God, what are you doing? And I thought, well, you also got the opportunity now to do other things that you weren't allowed to do before. At the moment, there's a focus on German music, this new music, which has just been happening in West Berlin in a small section of the city called Techno. It's like, this is it. This is the future. I don't know anything about that. What the hell is that? What's a 12-inch? They didn't know anything. It was all a big question mark to them. You've got a group of old men. And their head of A&R, who was quite a young guy, he was like 25 or so. He thought like a 40-year-old, you know. It was like he was into, you know, Christaburg or whatever, you know. It was like, oh, God, you know. You've got this apparatus. Why don't you use it? And then they just said to me, well, we don't know anything about this. If you know anything about it, then you do it. We'll help you. You know, you can use our facilities. I thought, great, fantastic. I'll just get all these East German kids who are all desperate to make music. I'll make an East German label for these East German kids to present themselves on without actually at that point realising that. no, East German kids don't have synthesizers, they don't have computers, they don't have Ataris, they don't have like, you know, all this equipment to make this music. They might have the ideas, but they don't have the equipment. And they're not going to get the equipment instantly because they don't have the money. So there was nobody out there providing me with any music, you know. I was like, what do I do? You know, I've got a record, suddenly I've got And I went to my friends like Paul Browse, who used to be in Clock DVA, and he was working with Johnny Kleemek, who's now a film producer, film music producer. And they were doing this project called System 01. And I said, well, you know, if you've got anything other than System 01, you know, do something else. And it was like Paul was like, yeah, we'll create our own project for your label. It was basically System 01 under a different name. effective force and it was like right i'll release this it was a bit kind of trippy and a bit dark and gloomy hypnotic somehow right what was the name of your label sorry my label was called mfs yeah what does it stand for well it still it stood for masterminded for success I like the idea, you know, that towards the end of the 80s, you saw a lot of people walking around the streets with T-shirts that said CIA on it and FBI and DEA, you know. And I thought it would be quite nice to have. to not lose the East German Secret Service letters, you know? Like, they're going to disappear into obscurity if we let them. And as on the TV, there was suddenly this procedure of, like, going through the Stasi files and, you know, finding out who's in the Stasi. The words, letters MFS kind of, like, cropped up all over the place, I thought. It would be quite nice to retain these letters. First of all, it would be provocative for the kids to be able to wear these letters and say, I'm into MFS, knowing that their parents would be shocked by this. But also, as well as retain the letters, not let them disappear. You couldn't get them to agree to Zony. I couldn't get them to agree to IFS either. I disguised it initially under the banner of masterminded for success, knowing that they wouldn't make the connection. But knowing that Germans abbreviate everything, you know, every opportunity, I thought to myself, myself. Eventually they might cut on on, but at this moment, I'm not going to talk about MFS. I'm only going to talk about my label is called Masterminded for Success. And I said to them, no man is to man. You know, that means, you know, like this is what it is, you know. And they were quite happy, you know, masterminded for success. It sounded quite quirky. They didn't know what it meant. It was English. They didn't speak English, spoke Russian. You know, I had to explain to them, you know, like it's been thought out for success kind of thing. And it's like, all right. okay, didn't really get it, you know. It's too way out there for them. It was only when I made these posters, which said, which means we're back. And I stuck these up that I got shit. It was like, this isn't the day. It got by then, it was already too late. I made these posters for our press conference. that we were going to have for the first releases, you know, and stuck them up all over the streets around the studio, the record label, you know. The label was actually, the Amiga was actually housed in what is now the Reichstagspresidentenpalais. which is the palais where the president of the Reichstag has their office. This office used to be the office of Hermann Göring and people like this. From this house, the tunnel that leads to the Reichstag where they set the Reichstag on fire in 1933. It was a very, very controversial building. And it's a very beautiful building with a marble staircase and everything, really. And in this, what was known as the Abhörraum 101, which is the listening room 101, that was mainly my office because it was the room where I had the stereo system in where you could listen to all the music, you know. And in this room, I had my press conference. And I decked it out so it looked like East Germany, you know, like with like, I had like a stylized picture of Eric Honecker and some kind of like op art kind of like design, you know, painted this picture of Eric and had all these like posters up and everything like this. And they were horrified. They were completely horrified by it. The A&R guy who thought like a 40 year old. Mathias Hoffmann. He had explained to me what I wanted to do and explained to me that it was a bit of tongue in cheek and it was made to provoke and made to cast questions. I wanted the media who were going to come to this thing. I needed them to ask questions and be horrified at what I was trying to do. And he kind of got that and he understood that. I didn't have to win him over, but the rest of the people who worked in this company were completely horrified. I actually got these guys who worked there to dress up in East German army, like in football uniforms. And I got like a stamp, you know, and I made these, I made these visas up so that then the journalists, I sent to all the journalists, their visa that meant that when they came, they had to give it up. They were like, what the? fucks this you know they came to that and they had to like give it up and then some like the east german at the bottom of the stairs had stamped their visa and they'd have to go upstairs and there'd be somebody else sitting there who would collect it and cut it in half so they had to fill it out and then it'd be stamped So I had a record of who'd actually attended, who'd actually attended the conference. And they had a memento of this wonderful event. And then they had these girls dressed in FD yacht, you know, free German youth uniforms to like hand out the records, you know. And there was quite a lot of East German press as well as West German. They were horrifying. You studied advertising. Yeah, I did. So maybe this is a vestige of that. You were working. factoring. Of course. So like all of these things, it seems like you're just learning from the best with this. Well, I was like, you know, I knew that it would be provocative, you know. I knew that I'd be shot down on one side and on the other side people thought it was funny. But the people who actually worked for the company were absolutely horrified by it. They couldn't believe that I'd actually gone through and done this. You know, it's like, what's going on here big questions of whether it should carry on and I had to virtually go to virtually everybody and explain to them that it wasn't meant to upset them and it wasn't meant to hurt them, it was meant to draw attention to what I was trying to do, you know, to like bring a bit of focus, a bit of media attention, because otherwise it would just disappear. No one would be interested. What's the point of making it if no one's interested? Because they didn't understand advertising. They had no such thing really in East Germany. The so-called advertising you saw was all state run, state controlled. And they didn't understand that you could be like... negative as well as positive. You know, it's like the understanding of advertising wasn't there. You know, you could see that in their designs and everything, the way things were presented. And I tried to explain to them that it wasn't anything bad. And consequently, you know, the label was the only part of the record label that really got any press, you know. And people at this point were questioning techno anyway as a genre of music. It was like, you know, all these jaded, like, rock journalists were like, you know, what the... fuck is this techno shit you know like it's rubbish is it gonna have is it gonna last you know it's a fad you know also what wonder if it was gonna last I didn't really think about it, actually. I didn't think that it... I thought, well, you know, I've experienced as a child a lot of different genres, you know, like I grew up as a small child with the Beatles and the 60s twang guitars, you know, went through all this kind of like hippie 70s music and, you know, rock and progressive rock and all this kind of stuff, punk rock, you know, new wave, disco. high energy, acid house, techno, and there I am, you know. And all these things that I'd kind of really only lasted relative to short periods, you know, like if you look at how long each of these trends lasted, they lasted like three, four years and then they became something else, you know, you had like twangy guitars became progressive rock music became this and letter or whatever. You know, I thought... You know, possibly techno wasn't going to last so, as such, it was going to develop into something else. That I'd be involved in this developing something else, I didn't really give it any consideration at all. You know, I was in it. I didn't think, oh, I'm going to make something that's going to be different. You know, Berlin having suddenly the walls come down, everything's very positive. and optimistic towards the future. Everyone was like, Germany is now going to be unified. You know, it was like, this feeling of like, this euphoric feeling of like, like positiveness. I somehow wanted to kind of encapsulate that in the music more than this kind of like gloomy, frustrated kind of like anger being driven out of the techno thing. You know, the techno was literally fall of the wall Berlin, you know? get all this anger out, get all this frustration out. Finally, we're free, breaking the chains. Suddenly, it was like, okay, how do we bring that into a musical form whereby it's musically... looking towards the future like give it give that some kind of like melancholic hope positiveness somehow you know it's like how do i do this and spoke to cosmic baby you know i've known you for a couple of years you know i know you can do this you know i know that you've got you've got this melodic thing you can you can work on that i know he'd been doing that so i was like you try that see if that'll work and it was just taking it from there really and just like trying to like bring other people in see I'm doing this if you're not just interested in making just like hardcore kind of 3k techno maybe you're interested in doing this maybe you've got something else to offer one guy had Mike Van Dyke he had on one of his I got a cassette off him of Jürgen Larmann who was running Front Page magazine and there was that most of the tracks on it were kind of hardcore techno but there was one single element one little bit and one at the end of one track and i was like oh it's really good that little bit it's really really good i wonder if i can get him to make a track around that bit which he did yeah And I'll release that. And it just kind of went from there. Where does the word trance come into it? Just because I thought my music was hypnotic trance-y like music, really. Was it early on that this? Yeah, I mean, it's how I promoted like Effective Force was like, you know, this is hypnotic trance-like sound, you know. And Jürgen Larmond was the person who said, hypnotic trance, hypno-trance, as I called it, is too long, you know. It's like hypno-trance. It sounds crap. It does actually sound crap. He said we should shorten it. In fact, he didn't even say that. He just did it. He just shortened it to trance. And it was like, from that, decided to make it a bit more focused in this kind of sound, just trance I thought it's something which is a little bit, you know, people are taking loads of drugs on the dance floor, dreaming, tripping out, you know, lots of like flashy lights, stroboscopes and stuff. You know, give them something to like, to play with that emotion that, you know, you read up and your emotions are at their actual peak. So you give them something which gives them this. ride, if you like, of emotions. You know, it's kind of higher energy, positive, melancholic, up and down, you know. But I read once that you kind of... wanted to stay away a little bit from the two highs and two lows you know that trance and the original conception was sort of less about the ride and more about this idea of staying within it my original original concept Whereas to have this kind of like, you know, elongated tracks that were just like, just like very hypnotic and like repetitive. Just basic channel. Which basic channel did perfectly, but would never, I never agreed to the fact that the music was very trancy. I thought that was the perfect example of how I would have envisaged a trance record. because I wasn't making the music myself, I gave that baton to, say, someone like Cosmic Baby or Mike Van Dyke or Dominic Luzzi or whatever. They interpreted this as something else. And that was okay for me. It wasn't how I had envisaged immediately this hypnotic sound. more or less my music was more the idea was more to like something like to chill out to really and to dance to to be honest it was more like but you know I thought okay you know that's how they they envisage this idea of trance and this idea of like something which is melodic as well and They just took it from, you know, have you heard of a group called Global Communication? I thought their album was a very trancy LP. It's how I'd envisaged this idea of trance music, you know, later on. They made this album. I thought, that's just a perfect, that's a really good trance album, that, you know. Whereas Cosmic and Mike, Dominic, they took this music and created their own version, which became copied and reinterpreted and reinterpreted. And it became Paul, who didn't have very, not musically proficient at that time. He understood it in another way. And from one thing led to another. And suddenly you've got this other, this trance word and this idea, this sound, which had nothing to do with really with my original idea. You know, the closest I possibly came to this idea was this album. The first album that I released as a compilation transformed from beyond. That was the closest I got to my original idea. you know, I said to Cosmic and I, you know, take all the tracks that I've released as singles and, you know, like re-remix them so that they fit into one continuous long sort of like, it's like a DJ mix, but it's not a DJ mix. It's like the end of that track is composed so it fits into the beginning of that track and kind of interweave them. Yeah. unlike a DJ mix where a DJ just plays one track into another, you have to like compose the sound. So they kind of mix into each other. And this spent a couple of weeks doing this, you know, and that was not became the first compilation that I released. And that was the closest I really got to it. Really. After that, it kind of went in a different direction. Were you going out to clubs very much? All the time. What was Eivorke like? Was that your main club that you would go to? I went to as many places as possible. Although, I really don't like club hopping. I find it really tedious going from one club to the next club to the next club. You never really get to see anything or experience it. I prefer to go to a club and stay there all night. to be honest, but there were a lot of things happening and a lot of places to go and a lot of secret, new, instant, one-night-only places, you know, like you just wanted to go there and just suck in a bit, you know. So I'd go to as many places as possible, like literally as often as possible. I also worked in a bar, you know, Penguin. So I had to kind of like... try and fit in the bar with the club. Thankfully in Berlin, club life starts at one o'clock or whatever. So it meant that when I shut my bar, I could just go to a club. It literally get there when it's just peaking and so I could experience all these things. So it was quite an enduring time because I... slept like virtually zero yeah i'd like and it did affect my health eventually eventually i had real problems with it later on um from doing this for like seven years non-stop you know it's like really fucked me up um but i enjoyed it immensely it was like you know it was a it was a fantastic experience to go to all these places like the VMF and the original EVEC and you know it was a really real thrill and when EVEC actually started as the club that we knew it from that period it was the best club in the entire world And it's probably, you know, on par with Paradise Garage, without a doubt. You know, Paradise Garage is like, as far as like underground New York disco goes, unsurpassed. And E-Virk, as far as Technomecha goes, unsurpassed. It was like the place to go, you know. What was it like? I mean, just even structurally. Well, tiled. It looked like a slaughterhouse, really. It looked like a slaughterhouse. It was very high. Very, very high. High ceilings. High ceiling, yeah. With pillars. Metal. the girder type pillars it was hard to get in maybe not for you for for for well yeah I mean the strict door policy they look at the people and the door the doorman weren't the kind of traditional the doorman that you see today in clubs you know these big guys with bald heads and walkie-talkies and black coats and volo neck sweaters and stuff, you know, it's like, the door people on the door at the event were clubbers, you know, they were people who were in the club scene, they were like, you know. photographers, you know, like the club, the people who work on the door, the bare kind, you know, the photographers, the artists, you know, they had things, other things to do in their private lives other than working on the door, but because they were part of the club scene, they knew who the clubbers were, they knew how to spot a clubber, they knew who was on drugs, you know, they could see that. You know, today you've got like ex-cons kind of standing in front workout guys, you know, like, they want to hit you immediately because you look different, you know, you're wearing suede shoes or punching the face, you know, like, a completely different atmosphere. You know, you come to the club, you didn't feel intimidated by these guys who were standing there protecting the door, you know, they just looked very, very normal, just like normal clubbers. Paul was one of the main DJs? Well, the nights that... Paul had been the DJ for Jürgen Kramer, who was one of the first people to put on techno parties here in Berlin. One of the unsung heroes of the techno scene. And he ran this night in the Glorgarstrasse, in the Turbine. And... He initially, because the Turbina was a small place, in the Gloucester, it's a small, held like 200 people, maybe, you know, so very small. He had to move from there and find somewhere else. And so he went to Cafe Moscow and did his parties in Cafe Moscow. And that became too small. And so he had to move from there to what had then become the E-Worker, more or less just started. And so he moved his night to the E-Work. And we did like, you know, maybe a year or something with him in there. And then eventually we ended up doing our own parties. And that's when Paul became, he had his Friday nights in the EVEC really. We gave him the MFS nights in the EVEC. So you had a label night there. Basically, yeah. So this is the 90s, basically. What happened in the 2000s? What happened in the 2000s? Well, in the late 90s, things started to get a little bit kind of like unsavoury. Yeah, well, it seems like... I think certainly that the thing that had annoyed you about punk rock by the time that you had left England was probably potentially annoying you about electronic music at that point. That there's these superstar DJs that had become an enormous business. That it was a fast buck. Yeah, there was lots of people making... A lot of rubbish. Still are. But, you know, it's like, I didn't really want to have anything to do with that, to be honest. It's not me. I was like... I didn't want to go down that road. I was being forced, actually, by my distributor to try and go down that road. They were trying to force me to go down that road. And I was like, oh, I don't want to. And some of the artists who I had on the label still, Paul had left MFS in a fit of rage. It didn't seem like it was an amicable. Which I never actually understood because he never actually explained to me really why. But I do think, you know, probably the reason why was that he didn't want to share his money with me, you know. It was like, I'm making millions of money now, I don't need to share it with you, you know. But he's never explained to me, so I really don't know, so I can't say. I'm just... imagine this is the only reason because really i can't think of any other reason why i should want to have left the label because i did everything for him everything i possibly could and invested so much time in his personal career to get him from being a nobody person DJ to be potentially the thing that I thought he could be which is the first superstar DJ internationally speaking beyond Sven Fey or whatever of his genre I was like but also retain a certain credibility, which I thought, you know, you can be a sellout DJ if you want, you know, but you can also be a DJ that's popular and has gained that popularity through your credibility. How do you do that? Or how did you try to go about that? By connecting in with people who also had a certain amount of credibility. Basically all my mates. You know, I knew that Paul was a fan of New Order and I thought okay, you know New Order releases is the last album of a single off the last album. It's they're gonna be the last single I'll ask Bernard as a favor You know Paul's birthday coming up, you know, let's give him a remix just he's always wanted to do New Order remix Let's give me the opportunity to do this remix maybe in the future I'd work with you on something, you know, and things like this kind of like went along, you know, and just give him as much credibility, like try and get him to play in credible places and be with credible people, you know, or to credible clubs or whatever. you know, it worked very well, you know, it's given him the best kind of like, like platform for him to rise upon. And then suddenly just to say, I don't need you. I thought I was very disappointed that all that work just kind of was really for nothing really at the end of it. And I envisaged it really, I expected loyalty, you know, I expected loyalty in the way that Daniel Miller had with Depeche Mode. loyalty the way new order had with factory regardless of the ups and downs and the problems and everything they always remained true to the label regardless of what was going on you know it was about it was about loyalty and i had invested my time and energy love creativity and everything that i had all my money in paul's career in the idea that he would ideal that he would be loyal regardless of whether things were going well or going bad. But when it came to that point where he could suddenly ditch me, he did. So that's life, really. So it kind of like makes you really wonder, you know, why did I do all this for this person who just doesn't appreciate anything, doesn't understand it really, what I did for him at all. How do you rebuild after that? I'm just resilient, I suppose. I'm quite resilient. I thought, oh, fuck you. That's how you feel. I can't make people be loyal. I can't make people think like I think. So I just have to swallow it. It's a bitter pill to take. Very disappointed. I thought there's something else out there. It's like music goes on. I'll go. I'm not going to be defeated by this. It's a setback. My potential pension maybe has been taken away from me, whatever. very disappointed, you know, like having worked all this time, all this focus on this one person, I suppose. The other artists too, you know, I tried to keep... kind of balance between everybody. I tried to keep everyone, treat everyone exactly the same, you know, like it's up to the artist to be creative and prolific and carry on making music, you know, by sitting in a cafe complaining about the record label not doing anything for you. It doesn't happen unless you're in the studio making music and presenting the label with music so that they can decide whether they want to release it or not. If you're not making the music, then I can't release it. So don't complain, you know. And I was getting that as well from some of the other artists. And I thought, I'm so ungrateful. I'm there for you, giving you the platform. You have to utilize that at the moment. Give me your music, get nothing or get something which I can't use. I'm trying to just manipulate this a little bit and just do this a little bit and it'll work. And it's like, no, I'm not going to do that. my music, you know, it's not going to work. If I release it, you'll find out because people will tell you it doesn't work. And, you know, you go through this and it's a bit disheartening, to say the least. I thought to myself, okay, I need to take a step back. I'm being pressurized by the distributor right now to make some kind of music I don't want to make. I don't want to make diggity, diggity, diggity, diggity. It's like, this is not me. And I don't really have anybody who's doing it. I had one artist who was in that kind of mindset, but I thought, it's not really where I want to go. I want And I thought, you know, the music at the moment is lacking in sexuality. It's lacking in everything. It's become completely clinical. You know, you've got techno music, which is not techno as we knew it in the beginning with the energy and the excitement of an early techno record. It's become a kind of like a version of techno. You've got trance music, which has become this tepid and tedious. diggly diggly rubbish you know and i thought i need to find something which is a bit more giving you know it's got some kind of like a something which reflects this like a new a new sound somehow a mixture of different things really what it's like but it reflects some kind of like this this thing which is lacking in these kinds of, both of these kinds of sounds, you know, there's like no sex in techno at the moment. There's no sex in trance at the moment. It's like, how do I bring that back into one sort of like thing? And I'd already, I was using my East German, Eastern European contact to like some of the clubs over there. I'd been in contact with one DJ called Vin Dalek and it was like. He was from Hungary and I thought it's time now that Eastern Europe showed its face a little bit to the West. There's a lot of potential there that's not being tapped into. No one's interested in the West about Eastern Europe. They don't give a fuck. There's a lot of DJs in Eastern Europe emulating Western DJs. It's not very exciting. You don't need another Eastern European Paul Van Dyke or Sander Kleinenberg or whatever. Who cares? But present them with something else which is not that and it might spark... off some kind of interest and so I found this diminutive guy called Corwin he was like very he'd put on the first Paul van Dyck party in Czechoslovakia you know And it was like, okay, I'll speak to him and find out if he's interested in this idea to present Eastern European in a very sexual, overtly sexual, almost like bordering pornographic kind of way. Because Eastern Europe was known for that, you know, like all these like tourists going to Czechoslovakia and Estonia and whatever, you know, for these like, you know, stag nights. they only know it as that I thought I'll utilise that and take that and put it into some kind of musical context and get him to kind of like be the vision and the image of this and we decided we'd create this like sound very sexually overtly kind of like almost tribalistic taking elements of different things and it was a couple of tracks that We released a track called Pounds and Pens and Corvin had done it in a kind of trancy sort of way and it was like, all right, well, nothing special. And a friend of his who he'd worked with was a DJ, Alex Flatner, he decided to do, he wanted to do a remix. He came and begged me to ask me if he could do the remix and I was like, yeah, of course you can, you know, have a go, you know. That's all you can do. And he brought me this track, which was like, hell, this is brilliant. This is really, this is it. This idea of this music that we want to make is kind of epitomized by this one track. It just kind of like... brought it to a pinnacle. I was like, this is the direction, this is the idea. He's created, indirectly without knowing it, he's into techno music, but he's indirectly created the sound that we're trying to create. So let's take it from there. And we decided that just one afternoon, sitting in this place in the Czech Republic. in the Padovica and looking through these magazines and we just came to this idea that we would call this music wet and hard because it kind of like said everything. It was like wet and hard. It was like sexual somehow. And we created then this idea of this sound of music which would be called this. And Corrin attracted immensely. like media attention not in Germany because Germans were like no way what is this they kind of like completely completely closed it off you know they didn't really want to know it was like seemed to be some kind of threatening thing it was something really threatening for them and in Germany we didn't get any hardly any bookings at all in germany but carving played like everywhere else in the world you know like we went to like south america to china we did like a month tour in china we did like you know columbia like numerous times playing first gig in columbia played for like 200 people like the last gig in columbia played for like 10 and a half thousand people you know it's like they're like the immense like people really got it there south america especially We found that this idea that we had really hit home in all these suppressed Christian countries like Ireland, South America, China. It was like, they really, really, really grabbed onto it. And especially in England as well, where sex is some kind of taboo, kind of sniggering behind your hand kind of thing. It was like... very interesting to see this like evolve but Corbin didn't really have the staying power somehow for this it was like it was too overwhelming for him he felt he was the only person doing it which he was but there were a lot of he had a lot of fans and he had a lot of people who wanted to make that kind of music but didn't really get it you know we hadn't really defined it properly I don't think and And he felt a bit overwhelmed by it and he ended up like, you know, packing it in because he just couldn't take it anymore. He couldn't take, he couldn't take, he couldn't, he couldn't believe himself that here he is, this kid from Hungary who a couple of years ago had been like a, just like a weekend DJ suddenly playing in front of a crowd of 10,500 people. president the son of the president of Colombia kind of like standing there screaming behind him you know it was like he couldn't understand that that had happened to him it was like a bit overwhelming for him and he ended up like just hanging his headphones up and taking a taking time out you know and I was like oh dear here we go again When was this that he hung it up? 2007. You know, it's like we worked really hard, you know, from 1999 doing this thing and kind of like travelled all over the place, you know, playing some... unbelievable places unbelievable gigs you know like places like I was speaking to Richie Horton telling him where I'd just been you know and he was like I'd love to play in a place like that and I'm like well you could but you know you can't ask for like $20,000 or something for the gig because these people don't have $20,000 for your gig but they'll give you you know $10,000 or something but you won't do it for that so you know you can't play there You know, we did one gig in Colombia. It was like the most amazing event I've ever seen, actually. It's like they built, these people, they built this place just for this gig. And it was on the side of a mountain, on a plateau on the side of a mountain in the middle of the jungle in the middle of Colombia, you know. Do you think there's, you know, you say that, you know, you... can't get paid this much do you think you know a lot of people talk about south america and china being emerging scenes for dance music are they in your mind i mean because my The conception is that you need mid-sized clubs where these things can build up and have a support structure. You can have these amazing gigs where something gets built and 10,000 people come, but if it only happens every six months, what does that mean? Once. I suppose for the emerging scene, yeah, people... you know, are building clubs and making places to play because there's a demand there. But it's a lot different than it was when I first went there, you know. And I suppose in South America, it's the same, you know. You know, suddenly people see they can make money out of it or whatever, and it's like, oh, well, we'll do a club. You know, they don't actually have any relation. They're not out to... create anything they're just out to make money out of it you know it's like it's not it's not they're not fueling any kind of scene there's no kind of like new colombian musical scene that's emerging there's no kind of real chinese musical scene emerging as as as per se you know although there are a lot of people there making music and and you know a lot of interesting people making music there it's not it's not brought together into some kind of focal point you know it's kind of like really diverse and sort of scattered is that a bad thing Yeah, of course it is. Because it means that people don't get the opportunity to be able to evolve as one thing. You know, like, look at our trends in the West that we had. All these so-called trends that we've had in the West, from the 60s to techno. They were all brought about by the fact that everybody was focused on one particular thing. It's like, you know, and also... The fact that records were something very special. You know, you had one music outlet, it was a record. And if you made a record, it was something special. It meant something. It meant you'd come to this point, you know, where you could actually make a record. And all the genres that kind of went along and made that kind of scene, and you could adhere to that scene and dress like that and be a part of that. it's now all kind of scattered and it's a bit kind of like, it's a bit, I'm like, you can, you can, you can adhere to a niche now as opposed to adhere to a scene, you know, it's like, so I mean, a lot of that has got to do with like, you know, the way music is distributed these days you know the amount of music you can get on the internet and free downloading and you know all these kind of platforms where you can just like get an abo and just kind of like you know just choose from the thousands and thousands and thousands of songs you know it's like you the actually it's all scattered around and that's how the scenes are so there's no there's no real particular focus you know and like and say okay what's next? You know, we've had techno and we've had like loads of divisions of like techno minimal and whatever. It's like, how do people come to a new thing you know what it's like without you look at dubstep and that emerged slightly it's it's a it's a it's a reimagination of of what was has gone before i mean dubstep is not a new idea it's been there before it's just that is a new Maybe a new generation of kids kind of like trying to focus on it. But I'd argue that it's an example of a scene for sure. These guys in Croydon and London, because they were in that area, created this thing. Yeah, I mean, Dubstep was there in the late 90s, early 2000s or whatever. It's an attempt, I think, at creating it. But it's not really as a scene yet. Is it a scene or is it just another niche? Is it just another section now? Has music become... as opposed to being like, you know, if you were in the techno scene, you know, it was a nationwide thing, you know. It's like people say, I'm into techno. You know, it's like you've had... I don't know. We'll see if it happens. But in the midst of all of this, you finally started making music again. Yeah, being jaded into it. You've been jaded into making music again. Yeah, I was like... Because I've read some interviews where you've talked about that... how music has obviously less economic value than it did before, maybe spiritual value in terms of coming out. And you're being more creative with this format than ever before. I find that really interesting. The new project maybe, allow me a little bit of theorizing the new project. is something that is new and exciting to you this 5.1 surround sound idea which is a frontier that's worth exploring is that kind of the draw of that stuff um well you know the rhythm the fact that i actually started making music again was something that was born out of doing the sounds uh like foley you know like the sound effects for jörg for a play that he put on at the the heaven theater there and it was like the how you know it's like it's like he wanted me to make the sounds for his for his this theater piece called captain berlin versus hitler and he wanted it to be done in such a way that it was in a real old school way you know that i made the music actually there on the spot and I made all the effects on the spot, you know, like if you hear some kind of like leaves rustling in the trees or whatever, it'd be literally with leaves rustling, you know. So I did this, yeah, for him. But I also had to make some of the music for this thing. But as the theatre was so small, I couldn't actually have all the instruments. So I actually ended up having to do it, pre-produce it. And that kind of got me back into making music because I had to suddenly sit down and say, okay, Jörg wants me to make music that sounds like a really shitty kind of circus band. You know, if you imagine a band of old doddering old men. who were kind of just about to go to meet their maker or something or get their pension or whatever. He wants me to make music that sounds like this kind of un-pa-pa group band, you know, a circus group. And I had to make this and put it onto a CD and then play the CDs while the theatre piece was playing. But it got me back into making music again. I thought, you know, I had quite a lot of fun doing this. And then I was asked by Blanken Jones to, they had a song and they wanted Bernard from New Order to sing on it. And they asked me if I could kind of like pass it on to him and if he would like to do it. And of which he said, yeah, he thought the song was really good. He thought, yeah, I'll do it. And as a kind of thank you for doing that, they asked me if I'd remix the track, but in my old school, like 1980s kind of sound, you know. It's like, oh, God, do I really want to go down there? I've been there, I've done that, you know. Can't I do something else? We've got all this kind of trans-techno sound, minimal whatever versions. We want something that's a bit different, that's not like that, you know. Can you do something else? We want it to be like this old-school sounding kind of typical new-ordery kind of sound. Oh, God, OK. If you want. I thought I'll just do it, I'll just be a one-off, I'll just do it, just out of, I suppose, and okay, I'll do it. And as I did this, I got, I rediscovered that in the past, the way, I made it actually, the track, as I would make, as I made music in the 80s, yeah. Very, very minimal for a few instruments. And I realized that though with the technology that we have today, we don't have half the problems that you had back then. You can turn it off and turn it back on and it's still the same sound. Whereas back in the past, you turn your synthesizer off and that was it. The sound was gone. You know, you had to re-figure everything. And I was like, it's quite refreshing to make this music with the modern technology. This 80s-ish sort of music with modern technology. I thought it was quite refreshing. Quite good. And they really enjoyed it. And from that, I got a phone call from Pet Shop Boys and they said, we're releasing a track on Compact and we need a Pet Shop Boys-y kind of sounding track. You know, like... can you do as a mix we really like we really like the way you've done that minimal miracle cure track for uh for blank and john's like could you do as a track that's in a similar kind of sound for our i'm in love with the german film star all right all right okay and so it's kind of like things kind of developed from there It was like then Blanket Jones asked me to do something else, another track, and it just kind of just developed from there, you know, just started doing it then. And it was like, okay, let's make an album. Rework all your vocal tracks and make that into an album. You know, normally you have like a vocal track and you make it into a dance track. We took a dance track and made it into a vocal track, kind of chopped the vocals around and things like this and re-edited everything and made it into sort of like an 80s sounding kind of reminiscence, if you like, you know. And it just kind of went from there. And then as I'm doing this, I'm thinking to myself, you know what, I'm interested in... the way, you know, that surround sound idea. I've got quite a few surround sound albums and I thought it was quite interesting that here I have got the opportunity here to do these songs with these people like Robert Smith and, you know, Bernard and Pet Shop Boys and stuff. You know, surround sound albums at the moment, all you can buy are things like Moody Blues and Pink Floyd and King Crimson and, you know, these mega artists, you know. But you can't buy a 5.1 surround sound mix of a Pet Shop by a song and you can't buy a 5.1 surround sound of a Bernard Sumner song, you know. well, it would be nice to be able to take a mixture of these things and some new groups as well, some new artists as well, and just make a 5.1 album that kind of gives these other groups that wouldn't normally have this opportunity. I wouldn't do it themselves, probably. I wouldn't think about doing it. Give them that opportunity to do something else, have something else. And that kind of was the idea behind this album was like to make an album which was a balance between a lot of really well-known things and well-known artists and some completely unknown artists and some kind of bubbling artists, if you like. mixture of two things do you want to do it again i'm doing it now no i wouldn't i don't know about doing a 5.1.2 or something like that but you know the idea of making 5.1 music is a totally different challenge you know it's like When you're making a stereo record, you've got two speakers and you can layer things over each other and it's nice and flat and it's normal, it's a very traditional way of listening to music. It's the way most people listen to music and will in the future anyway. The idea of making a surround track, you have to think completely differently because you have to... decide where you want to put the instruments and how you balance things so that it sounds normal but is all around you you know like you the way we listen to things in three dimensions you know is the way i want it you you of course it's not something that you're going to be carrying around with you you know it's like It's a very static thing. So that's why its limitations are really kind of limited to having a surround sound system sort of wrapped around you, really. But people don't really listen to music these days, like sitting at home most of the time. They listen to it on their iPod or they listen to it in their car most of the places. Car manufacturers are starting to put surround sound systems in their car. But, I mean, it's early days. I mean, it's like, you know, like when I was thinking to myself, stereo, it took stereo, you know, like about 30 years before it became a household. Yeah. You know, Leopold Sikorsky made like... Fantasia in quadraphonic actually. Yeah. But they released it in stereo because they didn't understand how they were going to, they didn't have the technology at the time to make it in quadraphonic. So they only had the idea to put it in stereo. So it was released as a stereo film and a stereo record. in 1940 or something. And, but Leopold Tchaikovsky actually recorded it in quad with the vision that this would be surround sound back then. And this idea, like, you know, stereo, then suddenly, you know, people... 30 odd years before people started, you know, like till about 1960, late 60s, you know, mid 60s before stereo actually became something which people actually had at home. It's a long time, you know, and it might take just as long for 5.1 to become a household thing, but it depends on how it's... progresses in the future.
