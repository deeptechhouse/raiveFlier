You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour. This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour, RA's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. I'm Martha, producer of The Hour, here to guide you through this month's episode. Oh, this is so exciting. It's Martha on NTS coming to you from my bedroom, live in Peckham. How are you feeling? What's your panic level on a 1 to 10? This is quite exciting doing this from home. Really great to have so many of you locked in with us today. You can see the shout out streaming in. Along with some of my favorite hosts, like Moxie and Charlie Bones, who you just heard there, I've been learning how to broadcast from home. I have been. consistently obsessed with radio since I was about 14 years old. I love the space that listening gives me to imagine and escape, to learn and keep me company. In light of the coronavirus pandemic, radio seems to have become more important to people, a lifeline. An element of routine whilst our usual settings have been disrupted. A distraction to immerse yourself in. A way to connect. Community Radio is holding together underground music scenes right now, providing a space for curators to keep introducing new music to listeners whilst we can't be together in the club. So this episode of The Hour is dedicated to my first love, radio, as I hope to get a better understanding of what makes it so powerful in a moment of crisis. We'll get some insight into what it's like to broadcast on national radio during a pandemic with BBC presenter and incredible DJ Jam Supernova. People have said that, you know, it's really helped with their anxiety. It's given them something to look forward to every Tuesday night, to have someone kind of with them. Esteemed audio documentary producer Hannah Walker-Brown. will help break down what it is about radio as a medium that is resonating so strongly right now. There's something about someone just talking directly into your ear. You know, it sounds like they're there just for you that I think people just find a lot of comfort in. And I'll take you behind the scenes of streaming from home with head of production at NTS, Rory Bowens. But first, let's hear from radio stations across the world, sharing their experiences of lockdown. The whole dynamic has changed. And as the whole dynamic has changed, we thought it was really important that we adapt to a new reality. Here's Christian from DubLab in Barcelona. We have like a totally new scenario. A scenario that we don't know where it's actually going to end and where and when. But we thought it was important to just adapt to new circumstances. So we've been trying to do certain kind of like actions with the hosts, another kind of content. For example, each host was recommending a record and we were broadcasting that. We just did a long, long, long playlist of all these records and short recorded messages of the hosts explaining why these records, explaining a bit of their situation, home, etc. And we thought it was like a time to maybe... instead of like listening to mixes or like regular shows we thought it was like a time maybe to just go back and rediscover records and we have the time we're always talking about the lack of time so maybe this situation made us appreciate more just being there sometimes even getting bored because I think it's very important to have that opportunity this situation just gave us time To rethink, reschedule and basically just be and feel. Another action that we were pushing people to do, they feel like and they wanted to, is to recommend places, restaurants, bars, records in our city that they miss. And to just give a voice to these small businesses that they're probably also going to be tough. I'm Frankie, I'm the co-founder of Foundation FM, which is an online community radio station based in Peckham, which is female-led. So obviously we're in lockdown and that has changed the way we operate the station just because we can't be in the studio live. I think what's changed is the way we view radio a little bit now. And, like, Foundation has always had talk shows, two till four. We're kind of being more considerate of, like, what we need to talk about and how we need to support people. What I've noticed that's different is the way that our audience is interacting with us is they're staying with us for longer, so... We're getting more listeners and they're staying with us for longer and engaging in conversations with us. So it's always really important to us with the two to four that we showed that, you know, not only women great taste makers in music, but they actually have strong opinions on things. And they they are businesswomen, they're creatives, they are political, they're storytellers. I think audiences are seeking maybe a little bit of distraction right now. You'll notice with radio more that you can share your story. Radio is really reactionary and you can say, OK, you know, life's a bit meh right now, but here's that throwback track that we all loved in that summer where it was insane and you can just take someone to that place. Or you can say, this is a completely new artist. Let's really focus on some people who are trying to get their foot in the door and give them a bit of support right now. And you know what? I do think at this time, more than ever, it's nice to have a community and know that you're all going through it in turn. to each other and also just like help each other out foundation has always been a family and we're all missing each other so much and i think radio does make you feel like you're part of something a bit bigger and that anyone can be a part of it like whether you're the dj or the listener Because, you know, we all have to record at home right now, it's kind of like DIY radio back to the beginning, like people recording bits on their phones and they're finding out about editing software and we're talking through production a bit more and it's getting all a bit more techie and specific and editing and it's nice to see them all go back to this basic and learn about... radio and how to put radio show together and then piecing it together and then us going through it together is really nice and i think because there's that like diy feel to it which is personally something i really love about community radio i think people feel that it's something for them i feel like maybe sometimes when you listen to national radio it's so slick and so professional and you're like oh how do I ever get to that place whereas like Foundation FM I would say the production level is amazing but you know it's come from the DJ you know that it's come from like Foundation FM and our staff and that we're all working together but you could be in that position and like there is a place for you here Here's Mohammed from Boxout FM, India. We broadcast from a basement in New Delhi, where I actually also live. So I take care of pre-recorded archives, uploading video content, editing video content, and kind of just keeping the platform running. We're kind of trying our best to keep things going. Therefore, we decided to power through and actually launch our brand new mobile app. There's a lot of data problems in India, so we wanted to create an app that's easily accessible for anyone. Audience expectations are always quite high. But I think a lot of the audience is just hoping that we keep it going and we stick around and we don't shut down, we don't fold, we don't end this. So a lot of people are always messaging, asking how we are doing, how the team is doing, how the hosts are doing. I guess the community aspect of things is more relevant now than ever. I think more people are tuning in because they don't have much. else to do they're not going out they're not able to get their entertainment where how they used to get it and the one place they find some sort of like safety is when they tune into shows or listen to hosts that they have been kind of following for a while people want to hear other humans talking and telling them that Yeah, we're all having difficult times right now. It's not just you, actually. We're all having anxiety. We're all confused. It's not just you. Actually, everybody doesn't feel that great right now. So just reassuring people that we can overcome this together. Look after yourself, share whatever tips you can. So bringing the community together, I guess. Something that's given me goosebumps since the pandemic is sometimes while I'm playing tracks and introducing them, I see my friends. from the city and other cities all in the chat room just kind of like having good time and it's like oh this is the new normal So what's it like to hold the responsibility of broadcasting on national radio right now? I have to do what I have to do and get on air to keep my promise to the public. This is Jams Supernova. Jams is an essential part of BBC Radio 1X. I asked Jams what it's been like for her adapting from BBC Studio Live to home broadcasting. So I kind of thought that, oh, you know, people are going to know it's pre-recorded. I'm such a radio nerd. I'm like, people are going to know it's pre-recorded. They're going to hear it. They're going to switch off. and they also brought my show earlier so I was on 7pm till 10pm so and at extra hours there was loads of things to think about it and at first I kind of initially like from an ego point of view I was just like they're gonna hate me they're not gonna get the show of it being on at 7 or they're gonna know it's pre-recorded like I had so many just you know am I gonna get the tone right am I meant to be happy am I meant to be uh neutral you know we were in honest with everything in my links and was quite up front with where I was at, where I was literally at, where I was recording from. to how I was feeling about the situation and that I couldn't believe like the responses that we started getting in. People have said that, you know, it's really helped with their anxiety. It's given them something to look forward to every Tuesday night to have someone kind of with them. And from the Selecta Radio point of view, I've had loads of people from all around the world because all the shows are basically there online. You can listen to them on Mixcloud. A lot of people have been messaging me being like, since the beginning of lockdown, I've made it a mission to listen to every one of your shows up until the present day. which has been really cool and amazing because I feel like, you know, that's a lot out of someone's time, one. And I like the fact that they so, you know, so want to be involved in UK music that they would dedicate that amount of time and take the time then to write a message to me. So for me, it developed a real personal connection that I don't think I had before. I think when I used to do radio at 9pm, I'd get interaction, I'd get people hitting me up or I'd get people talking to me when I was out and about, about the show, but I didn't have that personal connection with the listeners. And I think that me being vulnerable and talking about things outside of music kind of allowed them to kind of feel a bit closer to me and they were able to share how they were feeling as well. That's been definitely a plus, I think, the instant connection. And then up until now, I feel like the most recent show that I did was a George Floyd tribute show and a tribute to racial justice. So I was kind of, again, a bit nervous. How are you going to get the tone right? It's just me talking to myself in the living room. I've got no one to bounce off. I don't know how the rest of the day is going to sound on air. I haven't heard the other shows. My show is the only pre-recorded one. But doing that show, you know, I didn't even promote it, actually. I didn't want to promote it because I thought it would be a bit crass at the time to promote it. So I just kind of let it breathe when it went out and just let it do its thing. And I had so many beautiful messages from people saying that. it was the show that, you know, it spoke to, it actually allowed them to feel how they were feeling. So many of the lyrics kind of spoke to how they were feeling and it made them kind of pause and take a step out and actually just let themselves feel. So yeah, I think that for me is like, if anyone says what has been your radio highlight of your life. then strangely I would probably say that show because it's the most authentic and the most real and I think the most needed for people it was offering a service yeah that's so cool that you're able to like receive messages from listeners and like be a part of helping them to like figure out how they feel yeah I would never have expected I mean we had a little bit of that with like DIY generation when I did a feature about entrepreneurialism people coming and asking of advice but I think yeah I think I think for me I always kind of like to like to do radio and think that nobody was listening and then if I thought no one was listening then I could just be my most authentic self but I think that kind of made me put up a barrier between me and the listener and I think that during this time the barriers come down and maybe that is why they feel more open to come and message me because I definitely I can assure you whilst I know I had listeners they was I had no one messaging me like the way people be messaging me now my name is Jam supernova and tonight on the show is all about the music so I've chosen tracks that speak to pain I've tracks that speak to protest and I've chosen tracks that speak to peace. I wanted to kick off with Solange, two tracks actually, because I feel like they perfectly encapsulate the feelings that I've been going through over the last couple of days. Weary and mad. Taking from the album, A Seat at the Table. So I'm going to do a lot less talking tonight, but every record has been picked for its emotional vulnerability, for the lyrics, so sit back. listen and hopefully I can be the soundtrack to the way that you're feeling as well. When lockdown first started, everyone was like streaming from home and figuring out how to do it and parties on Zoom and stuff like that. What ways of like bending and growing the traditional format of radio did you notice or sort of find interesting? So yes, I love what No Signal Radio have done. So No Signal Radio is basically an online radio station that came up during lockdown. It's set up. by two guys who also run a party called Recess. It's kind of very different at the young black UK community. And they sort of blew up firstly from doing verses. So they would put two artists against each other. and have two hosts kind of battle it out for like 10 tracks of each of theirs going head to head. And it's just taken on a whole life of itself. And I've seen people tweet about the fact that they might have a whole Sunday that plays African highlife music, where you're not going to get that anywhere else on UK radio. So they've definitely kind of filled it. filled a void and a purpose I think during this time and I always think of radio like an ecosystem where one station fails another station has to pick up and it just keeps on going round and round and round like not no one station can have it all and I've loved listening to Represent and hearing how they've adapted like I've heard pretty much whole radio shows that I've had co-hosts that have been done via Zoom. I know it's so innovative. Yeah, yeah. Now there should be no reason why we can't do anything. And I think from a, you know, from a BBC point of view for me and my show, it doesn't always have to be this high glossy full on production. It can just be raw as long as the content's good. Do you have any tips for people who are making radio shows at home? um yeah um yeah i would say get a good mic i think a good mic is is really key um it just it would just you know i think it would just make your life a bit easier so i actually have a couple of mics going i have different ones for different things so right now i'm using a usb mic I actually bought it for like 70 quid on the internet and it's been quite fruitful. And then I've got a more high-tech mic. It's a Neumann that I use for the One Extra show. And I've got a lot of good feedback on that saying that basically nobody knows if I'm in the studio or not. Yeah, I know, which is crazy. Yeah, I would say get a good mic. And when you're recording, you know, things like closing your curtains. I've never been one to get underneath the duvet. I've not done that yet, but I think the quality that I have is quite good. But I normally close the curtains and close the door. Me personally, I can't do radio if I can't hear myself. Yeah. If I can't hear myself, I think... I'm going crazy. Yeah. And I start to, I sound like I'm unsure of what I'm saying. Yeah, yeah. So what I've done is that basically I record the music on a separate feed to the mic. So I basically just run the music through. the decks and I have a little device that it records onto and then I record my mic completely separately so I record my mic through my zoom which is like a portable recorder and I have basically like big headphones on one ear listening to the music and in the other ear I have the feed from the Zoom so I can hear myself and then I can really pretend like I'm in the studio and I'm jumping over instrumentals and things like that so that really helps for me I think yeah just trying to find ways that make you feel as comfortable as possible Personally, the way I started doing the pre-records right at the beginning of lockdown to where I'm at right now, I'm a completely different person. Like I've had some existential crisis moments in my living room, in my dressing ground, you know, crying into the mic. Like, why don't I sound good? And then now I've just kind of like, you know, I just have to really try and, in my imagination, pretend that I'm live. Yeah. I have to pretend that I'm live. You can't go back on. like link okay you messed up a little bit but keep on going you're not perfect you're human and if you was in the studio you'd make a joke about it so make a joke about it um so yeah there are a couple of tips and then i guess like yeah good editing software is always good to have you know it can be as simple as garage band you can go all the way up to something um like ableton but i guess if anything as well this time has shown us we can all have radio shows Why not? If you want to do a radio show and you're not on a station right now, there are ways and means for you to do it from home and just release it out into the world. Why not? After collecting those invaluable tips from Jams about broadcasting from home, I thought it might be helpful if I share with you guys what goes on behind the scenes every Friday when I go live on NTS. Alright, I am... in my room right now which is where all my equipment is to do the radio and it is Friday afternoon which means that very soon I am going to broadcast live from my bedroom on NTS so I have got everything set up and in a minute I'm going to call Rory who is the head of production at NTS and we'll do a little sound check on the phone and then if everything goes smooth we'll get on air at three o'clock this afternoon hey how are you good good how are you good thank you if you could just maybe send actually just send a bit of music signal there it can be anything good that's all right um cool yeah i'm happy with that So that is how we do the sound check. And everything is sounding good right now. Which means that I'm all ready to do my live show. So we've got five minutes exactly. And then we'll be on air. Oh my god. I love this. We're on the air. My name is Rory Bones and I'm the head of radio production at NTS. It's been super inspiring actually getting people to broadcast remotely from their homes and sort of seeing what's possible. I feel like we're sort of returning to a more DIY ethos that was, it's always been super present in NTS but it kind of reminds you of the early days of NTS. Yeah, it feels really DIY just. setting people up on very basic equipment from their homes and broadcasting from there. I think it's kind of created a really lovely sort of atmosphere and kind of intimate vibe to the shows as well as people are almost sort of opening up their... sort of homes to listeners as well as on their shows I found in some cases you know that's what it feels like to me and I think it's creating yeah just a really nice vibe but I'm still really looking forward to getting back into the NTS studio. How would you say the audience have been interacting with NTS since the start of the pandemic? Well for a start the audience have just been interacting like a lot more with NTS since the start of the pandemic. In April, we hit 2.37 million monthly unique listeners. So that's unique listeners as opposed to total. And that's an increase of 90% compared to this time last year. So it's pretty staggering. Engagement time is sort of also up. People are... sticking listening a lot longer I think it's 72 minutes is the average engagement time which is really it's pretty crazy when you think about it and it's a lot longer than kind of traditional radio I think the main thing aside from all that is that there's been a much bigger interaction between the listeners, whether that be with each other or with the hosts in the chat room. I mean, if you jump on the chat room for any show, it's pretty rammed at the moment, but particularly the Charlie Bones breakfast show, just the chat room is gone. crazy recently uh monday to friday every morning there's just just a kind of an army of people in there um And I think, you know, there's been lots of things that have, particularly on that show as well, that have gotten the listeners more interactive with the radio as well, whether it be on Charlie's show in particular, there is the jukebox where listeners will call in and sing a song to request it. Jukebox! Oh my God. Let's get right on, let's get right on, let's get right on, let's get right on. Where's the 20 minute crew holding on? Is that playing? Give me a call, please. Seriously though, do give me a call. That was the biggest Cascades yet seen, I think. Good work, people. You've also got an Anu show. She's having listeners send in voice notes to her. So I think a lot of shows are quite conscious of people's needs to kind of interact at this time and are trying to make the shows more interactive and get the listeners more involved from a distance. Yeah, and it's working. Yeah. Why do you think the radio is connecting with people more right now? I think radio is sort of, good radio is always sort of an exercise in kind of connection. you know particularly host-led radio um people are obviously really isolated at the moment and just hearing that voice communicating uh is very important um i think the fact that it's a live experience is also crucial you know people can experience something in real time with like a huge audience of other listeners at the same time and that kind of intrinsically connects them to each other as well as the host and I think also the fact that all shows are largely hosts kind of DIY broadcasting from their own homes in isolation themselves it kind of makes it more special because it's like they're going through a shared experience with the listener And I guess you can see that across the board with all these Insta live streams and different streams that people are doing in general. I think also the kind of routine element of the radio is really helping people right now. I guess a lot of people, their normal routines have been severely disrupted. they've been furloughed or they've been laid off and they're kind of having that kind of anchor of a regular radio show, I think is connecting with people. So every Friday I do my NTS show from home and it involves me and you talking on the phone and we do a little sound check. do you have any tips for people who are streaming at home? I think my top tip for people streaming at home is it's a kind of a nerdy audio one but I'd say get your hands on a software compressor So for anyone who doesn't know, a compressor is like this audio sort of device that will sort of make your stream less dynamic and make your stream more consistent. Basically, there's loads of free software compressors and other free audio plugins you can get and it'll just make your stream sound super professional. basically all the ones we use uh for our remote broadcast from hosts um are all from like free sources so you don't have to spend a lot of money on it um and yeah i'll just make your stream sound really good one we use is called the tdr kotelnikov uh which someone said to me recently sounded like a kind of a weapon which uh yeah um There's another one called the W1 Limiter, which is a really good limiter to use. There's loads of free options online. Places like LANDR and Plugin Boutique regularly run sort of lists of the best free plugins to get and they're all really solid. So definitely just check out because there's so much you can get out there that's totally free and will just make your stream sound super professional. Let's hear from some more radio stations around the world. Hey Martha, how's it going? Hope you're good. It's Richard. SCR here from Seoul Community Radio broadcasting from South Korea right now we hope everyone's well we were actually in a very interesting situation right now we were actually moving studios so I guess like for us it's sort of we're in a transition period in the middle of a very uncertain period so Everything's just all a big gamble at the moment and we hope it pays off when us as a society and a scene are out the other side. So fingers crossed. What I have quite liked is what people are doing themselves. One of the interesting things is I've had a lot of people actually messaging me, like sort of asking how to stream themselves, which is obviously cool. I'm happy to. lend them the uh the some some advice and i heard from a lot of people that you know they can't get hold of black magic ultra studio minis which is the main video capture card that people are using for like video streams so You know, we see sort of different valuation of like certain equipment happening because people are looking to get hold of the essential items to stream. I like seeing people doing their own stuff, their own streams. It actually also gives us a window into sort of what they might want from us, really. So it's good to actually, it's been good to sort of watch what's been going around. I like the creativity that's been happening. Radio as a platform is always the medium that's the strongest in a crisis, really. I think whether it's people broadcasting from bunkers and that old cliche, Terminator 2 had John Connor broadcasting from a bunker when it was the end of the world. So I think radio's always got that kind of... the sort of quality that people are going to turn to. Hi, my name is Gavin and I'm running on our radio station called Hong Kong Community Radio, aka HKCR. So just to be clear, outside of the travel ban, so far Hong Kong has not been in a lockdown. Although many venues and social places are instructed to be closed in the meantime. But our students are still open, but obviously no more travelling artists coming through the station right now. And we have much less local... host to request for shows as everyone's practicing social distancing basically we take a chance to take a break from regular programming and focus on improving the studio space and we actually try to make program outside of the normal live streaming format either it'll be podcast or some recorded performance or other kinds of shows that isn't necessarily in the medium of radio. Seeing this kind of online performance streaming becoming a norm now, maybe people will start to accept that this is a valid format. to watch a performance. It's an interesting development of the online radio community and something we have to think about in the near future. Here's DJ Bowlcut from Seoul Community Radio. Usually, SCR has a lot of international guests. But because of this virus happens, there are a lot of these international guests has been cancelled so that it allows us to focus on what we're doing. In Korea, streaming culture is very popular. A lot of people watching podcast in real time and then they do donate a lot of money. to the streamers but it doesn't apply to DJ mixes. They think it's boring. They think it's not worth to donate the money but I see things a little bit different now because as a lot of events and clubs are closed down in Korea too, bars still open but major clubs and festivals have been cancelled a lot of times so it does affect a lot of DJs and rappers too. So I see there's something interesting happens in Korean hip-hop. culture now. A lot of big hip-hop heads, now they're doing streaming. At the same time, they get a lot of donations whilst they're playing music and do a live rap show. Before, they think it's not necessary to do it because they usually rely on live acts and stuff like that in a club or in an event or something like that. But nowadays it's a little bit different. So I see people are more educated. to donate whilst they are tuning in music show now. So I think in future it might affect on music stream as well in general, like DJs playing music and people donating because, you know, this situation educates people to donate money on live music stream. So I think this is a new business model in future and we'll see how it goes. Hello, my name is Marco Aimo. I'm the co-founder of Radio Reim, our radio and community platform based in Milan, Italy. The audience is interacting with us. in the same way so we gain probably more and more people and more people in the radio more so we actually we are growing a lot as numbers but we have decided to maintain our usual routine because we see that right now everyone is trying to do they're doing their own shows their own stuff they do Facebook live they do Instagram Everyone is doing a broadcast. So we decided just to do what we are able to do and what we do at our best. So for us, it's like if you are like a baker, everyone is starting to do their own bread, you know. So we decided just to keep, as artisans, our bread the best we can do. We decided to do just... a project called stay connected which was just a simple thing just to contacts, all our friends, other radio similar to us and sometimes to broadcast at the same time the same show and I think this was a specific moment during this pandemic that made me happy because sometimes you ask yourself how the radio can help the community, it can help the society I think For us, it is to maintain as max as we can the same kind of effort and service for our listeners, for our main task. Let's see what happens in the next month, because probably we would need to use also radio not just for music, but also to... to talk about other problems, to change the world, I don't know. But this, you know, is an adventure. Let's see what happens. It's very weird because I've got kind of two sets of headphones on right now. That's exactly what I have. So my phone is far enough away from my mic that it doesn't interfere. um but that's just how it goes at the moment isn't it yeah I wear my like in-ear headphones for the phone and then on top of the massive over-ear ones for the recorder that's exactly what I'm doing as well yeah great okay good it's working so far yeah I wanted to understand more about radio as a format and why it's connecting right now. So I called Hannah Walker-Brown. Hi, my name is Hannah Walker-Brown. I'm an audio documentary and podcast creator. I'm also an executive producer. for Sony Music and Broccoli Content at the moment. A lot of my work is kind of rooted in music and sound design and cinematic storytelling. So kind of applying the rules of film and music composition to radio and audio storytelling. Why do you think it is that radio and telling stories through audio is so potent at this moment? Like it's such an intimate format. You usually listen on your own anyway. So it's not like that part has changed. And I just think there's something about someone just talking directly into your ear. You know, it sounds like they're there just for you that I think people just find a lot of comfort. foot in and I think a lot of escapism as well and I think that's probably what it is with music and I think the combination of those two is just really kind of helping people escape for a few minutes or at least just forget about you know the shit show that is outside and I think audio has always done that it's always been that really intimate and yeah like just it's like giving you a big hug I mean unless you know even true crime I guess which I'm not really here for but at least you can get lost for a bit in a story and I think we definitely need stories more than ever now especially ones sort of with hope Which I guess true crime doesn't have, but, you know, each to their own. It's definitely immersive, we'll give it that. Mmm. Yeah, exactly. And it's just that thing of getting lost and being able to step out of your everyday and into someone else's, which, you know, audio can do just with a voice or, you know, sound effects. We don't need the big film shoots or, you know, loads of cast members. That's just kind of. Yeah, how it is. Yeah. I think for me, it's always been like that mixture of like having enough of a story to bring you in. leaving enough space for you to imagine it how it looks kind of in your own head and that being like a total distraction and that's like really appealing to me right now for sure totally audio is so inclusive of everyone like every imagination is valid And I think that's when it really works well is you give someone just enough that they can start to imagine it themselves, but without thinking, oh, no, that's not how I imagine them. The beauty is that you just, you know, it's suggestive. And I think, yeah, that inclusion is so important. For sure. And radio has always been to me like the kind of... friend that you can hang out with and hear their story without having to say anything back or give anything back or you don't even have to put in any effort you don't even have to get dressed properly to get that company and you still get that human connection from it yeah that's the perfect lockdown mate it's kind of come full circle in that sense and I know like everyone I kind of thought radio was going to die. I mean, everyone always thinks radio is dead and then it comes back to life or it just refuses to die. And now with podcasting and I just think people are kind of taking it, like they're appreciating it a lot more, I think, than they did before. Yeah, for sure. And I think people are... being kind of you know we realize now that you know the sort of content people need and I think the things that really thrive are the things that are led by kind of the public and what's missing and and that variety so Yeah, there's definitely a friend for everyone. For sure. And it is really encouraging when you just see radio surge up again. I'm really loving all the different takes on the traditional format of radio, the way people are bending the format to fit an online world. I guess podcasts are a massive part of that. Yeah. Like you were saying. the way that we usually take in podcasts hasn't really changed. We still kind of do that on our own. So maybe there's some sort of comfort or stability in that not changing despite the world having been literally turned upside down. Yeah, it's like the one thing that's remained the same, which... Like there could be better things that had stayed the same than podcasts, but at least, you know, it's something and I'll take it. You know, you have to take what you can get at the moment. For sure. And I do like to see lots of people having a go at making their own podcasts and all that kind of thing. Yeah, that's it. And I think the other thing that's been happening, because you've sort of mentioned like new ways of working, but also it's staying the same, but using social media and that interaction and you know I've seen a lot of kind of Instagram live like recordings where people are in conversation but you can like see them both and I think the other thing in kind of podcasting and radio is people are doing a lot of Like Skillshare, like online, like tips and tricks. So I feel like, I mean, podcasting has always been pretty democratic in that like everyone can do it. Like you just sort of need a microphone. And I don't really agree with that. But, you know, the principle is essentially, you know, anyone can. record into a mic and upload it onto a soundcloud or on spotify whatever um so i think that's really nice how we're kind of bringing everyone in and people are like using this opportunity to learn that new skill or to start the project that they hadn't had time to before for sure so i think that's kind of another area that i'm seeing thriving that i quite like yeah What have you been listening to or seeing online that you've kind of noticed growing since the start of lockdown that you're excited about? I know Tory Lanez was doing his like... Instagram live and he was calling it like quarantine radio even though there's like nothing radio about it but it was still interesting that he chose to take that like traditional idea of radio and like make it work for the time that we're in Yeah, definitely. And Gemma Kearney, the BBC presenter, and she owns a production company called Boom. And she started a online radio station called Nightwaves Radio, which, again, is like going back to the old school. It's like online radio and it's her and, you know, I just... I like that things have sort of gone backwards and I don't know if like that's getting older and just that's what happens when you're like oh the good old days they were so great um but I just like that creativity and that people are using it to like not necessarily find new ways to do the format but going back to the traditional ways and and again it's that idea of it being so inclusive and like everyone can just tune in like you don't need an app you don't need this you don't need to pay the subscription like it's just there for you to go into if you want to have it so that I really like um and again just Just seeing how people are recording, I'm really enjoying. There's been so many duvet thoughts. I've been making a series at the moment and each of the contributors has been sending a photo of what they've built and I'm like, God, these guys are really creative. And I'll say, oh, you know, put some cushions around it and they send an image in and it's like... like literally a castle of pillows that and then they're sitting in the middle I'm like oh my gosh like this is excellent so again just like finding like just very traditional ways to do it we're not in fancy studios and I guess yeah we just have to get creative so I'm just really enjoying that and I think maybe I mean as soon as we're out I'm going to really enjoy just you know interviewing someone in a studio where everything is set up and I'm like oh god dreamy but also I don't know it just proves that we can do it without all of that noise and tech Here's Jam Supernova. People have been, like, pissing on radio for a long time. You know, on every panel we've been on, radio's dead, how are you going to fight the algorithms? And I think what this time has shown us is that we... are humans that want a personal connection that an algorithm or a playlist can't completely give us it can give us a moment or a feeling that's fleeting but having someone talking to you through the radio is something that you'll always remember and I think that we forget actually the amount of people who are on their own and especially during this period of time They live on their own. They have nobody to talk to. They have no one to interact with. And the radio has been the only thing that makes them not feel alone. And I think a playlist cannot do that. It's impossible for an algorithmic playlist to do to make someone feel that. It's that voice in the house. I leave the radio on for the dog when we go out. It's a calming voice. It's a presence. So I think that's why it's important. important I think it's that personal connection and actually um there's been sort of people saying that the BBC's had like a you know a big a big growth in the amount of people listening and if you look at the stations that have had the growth it's your one extras it's your radio ones um it's a station all your sixes six musics but they in every show that i've heard across those stations you know the daily shows they've been talking about what's been going on and they'll get listeners up you know it kind of feels like we're all in this together whereas some of the more commercial stations where it's kind of been like business as usual keep pumping out the chords five track segs let's go they've actually lost listenerships over this period of time um So I think that people want to know that there's someone going through what they're going through and they want to hear. And then they're not only connecting with the presenter, through that presenter, then they're connecting with a whole other universe of listeners. Yeah. You know, it feels like you're all in that one moment, you're all in it together. Yeah. Oh, it's beautiful. What would you hope you'll feel when you look back at the series of broadcasts that you're doing from home in future years? How would you want to describe the potency of them? I guess. Part of me feels like I would look back and I feel a bit like a foot soldier. I haven't even wanted to take any time off. I mean, I need to take time off. I'm definitely ready to take time off and I'm burnt out, but I kind of feel like I don't want to take time off until this pandemic is over because I kind of feel a little bit like a foot soldier. I have to do what I have to do and get on air to keep my promise to the public in a sense and I know that maybe sounds a bit dramatic but I feel like that's just how I feel I feel like I need to do what I need to do because there's so many people that one aren't able to do what they need to do and there's so many people that need it they need us to be on air you know if I'm not on air in their silence That's deserving someone. I'm on the BBC and I need to step up to the plate. So I think I would look back at it as a going to war period of time. And the radio was my way of communicating with people. And I hope that from a personal side, it would have made me a better broadcaster. I hope that if I can make it feel real, with me in my dressing gown talking to the wall, that when I get back into that studio... and I am live that I am so much more animated, so much more, just so much more alive, you know? But I think it will definitely remind me of the summer that I had to be vulnerable and I had to be open and I had to... think about the way that I spoke to my listeners not just hitting them with facts about music actually letting them in into my world and my life and asking about them I asked everyone I spoke to to share with me what they think the significance of radio is in this moment Here's Rory from NTS. We're living in a time of such crazy uncertainty. You know, people are stuck in their homes, really isolated. And I think radio is just providing that sort of connection that people need. If you listen to a live show, you're not alone. You're listening to it with a bunch of people. of other listeners you know you're going through this experience together and I think when everyone is quite isolated and quite alone that means a lot. This is Gavin from Hong Kong Community Radio. I think the audience are not just looking for a replacement of the music gathering but a connection between bodies over the airwaves. I think what people are looking for from radio stations such as us Right now, it's a sense of resonance with other bodies that works outside of physical limitations. Here's Frankie from Foundation FM. It's all a challenge, but one thing I love about radio is that it's a medium that can be shaped and moulded because of the internet and online. We can make whatever we want. I feel really lucky that Foundation FM is still able to run and the DJs are still really committed to us and we commit to them. And I think now more than ever, we've realised that community is really important. Marco from Radio Rahim. The audience, I think, is looking for something in a radio, which is easy. So the audio is like a book. you still have your own imagination you can have it on the background and relax and the audio is also something comforting and something you can leave your mind a little bit of And the radio, I think, has this power of something more easy. Especially now, you can leave it in the background, you can let yourself, like, you're flowing in a river and you end up doing nothing. There's flux. And Hannah Walker-Brown. Radio right now is like the friend that... You know, you don't see all the time. Maybe you're not as close as you used to be. But when the shit hits the fan, they're always there for you. And I think that's what it has become. It's become that person that will always step it up when you need it. But it's not bothered if you're like... you know, you go and do films for a bit or TV, it will just always be there. And I just think it's thriving. I think we all need pals like that, you know? And I think maybe what we're also starting to realise is it's not like the format itself, but it's just people talking and sharing and listening. And they're like essential practices and they'll get you through just about anything. to get through anything like talking to each other listening to each other and sharing our experiences so yeah I think that's what what radio is right now you Thanks to all our contributors on this month's edition of The Hour.
