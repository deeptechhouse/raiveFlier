Get, get, get, get. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week on the Exchange we head to Mutech Festival in Montreal for a live interview with Gudrun Gut. She was an architect of the "Guinea de la Tonten" era of Berlin subculture, which was one of the most fertile and influential times in the creative history of the city. An early member of Einsturz und Neubauten, she soon founded Mania D and Malaria, both of which are still considered landmark acts in German post-punk history. But this only marked the beginning of a long and winding career defined by independence, experimentation and agitation. Significantly, her moniker label and collective of female artists prefigured the modern-day rise of musicians organizing around gender representation. But as we hear in this conversation with R.A.'s Andrew Rice, this sort of attitude has come naturally to Goethe for over 30 years. Despite the myriad changes she's witnessed, an effortless authenticity still runs through everything she does. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Gudrun Gutt is up next. *music* So I'm here with Goodwin Good, who is the pioneer of all kinds of music, especially electronic music. from Germany, started many bands, has an illustrious solo career, runs a label called Monika Enterprises. I think she's one of the pivotal forces in Berlin for the last 30, 40 years. So you just finished a tour for your new album, Moment, last year, right? The album is kind of in between, it's kind of like cold wave, kind of synth pop, kind of down tempo. maybe like a little techno. After like four, five decades in this music, where do you see yourself in the electronic music world? What role do you occupy? Actually, when I started, I played drums and cork. So I didn't start with pure electronics, but in the 80s, it was pretty normal to have like... electronic involved but drums was more like my physical kind of thing and the synthesizer was more the head thing and I'm still trying to combine like a physical experience with a little bit sophistication but I don't I wouldn't put my music in a kind of a genre I don't know What do you consider to be sophistication in music? Like stuff which is kind of exciting, you know, which is not copied too much or like, you know, something I've heard thousands of times, something which is a little bit more original or I don't know. Your new album kind of strikes me as being like kind of retro sounding, but also not. And I was wondering, like, what kind of stuff inspires you now to make your new music? With the album, actually, I'm a pretty busy girl, like, you know, with the label. And then, you know, I do the Monika Werkstatt and this and this and this. And I had a project coming up which failed. So I had suddenly I had two months kind of free. I applied for some project and it didn't work out. So I thought, oh, I have two months free. I can do my album. I can do a new album. So that was really wonderful. I just went to the studio and my first thing was I wanted to go away from this. computer-based recording. So I, because of recent years already, I got more like little analog stuff. Going kind of back where, how I started actually, I found this old Korg MS-2000, actually not the 20, and I recovered and I thought, oh, check it out again. You know, got a little bit into the old stuff because I wanted to have I just thought it doesn't really make sense to do an album anyway you don't make any money with it it's kind of it's a luxury so if I have if I take the do this luxury work I do what kind of excites me and that was more playing around with analog stuff and you know connecting it and then I got myself this really cool little new synthesizer and just trying stuff out recording it then with Ableton and editing it down like you know producing it finishing it up But it was a lot of just real improv and being free about the work and just let it flow kind of thing, which was very good for me. I already have so much history in my body. I think I can do pure techno. I couldn't do it because it wouldn't be natural because I come a little further back. You said you've been busy lately. What else have you been working on aside from the album and the tour? The Monika Bergstadt. I mean, I have the label, two labels, Moabit Music and Monika Enterprise. And the new, the extension for me is Monika Werkstatt. This is a collective work with 10 or more women out of the label context who do play together. So we do, first we started, it's kind of a feministic thing as well. We started out doing the Werkstatt combined with talks where we had to talk about how we work because, you know, it had to do with a visibility project from female pressure. Because mostly people can't imagine that women do work in the studio kind of thing. And so we wanted to just talk about our work. That was part of the first Werkstatt things. Where we said how we record, how we arrange our life as an artist and stuff like this. So we had four to five... female producers, solo producers, sitting together and talking openly about their work. Then we did, like, presented it, like... each of us played a short solo set and then we improvised together and now this extended we don't do the talks anymore and we're sick of the talks and so we only do super experimental improv sessions Last year we had a Berlin edition where we always invited for the Werkstatt. We did a couple of Werkstatt in Berlin in more underground places where each of us maybe wouldn't play because they don't have any... They don't pay. But we wanted to play these places as well. And then we invited friends, female musicians. Each artist invited one friend. So it extended into a bigger collective. It was pretty cool. And we got to know, each of us got to know different artists again. And it's super cool. Nice. Why is the idea of collective important to you? For me, especially in music, as an art form, it totally makes sense because it's really the only art form where you can do things together. You can create something in a collective. I don't like the band idea so much, but it has to do maybe with the band as well, but it's not so, like, collective is bigger. Like, you know, it can, it's extending, like, so you can have different people in there, and then they go, and because everybody is busy, so, you know, some doesn't have time, another one goes in. and you learn from each other. It's always very inspiring. And how does recording that work when you have tens of artists who are all working together and improv-ing in various sessions? How do you turn that into a finished track? We had a Monika Werkstatt session in the studio. We have a house in the countryside close to Berlin. And we have a big studio, a big room, small studio but big room. So we all met there over three, four days. And Mo Loschilder from MediaLoka was there as well. She was cooking. Luckily. And people just went in and out. You know, Lucrezia Doll came one day later. Barbara Morgenstern had to leave one day earlier. And then sometimes there were all of us in the studios, sometimes only two. And then we recorded and recorded and recorded. And afterwards... Me and Antje, A.G.F., Antje Greyer, Fuchs, Ripati, went through the whole recording and each of, no, before we listened to the staff and each picked like something they wanted to work on and each artist took like two pieces and finished it up. produced it, finished the production. So that was the Monika Werkstatt album. Because I didn't want to have a pure improv, you know, first improv and then make a record out of it. Didn't seem the right stuff to do. And I wanted to use the fact that they all are producers. So, and I wanted to hear what each one comes up with. So some of it is like a remix. Some of it is like a pop production. It's very different depending on the artist. For you, is there a different feel or energy when it's all women in the room or all women involved? I mean, obviously it's a big part of your career is empowering women. You yourself used the word empowering before and your label, Monica Enterprises, is for releasing music by women. And I was just wondering, like when you're at... advocacy, and mission to empower women started? Very egoistic reasons. Because when I started out, you know, I was pretty young. I'm in this, like, since I'm 20 and I'm 62 now. I was like, oh, God. And I thought it was the punk movement, and I thought, now everything is going to change. It's all equal. And there were lots of women at that time, but then they all disappeared. And I thought, something is wrong. When I was 30, I thought, this is not right. Something is different. Even in the 80s, we were looking for listening to music, to older music, old blues, or what is done. And then I realized it's only men. Why is there only men? But there were women, because there were lots of women in the blues as well, and writing music as well. but they never got popular. They were under the carpet. And I didn't like that because I was an artist myself and I wanted to... It's egoistic. Just because... I wanted to be equal. And so how did you start going about that, like with the projects to empower and feature women artists? When I started the label, because, you know, I got inspired by female artists myself. and I get approached by a female artist because I'm a female artist. So I got approached by a good musician and then I didn't know, because I'm not so good with business, I didn't know really how... how to do this label if it's not for me because Moabit was re-releasing our stuff. If I release other people's music, it's different. And then I informed myself and they said, you have to find a niche. And I said, oh, the niche is female music in this world. And that's why I kind of thought, oh, maybe that's a good business kind of plan. Was that like a radical idea at the time? The label is like 22 years old now, right? Yeah, I don't know if it's... We started in 97. At that time, a lot of labels started. I don't know if it was radical. It just was my interest. I got pretty sick of it after a while because, you know, in every interview I had to talk about why I signed female artists, but not the other labels had to do that. You know, the others were 99%. who signed only male artists. Do you feel like the electronic music and experimental music, has it gotten better in the last 22 years for representation? How has it changed since you started Monika in terms of women being represented? I think female pressure was really important. counted the fact studies they did. Female Pressure is a female composer, producer, non-binary as well, non-binary and female kind of feminist mailing list of producers and artists and bookers, whatever, you know, in the electronic music field. And actually it started with MUTEC. MUTEC was a very important part of it because a lot of composers and producers wrote, oh, MUTEC Festival, I'd love to play there, but they're only men again. And then we kind of started, yeah. And then we said, yeah, I mean, that's strange. But this other festival has only men too. And then we started counting the festivals, like how many female, how many male acts, just by curiosity. And then we were shocked by the results, that it was 90% male all over the world. Except Sweden. Sweden was much better. And then we said, okay, this is kind of important news. We have to kind of do a press release for this. And everybody was really busy. The whole female pressure group was super engaged. So we did a press release and we did a festival in Berlin, female pressure festival. We had a talk with CTM, for example, and other festival promoters. And they first didn't understand it. What are we talking about? But now CTM has 50% quota. They realize after a while, it takes a while. And even I have a lot of friends from the music scene, electronic music, male friends and female, but male a lot. They didn't want to talk about the question. because they said electronic music doesn't have sex. So I don't know about that. So it took a while. And I think now there's a bigger awareness. And then other people picked up on it. The press picked up. I think in general every female being wants to be equal. And now they can drive in Saudi Arabia. Do you think that there are more resources now for women in electronic music? Actually, a friend of mine complained. He said, oh, since they all book now female artists, they don't book me so much anymore. I said, I'm really sorry. But it's really important. I think that even... It's not a quality question. I think it's important to give female artists a chance. to perform because every performance you do and that every musician can agree with this you get better you learn so much you don't learn so much rehearsals are important but shows are super important One show is like 100 rehearsals, you know, because the mistakes you can make and how it is actually to perform it, it's super important. And so I think festivals and clubs should see that they do a female quota. In Berlin, this one club did a 100% quota for one year. because they looked at the last years in their history and they thought, wow, if we want to get even with the female quota, we have to do 100%. So that was kind of nice. Ausland. You said before that working on your new album was like a luxury because there's not much point in making an album anymore. I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. It's really hard to make an income with an album. I mean, with the label too. You don't sell CDs anymore except in Japan. vinyl costs a lot to make it, so you don't make any money on, just on the money side, it's like, I think all the eclectic new labels are done by rich people. I'm not rich. So as someone who makes a lot of different kinds of experimental music and is involved in a lot of quite obscure musical projects, how do you make a living off of it? How do you get by? A lot through live concerts. mostly through gigs. And so, you know, you said now there's obviously a lot more opportunity for women in electronic music being booked on lineups. There's more presence, but it's harder to make money. So as the industry has changed, has it gotten better for you or worse for you over the last few decades with the recording industry changing? The last 10 years I've very much concentrated again on my artist life. So what is better, what is worse? I don't know. I enjoy my life, actually. And financially, it's better these years. But there are always, as an artist, there are ups and downs. You've got to live with it. I'm used to it. I feel like you're a pioneer in a lot of ways and a lot of things, but you don't always get a lot of recognition for it. And I was wondering if you feel like you yourself. I recognize for what you've done in music. I don't see myself so much as a pioneer. I don't know. But I guess. Sometimes I feel like, I feel a little frustrated, but doesn't everybody do that? Feel frustrated about, you know, stuff? I don't know. I think in general, female artists, musicians, writers, whatever, need... much more recognition. Yeah, in general. I wouldn't put it only on me. All right, so you've been making music in Berlin since before the wall came down. And I was just wondering, you were there for the start of techno and raving in Berlin. And I was wondering if you were involved in the techno scene, dance music scene at all. late 80s, early 90s, what your experience was. I lived in Berlin, so sure, you know, we went out clubbing, lots of clubbing, and I did some experimental loop performances. I had a loop machine and like this kind of more like experimental stuff. Then I did the members of the Ocean Club album. It's more pop production, but with electronics. And with the album, we had a club in Berlin, the Ocean Club at Tresor, every Sunday. Upstairs was Ellen Elion with Tannit, and we were downstairs with the Ocean Club. But we were more like the eclectic thing. with wire music and like different kind of... We had a mermaid and it was more like... It was pretty cool, actually. It was like, in those days, the club always had the dance floor and then the lounge. In the lounge, they did all the experimental stuff. And later with the Ocean Club, we always did the lounge. at the WMF. So we did club events. Yeah, lots of club events. But different club events. And we traveled with the Ocean Club as well. It was a collective as well. With DJs Thomas Philman, Chica Paula, Mike Vamp. Sun Electric and different people coming in and out and we invited other artists. So we did this club stuff and then in 97 we got a radio show, the Ocean Club Radio, which is still, like people still love it in Berlin. It was officially on Radio 1. for 15 years or something, me and Thomas Feldman together did the show. He's a really good music collector. He's a collector and a selector as well. And we did it together. And you said before, at this point, you couldn't just make techno. It wouldn't be satisfying to you or natural to you. Are you still interested in dance music? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm interested in some dance music. I'm very much looking forward to see who RQS is. Is this right pronounced, who RQS? I really like the stuff. It's really cool. Some stuff I really like, some stuff I don't. Not so. And also, I've noticed an undercurrent of an interest in pop music. Some of your stuff is kind of like pop music. You said Ocean Club, there is some poppy stuff. So is pop music one of your passions as well? Yeah, I was thinking about that. I think it's not a real passion, but it always comes through. Because I think there was always, I have a pop affinity. So I don't like normal pop music. But like if it has a twist or if like if. Yeah, I guess I can't shake it. It's there. I don't like hard techno so much. And I don't like house so much, strangely. On your new album, there is a lot of singing and talking. And there's a lot of German lyrics also. Yeah. what are you singing about and talking about in German? What are the songs about? Because obviously a lot of electronic music does not have vocals, and I feel like your music is very vocal heavy. Yeah, it's more a little spoken word kind of stuff. It's pretty association kind of associative lyrics. For example, I have one startup, it's called Startup Hole. And it's just about like, you know, you want to fly high kind of thing. But then you're kind of... falling into a hole because you fly too high, kind of, and suddenly like, oh, I hope the hole is not too deep, and this kind of thing. And then, you know, because there's a lot of people that have a startup these days, and at first you think, wow, great, and then, ooh, it didn't work out. So this kind of little, you know, Gegenwart, like present stuff, what's in the air and put it into like, oh, the baby, I can drive my car in Saudi Arabia. It's kind of, you know, taking little things from the, from reality, putting it into a fantasy. Do you think there's humor in your music? Is that important to you? I'm not English. So Germans don't have humor, actually. That's what they say. So, you know, when you get older, it's like everything is getting a little bit, it's not so serious anymore. Do you enjoy that, like not taking yourself too seriously? Oh, yeah. I love it. Because it does seem like not German. No, that's not true. That's not true. But it's, yeah, I enjoy getting older very much because, you know, when you're young, oh, God, now it's like I already lived my life in a way. And so I'm much more relaxed about things. I get really mad sometimes, but still much relaxer than... And I'm not afraid of things anymore. Or, you know, love can't kill me kind of thing. You've been making music for like 40 years now. You're in your early 60s. experience and your age now has that changed the way you approach writing music? Sure. How? I don't know. This is hard to explain because if you have, you can't really explain experience because I experienced a lot of different times. I experienced the 80s with all this kind of punk stuff, then the 90s with the techno, then the zero years with the kind of networking beginning, and then the... tenor with social media, you know, every kind of ten years is like very different. And if you experience the part, you feel older. And then, you know, if people now do like 80s music, I think that's ridiculous. It doesn't sound right. And why copy something which was already there? I don't get it. And how do you keep music exciting for yourself after doing it for so many years? This is a very good question, but I never, I don't know, because it's always, if it's worn out for me, for my taste. then it doesn't excite me. So it has to be something a little bit... And for the last album, for me, I changed my life set up totally. Now, what you saw last night was totally different from the last show, but I didn't want to play the last show anymore, so I didn't do any solo concerts the last two years. And then I changed the live setting with like all this gear. You know, actually, this is how stupid can you be? Because when I started... After playing drums, I was the one with a lot of carrying around as a drummer. And then my aim was to have a really little luggage, you know, just fly there with a little suitcase and good. And now I have luggage again. It's like... Going back. I'm going back. You know how old people get a little bit childish? I'm going that way. I'm a teenager now. What drove you to go and kind of like that, going back to the old equipment? Because I was really sick of staring at the computer all day. Especially because every kind of work you do has to do with the computer. So you always look in this computer. And then even if you do music, that was just going too much for me. So I wanted to have a little bit more, free myself off the computer. That was the main aim. All right. It might be a bit of a large question just for the end, but the question is, could you maybe elaborate a little bit on how you start, you know, how do you find this inspiration? How do you be creative? You know, kind of, it is a natural part of my creativity. I would put it that way. Because I don't really, I don't look for it, it comes to me. You know, because I'm bored. If I'm not excited about something, I'm not doing it. You know, I don't do a concert where I don't want to, I don't play at a festival I don't want to play. I don't do all. No, we don't do that. I mostly do stuff I want to do. Because actually I never, I think one part is I never was under the pressure of being commercially successful because I'm out of the line. You know, as a female artist, I could always do what I wanted because nobody cared. So that helped going this way. I had to make always my own decision. Sorry to ask another question. I don't know if you've played a lot outside of Berlin in Germany. The music scene in Berlin, do you think there's a big impact on how it affects how you're writing? Or do you think you could play anywhere else in the world and still have it be just as interesting? Does the location of where you live affect how you write? Or is it just the people you're surrounded by? Not anymore. I don't think not anymore because I'm too old. But it used to be very important. My surrounding used to be very important. And I guess it is still. But it's not as important anymore as it used to be. I just want to backtrack a second to that last little thread. I was hearing in your response around the creativity question a lot of integrity is kind of what I heard a description of. And that ties into that answer you gave about being brave. And so I'm thinking about as someone who is some decades behind in a career. Have you ever negotiated that integrity and learned to follow that path because of faltering or have you just always inherently felt that way? I couldn't answer that question. Sorry, but it's nice. I think there's a sense in the... histories of collective artist structures that maybe competition is the enemy of the collective goal. collective artists working and I'm wondering with your extensive experience in multiple communities multiple collective organizations as well as like you know multiple genres what maybe your experience with competition whether it's yourself or or the context that you find yourself working in has been I think competition is not so it's always there in collective as well I think it's always there But you have to, it's very complicated. Because competition, there's a little bit competition, like, you know, where you can, like, oh, she's doing that. I want to do that too. It kind of can be inspirational and kind of pushes you, because pushing is not so bad, I think, to get things going. But then if it's too much, it shuts you down. If it's just like, oh God, typical capitalism. competition. No. But a little bit is cool. But this is a collective. The collective is really good because there you can balance it nicely. So if one is too... Because especially in our Monika Werkstatt, we are all solo artists. So everybody has their little issue. But we all know we can't really live it out because it wouldn't work. If we would be super egomanic, the collective is not working. So we all have to kind of go back a little with our ego and that's the way a collective is really good. I really like that. it and then sometimes it's good but you can't just always hold back you have to go and give something you know be a little bit brave and go for it but then don't you know it depends what kind of competition kind of stuff but you know what I mean Hi, Goodwin. Thank you so much. I have a question. As I age, I become increasingly aware of or interested in the boundaries, especially in the music industry, around ageism and gender. And it seems that you've managed to squeak through okay. It's really strange too, because normally, yeah. But I'm pretty openly saying how old I am now too, because they all look at me and say, oh, she's not a teenager. It's obvious. And so, you know, if you just handle it openly, I think it's totally okay. But I'm surprised in my age to do this concert still. It's kind of weird. Well, and you also work with women of multiple generations as well. I mean, are you discussing that as an issue? I had a little talk with Peaches recently who was talking about ageism and she's also someone who's been able to still have a career and we made jokes about Madonna and all that. But for younger women to see through their artistic career that it doesn't have longevity and is there advice about longevity? Peaches was saying that ageism is kind of this new final frontier for women artists. I have no idea. I'm just surprised myself because it's all new kind of territory and society changes. And I think... I'm not sure how it is in America, but in Germany, like my generation, it's a big population. It's the biggest population. So maybe that helps too. You know, I don't know. It's new because I remember my mother at my age, she was... preparing for a pension. But it depends what kind of a job you have. I don't know. But I think now you get much older if you live a healthy life. Which I don't. I don't know. I don't think too much about it, but it's surprising. I would never, I mean, when I was 20, I was thinking like 30 is horribly old. I never imagined being 30, and now it's like far beyond. I would like to know how has your perception of the audience changed across your career? When you started, would you pay attention to the crowd or would you just focus on what you're presenting? And right now, yesterday, how was your interaction, your perception of the audience when you're performing? I think it was always the same. I mean, when I started, we ignored the audience. 80s, you know, kind of. And we did like really crass music. So we didn't please the audience, you know, for we were kind of. So we had to be really kind of. we do what we do. It doesn't matter what you think about it because people didn't understand it. But then it got better and people now, I like a very, personally, I prefer, I played a lot of theaters too where people sit. I don't like it so much. I like it better like last night where people are like, you know, dancing a little, drinking and, you know, having fun and reacting. It's much better. It's much more exciting. And theater is always like, oh, you know, really quiet. to your heart.
