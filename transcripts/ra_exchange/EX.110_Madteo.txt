Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's conversations with the artist labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Mateo is a man who wanders in conversation. We're warning you now. If you're familiar with his music though, you'll quickly realize that it should be expected. Mateo's approach to just about everything in the world is a bit different to our own. But whether it's with his collaborations with rapper Sensational or his association with underground house labels like Workshop, Sex Tags Mania, and Hinge Finger, it's obvious that the New York-based producer is courting the right type of attention. With an upcoming full-length due on Socko, we're willing to bet that will only continue. R.A.'s Jordan Rothling caught up with Matteo in New York in July to talk about all of this and more. Before we met today, I know you told me that what you usually do on Saturdays is go visit this flea market. You go just about every Saturday. But you told me when you came in today that you ended up not going to the flea market. Today. Yeah. Why not? Oh, you're getting me excited about the stuff that's waiting for me home now. Yeah, I know. So basically, I usually go to the flea market. And what happened yesterday, I was coming from the basement in my... building and I saw big stacks of LPs. So I dropped my grocery bags. I'm quickly scanning through these stacks and you know I see gold. I mean gold. Gold of like gatefold LPs. You know a lot of jazz. I live in a building with a lot of older professionals. Many are intellectuals, people who have either teaching positions or writers. There's quite a lot of interesting older. characters and I'm not surprised yeah in Jackson Heights but then I go upstairs I'm like you know I've already gotten dusty you know fingers by the time I'm up on the sixth floor and I drop you know I get into the kitchen I put everything in the refrigerator and like I'm already like you know Like, you know, anxious going through this stuff and putting them on, cleaning them. And I find these records that are just ridiculous. So no flea market today. No flea market today. I just came back to see you, man. But happily, because I'm like, wow. I was like, wow. So I was thinking about pairing this set for this upcoming Boiler Room appearance. thought that wow i just stumbled on the perfect pile of records yeah to make a an interesting sounding if a little bit um you know smart ass kind of like uh um uh i guess um you know jazz sort of a free jazzy with some classics thrown in um yeah i like to do that this kind of like find piles of records and then end up in a place that has decks and just like clean the records and make these like improvised sets that's pretty much what i've been doing for the past uh since 2006 um i found i was told i was i was um what do you call it um reminded by this um you know the Chelsea flea market area everybody knows that but it's it's all kind of gone indoors since they build up those famous empty lots there are no more they're all condos now yeah exactly so but there's one which has remained that's still outdoor which is the the one on the parking lot and that's the one that you go yeah of course and I was found out about that I was at Academy Records in the East Village. through this guy who was digging through the $1 bins. And he knew everything. Put a freaking wiry kid, not wiry, sort of middle-aged, early middle-aged, what I'm approaching now. That was six, seven years ago. So anyway, he said to me, oh, this, this, you got that, you got that. No, I didn't have barely any of them. The ones that I kind of... was suspicious about i was like putting aside but he he knew a lot more than me so he kept like make sure you get that man make sure that's a hot one that's how i went so i picked up 30 records because of this guy and i was like dude man thank you so much and he's like you know you're you know about that place on 25th street i'm like i was like dude i work on 24th street 25th and what between 5th and 6th. I'm like, damn, I worked on 24th between 5th and 6th. That's where I'd go play records. I was going to Academy, buy a few records, and then go to the store. I mean, I had enough music, but just my weekly money budget was... going on a lot of used records at Academy back then so I was a man thanks for the tip and by the way what's your name he's like my name is victim but they call me classic Vic I was I think I did must have asked him for his phone number anyway the point is he hooked me up with this little tip which I obviously I knew about that flea I mean I knew of it. I have been going there since then every weekend and it's one stall, one guy from East Harlem and a lovely character who's very very widely respected in the... it's like the life of the party in this flea market you know. So I really literally like to... go there partly because of their records yeah but but but also just to go and say hello to this guy and hang out and hear him you know loudly um um offering uh his his wares to The usual characters, because these places are frequented by heavy regulars. There are people who go there, they have these habits of going there to look at the same stalls like I do. I look for records, other people look for the other stuff, but there are very interesting characters. There are a lot of loners, city Manhattan people who've literally grew up here, but they don't steal. speak much English, you know what I mean? Whether they're like old Russian Jews or Puerto Rican guys, you know what I mean? Or Italian-Americans who still speak with that thick Italian-American accent and they're kind of off the boat, you know, but they're not really... Well, I can see, though, this practice of going to this flea market or, you know, to buy... Yeah. happen on purpose you don't try to make them happen yeah they just happen to you yeah and this flea market approach seems kind of like a big part of your process then yeah yeah it's it's funny enough it all happened when um um I just started having very little money, like no money. So it was, you know, before I was spending like 50 bucks a week on music, you know, for a long time. I mean, for many years, for decades or something, almost. You know what I mean? Right. But you can't you can't pay for something that just comes along and happens to really to really change your sound or for somebody to just come along and really change your entire career. My understanding is that that's what happened when you met Robbie from Morphine Records. It all happened. Actually. You mentioned Robbie, the same year, it's actually simultaneously while this stuff happened that I discovered this flea market. It was also when, by that time I had been trying to write music, make music, teaching myself how to. However, it had been already a few years that I had done it and I was still feverishly looking to buy records and looking for records. But I still hadn't found this spot which became my only spot. with this economic deprivations that I've had losing this gigs that I had business that I had and becoming pretty much poor you know I'm like you know I mean I'm poor and I mean I'm very lucky because I You know, I own real estate in New York City. I mean, it's a small place, but, you know, most people can't say that. I'm still, I mean, I'm still pretty way, way under the economic radar, you know, like. barely able to pay maintenance for my co-op apartment. Straight up. Maintenance in a co-op apartment in New York is pretty much like a fucking rent. It's not exorbitant, but I'm also in Queens, not in Williamsburg or something. Right. That would have really... That would have really been something. The connection that I guess I'm making between finding records at a flea market, finding records that just sort of fall into your lap, and making that really great connection with Robbie from Morphine Records. Yeah, no, totally, man. Yeah, I guess it seems like... Oh, it's falling into the lap. Falling into your lap. It's nothing that you would have necessarily... expected to have happened. You and Robbie actually touched base on MySpace. Yeah, no, exactly. Now you are making me see your connection in your head that you were expressing as far as this thing falling into my life, whether it's records or this guy I call Robbie. who's a Lebanese dude but lives a stone's throw away from my own old stomping ground and like Venice hometown yeah the Venice part of a metro area You know, it's like, you know, it's one of the big metro areas of Italy. Yeah. Of the southern European continent, really, because so you have a lot of stuff going on. But, you know, he he was he is a remarkable character, but he did something remarkable just as historically for what has to do the scene for the time. Italian scene in general, you know, because Italy has never had, has had a very incredible history musically, but, you know, as far as like... club music, house music, it was huge and then I guess you can say in general the house scene was kind of like, got stale, you know what I mean? Like in the 90s it was all great and then like, but the late 90s, I hear more people have related to this, people have been around and following this music, you know. I felt, you know, disinterested after a while. by the mid-90s. He did something amazing having been there and being a digger from his own... and and and kind of liking music and and feeling this innate uh inherent necessity to um uh be a wholesome digger you know like you're you know you're yeah you go to the club because you listen to house music and that's cool and that's what's cool and techno but but you You basically are a music lover. You're not happy to listen to one, two, three or four kinds of music. You want to hear as much as possible. And you force yourself. You have to force yourself. So Ra, not that he was the only one doing it, but... because he's such a visionary guy and he took it upon himself to learn how to craft a sort of sound for himself first and then start recording. labels blah blah blah you know he did something okay techno of a certain kind then he has this jazz project a jazz label then he had this this venue that he kept on open that he opened and created and then you know lasted about a year only but then in any case uh he made all of stuff happen the connection with me it's incredible yes it's like um almost... You told me that Robbie's reputation had sort of preceded him before you got in touch with him on MySpace, that you had heard about this Lebanese guy living in Venice who was involved in this kind of music. Yeah. And who got in touch with who first? Funnily enough, he did. He got in touch with you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, he definitely was the one writing me. I might have asked for a MySpace friendship or something like that, you know, but I'm pretty sure he was the first to actually write me a note, you know what I mean? Something like that. I definitely never asked him, hey, man, check out my stuff. I mean, my stuff is up on MySpace. I don't even have to tell you it's there. But the point is, it just happened in this... you know, as natural way as I guess it can happen in this internet world. But the interesting connection was that there were two people in two different parts of the world that were, one was an internet acquaintance of mine, a German kid. The other one was an old friend who was, you know, living in New York and being a jazz drummer. and going back and forth, keep on telling me, oh, this guy, and then, you know, it ended up being the same guy that the German kid was telling me about for at least one or two months. maybe even two years before I ended up being contacted by this Robbie guy. And I was like, man, you know, people have been talking about you, man. You know, what's up? That's wild. Well, and he released your very first record. Yeah, yeah. Basiado Beatdown with Sensational. With Sensational. Right. Yeah. And then ended up putting out your first full length. So far, your only full length. So far, my only... for like that right well that's pretty funny it's all happened in I think 2005 maybe is when me and Robbie started talking the 12 inch came out in 2007 so you know there was at least a year maybe a year and a half of of talking back and forth listening for him listening to stuff and making comments and stuff and you know the point is that um um the relationship that is established between um people like uh Robbie which are not most people who run labels are not necessarily has uh everybody's really you know a hope you know into their things you know but there's there's something that defines and it sort of explains the fact that he makes also that kind of music and his label is that kind of label those records are those kinds of records if you hear him DJ he is that kind of DJ you know I mean So for me, as a total novice, trying to teach myself how to create some things that sound at least decent enough. part of the artistic development is born out of the encouraging either words, you know, the fact that these people want to put your music out. That's what I live for. You know, it's like, I don't, you know, everybody releases music. I could make my own label. I could put on my own records. I mean, literally, I mean, I don't really have maybe the funds, but I could get the funds, you know, to... press a label and make my own white label Mateo records you know what I mean I just I just not I just I just I'm just not that confident that You know, I don't, I prefer, like, you know, dabbling, you know, or toiling away for, like, you know, years and making a pile of stuff and then maybe, you know, hear of about and get into a label, you know, maybe, you know, basement records. Maybe $1 finds, I find, you know, this label. Let's see, oh, cool record, you know, let's see what. it's still around and then maybe it's a little label you know what i mean like stuff that like that happens like that where uh of course you know everybody wants to be on such and such label but everybody knows that they're probably receiving you know thousands of demos every week Yeah, it sounds like what really made the difference with Robbie was that he was giving you a lot of feedback on the music that you were sending him. Yeah, exactly, exactly. Do you feel like that experience of getting to work with him at that early point in your production career made you a better producer? Yeah, of course. I mean, because they're all, you know, it's a learning experience. So, I mean, inherently. that's going to make you a better person or producer in this case well yeah yeah better because the experience yeah but especially because of him being the person and not some other guy in for example That label that initially had expressed interest and asked me, you know, like, you know, really, please keep sending us stuff. And I did send them like tons and then never got. But that label to me is worthless now. Not because they, you know, didn't go for my stuff, but because of what that label turned out to be for me. This other guy, Rob, whatever. he's been doing and he's doing it makes me it's exciting because he you know I have so much more I look up I look up to him so much more than what maybe that other label was doing ended up doing you know what I'm saying yeah yeah well he was meant to he was meant to be in other words yeah and he he really took you under his wing it sounds like yeah at a really critical moment. But before you could even, before you even began producing, it was a long road to that point. You came to New York. in the mid-90s. Yeah. Straight out of high school. Yeah. More or less. But you were not producing at that point or even DJing at that point. No, exactly. You were going out to parties. I was going out to parties. What was the scene like at that time? What I liked about it, my... was more the experience of living in the heavily Hispanic area of Manhattan and the dichotomy that was living in this area, which was very close to Fifth Avenue, you know, right here. where you have patrician dwellings and you have this few blocks away, you have kind of like an island of a bit of desperation. a bit of poverty, anarchism, you know, squatters, vacant lots being populated by older nerd wells, you know what I mean? Sure, this was Alphabet City before Giuliani really cleaned it up. Yeah, he had started, but you know how New York is all about pockets, you know? Yes, absolutely. It's like blocks. Some blocks are iller than others. And I was lucky enough to happen to live, which is that time that I was talking about my friend, my roommate, a New Zealand kid, being the one who was buying his first couple of, his first 12. and piling up records and coming home and we listened to all this stuff. So that was the time and this block was particularly a very colorful block. If a bit dreary looking and shabby, you know what I'm saying? We had three vacant lots in one block. Anyway, so that... Making, starting to make music, yeah, it was almost 10 years went by, you know, 10 years went by. But DJing a little bit and then, funnily enough, I was in a relationship which ended up in a nice gift from my ex-girlfriend. wife now but it was like my 27th birthday i was djing up here on uh uni square you know um the coffee shop um downstairs there's a thing called the unit square lounge and I didn't know it, but it was a Jellybean Benitez wife. And Jellybean Benitez owns, they're together, they own both spaces. And his lounge, they hired me as a DJ for six months. I was there. I turned 27. I got this little doctor sample gift. Dr. Sample is that boss, little SP-303, I think it's called. That's how I started making music. That was probably 2002, 2003. Another really wonderful sort of thing that happened by chance. Yeah, it was great because my ex-girl was like, she loved great music and music that I didn't know so much. She hooked me up with a lot of New York stuff and then her brother-in-law is the the husband of her sister was a musician. He probably suggested this was a cool piece, a little toy almost, to learn how to chop up samples and make beats. I'm still pretty technology deficient in a way. I'm not very good at... learning. I'm not really a tech wizard, you know, or a computer, I'm sorry, I've never been one of those computer kids. Even in the era of Commodore 64, I had just the basics and to just play games. I never got deep in trying to like... program and stuff like that so for me learning how to make tracks on a reason program which I tried to learn maybe a couple of years previously I had never gotten around it because it was too much to to take in at once you know when having a little beat box you know you're chopping you know you literally have drums and pads it makes so much more sense to uh to just start like uh and and yeah it was pretty much uh that's it man that was it from from from that moment i pretty much it took me six months to actually even take that thing out of the box and then like i remember one night i chopped up It's kind of funny because that was the era of early... You know, from the late 90s to early 2000s. The late 90s, I rediscovered kind of like house music after... you know, being in the East Village and listening to everything but really house music, you know, it was hip-hop. Hip-hop and, you know, it was kind of like the golden age, you know. I mean, you know, I moved here when the Illmatic, Ready to Die, you know. all the great hip-hop, Gangstar, the first Jay-Z record. It was great times for hip-hop. And that's what you heard, literally, of... boomboxes in street corners in this village. And that and crazy Latin salsa music, which that's one of the things I loved about living in that because it made me understand what the value of that music, how powerful it is and how amazingly, you know, intricate. It's a lot of stuff going on, but there's incredible, amazing grooves in that music, that Latin. It's basically Afro-Cuban music. So you have such a rich brew of musical influences going at this point that you finally end up getting this doctor's sample box, all this Latin music. that's in your neighborhood, all the hip-hop that's going on at this time, the experience of going to the big house clubs in New York City. So when you finally pull out that box and finally start making music, what kind of stuff are you making? Yeah, basically, exactly. It's kind of related to what I was really into at that time, which... So I had discovered again after this late 90s wave of me being totally into hip-hop kind of like tamed because also how hip-hop changed so I discovered to another New Zealand friend he was like let's go check out this, my friend Eddie's got this crazy hot record from Detroit. It's like this kind of like smoked out like house record by this dude called Moody Man, you know, it was like, it was 96 or 97 when that Planet E compilation and that, so then we totally brought back all these memories. of being 15 in these sweaty after-hours clubs in Italy and listening to the deepest of the deep. house tracks mixed in with other weird stuff that cool DJs will do, you know, whether it was a chatter off a disco break, you know, B-side of a disco record mixed with some crazy house, you know, that vibe Moody Man brought into his production where, you know, it's almost like there's a live element to besides the whole connection with fucking soul. So I got it. really heavily. So I made, when I first made the first, tried to make the first track, I actually tried to totally emulate what I was loving in the feel of these, either Theo Parish or Moody Man records. And I used, I remember, some Gino Socio, like some of those famous disco tracks. And then I used... It was so typical. I got a CD of Gil's Car Heron and I used one of those almost barely arranged tracks. In other words, it's mostly poetry with a very sparse musical arrangement, which fitted the fact that I already had the Gino Socio arrangement. It was a massive electronic disco track. I just looped it up a couple of parts or whatever, and then I laid on... this Gil Scott-Heron thing. That was my first track, man. I worked on, you know, whatever. I mean, I worked for probably weeks or something. That was, you know, I think it's a pretty natural process. You know, you're emulating what you think are the greats, you know, the greats for me. I mean, they still are the greats for me, those guys, you know, Moody Man. But I have to say that... the report with making of stuff and what you're trying to make obviously changes through the years because my taste not only has changed, but I mean, it's more I built, I guess, I built on taste. In other words, I'm still thinking, you know, Moody Man and Theo Paris are legends and I love their records. But obviously, I'm not trying to make... stuff that sounds just like their stuff, you know what I mean? Sure. So I've, I've, I've, I've, I've, I guess I've, I've learned to move on and try to like. it's kind of searching, you know, it's searching for something that's more yours and not like me trying to disassemble a piece of work and make my own, which is still a lot of what I do because, you know, if it's another sampling aspect. I mean, it's still like, you know, you kind of make and break and then remake, you know what I mean? Sure. That's kind of like an infinite, ceaseless process of how many times you have to create and destroy to then remake and redistroy before... that remake becomes like this final remake. But I mean, what is final? It's final, I guess, if it ends up being picked up by somebody and like, oh man, this is great, you know? But literally that. it's only like 0.something percent of what you do because it's all about piling up stuff. And that's what keeps you extremely obsessed and frustrated because you have a ton of shit that's all undone. I have a hard drive full of like half-baked shit. Sure, sure. Do you have a sense, though, of when your music moved to music that was more of your own voice? I mean, it's like the strong feeling that you get of Making, trying to make this stuff happen is always something that has got to come from a very personal spot. So even if subconsciously I use those guys as my sort of like... benchmark you know i mean like standard or whatever uh it's it's something that to me feels like uh it's it's it's my own and not like i uh i i'm just basically trying to uh replicate their sound or somebody else's sound but i think um uh in the past I don't know, man. You know, it's hard to define, but I could definitely tell you that... In the recent couple of years, again, putting the stuff out there, the stuff that happens with the luck that I've had by Robbie putting out my first stuff, and then kind of like that led to the next thing, of course, you know? And then the next thing... next to the other thing. And then it got to the point where, you know, I've been trying to make stuff for a few years. So, okay, you know, then I've known people like Moody Man and Theo for 10 years. I've been listening to their records. This kind of breaking the whole thing down with like... trying to build tracks for tracks and all of a sudden it becomes like where you're taking a sample or or even not a sample but you're taking a one note instead of using okay you have a kick drum Cool kick drum. It's good enough for now. So you leave it here. You need it. You want a 4-4. You have it right there. Punch it in. That's it. Done. And then move on to the next thing, which can be another hi-hat or whatever, you know. Then it became more of doing something like, okay, I have a kick drum. How am I going to make a track out of this one kick drum? You know what I'm saying? It sounds like it's a lot of just gaining more confidence in your own process. Yeah, something like that. I mean, you know, like anything. You got the tree cycle and then you take those little wheels away and you ride your own bike. so I stuff a lot of other stuff has been happening you know especially I have to say getting into Like when that workshop thing was released, I'd gotten a couple of, you know, people interest in my stuff. That seemed like a really pivotal release in terms of building up your profile. Yeah, but I mean, they all were at that point. I mean, I put out like five records. I mean, it's not like I have a very long discography. So they've all been very massively crucial. There are little things that need to happen. You need to have these breaks. I had these breaks and I feel so blessed. And again, I'm as poor as ever, but the point is I'm blessed because... I have this amazing, encouraging and supportive people that I have never even met in my life. But they're, you know, they live across the seas and they have, you know, you know, you know, I have to believe them when they say, man, you know, we don't I don't really write to many people asking for. tracks you know and you know knowing of these labels and doing my own research which doesn't take much on the internet uh i knew that you know they weren't lying to me when they were saying you know i don't really write to producers that much asking for stuff because i get so much stuff and I listen to a lot of stuff, whatever. So, you know, this guy's, you know, an older guy who's been running an indie label with no profit for 20 plus years. Just a labor of love, you know. He has a career in other fields. But he integrates it with his label. And that's the same thing with Sotofet, you know, and his brother. They're basically... real visionary where they see themselves as, like, you know, sound rock, I call it his orchestra, like the ark, you know? It's kind of like, not with any sort of specific goal, but as themselves, as why don't, you know, I like music and I know there are people who like music as much as I do and they're cool. and they have amazing knowledge that I don't have, and they bring in these different things that I love, and they bring them together. So this guy is running different labels, completely different even, but they have this cool thing that makes them similar, which is a complete... You mentioned DJ Soda Fett. Yeah. I know that's been a very important musical relationship for you. Yeah, yeah. Tell me about... Well, it's become in the last year, really, because we met one year ago. Well, tell me about how you guys came to meet. Because of Robbie, I met Andreas from A Cheetah Records, who's a... a German guy who lives in the mountains of Italy. And when I was in Italy, I went to... That was when Robbie had this jazz club, amazing place, you know, that was open... for about one year. One of those nights, this guy Andreas came to meet me, but then I left before he actually got there. He drove like four hours on his little 500 Fiat 500 car. I ended up meeting Stefan because Stefan had been hearing of me from Andreas after me and Andreas became... I guess, you know, email buddies or whatever. I was introduced to his label. He sent me records. I mean, Andreas ended up coming to visit me. Again, these amazing music characters, but they really went out of their way to come and meet me. It's been very inspiring. Like this Andreas at a later visit to Italy. I guess the year later or something. Andrea still living in Italy finally came to visit me one weekend at my parents house while my parents were away for the weekend so we spent a whole weekend and there was a heat wave so we literally didn't leave the house and we just spent the weekend listening to music and making pasta, eating and smoking, watching TV and we became obviously best buddies He brought some Sex Tags Mania records, gave me some of his Acheeto records, you know, became a huge fan right away. Stefan has become a big friend of mine when, you know, he comes to New York and literally the first thing he wants to do is to come to... Queens to meet me. Yeah, you said that he came to New York. You were obviously a fan of his at that point, but that when he came to New York to see you, you hadn't met him yet. Yeah, exactly. He showed up in 82nd Street, Jackson Heights, and I went to pick him up right there at the stop. I took him to my house, and it's funny, we just became buddies, and now we're super buddies, man. such a mastermind dude because he made me he made me pull out the old works like I'm talking about the earliest works the three the stuff with the SP three basically basically literally the first ever things and he was like I mean he's kind of an enthusiast the the enthusiast with the you know capital E this guy you know that's why I think that's why his label is like that and his music sounds like that. He's a perfectionist but knows what he likes. what he wants, knows what he feels, so he's so into it, literally, that's his, that's his, literally, his chlorophyll, you know, his, he breathes this stuff, he's always thinking about it, I told you the story that he came here four weeks, and then, Three days after he got here, he was at my house going through this stuff. Not the earliest works, but he was like, you know what, maybe we can make a 12-inch while I'm here. He made a record. He came to New York without having any intention to make a 12-inch. But within three weeks, he had conceived of, planned, prepared, then mastered, then brought the masters to the... I mean, he probably sent... And made a record, pressed 400 copies. We went to East New York to this pressing plant. And by the time he was ready to go back to... norway whatever the records were uh in a boxes 400 copies on the way to detroit to the distributor who was and you know such an amazing guy uh yeah but the funny thing is um he used this track which i don't think anybody else would have released but so to fit uh it's yeah that hadn't happened in decades have musical friends like buddies like that and I think it's something that I would like to keep you know I like to keep putting out music with people that I can develop relationships like that otherwise it's just a fact of you know like people maybe oh yeah they want to you know it's getting to the point where it's like like uh i don't know when you when you people just want the name you know and it's like Obviously, I'm not some big guy, but I've already kind of sensed that there's a little bit of hype around this Mateo, you know what I'm saying? And it's kind of a turn-off. So I need to now really pay attention to who I'm... dealing with because obviously there's no money and I'm doing stuff you know if I gotta leave my own work which I'm already doing 24/7 because you know somebody wants a track I'm not sure you know why would I want what do you have to offer me because obviously I'm doing my own stuff and yeah luckily I found people put it out but it's coming it's weird this thing with now making it as a you know you have to be professional and do a record or like remixes you know you mentioned just before uh sort of this this hype that surrounds your name now and uh i'm sure that you know i'm a hype uh you you know i mean like it's you know somebody like us i guess you know we sense the hype and we run away you know what i mean right so so you have done yes my my my awkwardness and uneasiness with this sensing as hype around this thing has to do with what I'm doing because I hate, I hate, you know, I hate hype, man. Don't believe the hype, man. You know what I mean? Absolutely. Absolutely. Well, well, I bring it up because I know one of your, I'm sure the workshop release certainly, certainly added. to that hype, but you recently released on Joy Orbison's new label. Yeah, and those guys too, they are... Unfortunately, you know, there are haters. I mean, if you look at that piece, you know, people say overrated. And I think that's bullshit. It's not overrated at all. I mean, those guys are just one of the strongest combos in production outfits. You're talking about the combination of Joy Orbison and Bottega? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they're exciting what they're doing. And the funny thing is that they're such a dynamic, I think, partnership with one becoming from, well, being much, I guess, I don't know the age difference. I know there's a relevant age difference. marked a difference especially when you know being sort of young both of them but one has been around much longer than the other but Joey Orbison is being influenced by his uncle being a drum and bass kind of pioneer you know so being he's an early starter you know joy orbison i'm sure the other one too but in any case uh the other one coming from a um old school music making approach which is meaning racks of gear you know this other kid instead more of a kid you know like me but he's 10 years younger than me but i mean i have that naive kind of like approach to it because i'm making everything in a box or i was making everything in one little piece of you know yeah you can call that sp 303 hardware, but you know, I mean, it's pretty much like a toy, you know? Sure, sure. The thing is, it's fresh because you're relying on a spontaneous composition and it's also limited and limitation is great. So, there are a lot of great things you can do with that. But at any point, they're together, they're making these club tracks and mostly, you know, yeah, they're known as club tracks. They are mostly... club tracks but them are suffering from the same that some people are I mean, there's haters, man. Well, whatever hype surrounds what they do and then what you've done with them because of it, it sounds like the way your release on Hingefinger came to be released was not a product just kind of of that hype cycle. It sounds like you and Joe Orbison had to... a little bit of a relationship before that record ended up coming out. Yeah, I mean, we were talking back and forth, you know, for at least a year. What were you guys, how did that, how did you make that connection with Joyer? The initial connection? Yes. He wrote me. Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, as I said earlier, I don't, after that first... In 2005 sending a few demos. I mean, I might have sent some demos, but I realized man that when you when you when you When you knock on people's doors, I don't know. I mean, labels get shitloads of demos, you know. It sounds like the best way to get noticed is to try not to get noticed and just keep making music. And obviously, I mean, Joy was getting in touch because of... uh the records that i heard yeah and then then we kept in touch and i uh i sent him you know some stuff and then they made comments and uh and then and then and then i eventually found out that they were about to uh the the the release they wanted to do with me was to start a new label which i didn't know until probably a couple of months before the release which had being already a year of us working together via exchanging information. And then I found out about Will and... And who, and a bit of who Peter is, I mean, you know, I've met him once, but he seemed like a pretty guy working in earnest, you know what I mean? Like, pretty much a vocation. Yeah. So, tell me about this forthcoming album. It came about after Ra. In other words, as I was saying, this album, there was only one label that I would have seen a second album to be released. And it would be with Robbie and his Morphine label, on his Morphine. And, you know, the fact is... the while, the whole of 2011, he was, he'd gotten quite busy because he did that album, you know, and that basically... set him off that he was on the road most of the year. This album, Robbie is not going to be releasing it, but the people who are releasing it. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm almost, I'm very scared because I mean, it's a pretty solid... I mean, I know that it's going to be released on this label. Can we say what the label is? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a little sensitive because it's... You know, it's one of those things that you... But I've said it, you know, and I said it, and it's like, it's happening. But yeah, it's Saco who... I basically barely knew. I mean, I knew of Saco, but, you know, they're notoriously hard to find records. So, of course, I was like, man, can you send me some, like, you know, like... package with some Saco releases, you know, I mean, I was like, man, you know, you don't need to send me records you know I take CDs no problem you know so he sent me something like a nice box of like you know Mikavainios and then I had I had been buying like I bought the first Panasonic when they you know the blue one you know on at Academy for probably 10 bucks, original press, or something like that. And so I was getting there, you know what I mean, with this music. Yeah, you can imagine me getting this package of Panasonic and Mick Avani records, and I'm like, how the fuck am I going to make music? That's going with this. I mean, it doesn't have to obviously, but you know, it's going to, if it's going to be released, it will be part of that same catalog. Yeah. Well, and you told me that for the year after you got pitched the project, you were not only exploring the history of this label by listening to all this. all these Saco releases that you were sent, but you were also really producing music that was directly inspired by the Saco catalog. You were also exploring their sound through your own creative process. Yeah, yeah, intuitively, because, I mean, those guys make, they supposedly have, you know, they're gearheads. They're people who come, you know, they've been around since the 80s, you know what I mean? Like, so they probably have... learned their ways around gear, you know, real gear. Me being a total laptop guy, I had to stumble on... on my own faulty ways, or not faulty, but unorthodox ways of generating some particular tone which might recall the signals. that you get from messing with analog hardware. Obviously, in a laptop, it'll sound different, but the point is it shouldn't keep you from trying to experiment. and make something that can be as interesting as anything made with an expensive analog synthesizer. Because, I mean, it's one of my self-jokes that I'm making. That, you know, a laptop... Yeah, you're using a software, right? But the software is inside the machine, which is a hardware. I mean, you talk about hardware, right? You talk about hardware and you think of expensive gear to make music. A laptop is basically, it's not a software, it's a hardware. So it's like in anything, what do you do with this piece of shit? Because, I mean, I found myself with a lot, I mean, I've never used machines, so when I found myself in front of a ton of beautiful... old looking great looking machines I had no idea what to do with it I'm frustrated because you know the computer sounds a certain way sometimes you know it's sometimes very often all the time it's maybe that's why I don't know maybe there's There's an inherent advantage, but it's kind of like an indirect advantage. But me being aware of this deficiency, thinking of, oh, shit, I'm trying to make my stuff sound strong like this. stuff but recognizing that this stuff is all made by real machines and and then sort of kind of There's a conundrum there in my head. It will never come out as strong and as punchy. It's a very well-known fact. Then again, if you try to make your stuff sounding like that stuff that's made with machine, then probably you can't do that. But that doesn't mean that you can't do it. you can't make some very cool sounding stuff. that might not sound like it's made with analog machines. So who cares? I mean, you know what I mean? It's like that you're talking about two different things here. You're not talking about, oh, okay, so if that's where somebody's coming from, it means that that's the rule. The rule is that it has to be the machine generating that sound for you to use. to compose that music. and record that music. That means that you're giving me some rules. And all I thought was that there were no rules. So, see, it's like that's where I'm coming from now. So that's why I am, because of house and techno and all this great disco music, it's made with real machines, I find it hard to replicate that. Even if I think it's probably quite doable. It's just that it doesn't come with me because me, the way I am, my tastes and my ears and my kind of like where I see myself. as far as sounds, you know what I mean? But I'm sure there's tons of great dance tracks which are house techno or disco-sounding tracks which are made on a laptop. I mean, whatever, you know? So it's really not what you use, but the fact that how you use this piece of anything. is really where that stuff is going to come out of more than what you use. I mean, this is the very, very, it's almost getting stale now, this point of view, but it is as irreducible as it is. I mean, it's like, you know, and what you got is how you use what you got, right? My friend Sensational, he, you know, is notorious for his production. for being extremely minimalistic and recording vocals with the headphones and stuff. And it's like he said, use what you got to get what you need. And if I have a laptop, use laptop. But anyway, so Saco, yeah, Saco, hopefully it will come out. But yeah, it's supposed to come out. That's very exciting. And you have more releases coming out as well. Yeah, which is, okay, I have a... A couple of things I'm... Kind of excited about because also they've been in the works for quite a while. I would say at least over in a year is the one that's Will also be my first US release with a label called New Earth kitchen run by Jeremy who is a guy who's been very dedicated to East set up this thing called Made Like a Tree, which is a nice side of... interviews with podcasts and a lot of he's collected a lot of cool artists in there with different visions of their musical visions and I was featuring one of them as a few of my now music friends I've been featuring even 12 from Workshop Records the 100 Records guys I really wish you'd give it a shot with this Made Like a Tree, the 100 Records one. It's amazing because this guy gave him an hour of, you know, unreleased, incredible music. I did the same, actually. I kind of overdid it. It's very typical. Anyway, so Jeremy is doing this label on New Earth Kitchen. And we've been bouncing tracks back and forth for more than a year. The Sotofed remix is done. Also, I have Drezvin, who is Dre with Sven, who is one of my... Drezvin, they're a production team. But Sven is an amazing guy. great tracks. So they are doing another remix. So New Earth Kitchen, I think it will be number 6, 12-inch. Then I have this Wania, you know, the Wania, which is a sub-label of sex tags. The least... until this year. But Wania has picked up speed in the releases. Not that it's catching up with Sextax Mania proper. But it went from being only two releases to being like in six months, they're like five or six now. And there's going to be another one, which should be out already. Like he was supposed to come here and the release was supposed to be already done. But it's going to be, it's actually a sort of a production, but there's this. ridiculous vocal and that's another thing which is kind of funny because it's another another record that only Sothefett and his crew and his label would have been with a release which is literally a 15-minute track with a bass line, a very cool one, a very slight kick drum, because the bass is quite full, so you didn't really need a strong kick drum. And this vocal that I totally came up by... him, you know, asking me to do a vocal, I was not in his studio, I was in his living room doing my own stuff, he was in his studio, office, work, whatever space, and then, you know, after a couple of hours, he's like, hey man, I got something running, come here, check it out, and basically, get the mic, and like, you know, shoot the shit on it, you know what I mean, like, literally like that, and it was such a sound like a loop that he had made it was slight variation in the bass line but in other words nothing really happening very slightly at some point in the arrangement there's something happening but he used my voice I don't know I guess he liked the voice man you know the point is that I was just reading words anywhere. I could grab words. He's got records laying around. up a record i pulled up some um i literally always reading you know the liner notes and i will then make make up my own stuff with um after you know kind of i kind of taught myself a way to to come out with stuff because um i realized that um i did write in some occasions i wrote words attempting to blame them on the music. And it always ended up being unsuccessful because I'm not sure why, but... When I write words, or if you write words, and then even if you write the words, they come from you, then when you are reciting these words, well, you're still reading the words. Let's say you memorize the words. It's not about memorizing the words. Everybody knows that. It's about living those words. So it's almost like... If they're written down, it's already past the time when they're not spontaneous enough. So I'm not an improviser. I'm not some sort of spoken word freestyle rapper at all. But I guess you can tell that I can talk, right? So let's say that I have a situation where, I mean, like that case, I'm in my now good friend Buddy's studio. He's got mad shit happening. Like, it's all hot shit, you know. So there's constant inspiration. And he's giving you a mic with a, you know, fat bass line going. And it's like, yeah, see, talk, whatever. so it goes on for 15 minutes and he's like standing right there he's listening on the thing on the headphones then every every couple of minutes sometimes he'll turn around and he'll give me the he'll give me the his what do you call this thumbs up thumbs up Thumbs up, meaning like, keep it going. I'm like, really? So 50 Minutes, that's coming out. Wayne and I are sick. There's got to be a way. There's got to be a way. But the radical thing about it, it's 15 minutes with just a voice, a bass line. It's some really radical piece. I don't know who released our record. That's what I'm saying. There's something about these guys with these labels that, you know, that's what distingu some labels from other labels. These are records that... pretty sure very, very, very few labels will be willing to release. And this is the funny thing about it, you know? I mean, some people will dig it. I'm sure many will not. Many will find them ridiculous. The track itself isn't, he'll tell you, it's not revolutionary, but it becomes a little bit, very odd, the fact that it's... It goes on for 15 minutes and there's literally some guy randomly talking and obviously after a while you get into your own zone because you know about bass lines looped up with kick drums and it kind of becomes its own thing.
