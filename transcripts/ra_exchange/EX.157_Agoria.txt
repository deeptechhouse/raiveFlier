Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. Like one of his key influences, Laurent Garnier, Sébastien Davaud is an important ambassador of French electronic music. And also like Garnier, he's achieved this position through a number of different means. De Waard cut his DJing teeth in the late 90s during a difficult period for nightlife in France's second city, Lyon, but was later one of a small group who founded Nuit Sonore, a festival that's credited for reviving the city's scene. Eleven years later, Nuit Sonore is one of Europe's essential festivals. Although he's now moved on, De Waard was also one of the founders of Infonain, the famously wide-ranging label that mirrored his own broad approach to DJing and production. The Agoria aesthetic has arguably been best showcased in one of his many standout mix CDs, with previous efforts for fabric, balance and at-the-control. trolls. So there's a lot to discuss when it comes to Agoria, but when we sat down with him in London in June, we began by talking about Stefanovic, a largely overlooked Lyon DJ that devoured sight as his main inspiration. *music* When we spoke to you a couple of years ago for a feature, you name checked a French DJ named Stefanovic. You said he'd had a really big influence on you. We didn't really delve too deeply into it, so I wondered if we could start by talking about why he was such a big inspiration. Stefanovic was like one of the three or four French DJs who was playing in all parties in France. So we had like Stefanovic, Jacques de Marseille, Laurent Garnier and maybe Milos. Those four French DJs were playing everywhere. And Stefanovic, he has a... I remember I spent a night... first night in a club. I think I was like 17 or 18. And it was like at Hypnotique. It was in my hometown, Lyon. He was playing and I really entered the club. It was like maybe 1am and get out at 5 or 6am. And I have the feeling that maybe I spent like one hour in the club. He has a way to bring the audience to a point where we lose all the conscious time schedule. I don't know how you say this in English, but we lose all the, we say in French, les repères. And so Stefanovic, yes, he was like really the main DJ for me. And I remember like I was starting to organize parties and I invited him like many times in all my parties in Lyon. And he was, he saw me as a young kid, like really motivated and he was anywhere coming, even parties were really shit and bad and it was like maybe 50 people. and you know everywhere I could like hey you want to book a stepanovich with me in the party and so he was really my hero and the French DJ like I really respected and I don't know then after maybe five six years after that point he decided to stop his career he was bored about this thing but yeah it was he was really really magic DJ how was he able to put people in a trance like you're describing. Exactly, that's the word. Oh, is that? Okay. He was really putting people in trance. I don't know, you know, it's for sure something about his way of mixing also the bass lines. You know, it was like he could... Also Ricardo Villalobos know how to do this, but just a few DJs know how to... wait the moment of a record and it's the perfect time to come with another record and then not cut at all the groove and this is something not so easy to do and like he was able to do this and maintain the flow during hours and hours and constantly making you dance. I don't dance so much, but he was every time the DJ was making me dance. How would you describe his sound? Oh, that time, I mean, it was like, because we were in maybe 93, 94. So I don't know really what I would say Detroit techno or it was really more like Detroit or Chicago techno. Did you have international DJs that were influencing you at that time? Yeah, Jeff Mills for sure. Jeff Mills was like the first DJ I saw making things really creatively before all the computers and stuff arrived. So he was the first one making with like three turntables, T99 effects. His way of mixing was totally different. I was speaking about Stefanovic who was mixing tracks really in a long process, waiting the moment and finding the right balance every time. And Jeff Meets was the opposite actually. He was mixing very fast records. It doesn't matter if it was perfectly... Like synced. Yeah, synced. It was always in the right move. And it was always also with his own feeling. I mean, when he plays, he's like an animal, like a lion or a tiger or a pummel. He has his own way of moving and of playing the records very fast with his fingers. It's a pleasure to see him mixing. I didn't wear glasses at that time, but I was a little guy. watching him like every single move of his hand and of his body how he was mixing and I was really impressed like how he could play like three records just getting the high and the medium and then suddenly he put like a new 909 thing on it and it was perfect he has like perfect energy So Detroit Techno, would you say that this was kind of the sound of Leon in the early 90s? If I am really honest, because we have to be honest today. If I'm really honest, I think the first records I bought were really shit. It was like very, it was trance music. Like it was Frankfurt Beat Records or this kind of thing like Cosmic Baby maybe. or this kind of really melodic stuff, but kind of cheesy. And I didn't know what was playing Jeff Mills and Stefanovic. It was like really something new. So I really didn't know what was the record, and we couldn't really see who was the artist, so much white labels. And so I was not really, at that time... so much like influenced by Detroit. It's just six months or one year after that I started to buy records and the record shop also has been really important in my building because like I bought this Tron's record because also the guys at the record shop showed me arriving. Oh, there's a new kid arriving, so what are the records that we couldn't sell this week? So let's pass the record to Seb and let's see if he could buy this one, you know? During a few months, I mean, every new single customer in the record shop buys always shit records before the guy who starts to believe in you and step by step put one or two good records. was difficult to find music and so if you have like only five records of I don't know of the new axis or the new purpose maker then it was for the good DJs of the city of Lyon at that time and so I was already having the bad records and then months and months after that I had to understand what time the guys from UPS or DHL arrived. And so when I was waiting, I was asking the guy from the shop, like, is there the Detroit records? Are they arriving on Tuesday or Thursday this week? And so I was here at 11 before the record shop opened. And so opening the box with the records. And so then I had the chance to finally buy a few records that I liked. But before this, I was just buying records because I wanted to practice at home. And so it was like what I could have. But this was also a good moment, I mean, to know whether to be really educated to good music. Were you one of many kids in your town who were into this style and were checking Detroit things? I think kind of a lot, yes. Really, I think we were a lot. And it was a five or six record shop. And I was going to a record shop named Independence Records a lot and spending all my money. That was not, I wasn't so rich. So all what I get. I was spending in the shop and I remember the guys were like the guy the sellers of the record shop like were buying me food and me there because they were thinking oh shit so they buy me a hamburger or something like for me to eat something during the day but like Yeah, it was a really good moment at that time. But so many people were buying techno records, in-house records. Were you able to gain any success as a DJ at this time? No, not. And for me, I was just passionate. I find something new and something that... When I was a kid, I was really making a lot of tapes and listening to radio. I found that two or three associatives of radio were spinning electronic music. And so I was doing tapes and I was selling my tapes at school to get money to buy records and then do new tapes. And so it was like this kind of process. And so, yeah, I started to buy records. But the radio thing and the record shop has been important. I was playing a few after parties. Okay. Because I was like going and like I was speaking with the promoters that you meet in the record shop, that you met in the record shop. And so it was really the meeting point for everybody. after a few times they saw me in the record shop say what are you playing blah blah blah can you give me a tape to see what you're doing and so I was giving them tape my tapes were really not good because I had only a techniques at that time with a turntable that I couldn't change the the pitch so it was like so so one record was good the other was not so good and so I mean synchronizing and and so like yes then I was giving tapes and they started inviting me to to playing after parties but it was not so easy because I was playing always between 8 and 10 but one time I think on 10 times maybe I did play just two times because all the others, it happens the party has been stopped by the police or cancelled or it was not any more people or so. I didn't play so much. So around that time, you kind of mentioned in the past that lots of the parties had kind of an illegal slant to them. Why was it necessary? Was there no infrastructure in place for... but there are no clubs that these events could be staged in. I think Lyon was really the place where all the parties were cancelled. I don't know what was the main reason, if it was a lobby from all the clubs. the usual clubs with bad music or if it was like, I don't know, mystical reason. But all the parties were cancelled and it was impossible to organise things. So of course they were all illegal. And the first club I went to listen to, Stefanovic, maybe this club has been open like for four or five months and then it has been closed also. So everything was like really tough to organise. I remember it was a big, big rave party, a party that should have been organized in La Halle Tony Garnier, which is a 15,000 people capacity. And it has been not canceled because it was a main producer from Paris. who organized Johnny Hallyday, this kind of pop stars concert show. And this party has been not concert, but they said you can open only till 1. So if you open at 11 and it's closed at 1, then for sure... they had to cancel it. So I don't know the reason why it was so difficult to organize things, but that's why it was like this game with info lines and hidden place to organize parties. It was a game, really tough one. All my friends were promoting parties. Then after a while, losing so much money, they decided to stop. But also it was part of the excitation. And for me, I guess it was also like... one of the reasons I've been fighting and doing so many things for years and then start to create New Sonor Festival. It's also because of this, because I wanted to make something happen and to build something. So it was tough for the promoters, but was this leading to a good experience for people who were going to the parties? It really depended on the parties. Some were amazing. Promoters would find an amazing spot. And some were just in the forest, in a bad location, with no security at all. I don't know, something bad could have happened. And I recently thought about like... also reason why the the politics in france were like um really afraid about techno movement because it was like just with an info line and a sheet of paper um maybe five or six thousand people who could go to to a party without any security and when i saw what happened to the love power like two or three years ago when they moved it from berlin i said okay maybe also it was like a hidden reason why they try to to maybe come to make this party not happening but i mean for that time we never had any problem nothing nothing happened on no security problems i mean it could but like nothing happened Yeah, sure. Was it more of a widespread issue in France? Was this kind of an angle that most local governments were taking? Was it difficult to put on parties all over the country? Yeah, it was everywhere. But Lyon was the worst, I think. Because you got arrested a couple of times, didn't you? Yeah, I got arrested like two or three times. But after three times, they stopped arresting me. Because I was always saying the same thing, you know, I'm just playing in the after, like from six to ten, and I was just a DJ. I'm sorry, I don't know the promoter. I'm sorry if you can't find him. I mean, he parents have been kind of annoyed sometimes when you're 18 and go back at 2 p.m. because you have been arrested it's like hey what was you doing till 2 p.m. today like oh no nothing I went and then one day they they find a paper with my things from the police say what is this thing like oh no it's just like a party I did and they they arrived and they asked me a few questions but nothing really wrong so were you able to kind of establish yourself as a DJ and producer under these circumstances I started to make music really long time after that, I think. I didn't want to make music. I wanted to work in a record shop. When I say it has been really something important for me, it was like, I remember knocking the door of all these little shops saying, hey, do you have a little job for me for maybe six months? And they all say, no, no, sorry. And one time, a guy who then became a very good friend of mine, he said... you should more do music than working in a record shop. It's much more like what could be good for you. I mean, they knew that I was surrounded by music people and so they say, you should go forward. You mean it would be good for your DJ career to produce music? Not really career, but just for me. I mean, they were seeing already that, okay, it's good to work in a record shop, but there is so much more that you could do. And for me it was everything. Finding the music, listening to the music and then sharing it with people. and defending good music. It was something that I really wanted to do. And so that's why I wanted to be working in a record shop. But then after like, maybe I was like almost 24, 25, then I started to make music. Also, I was not really into computers and technical thing. Did you start out on a computer? Yes, I started with a computer and then like I had an old lead. and like at that time I think it was a Emu Emu sampler and that was my basic stuff to make my first record yes so when did things start to change in Lyon so that period was like till from 94 to 98 I think 99 And then we started to speak with politics a bit. And then we had the chance to make a meeting with the mayor of Lyon, with a friend of mine, Vincent Cari, and an association named Artifarti. And we really tried to convince him to make something in the town for the youth and for the new generation, saying, look, if you make a good nightlife in Lyon, then for sure the kids will come more and the universities will be more with foreign people. And it has been, he was something, he's still the mayor of Lyon. He was willing to do the Europe thing, so it was a good aspect to show him. And one night we decided to bring him to make a little visit of all the bars of La Croix-Rousse, which is like a district of Lyon. And in all these bars, we organize meetings with artists and labors and promoters and from drum and bass to techno, house, trance, every kind of thing. And after this night, he said, oh, something happening in Lyon. That's cool. Yes, you're right. We should do something. And the day after, like we had a meeting with many, many people and he say, OK, I want to work with you guys to make a new festival. And so it helps us to start Nuiceno from that point. So it was maybe in, we are like in, yeah, maybe 2001. So what did you decide to do? So you've just been given this opportunity to start a festival. Like when you were discussing what this might look and feel like, what did you decide? First, when he said he decided, the mayor said, okay, we want to do something. It was many people around the table. So maybe 25 people. So some were saying, yeah, we should do a festival with David Guetta, Bob Sinclair, Martin Solveig. And some others were saying, yeah, let's do a new salsa, rock, tango festival of every music for doing one week. And we were like, no, we want to do underground music, electronic music, and build something really new for the town. and it was like a big we were like really motivated they they saw this and we have we made like many meetings between us to to to write actually the festival is still the same now that it was when we wrote it in the kitchen of Vincent Cary together. And it became something important for us to defend because we all come through this period where it was impossible to organize things. So it gave us the energy to do it. And definitely we said, OK, we want to do something indie and electronic, but just with underground things. Because we have... been suffering so much for this four years that we really wanted to do it so what did the first edition look like how many people did you have how many stages it was not so easy also but i mean I think during six months, we've been all taking anti-depression pills during the day and then vodka during the night, I guess. Because actually, it was not also easy with people in the town. I mean, because when you start something and then most of all, when you have to help after... of the city so for sure you have a lot of jealousy and everybody say but why you not us and so it's also like a fight not only to make this happen but with the um with every everybody in town but we we try to motivate everybody and to make everybody part of this game and of this festival so it had it has taken maybe six months and after this it has been fine and so the first edition I remember that I did two sets this first edition I started I did the very first one the opening set and the very last one but this one was not foreseen because it's Ronnie Sizes was playing the last the last set of the festival and he has a flight I don't know to London and he said okay no I'm sorry you have to stop now to my set because like I need to take my flight and we were like but come you can't stop now it's like still have half hour or one hour more to play and so then okay so what we do and he was like really no I'm gonna stop Oh, okay. So he decided to stop. And it was in this famous place that was speaking La Hiltonie-Garnier, this main room of 15,000 people. And it was like maybe 6,000 people that night. So it was not bad. I mean, it was good. And he said, no, no, I'm going to stop. And so I did close the festival also because he had to stop. But the festival was, I mean... It was really similar of what it is now. For sure, not as much people. It was maybe 15,000 people. And I think this edition was maybe 90,000. So it's much more, of course. But it was exactly the same architecture. Were you trying to attract people from all over Europe? Was that one of the initial aims of the festival? The main thing of the first edition, it was to manage to book artists. Because when you start an edition and want to attract people, it's difficult to say, OK, come to our festival for not... We don't have so much money, but then we really want you. And for the first edition, it's always difficult to book artists. So it has been the main thing is to attract relevant artists for the first edition. And how cooperative were the local government with you and with the organization? Without the city, we couldn't have done it. because also like one thing of the festival is like changing a lot of locations in the whole town making a lot of different bets on the street or at the swimming pool we want to we really wanted to to bring the spirit of the rave parties, of doing things in insolite, we say this, insolite places, to a festival. Without the city saying, okay, you can do it, we couldn't have done it. I think when I visited the festival, the most striking aspect of it was just the level of access that you had to places. Like being set up in the main square, doing parties in the street, in some of the historic buildings. It was genuinely shocking. It was like, wow, they're getting away with it here. Even in the Stock Exchange of Lyon. I mean, yeah, no, I mean, we've been really lucky for this. And I think Vincent Cari and all the team, because me, like I've been really important at the beginning to make it happen because they needed an artistic caution to say, okay, we can do it. Seb is with us and, you know, he can bring a lot of artists to and convince them to come and play. But now... nowadays I'm not as much involved as I was at the beginning but today really when I see how the festival has changed and now it became like now the maybe one of the main festival uh in france and maybe in europe too it's like i'm really i'm really proud of them actually do you feel like it's changed the city or the city scene and music scene has changed much in the time that sonora's been going When we started, the scene was dead. I mean, a few artists were doing things, but there was no emulation, no effervescence. It was really, really low. And I think recently, I'm not saying this because I love Lyon and because it's my hometown, but recently, the city is really, really fertile and really creative. So many artists that I can mention now like Cosme is very good house DJ every is a fantastic new hip-hop producer. Speeder, who are on the scene for a few years now. And many others like CLFT who are doing good techno records. I can mention many, many, many new artists and new labels and new promoters. The city is really, really good now. In a certain point, to answer your question, yes, I think Nuit Sonore helped this. I think during five, six years, we were all trying to figure out if it was really helping the creativity in the new generation. And we were not so sure. But today, yes, definitely. Also, not only the festival, but the fact that... now the social networks, internet and everything help everybody to have an access to the culture much easier and so definitely it helped. Yeah, I mean I think I was certainly very impressed and I came away wondering really what it would be like to be going out just on a week-to-week basis. and how busy the parties were and that kind of thing. So you think it's in a healthy place, like week on week? You have good parties every single weekend. And you can have Omar S in front of people or Kyle Hall or Floating Porns or every single artist now are playing during the whole year. in many kinds of different places and locations. And the new thing that we are really excited about now is that we're going to open a new club. So it's going to be open at the end of June, but the real inauguration is going to be in September. It's a rooftop between Le Rhône et la Saône, which is like the confluence of the two rivers. And I'm really excited to open this club. It's like Nuit Sonore, Laurent Garnier, me and a few others, we built this club together. So it's a new baby for us. And I think it's exactly what was missing. Because now we have all this scene, all these artists and promoters and labels. We needed also a place where they can go from Thursday to Sunday and have parties and meet and speak and develop new projects together. And so it's a... Because we had clubs, but really smaller, like 400 capacity, most of them. So this one is a bit bigger, so it can also give a new excitation. So do you feel like you'll be increasingly taking a step back with the stuff you're doing with Nui Sonor? Oh, for sure, I'm less involved anyway. Yeah. I'm just like, even with the club, I'm just helping the club to happening and to be set up. But like, even if I'm not like day by day on this side, you know, like every time they need help or if I have ideas, we are like in connection all the time with Vincent. And so we speak about many things. And so I'm not working, but... Anyway, I'm behind like to, okay, open doors. You didn't DJ for the first time this year, right? Yeah, for the first time. Yeah, how was that? I loved it, actually, you know, to be really sincere, I loved it. But I was not at the festival the whole week, but because I had to move to Milan also, and I was also in the States during this week, so I couldn't stay the whole week. But it's, I think, for every DJ, it's playing in his hometown, you know, for something like a big festival, important, and it's, like, really tough. Because you have all your friends, all the family, all the people that you see during all the... They are in front of you in the room. So if you play a bad set, then you know that when you're going to go to the bakery, they will look at you and... Not so good this year. Not so good. So it's... People say most of the time, yeah, but it's nice. It's your city. It's easy. I think it's the opposite. Well, for me, it's really, really... more difficult to play in my hometown. So I was like, for the first time, so relaxed. You'd also said to us a couple of years ago that you'd got to a place with your DJing that you were starting to feel as though you were more free than you'd ever been. But what I was interested in was whether it was kind of a struggle to get to this place, whether it was, you know, a hard-fought thing. I think, well, maybe I was also a bit like typically French and arrogant when I said I was feeling free. Because, you know, I'm not sure if we can really be free one day. But to get like this sensation sometimes, I think it takes time, yes. Because for sure you have to... make a lot of mistakes and a lot of it needs a lot of experience actually to know what could be the good direction and how you can be like totally relaxed when you play for example tonight I'm gonna play to plastic people and I'm really happy for this because like I never played this place but I heard it's the kind of club you can play exactly the music you want from the beginning to the end And for sure, you always have to get in concert that people go out to have fun and to enjoy the night. So you can't be like for four hours totally into ambient stuff or playing only Reston Norton or this kind of music for four hours. But you can play some and that makes you free also. I mean, I always try when I play, also for me, to make me surprised. So, you know, the way you organize your records before you play, it's important. And I think when you were doing a record cast with records, you always put your records in a certain way of finding them when exactly you wanted. Or not. And for example, now, I'm not playing anymore vinyls, but that's another debate. you when I organize my keys, for example, or the music I have with me, it's always, I always put records somehow, I don't know, by luck, I put it here or here, just like to say, okay, maybe that could excite me to put this one at that time, but even if it's not supposed to match, or that's the kind of freedom I like to have, like not being always functional, because I think... I would be bored. I hate to be too much functional. Do you put quite a lot of preparation into your DJing? What does that process look like? A lot actually. And I think even more now that when I had records it was not so many preparations. But now it's really a lot because, I don't know, because maybe the fact of not seeing exactly what you have is something difficult. And that's something difficult for me. But I can't play any more vinyls now for many reasons. but I'm also really excited about this new thing of playing and organizing my music differently and the fact that I can play so many different music in one night that if I have just one or two record box. So it's really like every time, for example, I know I put two or three African records for tonight. I don't know if I'm going to play them, but I wouldn't have thought about this five, six years ago with vinyls. And now, with this new way of organizing my set, I put some stuff like this, and it's a good game. Has the way that you sourced music also changed very much? You mean how I receive music? Yes, yeah. Yeah, definitely. If I was still receiving records, like I mean promotional records, I would definitely play only vinyls too. The thing is now we are a group of artists sending a lot of things before. And if we want to play those records or those tunes, then you have to play with USB keys or with CDs or with computers. I had so many difficulties to play vinyl recently, that's why I stopped. I still bought a lot of records, but now I'm forced to record those records. That's really bullshit. But I can't play these records anymore because most of the time the sound is too much equalized for digital sources or it's difficult in festivals, you have so much rumble and so many problems that... it's the eternal debate I think the support is not so much important and I think now it's finally my way to get creative with these digital sources that it took really long time for me because of all what we were speaking before my love for the records the record shop and all these things for me it has been really tough to say ok now goodbye to Vinyl and I finally find a way to make it creative um i feel like you've um earned a reputation as being uh one of the more diverse djs and your approach and your music selection has this always been your approach as a kind of selector dj actually i really don't know why i'm trying always to to excite me making this kind of thing and much tracks that are not supposed to match together. I don't know, I like this. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. But when it works, it's magical. It's like really a good present to play diverse things and see it working. Like a song in love we recorded recently named Benga Benga. on Pilot Bridge and it's like for me it's the bomb this record it's a mixture between acoustic African voices typical drum electronic drums and it's amazing this is all what I like when you can find a record that you can play in and match all these influences. I love that. But why I'm so diverse, I don't know. It's not like I'm born one day, hey, I want to do this. But I'm excited by this. And also because I'm playing really, really a lot. So if I was playing three times a week for years, only playing functional house techno records to make people happy, then... I would be a bit bored. I'm still for sure sometimes playing tracks like this because also I like that the groove and how to make people dance and it's definitely something I enjoy it but I really also like to okay excite the brain I mean, I'd read that you've recently been playing maybe up to 100 gigs per year. Is this still the case? Yeah. And do you have to, I mean, does it vary quite a lot in how far you can take an audience with the diversity of your music? Also, I think we can play diverse. music only when we play long time that's there are a few clubs where you can do this like panorama bar for sure in berlin or trao in amsterdam or i hope the new club we're going to open But most of the time you play one hour, 30 minutes and two hours. And in this case, for me, it's also tough to play diverse things because I did, sometimes I do it, but I find it's difficult also because people can think, okay, he doesn't know how to play one start, so he play many starts, you know? It's a bit like this, when you play just for a while, like a really short set, it's tough to do it. So then you become a bit more classical, I would say. But yes, I remember last time I played Hans Zimmer's tune in Panorama Bar, it was magical. really the people was like freaking out or like at Trau when I played last weekend the benga benga it was also fantastic I like this kind of I mean it's what you remember. If you play like a major hit of techno house or like something which is not a hit but like really effective then you know what you're gonna have. You know the answer, you know the feedback. So it's a really good moment, you're happy to see everybody happy. But then it's not the same mystical thing that when you play... something that's not supposed to work and you see everybody amazed i like that i mean what are you trying to achieve with your dj do you think i mean you talked earlier about um stefanovic as being someone who put people in his trance i could i could never be as that's not your style i won't be i could you know I think Stefanovic was really gifted by something. It was easy for him to play records during two or three hours and never miss anything and keep the flow and the groove perfectly. It was not at all in this kind of diversity thing. because it was much more lost in the repetitive process. But also it's something really fantastic. But I'm not like this. It's not me. I love to go in a party and see DJ doing this because I couldn't do it because after a while I get bored myself doing this. So when also you just can do it, I'm like, wow, fantastic. I'm a big fan of this. What are you trying to achieve? What's the, what do you want people to, how do you want people to react to what you're doing? I don't know. I just want them to have fun, of course, but then to have a big smile when they see, oh, wow, he took this risk and that's cool. It worked. Or sometimes it doesn't work. But I mean, it's like this. But I couldn't do like five hours DJ set just flat. Yeah, sure. That's something I can't do it. But when it works, when a DJ does this, and also he doesn't lose the audience, and the audience is into anywhere during all these hours with this. I don't know what you say, entre guillemets, but with this, like, it sounds really flat. I'm like, wow, great. Your style of DJing on the diversity tip seems to have lent itself really, really nicely to the mixed CD compilation format. Is that something or like a challenge that you've enjoyed, do you feel? It's the same, I guess. My first mix was "Cute and Cult", I think. And I did it only with vinyl and mixing, like... Doing hours and hours and hours and weeks. The same mix. to get the perfect mix. I mean, really, really like hours. I don't know how many times I did this mix, but I didn't want to use any computer. And then that was done. So I wanted to do something different. And so I did the other controls and the balance mixity and the fabric one. Those three mixing a lot of different sources that would have... wouldn't have been possible just with two or three of three of three vinyls and so yeah for sure i also think like when you do mix cd if it's just to do like what you can hear in a party then you have so many podcasts or you have so many way to listen to it there's no use to do this it has to be something more like personal and so I always try to add like tunes again that are not supposed to match like and for me it works for for all these compilations maybe for some people it could be like this one or this one was the the the it really built up and then it it cut it a bit too much at that time or i don't know but for me it's like also like uh when we we are the build up what we should have like the explosion why we shouldn't frustrate maybe a bit more before we we again build it up i mean and i like this kind of um of experience and and the mix it is i love this this format how does the process work for you where do you start with something with a project like this i never for example now i don't have any project of mix cd but i'm every week i'm putting in a folder new music that i have or receive or that i listen to even if they are not new but that i just discovered in this folder like for the future because like i say oh this one could be relevant with this as a record and so i like organizing things like for the future like this and every time it took me a lot of time to to to select it to select the music i think the the balance one has been the most challenging for me and last year started a new audio visual project called forms is that right Yeah, correct. Yeah, that's correct. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that and what the kind of concept and feeling behind it was. I think like the last decade was like a period where other artists... we mix all kind of different music from jazz to hip-hop to indie rock. Every artist like try to cross all the influences and the technicals helped on this. What was not possible 20 years ago was easy the last decade. And I think for this decade actually, it's like a new challenge in a way is mixing all kind of arts so what i try to do with forms is like to mix architecture with like visuals and and music so it's like I have a structure in front of me where we map videos and a big screen behind me. And I'm totally immersed in this kind of, I don't know how you say it, a show. So this decade is the moment where we can mix all. all this kind of art. And because it's like, also it costs less money than it was before. And I think it's really interesting to work with other kind of people. and shared our ideas. And so I remember last summer I played many festivals like Dua or Benny Cassim or Rock on Sound, more indie festivals. And I don't want to educate older people to techno or to electronic music. But when you play after Oasis... I mean, it's sometimes tough to make people, to get the attention of the people who are like... listening during one hour and singing like all the big hit of Oasis and then you are like in backstage saying what you gonna do after that you know like listening 20 000 people singing to Oasis and then you have to come after this wow with techno music good luck how did it go then So, yeah, not too bad, actually, I think. It was cool. But because of this Project Forms, it has been easier. If I was just alone on stage with my, like, turntables, playing techno at Detroit or Chicago House, it would have been a disaster. But because, like... had this project and they have something to see different of just like a DJ behind three turntables trying to mix them. It was like They don't have to overthink about what they were listening. I'm not into the fact of emancipating the whole the world audience of music to techno music, but I like to be into a new challenge and I like to be challenged most of the time because like after all this time DJing and making music it's good to find new challenge and this one is one of these I'm Thank you. you Thank you.
