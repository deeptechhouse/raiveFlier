♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Will Lynch, and I'm the Associate Editor of Resident Advisor. Our guest today is Alec Empire, a Berlin artist who mixes music and politics far more forcefully than most of his peers. He's been a DJ and producer since the early 90s, but turned his back on club culture long ago, seeking something more radical and socially conscious. On his own and with his band, Atari Teenage Riot, Empire created what he calls digital hardcore, a breaky, punk-inspired sound. that perfectly complemented his politics and earned him a decades-long cult following. A longtime modular synth enthusiast, last summer he interviewed Morten Sabotnick at the Berlin premiere of the documentary I Dream of Wires. The next morning, he stopped by our office in Berlin to talk about synths, socialist raving, and his own singular career. You can hear our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net. and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The Exchange with Alec Empire, up next. Hello. you They interviewed you for the documentary or they interviewed you for the screening of the documentary. Is that right? No, like they interviewed me for the documentary because I was I Don't know if they're very early on like very interested in modular sense You know, I was I was doing digital hardcore and and and acid and techno like in the 90s There was that point in 2000, something like that, when everybody switched to Ableton and it became like the studio in the laptop. And I just didn't get that physical energy from those sounds. I mean, I understood that it had to be a sacrifice to develop that new software and stuff. But I knew also it would take over a decade until it got to the point where you can stand in a club and listen to something like that, just have that same physical body response that we used to get from analog drum machines and synthesizers. So I was really not satisfied with where technology was at that stage. So I began to just explore, you know, that very new modular scene, which I think started, you know, for most of us, it was like 2003, maybe 2004, like you could get these modules like built by. It's very DIY, underground kind of manufacturers, you know, often like one guy, maybe two guys in a garage or at home making this stuff in very limited quantities. Yeah, it was just really exciting. It immediately felt like, okay, this is something, even though it's not purely digital, now it's not really digital versus analog kind of thing. I think a lot of people make it out to be, but I don't think that's completely right because there are a lot of modules. that use also digital technology. But the thing is this, I compared it a bit to the whole open source movement. It's like you could create your own synthesizer, basically. And therefore... you could get a very unique sound. I always saw the danger with software. Even though you could say with a variety of plug-ins and stuff, you have a lot of choice, but I always felt the moment it comes out of the box. has a very conformist kind of sound, you know, and I think now if you scroll through, I don't know, hundreds and hundreds of tracks, maybe on Beatport or platforms like that. understand I guess what I mean you know it's like a lot of stuff sounds very much the same now we could say this was always a bit the problem of dance music right that you you have just stuff that it sounds similar and it works in clubs and so on but I really felt there was something new that started and yeah and I was you know very early on like mentioning that in all interviews that i think that's where the future is and people paid attention they were like what that that was that guy who only used samplers and maybe analog distortion a decade earlier you know so i think that's also why they thought okay let's interview alec see what he has to say so and i really like the project because I hope people also who are not musicians, that they can understand more how that music is made. Because we know there's like that... It's almost like the DJ or the electronic music producer who maybe plays a live show or something in a club or a festival. It's almost like the modern kind of magician. You just don't know what's going on, does what. And then there's all these DJs who... maybe just press the start button, wouldn't do anything. So I think it's really important to not just... you know, get mad about, you know, whatever, all those kind of DJs who don't do anything, which is, of course, like the, you know, it goes viral really quickly because you see, I don't know, David Guetta's CD is skipping or stuff like that. And it's a joke. But the problem is that I think. this stuff does create a damage. A lot of music fans go, okay, am I being fooled? Like, what is really happening? So I think by making a documentary like this, people see, wow, there's a long history, you know? Electronic music just doesn't start. know in the 80s or something like that because i think that's where what a lot of people think they maybe go back to craftwork or something like that and go okay this is but then the stuff from craftwork they know is probably like from 1979 or 1980 you know what i mean so and they forget that there was so much uh innovation and and Yeah, just so much important stuff happening like way earlier on, you know, without those people like Morten Sobotnick, for example, we wouldn't be here now. And I think a composer like him, he really deserves the credit. But it's also people who make... make the instruments. You know, I think that's something it's often overlooked. Like, without those creators, like, you wouldn't have the tools, you know. Like, it's just really important that you have creative minds on that side, you know. Often... When corporations, I don't know, make synthesizers, like big, I don't know, companies, you know, it's very rarely they come up with something that's unique and special. You know, they always try to market to the mainstream keyboard player, whatever, audience. So you really need those outsiders and those freaks doing stuff that nobody else would think of. So modular synthesis is a way of ensuring some level of individuality in your music. Yes, I think that's one thing. Because I think that should be the goal, right? I mean, what we don't need is thousands and thousands of musicians who sound the same. You know, I like the music scene to be diverse. I mean, I know a lot of people from the music industry would probably disagree with me on this, but this is like my own taste. I think the only way out of this crisis also. because the music industry is in a crisis for such a long time. This can't be that we become conservative. We repeat old formulas over and over again. Because at the moment, the music industry, they always hope that a younger generation doesn't know the past. They don't remember how could they. But the thing is, there is something like evolution happening. So even though you might not know... stuff that was 20, 30, 40 years old. I really believe in that, that you catch up really fast. We see the same in video games and also films, the way films are edited. There is progression and a lot of conservative voices in the music industry, they try to sell us this idea, it's all a cycle. this is what people like, you know, it will never be different. You know, and the funny thing is, I heard those arguments like, yeah, when I started making underground techno in like 89 you know in 1990 it's it's there were these major record label people who was like nobody will listen to that music like why should this be big it's like yeah there's huge raves going on so I know it doesn't make sense to you but at some point music is evolving and we want something That is unpredictable, you know, and I think a lot of people over the past decade have tried to stick to like a formula that they just can rely on. And I think, again, that especially in software development, like... People, of course, follow also that trend. You know, if you look at DJ software, for example, it's all about like making it really easy and, you know, reaching as many people as possible. Of course, you know, it makes kind of sense. But what we're losing, I think, is, yeah, those, you know, those really special sounding records that... drive the whole thing into the future you know and modular synthesizers i think they open the door you know it's just because just the way your mind works like when you make those connections is just really different. There's a really important scene in the documentary where they speak about, you know, when Robert Moog, like when he developed the mini-Moog synthesizer. Before that, there weren't really keyboards, like keys like the piano, you know, attached to those synthesizers. And it was a big deal. They were like, hmm, you know, like, aren't we falling back to like this old, you know, like way of thinking? Because if you have these keys in front of you, you... you approach a synthesizer more like a piano, you know, and I think what we've seen is, you know, the result of that was in the 80s, especially like when you would look at a synth would be maybe this horrible pop band where people try to mimic, you know, traditional instruments, you know, it's like, oh, I can't get a brass section, let's choose like a... brass sounding like sound or something and then you get the stuff we kind of laugh about now on youtube people you know i mean it took a while i think for people to think outside the box again and go like okay like acid house detroit techno you know these kind of things i think they It wasn't like pianists who used a synthesizer to do, you know, like to just come up with a slightly different sound. It was just a different way of thinking. And I think the instruments can, yeah, they can almost force you to rethink, you know, like because we all kind of grow up like with you learn an instrument maybe in school or wherever. immediately you just think in that direction. And sometimes technology can break through those limits that in the end just exist in your mind. But they do exist. It's almost like when DJs immediately... they always think still, I think, almost like two or four turntables. I mean, a lot of people still have that, even though they use a laptop or whatever. That's just how their mind works. Still decks on the interface. Yeah, yeah. And I think that's kind of interesting because if you're now, let's say, 16 years old, why does it have to be a turntable? to be like that you know what i mean so there's probably some changes coming uh in that era too like i mean the thing is you wonder where will the line really blur like between for example a dj who's just playing these tracks and maybe he's doing a mix like the end of the day getting tracks in sync and then you know, wherever, maybe firing off some samples on top of something. But a lot of DJs don't even do that, you know. So hopefully we will have DJs which are like more on the side of the musicians and create stuff as they go along. And I mean really create stuff, you know, like not just go, okay, I've... leave the record at this point this other DJ leaves it a minute earlier so you know that's not that creative you know so in general it sounds like you think DJing is art could be a lot more fundamentally creative than it often is now. Yes. I mean, if we go back to the roots of DJing, maybe Afrika Bambaataa is a good example because people know his mixes now. But these people were far more creative than most DJs that we see now. The strength, like, or like the... advantage a dj has is they can make these connections that normal musicians often don't make you know so by going okay i'm going to take that bar of like this funk record and then i'm going to add this bass line from that record and stuff there is um They just think different. While a normal musician would maybe go, okay, my friend or whatever, he played this beat and I'm going to add this bass line. But they haven't been created in isolation. You know what I mean? And there is something about that making those new connections. That's also my criticism of the whole copyright wars in a way. I mean, there was that point, I think, maybe around 2000, something like that, where publishing companies and record labels really went after artists who sampled others. I mean, it was kind of like a gray area before. It was like a lot of these records were made for the underground, you know, hip-hop artists. put a loop and it became a top 10 hit or something of course you need to work something out and you know pay the original creators a share But I have the feeling a lot of, because there was so much legal stuff about it and you had to clear all these samples and stuff. A lot of people just went to, I don't know, like, I'd rather stay off that stuff. And I'm not going to, this is just too much of a pain. And I think at that point we saw like, we're just very often looking back. and going, okay, I'm just going to, I don't know, look at Detroit techno or whatever, and I'm going to try to copy that. I think it's also interesting how shortly after Minimal became so big because it's almost, it leaves out all those elements, you know. It's almost like consciously people were like, okay, okay. what's left okay i'm gonna stick to this very kind of it's almost like it lives from the emptiness you know what i mean which is was also interesting at the time but you could really see that this was a total opposite of let's say early hardcore breakbeat records or something especially from the uk at the time which we just They had like, I don't know, 30, 40 copyright violations on each track. You know what I mean? But this was also very strange music when you look back on it. Like the way everything was pitched and because the sampling technology wasn't that advanced, you know, like so people had to cut up everything and it's... It's like this weird collage music. At the time, it sounded like the future, but looking back now, it was like this weird, almost mistake, the evolution of electronic music. But that's why it's so interesting and fascinating. And I think it's really important that musicians work together with... DJs and those who make the tools, you know, and I hope that the modular synths will influence more, you know, the software developers. I could really see that this will be happening, you know. Yeah, from the way you talk about it, it sounds like... you see there's being these kind of two forces. There's a force kind of homogenizing music, whether it's record labels, the way the software works, things like that. And then there's this kind of counterforce of people trying to consciously work against that. Would you say that's right? Yeah, I think, I mean, in a way that was probably always the case. You know, there's once something becomes so accepted, it also becomes kind of boring, you know. And so you see small group usually finds it boring first. And then they go, wait, this is just boring. Let's make something better. Let's make something that just feels more alive and more fresh or whatever. So I think there is one thing about the Internet. It is really great that those kinds of people can connect now globally. And I think those changes could potentially happen much faster. But also there's something else. It's that kind of mob mentality that almost like... wants to crush those people. You know, because if we're honest, and I think that's also what the documentary shows, I think a lot of these musicians or manufacturers of these synthesizers, they're kind of different kinds of people. Like, they're introverted, they live in their own little world and create. And that's very different from the DJ superstars we see in EDM, for example. You know, like, they're almost worse than any rock star behavior. I mean, if you would look at, I don't know, like, hair methods, you know. They were at least really skilled. I mean, I hated that music, but the thing was... They had some wicked solos. Yeah, I mean, you know, I never thought when Acid House started, because at the time we really thought of electronic music as, okay, we're going against everything that was really bad in the 80s. There was that horrible corporate rock and even pop music. If you really look at the amounts of songs that were in the charts, it is not just cool. Like, okay, there was Deep Ash Mode and there was this and that. There was like for every... hit like that that was kind of good you had like i don't know 60 of the worst of like constructed kind of songs you know because and that was also because of electronic of electronic music in a way like you could just get some idiot into the studio or have the producer to the rest. And you know, and so there was also something, yeah, almost evil that started that tries to eliminate like the or get rid of the artist, you know, and I think we see, I mean, in 2015 now, it seems this is still the same conflict, you know, you have DJs playing underground clubs who are really mad about the EDM stars, like, you know, they don't do anything, what is going on, like, how can so many people stand there, applaud, and... I really liked when Jeff Mills, I think, said it in an interview last year when he said it seems to him like there are less and less people actually dancing. And I witnessed that too at, for example, Coachella or events like that. There is that trend where people just stand there, face the DJ, look at the DJ, and I'm like... This wasn't the idea, you know. But I think this is what happens when you, yeah, when you use those kind of... settings that came from rock music. I mean, the idea should be, the original techno philosophy was that the DJ is part of the crowd, is almost not really visible almost. And the DJ is absorbing the energy of the crowd. crowd and then also picks the the music and feeds it back into the crowd and there's that constant interaction and i can't see that at all at edm events you know it's a very top thing it's like djs have their set prepared in advance you know and there's very little interaction with the crowd i mean the only thing is maybe like okay clap your hands then go some some you know stuff like that which is that's not real interaction It's almost, yeah, is that cultural fascism already? Like, I don't know. It sometimes looks like it, you know, like, okay, I do this, you all follow and you repeat, you know, like anyone who experienced a real like rave, that's the right word for it. where those barriers are broken down, understands how exciting the real thing is and how, you know, there's... such euphoria and it it can be the best music experience ever that you can have and it's like it almost feels like okay freedom you know is possible something like that and i think that's also why so many people um when you see documentaries or something or speak to people who were there in the beginning, they almost talk about like it's a spiritual, religious experience or something. And I understand why that is. I mean, I never took drugs or anything. So I was always a bit like distanced from like, you know, like losing myself completely in the big crowds. I understand what they're talking about. And this is why EDM and all that commercial stuff is in a big danger of becoming a bubble that we burst. If you look at America, it's almost like they repeated the mistakes the Europeans made in the 90s. Because of the internet, everything stupid is being amplified so much. It's almost like a verse copy of what happened in the 90s. And it's just strange. Electronic music and dance music always has to go down that path to then maybe build back up again from scratch or something. I don't know. It's an interesting thing at least. For pretty much your whole career. music and politics have been very closely tied could hardly be more enmeshed i guess A lot of people talk about how the rave experience has spiritual value. You just kind of touched on it, but when you first encountered raves in Berlin in the early 90s, did you find they had a political dimension? Yeah, of course it did. I mean, I went to raves in, I mean, of course in Berlin, that's where I grew up. I was born in West Berlin, you know, so. When Acid House happened, this was more like in club environments. This was before the war came down. When the war came down, there was all that space. So the first big race with, I don't know, 5,000 people or something happened, 8,000 or something like that in warehouses. But I also witnessed stuff in the UK. And, for example, Spiral Tribe is a really good example here because it became also a political thing because the authorities, the police, wanted to really crack down on this stuff. What's really interesting is at the time, because a lot of people took ecstasy and other stuff, but they didn't really consume beer or drinks like that. So the brewing companies, they hated that. They're almost like, okay, if that's the future, there's no place for us anymore. So there was also that corporate interest to apply. changes stamp it out yes and a lot of people don't see that so much and I think what is interesting the early love parades in Berlin you know they kind of came from the Christopher Street day and from the gay scene and where a lot of the house and techno stuff happened first you know I think that's often being credited enough you know like people think okay suddenly some Detroit musicians came to Berlin and then this whole thing and happened and then also in the UK there was something at the same time that that became big I think the gay scene was so uh experimental and really exciting at the time It's like these were spaces like where this stuff just happened. It's really strange because I couldn't see this music in like the normal like mainstream clubs where they just play top 40 music. So again, that immediately became a political thing. I mean, like the first love parades. it was almost like a message, we're here, we're different, but you need to accept us, you know. And it's still relevant today, you know. And it's almost hard to believe, like, why is there all this hostility? I don't know, Russia or, like, places like that. I mean, we have it in all countries, I guess. In the beginning, I think there was this idealism and it had a political dimension. And then when that got beaten down almost, it became a political thing. And also I think in the beginning, for example, people like Spyro Tribe, they tried these alternative lifestyles. It was very influenced also by the kind of hippie movement. from the late 60s or something. But that merged with technology. And so when you look at old film or photos of those types of raves, for example, that happened at Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, where now there's the Sony Center, you can't imagine that this was a wasteland. And there were raves, you know, and it was almost like the Mad Max movie, you know, like all these trucks. Everybody also looked kind of like that, you know, like it was almost like steampunk, but it wasn't steampunk. It was just people had these types of clothes, you know, like brands weren't really important at the time. Yeah, it was a mix of cyberpunk, hippie culture. yeah and also punk you know like the a lot of the early producers or djs came from punk i think yeah so that there was that conscious like the system can turn against you so be careful you know like but it also of course had to do with the past of Berlin. You know, I think that's why Berlin was kind of like an exception from what was going on everywhere else in the world, because you had socialism ending, you know, exactly at that time, like the wall came down. Suddenly, a lot of young people saw new possibilities and they... really understood how it felt like living under surveillance. Like all these topics, I mean, they are relevant again now, you know, but people just came out of a system that was so oppressive and thought, okay, now this country is kind of united again. but a lot of people hoped something new would come from that. Of course, then the West took over and stuff, but there was that spirit, I think, and that influenced the early race, where people just had this enthusiasm and they had hopes. Also, they involved themselves. I think that was really great. It was very open. It wasn't defined like this is you do the visuals, you are the DJ. These rules didn't exist. It was just a big experiment. And I think it's always good to remind ourselves of that because it could help us in the future. Am I right in thinking you eventually became disillusioned with rave culture? Yeah, like very early on, I think it was in 92. No, because, of course, I was so enthusiastic. And, you know, if you would speak to me in, like, let's say 1991, I would tell you, okay, artists shouldn't be individuals and they should all be anonymous and records shouldn't even have titles and, you know, it should all be just music and there's no hierarchy. the crowd and the artists and stuff there was one problem that I felt we needed to solve like I mean it was the racism in Germany got to a point at the time You just couldn't ignore it anymore. I mean, there were these attacks on asylum seekers. I mean, the neo-Nazi scene was really on the rise. It's... And the dance music scene, they weren't prepared for that. I think at the time we all thought, of course, things are going to get better now. Let's create a better world. But then there was this part of society where people didn't agree with that at all. And we wanted to. a more connected world. You know, it was almost like, you know, the internet was a result of that time where people just felt like we want a network. There are people in Chicago doing stuff or in Japan. And, you know, it's like, okay, let's send faxes around. You know, it was that kind of time. It just really felt like that we need tools to connect. But then you have these other groups in society who want to, you know, kill millions of people, basically. And they would shout, I don't know, Zikaia again. And I don't know. It was just a big shock. And when the violence got too much, I realized, okay, we don't have... the weapons to fight it because I have to say when I was still in school and stuff like there were problems with neo-nazis in the 80s it wasn't as radical they weren't as militant but in the 90s it started you know they got weapons and all this stuff it got to a point where it was getting really dangerous I was really tired of If you would get into some fight in the streets, a cycle of violence that sometimes you get punched in the face, maybe you punch back, but the problem never gets solved. So I thought, okay, we have to create music that encourages people to... Yeah, to fight that and to argue against that. It has to start in the mind. We have to reach people and give them the energy to make changes happen. Because at that time, the rave culture was very much about escaping everything. I felt it was like, okay, let's see. And you see it even when you look at old like flyer designs, for example, it switched from, you know, like more like a sort of industrial kind of 80s, you know, like. like black and white, photocopied, whatever, like, you know, kind of designed to the kind of Alice in Wonderland fantasy. You know, it's almost like you go to Disneyland or something, you know. So that's when I was saying, okay, we need to make music that is fighting that fascist ideology because with the... reunification of Germany came that nationalism that I didn't grow up with and I didn't understand why people thought this was important at all. You know, it didn't make any sense to me. And this is when I switched to making a lot of like... breakbeat records and this is also when the Tartinish Riot started, you know, and it kind of started with Force Inc. music, which was a techno label at the time in Frankfurt, with Amir Plateau. label came from that and we said okay let's you know dance tracks like for djs other people can do that what we need to do is now we need to experiment with those things and i mean the first track that got attention was that hunt down the nazis which caused also a lot of debates in the scene back in the day because a lot of djs said no we need to keep politics off the dance floor And I said, yeah, I kind of understand it, but... we also see neo-Nazis coming to those raves. It's like, sorry, you can't have people, I don't know, shouting Sieg Heil or beating people up. You need to make a statement. So this is kind of like where all this came from. So the idea of having a track, Hunt Down the Nazis, it's not just... the topic of the song, it's actually a political gesture to make it clear that Nazis aren't welcome at this event, basically. Yeah, I think also at the time, I mean, when I speak to hackers now, in Germany, the Chaos Computer Club, for example, there is a long tradition of being anti-fascist. Like, you know, if you speak to American hackers, they often are not even political. They just are interested in, you know. those technologies and the challenges. But over here, I think, politics are really connected to all that stuff because of the history, you know, I think. And also because you have these people, you know, when like last year, Pegida, you know, became so. yeah, like almost dominant, right, in the media. A lot of people ask me, like, how could this happen? This came from nowhere. I was like, no, this is a threat that's always there. And it's almost like as soon Germany is good, like in football or in the World Cup, suddenly you have these people, like they feel really proud. And it's something I think we need to care about all the time, you know, not just when it escalates. And I think also personal opinion about dance music is this is always when it was great. I mean, sometimes like the early house records, they had that, you know, like that spirit. I mean, there was maybe like a Martin Luther King sample, stuff like that. At a big rave, you felt that it was such a unifying kind of thing. You were like, okay, there are all these different types of people. Because at the time, it wasn't really like a subculture where it was like these were the ravers or something. It just brought together all kinds of different people. And I think this is where music becomes powerful and also very... very good you know i mean these old records still carry something that a lot of new stuff lacks and i'm not really saying that just because you know i was there back then and everything was better i don't really think that but there is something about when people do something and they it means something in the context, then it's also exciting. That's for every genre of music, from Nina Simone to the civil rights movement and soul and rock, hip-hop. Every genre almost becomes very exciting when... Things matter, you know? It just adds these extra things. As a music fan, I also like this, you know? Like, I just don't want to stick a stamp on everything. It can also be maybe a love song or something, but most of the times, love songs are just so fake. And I'm going, why do you have to sell out that? topic in this bad way just to not offend anybody you know what I mean it's like but there's a point where it just doesn't mean anything anymore you know yeah I read something where you said that a lot of music you've made has been dedicated to fighting racism like whether it's overt or implicit or whatever and as you said Atari Teenage Riot was kind of conceived as an anti-fascist project Is your music today motivated by a single cause in that way? I've done so many different things. It would be kind of stupid to say, you know, it's like a dogma and I apply it to everything. I mean, for a Thai teenage writer, kindness still is the kind of rule that every record we make needs that. Not a political message in that sense, but it needs to deal with those topics. But there's so much instrumental stuff I've done. I mean, like a record, for example, like Low on Ice, which is this... me and the album I did on Mille Plateaux Records in 1995 and it's I just played it live for the first time at CTM in January at Berghain and some people come up to me and say this is really political because there's all this acceleration and you're really going against that because it's so slow and really anti thing you know it's the opposite of EDM and you know and I was like okay I mean you can in a way find a lot of those meanings in the music but I mean maybe it is kind of true because I did it in Iceland in a tent And I think maybe although we are all connected through social media and stuff, more and more people maybe start to feel kind of isolated in all this, you know. So, yeah, sometimes things become almost like a political thing without. having the intention to do so. It's often also what can people get out of the music. What does it mean in that moment to them? So yeah, I wouldn't say like everything is super political. I do. But I'm still a very political person. So and I think it's really important that everyone pays attention to what's going on, because very often, people like us become the victims of certain politics, you know, it's so yeah and if that means just oh i can't get a job you know why is that am i a loser am i a fool like what happened you know it's like people need to understand they are part of a big kind of system and and if you always blame yourself for that i mean you can't always just blame the system for everything that goes wrong but you need to be aware of that too kind of exist in this without going completely crazy. Is that maybe part of the purpose that political music can serve, to just kind of nudge people to try to be aware of that kind of thing? Yeah, I think, I mean, I see it like musicians are like... Everyone else, they should express how they feel or what they think. And that can help other people. I mean, I had so much feedback over, you know, like two decades where people said, I don't know, I live in Texas and I'm gay and I'm the only one and I get beaten all the time and your music gives me hope. Or like other like political activists who... who told me they were singing the songs after protests when they got arrested and they spent a night in prison or something and then were like, okay, you know, we don't give up and stuff. And then there's also that hacker world, you know, where I get a lot of feedback from where people say, look, I've heard of Tarantino's Riot and I understood I can use the computer as a... I wouldn't say as a weapon, but you can make a lot of stuff happen. And I think this is great, you know. I mean, of course there is the audience that just, I don't know, maybe likes to take drugs and listens to the stuff for a little while and maybe has no effect on them. Even though I have to say I always believe that once the stuff goes through your brain... The music that is not the church. Yes, exactly. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, that's what I meant. The frequencies. No, because I think everything has a consequence. Like any movie you watch, any game you play, any book you read, it's kind of stored in there. So it should be a decision, a conscious decision, what you let into your mind. In your creative process, do you feel like... production versus politics? Are they separate things? Or is it hard to tell where one ends and the other begins? The thing is, I mean, I come kind of from that kind of cyberpunk, early hacker. kind of ideology where you just or philosophy or whatever you want to call it it's like you try to i think merge with the machines as much as you can so and i think that's when really interesting things are happening and and usually that's the case when you know your gear inside out and you don't have to always think oh what's that button doing oh i have to click on this or you know like And I think once you get to that point, you can express stuff that is very kind of hidden. I see the parallel to jazz maybe. I know people made that comparison in the past, but there's some truth to that. Like when you don't have to kind of think, I mean, about any move you make. I mean, you can tap into something deeper with the music, like while you're in the studio. And what's important to understand about electronic music is... we all use the studio as an instrument. You know, it's, I think when you talk to a traditional musician, they go like, yeah, but do you play the guitar? Do you play this and that? It's like, it's a different process. You have to sit down and you... you control so much stuff. It's not really about, okay, I can play the keyboard in that way really fast. You know, it's not about that. You know, it's almost like... the line between the composer the producer the musician and all these things has blurred you know in such a way that it's how the future musician in my opinion should be and then of course how you feel about politics or your personal life or something, it's very easy to express. You know, you don't have to go to university and study classical music for, I don't know, a decade and maybe get to that point, 40, and then recognize what you did. You know, it's like I think the technology can help us to get to the point like much faster. And this is how I understand it. It shouldn't be a tool to make us more lazy. You know, it should be, we should just connect with it more. But I think a lot of people look at it like that. I'm not hopeless. So technology can be kind of a democratizing force in that sense. Yeah, that was always my hope. In every decade I have that hope. But once you're on YouTube, you wonder if this will ever work. What we need is... We need to find really great musicians amongst millions and millions of people. And therefore it's a good thing. I mean, people say, yeah, there's so much bad music now. Everyone just uploads it to the Internet and it's really hard to find good stuff. But the thing is this, I mean, decades earlier, it was like you had to really get signed to a label. And then the question was, was that A&R making the right choice? And, you know, and we don't know who we lost, you know. And in that process, maybe there were better musicians out there that were just not seen, you know. Yeah, I think it's good. Of course, we need to kind of filter the bad stuff. But, you know, that's where music journalists come in. No, but I really believe in that force, you know, that it should be music journalism also needs to kind of adapt and change because like the role of the real critic is more needed than ever, you know, but there is that thing where the print media is losing more and more readers and people go, oh yeah, well, let the intern write the review or whatever. I hope that at some point people would just write in a different way about music because I think it's needed. If you have people just watching a YouTube clip and they don't have the additional information and the context and stuff. There's so many misunderstandings. It's horrible, I think. You know, what some people think, that they leave the comments and you go, I don't even know where to start. Like, you don't know about this, you don't know about that. And then still you are the big judge. You know, knock something. It's basically because you're kind of stupid. I'm sorry. And I think that's why music... journalists are really important and they i hope that there's going to be a new generation of of real like critics who who are real writers and because i also think as musicians we need that you know like if you just i mean the main thing about the internet is always okay artists can connect with the fans right i mean that's always the thing but It's also a dangerous connection sometimes because, you know, I mean, I can say it from my own experience. I mean, sometimes there are misunderstandings where I go, no, I mean, I can clear them up at least now better than 20 years ago. It's, yeah, it's just important to rethink a lot of these. Yeah, the parts of the music industry almost, like the way they used to be, some of them just don't work anymore. And yeah, they have to be rethought and redone or reinvented. You mentioned hackers a few times. Do you feel like a personal kinship with the hacker movement, hacking as an activity? Yes, of course. Like we came from that. I mean, also this happened because at the time everything was like much smaller, you know, like it was a smaller scene. The thing was, if somebody wrote an early music software or something, the chance was that they were part of the hacker scene was very high. It was also because many of these people listened to electronic music. of course, because it was part of a lifestyle. Everybody wanted that, I don't know, to be in this new romance world, kind of. And, I don't know, Timothy Leary and cyberspace and all that stuff. felt like a really good alternative to the boring reality. So, yeah, and I think this also is a link to the modular scene because I think people shouldn't look at music instruments as... like a fetish thing like this is the 303 or the 909 drum machine and this is how it must be used like people need to understand well you can just open the machine up you can maybe apply some changes make it your own this is really hecka thinking and that's of course my criticism to like the ipads and all that stuff where it feels like People are being reduced to these consumers again, and it's getting harder and harder to use them in a different way. So the modular scene is a really good alternative because, yeah, these people think almost like... Outro Music you
