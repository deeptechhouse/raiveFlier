Hello and welcome to Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Will Lynch, and I'm the news editor at Resident Advisor. Superstar DJs might be the face of electronic music, but it's lesser-known artists and professionals that actually keep the scene running. Mark Schneider is one of these people. As a founder of Word and Sound, one of Europe's biggest house and techno distributors, he's been on the front lines of the record industry since the mid-90s. He also happens to be a fantastic DJ, a local favorite in Hamburg and Berlin, though he tends to keep a low profile elsewhere. Earlier this month, Schneider stopped by the RE office to give us his perspective on the state of the record business today and what the way forward might look like. Word and Sound basically is a distribution company based in Hamburg, Germany with an office also here in Berlin. And yeah, so we are distributing vinyl records, CDs all over the world. We distribute labels like Cadenza, Minus and... various other labels, there's over 100 labels we are distributing and that's our main job to get the records out to the customers, to the people. First stop is the shop and then it goes out to the people, the music buyers. How many shops do you distribute to? Yeah, over the years it got less and less basically, which is the kind of digital revolution I would say, also in the music industry. And approximately I would say it's in Germany we distribute to 40 shops roundabout. Some of them are frequent. customers, some of them just occasionally. But we also sell to other countries like Japan, the United States, Italy and usually we work there also with distributors which do the same job as we do over here in Germany as well. Yeah, I mean it seems like especially for European sort of house and techno and stuff like that, word and sound is kind of one of the main ones, right? It's sort of the backbone of the whole thing. Yes, we are... We do that already for quite a while, since '99, with a little bit more experience before with another company. And it used to be called Container Distribution and Container Records, which used to be a big record store in Hamburg. And out of there, we started Word & Sound after we left this company. We started basically as a house distributor first and we were basically only importing music from the United States, from England. And then after a while, more and more labels out of Germany started. And from Europe. And they came to us and asked us if we want to do their distribution and spread the music. And then it went on and we got more and more labels. So how do people like... How do people rely on you? Or when a label comes to you, what is it that, what's the service you provide them, basically? The service is basically, there's two ways the labels and we are working together. It could be either way number one, which is they give us the music, we manufacture. and we sell and distribute the whole stuff, like the records and CDs. Or the second way is the label manufactures the vinyl record itself or the CD. delivers it to us and then we sell it. So there's two options usually a label has. So the first one is the press and distribution deal. So where the pre-financing of the music is handled by us. And do you sort of negotiate with shop? or try to convince them to stock things? Of course. I mean, we have a sales staff that is weekly in touch with all the shops and there's a relationship between the vinyl buyer in the shop and the salesperson from our side. So that's kind of a business relationship which grows after a time. So the buyer and the store kind of trust our sales staff as well. So every store has its little specialty and the salesperson kind of... knows that and operates that way, you know, to recommend certain stuff which might fit better in this store than in the other one. Right. Yeah. I know there are some labels these days that are trying out a model of self-distribution, especially online or just... buying records directly from the label or whatever, like Intervisions, for example. What would happen if just overnight, if word and sound ceased to exist, how would that hit the whole industry? How would that affect everyone? I mean, I totally understand why labels get this idea to do their own distribution. But in another way, I know also a lot of shops, little shops, that can't get hold of certain stuff and it's not worth to buy from a label because the transport is too expensive for them. They don't buy that many copies of one release that it's worth for them to ship from that label. And it's like... It's also a logistic side of things, because we have everything in-house, we can spread the music much wider. The record can reach also shops that might not get the record directly from a label, because as I said, it's too pricey and too difficult for them. It's basically not worth for them stocking the record or getting it. the end. And do you guys use digital distribution? Yes, we have also our digital distribution department. That's word and sound digital distribution. Besides that, we have also a download shop, what people play. And the digital rooster is pretty big now as well, which doesn't... match exactly the physical rooster because certain labels also just don't do physical releases anymore. So we basically have three departments. So the download store, the digital distribution, where we make sure that all the releases end up on all the downloads. shops all over Juno, iTunes. So even if vinyl, you know, if things were completely digital, like if vinyl ceased to exist, you would still be able, the same model would sort of be in place for distribution. Exactly. So we have also, in the digital world, we are kind of operating as well. Right. What are some of your biggest sellers? Right now I can say for this year it was the Totteria release on Running Back. Raggish, it was such a big release for us. The Nicholas Jha album on Circus Company was a very big seller for us. And various other things like also the Boys Noise label is a label that sells still pretty good I have to say. Yeah. It must be interesting to kind of have that perspective on what shops are buying and what's truly in demand and everything. Yeah, you definitely can see everything very realistic. what's going on music wise, sales wise, what the people want. I don't have too much, I can't say so much about the digital sales, but the vinyl sales, they dropped pretty drastically in the last five years. Yeah, of course. Do you think, is it kind of leveling out at all or is it still a precipitous drop over time? Right now I think for the last year it's pretty steady. So you can't really estimate certain things. Sometimes records get their own dynamic and you don't know why this record is just blowing up. Yeah. Certain things... can you can understand like very big club records like the totario for example right but that's still i think that's interesting though because that still is pretty um it's a big record but big in you know a certain world of clubs certainly not big big clubs i think this record is uh had a big crossover potential And also I think there's still a lot of people that buy vinyl but they don't buy vinyl as they used to every week like a big pile including a lot of tunes you were probably playing three times and then not using it anymore. So those kind of sales go over to the digital part. So now vinyl is more, it's only a record that someone's really committed to. Exactly, yeah. So they really think about it twice if they should buy the record or not. Yeah, you said there's sometimes you don't understand why a record is blowing up so much. What's an example of that? Or what's a record that surprised you? Let's talk about the Nicholas Jarl album. I think it's really good for what it is. But I didn't expect that it's going to be that big as it was going for us. So I totally underestimated it. There's also music which we still sell pretty good on vinyl. It's more kind of music which I would think goes better on digital. It works pretty well on vinyl. A good example is Format B. which is a local Berlin act. And we have pretty good sales on their album right now, and on vinyl, which was a big surprise for me, because I thought vinyl heads are going to be... The vinyl heads these days are very dedicated to classic, old-school American music, like from Detroit, from Chicago. But there's still a lot of people that buy also very modern music. which I was a little bit surprised. Yeah. So did you say overall the vinyl is now kind of the connoisseur, almost like music nerd product or whatever, as opposed to strictly a DJ or whatever? Yeah, I think so too. I definitely think it's a total connoisseur. thing which yeah like 2005-2006 everybody was buying vinyl also for DJing it was just vinyl was the DJ medium at this point and then Traktor and a lot of people got those new tools where a lot of people switched to because it was cheaper and it was more comfortable to use, more practical in a way. So a lot of those vinyl hats kind of switched over but they're still gonna, I think they're still buying vinyl but very selected. Is this a sustainable model? The idea that the records are more for the connoisseurs or the more like people with... refined taste or whatever and then the mp3s are more for djs and club music is that something that could work out in the long run i think so yes i think so it's just a question if a label is willing to pay for a vinyl pressing because at the end It can work out, it can make money if the sales are alright, but it can be also the case that the vinyl exists, the sales are not great, but you have your music on vinyl. It's just a cherry on the cake for a lot of people these days when you have a release and you have it on vinyl. I think it's very important also for artists to have basically a physical product in their hand with their own music on it. Right. But yeah, it used to be the cake. Yes, exactly. Do you think maybe that's a generational thing? That the reason it's important is just because it's what they grew up with? I think it is a generational thing as well. It's also a question of... vinyl gets more and more expensive. Yeah. So even the people who grew up with vinyl, they kind of look also on their money if they want to spend. I mean, for a 12 inch you pay in the shop now 10 euros approximately. And if there's only one track on a 12-inch they really like, I think they think about it twice if they should buy the 12-inch or the file for 2 euros maximum or 150. Yeah, but it used to be for a long time a consumer's product to consume music on vinyl. Now it's a connoisseur kind of product and the kids growing up now and getting into the music, they just get introduced to vinyl that way. And you can't buy vinyl everywhere. That's another question. Yeah. You can't get it everywhere. I mean, I heard that Saturn and all those big chain stores, they're stocking vinyl now as well again, which they didn't do before. Yeah. So there's already, there's a little change which doesn't make the vinyl record totally disappear. Right. You know, I mean, kids know about vinyl, but it's just not the excess you had years ago. Is it weird to imagine? a time like when Word and Sound started where records would sell so much or an artist could make a serious amount of money on a record? Does that ever happen anymore or does it seem like a distant memory? I would say it's a distant memory. I think all musicians basically they are really much down to the reality and they know that you can't do much earnings with record sales anymore. And most of the income goes through publishing money and touring and playing DJ gigs. That's the main income. There used to be a good time, like for us I think the peak was 2005. It was the time when you basically could sell everything on vinyl in good numbers and the big records they sold crazy numbers. the income for those artists was really good. What was like a really big record in 2005? I remember I just thought about it and it was Matthew Johnson's It Is What It Is 7 release was blowing up like crazy. I think this was one of the records that started the era where we sold crazy amounts of records. John Tejada, a lot of releases, Mono on Mono, where we sold big numbers on. So we're talking here about numbers like 3,000 to 5,000 copies. And now the average sale of a record is between $300 and $500. So the drop is drastic. Do you think DJs and artists and labels, how well are they adjusting to this whole thing? Did the whole scene just seem way healthier back then? I think at this time when record sales got very, were very strong and this was also a time when a lot of new labels popped up, that those labels also started to be little companies, meaning employing people got little operation. going on, you know, having like working three, four people in offices. So it was working well for them for a long time and they could finance everything. But after a certain time, the record sales dropped. So the income was getting lower and lower. So I think now it's really down to little single operations. I mean, there's still a few labels that operate on a bigger scale. But before they had definitely the choice of doing much more than they do now financially. Right. It's kind of more, maybe felt more like an industry. Yes, totally. Like techno and house became a little bit more mainstream, also sales-wise. And I mean, it's still there. It's still, in a way, mainstream. The music got established after years. The record sales just are not the same as it used to. Yeah. Also, underground music was popular for a long time. What do you mean by that, underground music? I mean the amounts we sold on the vinyl format was pretty high and right now compared to right now it's just so little. If you take into account the digital sales and everything, are people buying a lot less? Or is there a similar demand? I think there's a lot going on piracy-wise. So there's a lot of gray area, which we don't know really what is going on. But I think people... I don't think people buy that much anymore. I think a lot of people are also listening to music in mixes. I think YouTube took a lot of people. I mean, you can be online basically more and more everywhere these days. So you don't really need to download or... buy anything you can just get online and have music 24/7 right now in streams right for free which is definitely becoming more and more popular which means record music sales gonna drop or are dropped already but I think more off the off the digital side yeah terms of selling mp3 files yeah i guess it's funny to imagine that uh i mean like I listen to a lot of tracks on YouTube all the time and everything. And to think that there was a time where if you even want to hear a song, let alone DJ with it or whatever, like if you just want to be able to hear it, there's nothing you can do aside from buy the 12-inch. You know, and it wasn't so long ago. Yeah, yeah. So right now you have the access immediately. If you're somewhere, you can... I mean the sound quality is of course not the same but a lot of people are just they're not professionals they don't DJ you know 2005 or let's say before when vinyl sales were pretty or where vinyl was a medium which what was much more established people were buying record because of one track right you don't have this anymore you still you dj did you do only the final no i mix it up i play i would say 60 vinyl 40 cds is it kind of a um just sentimental thing or um it's just for me personally I prefer to put the record on and have a direct interaction with the record. Also going through my records is just a visual thing. I like to go through the records and look on the label. And that's just my personal view on things. And CDs, usually I play because there's stuff which is not available on vinyl. Right. Or is not yet available on vinyl. So I DJ that from CD. Yeah, I think it's interesting how much in Berlin, and I imagine Hamburg too, It really is still completely the standard to DJ with records. You know, you see, even though Traktor and Serato are so popular. everywhere else, you barely ever see a laptop in the DJ booth, unless maybe it's a live act or something. I don't know, I've always sort of been curious exactly why that is. Given everything you're saying about the vinyl market and how everything's changing, you kind of wouldn't guess from going out to a club in Berlin, you know? Yeah, I think Berlin is a special place. this regards it's um you have a big amount of vinyl connoisseurs on one on one spot i would say yeah there's a There's a long, there's a big tradition also in Berlin, like techno and housewives of the DJs that are, maybe they're kind of old school and they still prefer playing vinyl. And I have to say the setup in Berlin allows also to bring vinyl. And I think there are certain territories in the world where you don't even find a record player. So you bring only CDs. I think there's even a lot of DJs that do both. When they travel somewhere where they know they have to bring the CDs or they just travel with Serato or Traktor. and in Berlin the setup is always there. You have turntables and usually best settings to play vinyl. So you were DJing before you started up with Word and Sound? Basically I was I was starting before Yes and started to go weekly to a record store and then worked a little bit in a record store and then got into the whole thing and just... yeah let my taste also influence the rooster as well of the distribution and i don't know i really liked it and still doing it at this point What was the record store where you were working? It was before, it used to be called Container Records. It was besides Hard Wax and I think there was another store. I mean, there were plenty of record stores at this time, but... Music Man and Cologne were the first ones that imported directly from the States. Meaning from getting Chicago house, Detroit techno, New York house over to Germany and to Europe. so there was before that there were usually not many importers over here so and we we the store was pretty big and was um had a lot of history especially in regards to house music i mean container records was always known for house music and especially for Chicago stuff and stuff from New York, like Classic Garage and New York House. And we had a strong connection actually to Chicago, so we... We did a lot of work for Casual and Relief Records and Prescription and we were doing kind of their distribution over here as well besides having the shop and having a little distribution section which spreaded the music a little bit more. What was the experience of finding out about records and finding out about artists and labels? How was it different back then? It was much easier because there were not so many styles. Not so many producers, not so many labels. You had pretty fast a very good overview of the whole thing. There was stuff from Benelux, Holland and Belgium had a lot of releases coming out. Actually that and Italy as well at this time, but I think Benelux and the United States had a lot of output music wise. It seems like you would really rely on a good record store. to sort of, you know, that would be your total source. Yes, totally. And you couldn't get the music in every record store. So there was basically, I think, in every city, major city in Germany, was maybe one store that carried this kind of music. And I remember going to the record store, there was a big line of... of people waiting for the new arrivals to open up and to put in the shop, to get it fresh and be immediately there when the new records came in and just grab a copy. And sometimes there weren't much copies also arriving, so you were fighting for your copy of, let's say, the new Plus 8 release at that point. Do you think that kind of scarcity made it more interesting? You mean getting there and you mean the limitation? Yeah, I think so. It was, I mean, at this point you were kind of frustrated at some point because when you didn't get a record, you know, you were kind of like leaving the shop disappointed. But I guess that's, if you're really a connoisseur and a music lover and you... you're gonna hunt for the record anyway. I mean you have that these days as well with vinyl limitation on purpose, you know, so there's so much limited editions now and people really are after those. It's kind of a very popular thing now. Yeah. Yeah, and I think it's interesting that there are these labels that, they're not white labels, but... You don't know who the artist is. It's just some weird, you know, cryptic word on the label, no artwork. And there are only a few hundred of them. It almost seems like it's not necessarily nostalgic, but it's like fighting against how things work now, almost wanting to go back to. Yes. Yeah, I mean this was going on before as well, but usually before it used to be like a limited run on a release, so everybody was after the record and then with a little bit delay the record came out again with a full release. So and then everybody, this actually had a very good effect and it worked perfectly, it was a perfect marketing. way of marketing and getting the records sold and to build up the hype of the release. These days it works as well but there comes not... sometimes people are repressing. Let's say Theo Parish for example, he's repressing his catalogue once in a while which is a very good idea I think. It keeps his music available you know and... But there's also music that comes in copies like in amounts of 100 and it stays like that. So of course you go on Discogs and see the prices raising and raising. People pay that price for certain records. You know, if they're really after that. I don't know if I would, but... Yeah, that's the weird thing is that now it... a rare record, whether you get it or not, is kind of how much cash you're willing to pay on Discogs or maybe eBay for some people or whatever. Whereas there was a time where you just had to find it somehow. Yeah, I mean the excess is there right now, you know, but you're gonna pay a good price for it these days. And sometimes it's crazy prices for records on this car. There's another big vinyl market going on on Discogs, which we as a distributor really don't see what is going on there. It's a total own world now. It's like a shadow market. Yeah, totally. I mean, I'm also busy a little bit on Discogs, but to buy even older stuff, which I'm after. There's also a lot of our record stores we supply, they also sell on Discogs, their new material. See it as another platform to get their music sold. Yeah, I'd imagine basically working in a record store, getting started with distributing, would really enhance your DJing over the years. It is actually a big advantage and I'm very happy about to have access to a lot of music and see what is going on and really take advantage of it and also it's not even that it only might influence my DJing, I would say even that for me personally it is... I influenced the rooster of the company and even doing record sales to a store kind of makes you feel very good if you get along with the store and the music, your taste is kind of transported to their shop kind of makes you feel very good. if there's coming good feedback and it works well. So it's like a similar skill almost. It is. Putting on a record versus pitching a record to a shop. I would say, yeah, it is. I mean, it's a selection in a way. You're giving advices to the shop and recommendations and they trust you. How much do you play outside Germany? I would say right now once a month. At least. Yeah, I always thought of you as kind of like a... Like you play all the time in Berlin and Hamburg, but you have a pretty low profile. Internationally, globally, yeah. But I used to DJ. I was on tour in the States in November. Yeah, right. Played a couple of shows. September I went to Japan, played a show there. I'm going to Italy this month. to Israel in February. So I'm kind of getting around also DJ wise. But would you say that is word and sound like your, do you think of one of them as your main career or? They're both pretty much on par. No, I think, I mean, of course, people affiliate you with word and sound. Yeah. Of course, this is there as well. But I try also, over the years, even before I started to work there, I'm still working with a lot of people from that time that are still doing events, you know, and this is going side by side somehow. But yeah, I mean, I guess there aren't very many DJs who, I mean, I only see it in Berlin, but like, it's very easy to see DJ, like you play pretty regularly, Panorama, Closet Visionaire. I don't know, I feel like I've seen you at a bigger variety of clubs than hardly anybody else, you know? Yes, kind of. I'm doing... already for quite a while and I played already a lot of big clubs in Germany and also in other parts of the world and yeah I don't know I'm the DJ career is pretty important for me as well besides the company and so I keep that still alive Yeah, have you ever heard that term, the DJ's DJ? Yeah, I think this kind of fits, yeah, totally. Do you think it's nice to be anchored by a normal job rather than just be fully an artist? Actually, I mean, of course, it anchors pretty much. I mean, besides that, in my private life, there's also other stuff which anchors me. So I'm father of two kids, which anchors me much more, basically. and but i think it's definitely the case and yeah it just seems like a balance that um you don't see too often yes totally it balances out exactly and i'm also making sure that i'm not that i'm home at the right time and not overdo things, so I'll be able to do both still. Yeah, it seems, to kind of go back to what we were saying earlier, I gather people can often be very pessimistic about how things are going with record industry, and people seem like they don't really know what's going to happen. But it seems like the way you feel is, even if it's not the way it was before, this could work in the long run, the way things are going now. Yeah. Yeah, I would say. I definitely would say the vinyl record for itself will be there for quite a while still. Maybe it's going to be a little bit more expensive, but it's going to be still a connoisseur thing and people will still like vinyl. And music sales in general will maybe not be the same anymore, but... I think there will be new ways of trying to sell music in the future. Maybe it's not the same amount musicians are going to do like before. Let's say streaming might be a thing. In some ways it's still free on some platforms, but in the future it might be. accessible mainly with a little amount you pay for it. If you could talk to someone that wants to start a label, is there anything you would tell them that from your perspective you think a lot of people don't understand or that would increase their chances of making it? I think it's quite important that you get on the surface and make yourself visible with a label. You have to really work for that. You have to really promote your record as well. make people aware that it's out there. To make a vinyl release, I mean it's mainly our job to bring it to the shops, but I think it would be a good thing to make people aware that the record is there parallel while the record has been sold. Yeah, and of course it's not about the quantity, you know, just having a few releases out, it doesn't really help the whole thing. Sometimes one release per year helps, you know, if it's right, you know, and just, yeah, just really, if you believe in your music. just go for it, but be aware that it has to be a lot of work done as well. Yeah. Do you think it's too much oversaturated market or there are too many releases coming out? Definitely. Like digital and physical? Yes, definitely. There never was so much music than it's now, I think. It's way too much. It's way too much. You can be busy the whole time, the whole day listening to music and there's still so much which I even didn't hear yet. There's so many new labels and I think the market is pretty saturated. these days. It's like they're all kind of making it harder for each other. Yes, definitely. It's going to be much, much harder. As more labels there are, it's like a big jungle, you know, and you have to get some attention, of course, from people and, you know, also being visible there. And just that's why I said you have to. of work for it a little bit yeah because unless otherwise you're one of a few Is it just like there's easier access or it's to get the label started or to put out a record is just easier or cheaper now? Or why are there so many releases? I think there's much more people doing music, actually. There's so much software that allows to be your own musician in your bedroom, just opening up your laptop and starting the program. you're able to build your own tracks and then you can start your own digital label easily. You don't have to invest any money. You just need contacts first and being able to have somebody. I mean, this is also a lot of labels even sell their music on their own website. Yeah, I remember somebody told me that the thing is in the late 90s or just, you know, any time until, like you're saying, 2005, 2006, you really had to have a lot more faith in a record in order to decide to put it out than you do now. It was, you know, the risk was higher or whatever. It was more expensive to do it. And it might end up selling a lot, but just the whole process was more complicated. So you would only do it if a lot of people felt really good about this record. And today it's not. Yeah, but we're getting there again. Because, I mean, you don't press up vinyl if you're not really 100% sure. Otherwise, unless you don't care and you just press it up. like that but usually you have to really think if you should. That's how a lot of big labels also operate now so they don't release everything on vinyl anymore. They just really think if it might be a vinyl thing, a vinyl release, if it's worth a vinyl release or not. So you have to be really convinced. or have to be 100% sure if you want to put it out on vinyl. Do you think labels put out records just to keep their profile up, or artists for that matter? I think a lot of labels do vinyl also to keep the artist happy, basically. Because as an artist, you want to have a vinyl, as I said before, you want to have a vinyl release in your hand. and you want to that's it is very important for lot of artists who have a physical product in their hands and it's also maybe a point they're putting out vinyl releases to be just in the vinyl world still you know be there not just entering or still available in the digital world or existing there Are there other kind of almost political things like that that sort of waste money or waste energy? No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I mean, for a lot of labels, when we're getting more and more there, that they really think twice if they should do vinyl. argument is of course being making the artist happy and being still in the vinyl world you know having people getting trying to have their music available for vinyl that's basically the main points Because it's still cool having vinyl. As you said, it's still cool having vinyl. It's like as long as vinyl holds on to that appeal. Yes, even if I look outside the techno house scene, a lot of artists, they really insist of having their release on vinyl. They tell the record company, okay, I want to make a vinyl edition. The label doesn't make any money with it. I guess they pay on top, but they... they want to make a special gatefold cover release for an album. Because also the artist thinks that it's really cool. So the vinyl is pretty... Does the real profit or revenue come from digital? I think it's a, yeah, pretty much. It's a mix-up of everything. And I think a lot of labels operate also now as managements. They have like everything in one. It's like an in-house management booking. the actual label for the record sales, it all mixes up together. I think it makes sense for a bigger label to operate like this, having the booking, the shows, the showcases and everything in one house.
