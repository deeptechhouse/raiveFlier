you Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is Paul Kalkbrenner. We've had a fair number of artists swing by our Berlin office over the years. but never a bona fide famous person quite on the level of Paul. He's a platinum-selling producer with a vast major label deal, and at present, a new album that's number one in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. He's also, of course, a movie star. In that way, Paul doesn't really fit the profile of an exchange subject. That being said, he's a former Berlin club kid and B-pitch control signee, and he couldn't really lump his music in with that of other stadium-sized dance acts. Over the course of our chat, I also found that Paul is a pretty normal and affable guy. Trappings of fame aside. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud. at ra-exchange. An Exchange with Paul Kalkbrenner is up next. Thank you. Kind of like right in the middle of festival season. It's the height of the summer. What is your summer looking like? What are you up to? I play a little less shows since I'm a first time daddy since this year. Congratulations. Thank you very much. and so also for to have like a very very full summer my album is coming in August so it's kind of too late it was supposed to be a little bit earlier so now 2017 2016 will be the big run. So it's like down to 20 shows per summer nice big festivals all over Europe and I'm much enjoying it so far. Sun is shining, people are in a good mood. Have there been any shows so far that have been especially good or are there any that you're looking forward to? The two French shows in Solidaise in Paris and Garou Rock in the south of France where just by peaking and also why atmosphere even with like Bengal fire you know the Bengalos you know from the football stadium they're dangerous but I like them so there were the two best shows by far it was also like 50,000 people in front of the stage so good sound everything perfect nice weather And yeah, so there's Tomorrowland, Up to Come and some others, but the level is set high. Well, these big festival shows or stadium shows, arena shows, whatever, is this... kind of the size of venue that you like to be playing is this what you feel works best for the kind of the kind of stuff that you're doing it's working best for the staff it's also working best for me i had one show what was different than all the others like last weekend where i played on solomon's destino where people standing right in front of you and that i'm not really used to that anymore I'm also always, like it was back in the club, so very afraid about my equipment, that no liquid gets in it and the show is over because just someone is just stupid. So it's actually much less stress to appear in front of 50,000 people because you go on your stage, there's your monitoring, it's all far away from those, and you feel just for yourself. It was back in the day, so I was in the clubs. Much more stress, you know, to arrive there with your life equipment, set it up beside the DJs. Hey, could you give me a little bit more space, man? And do it, like plug it all together while the party is running. So yes, that is much more convenient for me now. Do you get phased? by the big crowds anymore? I mean, playing in front of 50,000 people, does it really make you nervous or anything? No, not at all. Especially because it's so also kind of far away. You're not looking actually into one certain face looking at you weird. I mean, I played at the Rostock, Hansa Rostock. We like with Materia together, we saved the club and making like a benefits game there. And even though I played so many shows in front of so many people, when the ball is running to you in front of 30,000 people, that's when the heart is moving down into the trousers. Yeah, but when I play music, then not anymore. You've been playing this music now for well over a decade, two decades, really. Almost, yeah. Yeah. I'm curious about like... when you first had a sense that this music that you were playing sort of had a place in these kind of large venues. I mean, you started going out in what, 1992? Yeah, yeah. Trying to get into the clubs with 15. I mean, techno. was much more underground back then. It was a much smaller scene. I mean, did you have any idea back then that it could work in a stadium? No, we actually made everything was like supposed to be the opposite, you know, not like the rock concert where 25,000 people looking exactly towards the stage where the guys are up to. No, like in Bunker 1992, like several small rooms just with fog and strobe. Didn't even see in which one of them the DJ stands on the same level. And doing now the same thing after like 25 years shows me that obviously is the way things of life go. You know, when a certain size is achieved of something, then things are changing so that the people are reacting exactly that way again. I mean, if I would have known back then, I would have said, oh no, then I'm not doing it because it's not so cool and underground. But from now on to see all things have to develop, especially I have to change always to stay the same. Yeah, but it has been a long way and I would have never thought that it could happen to the techno because it was supposed to be in the small club. Yeah, you mentioned that that's the way that it was supposed to be. I mean, do you feel like what you're doing still is techno? Or because it has changed. I always called it like that. I knew it was always my techno because also back then on the beeper chairs with my music, it was never so easy for me, you know, before like it started to get bigger. People called it neo-trans or whatever, like what was not a very good term back then, you know, around when the new millennium came. I don't know. So there's not a stringent like red line from 1992 to here. It's also a lot of, I don't know, a lot of luck, a lot of things who are unforeseeable and not in your hands, you know, to make that happen. Take me back to that time. I mean, you would have been seeing... this sort of classic Berlin techno scene. What were some of your early experiences with this music? It was the time when like rarely music was produced already in Germany. It was just Berlin, the city where those records from Detroit, Chicago, on Sheffield or Ghent were like played for the first time altogether. And especially with this Berlin story, also this one part of the city, like freed youth, you know, letting it all out, that now the new time is arriving. And that's how I also saw techno all those times, you know, something that is very happy for the future to come, you know, not afraid of it, like many people nowadays are, especially in the rich countries. No, no, it was always a forward thing and it just can't get better. That was what was inside of that. And it was hard and aggressive music for sure. What were some of the clubs you were going to from the early days? Bunker was my first one. Then also Walfisch exit at the Ahornblatt, Leipziger Straße. But also like crazy, like discotheque clubs, like Linientreu in 1993. There was like a lot of DJs playing. And then, I don't know, WMF, all those who were there and closed. And not to forget Ewerg, what was the ruling one for all of us. Old Matrix Casino. Yeah, things come and go. You were a big record collector during that time too. No. No? I only had 50 Deutschmarks Taschengeld from my parents. And per month. So that was like three records and that was it. So you were mostly experiencing this then as a sort of a live medium, a DJ medium. When we were like 15, I didn't know anything about like a techno life act. We wanted to DJ techno. But then in the mid of that decade, we realized, aha, there are also some who are producing those records and some of them even go. I don't know what, with the studio or what on stage. And that's what I wanted to do quite early. You've cited underground resistance as being a pretty big early influence. Oh, yes. Yeah. I mean, we all had those UR hoodies, but it was more like, I mean. Music-wise, I don't know. I liked the Seawolf and some others of them. The rest was not really my music. It was more that it was called Underground Resistance and had the UR hoodie. So an attitude thing more than a musical thing. They had pretty good branding, I guess. Yes, back then even. From the years, they know how it's working. You sort of realized pretty early that you didn't want to DJ. You were mostly interested in playing your own music. live. I mean, this would have been a very difficult goal maybe in these early years. You weren't able to bring a computer on stage. Yeah, but the other equipment, how I actually made my music with was always in a way exactly like I play live today. So I had my DUT recorder where I... pressed record and then I had the mixer in front of me everything was just start and I recorded it on the mixer actually often I had to oh the wrong track was muted at 5 minutes and 40 seconds so I had to rewind it and do it again sometimes 20 times but this idea of playing live in a club Was that something that you had seen? It was coming from the way I was recording. I'd say, if I can record that song the way I also can put myself in the club and do the same thing, what I'm doing there while the DUT is recording, I can do this also in front of people. So that was the idea. Do you remember the first time that you did it in front of people? Oh, yes. In the new Matrix 1999. It was very nice. I think I got 100 Deutschmarks back Was that big for a gig during that time or quite small? It was also quite small. I think good DJs in this city could get like from 500 Deutsche Marks. So yeah, this is definitely early days. I mean, how did it go? What was the reception? to that early gig and did it feel like... Very good. I mean, this year also had my first record. That's actually when everything started. I had to make a little way around after school. I worked like two, three years for editing at German TV and film companies to earn the money to buy equipment with what I did in 97 or something or 98. And then quite soon I had my first release and started to play live. And since then, it's actually the same thing all over and over. First Records came out on B-Pitch. Yeah. That was a very important... I have to interrupt. There were even some before on an even much more unknown label. What, I don't even remember the name right now. But there was like some, you know, early works on some others, but quite soon on Beep It, you're right. Right. And they were a huge part of sort of your start of sort of that early part of your career. I was there 10 years. Yeah. Tell me about that relationship in those early days. I mean, how did you guys hook up? Actually, there were like B-Pitch parties before the B-Pitch label was founded. So after the A-Work closed, like there was somehow like a drop. There was not even a real Friday to go out anymore. Like there was 97. And then Ellen started to do those B-pitch control parties at Glasshouse and other places, Heiko Lauchs playing and some other people. And then in 99, she founded the label, like starting up then really from 2000, I think with release number six or seven, what was my first. And yeah, then it was like 10 years that way. I grew artistically in a way that I, after 10 years, realized a lot of things I like to do, also stage-wise and stuff, are not fitting to this label anymore. With these surroundings, it's impossible for me to do some things I had in mind. So, I mean, 10 years. Let's see how long are people staying today and companies or like even when it becomes to something entertainment like, you know, football players, maybe max two years in the club and then move on because everyone has his own agenda at the end. There's nothing bad to say. And we had like 10 very good years with Mozelek, Sascha, Kiki. This was always when we were on tour like a... like a school vacation so Everything had its time. Would it be fair to say that sort of that progression in your own career over the course of those 10 years was sort of moving from doing a club thing to doing something that was bigger than a club thing? Yeah, yeah. Like I never liked this clientelism in this techno that it's obviously rather for less people if they're really cool, understand it, than for more people. I never understood this idea. People say, oh, I'd rather sell not so many records. This is all half a lie and the other half is bullshit. So no one likes to sell less records than more from the stuff you put a lot of work and effort in. So, yeah, I grew out of that context, you can call it. That also strikes me as kind of something that's maybe quite unique to Berlin. I mean, this is your hometown. Berlin artists sort of tend to cherish how underground they are, and they take great pride in that. You can do that when you're young, but life moves on. And once you have your child in your hand, you should ask yourself, it's cool to earn less, sell less, have less people liking your music. Do you feel like you're sort of maybe out of step in some ways with other parts of Berlin Techno? In techno in general, back in the days wherever I flew, there were at least two, three other guys playing from Europe I know and hello. And it was always very nice. Now I'm there in those dressing rooms where also other acts play on the festival. I have nothing to do with rock music or other stuff. I mean, that's how it goes. It's also maybe a little bit more fitting to the age I'm getting into. So then no regrets. Everything has its time. Also, over the course of that period, you became quite well known for something that wasn't just your records. I mean, you became known for this film, for Berlin Calling. That is something that I think it's fair to say most other dance music producers don't really have to contend with. Yeah, that's rare. I also, when I look back, it was so very dangerous for me to focus on that too much. People were asking me, hey, don't you play so much anymore? New album and stuff? No, no, I'm making a movie. What movie? And I had to take myself really out of the, you know, I was playing less and had actually not so much time to focus on music and no one knew what will become with this movie. I mean, we all got surprised, not just by the release, also then the year later and even a year later and still had Berlin Calling and the guy from Berlin Calling. It was also like 2009, hard for me to adapt this. It was still like, I played then almost every day of this year, still in the clubs with twice or twice the people outside waiting, not getting in because it was full already. but almost every day. So it took a year or one and a half until we started with our concert tour and stuff. So it was crazy one, two years where there were things who were not similar at the same time of size. So it was really hard at that moment until actually everything else grew with the rest of what has grown out. Well, you've said too that, or you've sort of taken pains to point out that you are not Icarus. You're not the character from the movie. No. That's a character. You are quite different. And the longer the movie has passed on the shooting of it, the less I think I have to do. But you were also, I think, you had kind of quite a good sense of humor about this whole thing. I know in the 2010 documentary about the tour, at the arena show, you come out in the outfit. Yeah, that was a bet. It was a bet I lost with my manager, so I had to do it. And it was roughly taped together at the back, because it's kind of open. So it was kind of windy under there. But you've had quite a good sense of humor about this whole thing. I mean, were there ever moments when you said to yourself, man, I wish I hadn't done that. It's hard for me to be taken. It's hard for me to separate myself from that movie role. I just want to be Paul Kalkbrenner. Oh, yeah, especially in that one and a half years. Hey, come on. I also did Freeform Music. Can that go off But especially from now, when I look at it, just the experience, like to work in a team, when I'm actually incapable to do so, you know, music I could never do with somebody else in the studio. And also to prove it to myself that at least for eight weeks, I can do it. To get up at five in the morning and, no, pick up five in the morning and then shooting for 12 or 15 hours. while I'm actually not anything in the morning hours, I was proud after just to be able to do that. Well, I bet. I bet. I mean, not that making music, being a live performer in clubs is not a lot of work. But working on a film, that's a whole lot of work. It's much more, you have to be concentrated. You cannot live like you live on tour where you float a little bit, you know, from here to there and then you go on stage. That's always enough power to like pull yourself together for one and a half hours on stage. It's a completely different animal there. That's why I don't want to do it again because it is not my way of working. I was going to ask if... you ever thought about jumping onto another film role? I mean if they asked me in like 15 years when everything becomes bigger and maybe a public figure and stuff and they ask me hey we have for our new Bond movie it's again the German villain we need and we would like to have you and I'm older than then I would do that but beside that I don't know. It is so long. It's even much more than an album, you know, where you commit yourself maybe for one or two years and working. This is so much more. Everyone, directors and production, everything, this idea. But it's actually with preparation, everything, it's almost four to five years. And this is a much, much bigger commitment to anything and much less instant feedback, you know. especially someone who's used to very instant feedback in front of people it's it's a hard business harsh and hard business sort of shortly after that whole period you parted ways with b pitch And you started sort of your own label. You started doing everything in-house. Tell me about that decision. As I said, the time were up. It was, you know, like Schweini. Now he leaves the Bayern, goes to United. We could have never thought about it. But he needs to move on because he wants to achieve something else than what could be offered where he is. So I wanted to do it myself, actually. I wanted to have more control over my artistic output and the places I appear and how it's happening. And it was exactly the right time to do so. There was enough interest of people. We were able to, you know, fill up like a concert tour. We were not sure if that would work. Hot tickets. And everything turned out fine. Was it more work than it would have been to stay with a label or to move to a different label? More work, a little bit less headache, you know? So I also, my manager now for also the last five, six years, he was also the booker before. Beepage so we actually kind of left together and he is a very trustful person he's from the west even I would have never met him if the wall would not have come down but I sometimes I remembering this oh my god you would have never met this guy what then and yeah it was Great five years to do it by myself. We make it very nice in Germany or Austria, Switzerland, also some other markets. And now I even moved on again. I have also fans in Lithuania, on Peru, but I can't get busy in those markets. I can't even go there. I have not the time to. And so special distribution-wise, I needed now a stronger partner. So the five years I did it with the PK Music were, let's say, the freest time of doing something. But it was also... somehow it is limited what you can do you know you can have a nice deal with rough trade and distribute and distribute it to some markets and do here and there and continue playing your shows. Also, the records can go maybe gold in Germany, but that's actually it. And I need new things to happen. Going out on your own, in doing your own, sort of totally your own thing for five years, do you feel like you grew as an artist during that time? Did you learn things about how you wanted to do things, what you wanted to do? especially learn what you especially not want to do and then you just don't do it that's the point and at the end you stand much clearer with your artistical output and all what that means and all the blah blah blah around that is much more nearer much nearer to the core than you know on a label they're always this and that also with my booking William Morris I realized there's often also politics behind stuff What may not even have to do with me. So the PK time was the time where we actually, as I named the songs of my album, I didn't really care about anything. There's absolutely freedom. It doesn't matter how the tracks are named. If the song is good and runs in the radio, the guy from the radio doesn't even have to say it, you know, this word. Yeah. You sort of hinted at this, that there were definitely some learning experiences along the way. I mean, can you tell me about some of those specifically? Yeah, I mean, in the first place, it is like this, that... We have a team where also then before I didn't have a light guy or video guy and all this stuff. But since I do this alone on my own, it's the same team I have with me. And it's also very important to me, the continuity. When you work with someone like trustfully together, then you should try everything what you can to maintain that. Sometimes you have to make some cuts in the team, you know, sometimes they have beef with each other. that's normal but um especially that you realize that it's a big luxury you know after the Berlin Calling I left Beepitch 10 years grown as an artist and then you stand there and you can really for the first time like do whatever you want and I said oh I don't want to announced the the two first albums i don't want to make pre-single or stuff i just say it hey it's out here please no one's forcing me to anything rolling stone wrote that like in 2010 he must be the the happiest artist momentarily no one forces him to anything he just does what he wants but also as i can see for me that after five years now it's not enough And then you make a decision to sign a major label deal. And this is, it sounds like quite a big deal. When it came out, it was described as being worldwide. Priority release. Priority release. What does that mean? That means that I agree that I will do my best with doing the music. I can do whatever I want music-wise. It says it several times underlined in the contract. And that Sony agrees with putting all the power they have to make it to a worldwide successful release. So that they also are forced to work for it and not just signing a major. that doesn't mean anything in the first place. It could mean anything good or could be anything bad. We had five years where I was alone, all the majors with their German dependences asking in our management. But again, it showed. My grandma always said, the things come to the one who can wait. It's an old German saying. I could have done five years ago with much, much, much smaller numbers and no freedom. And now I waited long enough. We also found a very nice guy there, Wolfgang Boss. He's the vice president in national AR who understands what it's about. Also within Sony to place me as far as possible from everything EDM style. But also William Morris already five years ago, just deeply understood. You know, it's just an artist with an own oeuvre. And so I'm very happy. It took a long time. It was also like negotiating like over a year. I can imagine these things don't come easily. But in terms of the negotiation, I mean, the fact that you can... go to a label and say look for the last five years i did this totally on my own and i and i grew it from here to here that must put you in like much better position so that i can say i mean within germany i don't know how i could do it even better with you especially financially because it was a very good agreement with rough trade before so i actually earned everything from my record almost so That is different now. But as I said, there are so many, the world is very big and so many countries who maybe have fans in it. And I can't really go there, bring it to them in a way. Is that the biggest advantage? Distribution-wise, it's the biggest advantage. Plus the archive thing, of course. What is the archive thing? That I can go to the archive as the first artist being granted that access. And I can snoop around in their old stuff. I think they have it from like mid-60s. Stems in good quality. Well, this is something that I picked up on. listening to your record, I mean, there are a couple of pretty massive samples. There's Luther Vandross. Yeah. There's Jefferson Airplane or is it Jefferson Starship at that point? No, it's Jefferson Airplane. Yeah, yeah. I mean, these are probably not records that are so easy to license if you're not working with the label. Exactly. And that's also there was then with the D-Train, there was so much dealing. I just hear it on the side. I don't know. That's why a lot of people working there, you know, to make those things happen. Also that I don't have to name it their old way of featuring this and that. I wanted to because it's put in such a... new context that I wanted to avoid that. When you were making the new album, which is called Seven. Yeah. Or Sieben. Or Sieben. Yeah, it's just the, how you call it? The digit? Yeah, yeah, just the digit. Just the digit. Yeah, yeah. So Seven or Sieben. Did you know that, were you making this when the deal had already gone through? Was this label specifically, was this record specifically for Columbia? No. the vocals came in later and then it's like from heaven I had like The first sketches are from September 2013 and I was from the beginning very happy with it. There would have been also a very nice plan B. Not having the vocals and doing it again on PK would be a nice instrumental record here, going gold in Germany. But as I said, not enough at one point. And there was not even many vocals. There was not much time also then. There was not many vocals I could listen through. But the ones I had, now why they were fitting so on what I had made before already. So they were like sent to me. So I don't know. It was stunning. Yeah, because the tracks where the vocals are on, they almost existed like they're now before I knew or heard what kind of vocals would come on it. Still inexplainable what happened there. Talking a little bit more about this worldwide. thing. You know, Germany, you've conquered Germany, you've done Germany, continuing to do it, but Europe has also been really huge for you, Europe as a whole. So what are the parts of the world that are sort of next up? I need to close the big gap, like this discrepancy between I'm playing in... In Belgium or France, like the big headline in front of all the bands flying over the channel to UK, when very small, more on the bottom of the poster. And also in the US and Australia, very, very small as an artist. Like, I want to close that gap somehow. So yes, it is for the English, Anglo-Saxon world. This is what I need to... become a little bit bigger. Like until now, my music wasn't even really available in the US. So it's time to make that step. How aware are you of sort of what's going on in the States? Lots of people talk about this EDM thing. I mean, do you... Yeah, but this is not what I... I can say I'm not a big EDM hater. I mean, I hate the music, but I don't hate that also those artists, maybe just by making Americans getting used to 4 to the floor bass drum, also the chance is much higher that, let's say, Berlin artists, even from the underground, is maybe recognized also there one day. They opening big gates with that. Yeah, I mean, the size of those shows, the way that those big EDM shows are produced is not so far removed from what you're doing. But the sound of your gig is going to be much different from Skrillex or Deadmau5 or something. Yeah, I mean, this is even still okay. You know, there are much worse stuff going on. But I mean, everyone has two ears to listen. And if someone wants to put it into the same pot, then I just can say, hey, just listen to any albums of mine and then listen to any EDM album. You will hear what's different. So, and also that I... Now with this contract of where before already an artist of a certain size makes me completely unafraid that there could be like do shit with me or like put me into a place where I don't want to be or where I not belong. This is all sorted out and I'm actually continuing what I'm doing just on a bigger level again. I think I've read. Before, you know, that you've talked about how your music is continually progressing. With this new album, I mean, how do you think you grew sort of between Guten Tag and this record? I mean, I have to say to Guten Tag and also to Icky Vita, those two albums were made from my archive within three months, somehow in between big touring. So I don't even know anymore how I did that. This album has almost taken up more than one and a half years of working on it. So that was my major approach. I started to already play less in the end of 2013 to have a lot of time for this album. put it away for a month, getting back to it. So I'm not so satisfied with the last two albums anymore. Also, what I said before, what I don't like about the techno, the clientelistic things that you still think, ah, for the old fans, you maybe have to have like maybe three, four, five techno stompers on it. But that's just alibi, you know? I said, no, I do not need to have this on my album. I just want to... do the songs I really want to do. And the motto was spring. It was actually supposed to come out this spring. Now it's a little later. But this was the big motto for it. And let everything out. All melodies, everything. Don't hesitate. Don't think people say you are neo-transer and you don't belong to techno anymore. I'm out of this anyway. The fans, I could lose on doing something too, let's say, commercial. Those I have lost already a long time ago. So there will be always an interchange of fans. And if you want to be an artist who works in this job for longer than five or seven years, then this is what needs to happen to your fanbase. Otherwise, you play like Lionel Richie in front of people who are as old as he is. And he's 66. He looks much better than them. But, you know, that's the point. So fanbase have to change if you want to do this longer than just for your youth. So it's not just about growing your fan base. I mean, that's obviously part of it. But it's also about kind of bringing new people into the fold and understanding that some people will probably leave as you get bigger. Of course, that is the normal way. That was already when I was on Beepage, people telling me, hey, that's not cool anymore. That's not the underground shit. Or that, you know, Paul Kackbrunner, not Paul DB anymore. I'm very mad about that This I heard even 15 years ago. So I'm not really, yeah, it's not touching me anymore. But back then it was always hard to lose one fan. Of course. Tell me a little bit about your studio process these days. I mean, how close is your studio to what? you're working with in the in the live space it's the complete opposite on my old way of producing is only on stage i like maintaining the way on stage playing live the way i recorded back then today that is ableton also that i use it from day one that's now almost 14 years And also with these one and a half years of making this album, the skills I have with making music were at the end of the production, again, better than at the beginning. So this is what it's about, to become better and better at what you can do and make this road shorter from what you have in your head. That is a nice song. Yeah, now make it audible. to what other people also can listen to and this is what actually my biggest approach is to when somebody talks about growing as an artist everything else is the the outside thing as what it appears but this that I got better and better all my old records when they say you were cooler back then a lot of stuff is because of like a big lack in skill and a big lack in good equipment So it has its charm, but I'm much more happier with what I'm doing right now. It's also what I really want to do, not just what happens in the studio with the machines and me. It's also a very non-playing around. time when I'm in the studio. I sit down and do what I want to do. It's very target oriented. Do you still see sort of room to grow as a producer though? Oh yes. I thought before, oh no, but now having really spent so much time with one album, I realize, oh man, if I could go back, I would have other stuff from the beginning of the production process, I would do it differently. Yep, that's how it is. You say you want to continue sort of to grow with your studio craft in the live sphere and with your recorded material, you want to reach sort of newer audiences, bigger audience. Actually everyone, not just young people. I hear from many people, the kids are just silent in the car if a PK CD is running or something. So I call it technical people from 8 to 88. out of this clientelism, you know, that it's just for those who know. I found there's always a little bit. That keeps it small, guys. That keeps it small. This is just something what is attractive to you when you're young, when you realize that your powers are not endless and you maybe have children, then you start thinking differently about that. Yeah, I would imagine that having a kid probably influences like all aspects of your career. That probably changes your whole outlook on everything. It changes the life. I was always thinking that, you know, now I'm 38, I was thinking all the years before that I'm too late to become a dad, should have done it earlier, but now realize it fits perfectly, you know. The album was ready in February and the child was born in April, so everything is very fitting into my life. Are there other ways in which you kind of see yourself growing? as an artist, sort of beyond the ways that we've talked about, is there still, are there still these sort of hurdles you would like to, you would like to get over, these sort of mountains you would like to climb? Yeah, now at the moment, no hurdles in sight, to be honest. Before signing the contract there, it felt like a little bit like a last step of something, but now I realize just somehow the first step of something. We were also a long time thinking, should we do it or should we not? But now after I've done it, there is also no sense in thinking what could be regretful to it. Now I'm trying to start again. With the label I'm onto as trustfully as I can. It's, I think, three fixed and two options for, I think it's supposed to be within 12 years then. Then I'm 50. That would be a good end. Good time to retire, I guess. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need to go to my boat. No, I don't have one, but metaphorically. Sure. You are a massive football fan. Yeah. I'm curious if this influences your career at all. Oh, yes, it did. Just listen to Guten Tag, what came out in 2012 at the end of the year after the Bayern have lost so cruelly against Chelsea in their home stadium, the final. The new album is out after the Bayern won the Champions League the next year and over next year we became the world champions. So now ask yourself if this has any influence in the happiness and everything what is in this music. It definitely has. There's, you know, this sort of, I don't know, cliche, maybe this is more of a rock music thing than a techno thing. I don't know. But, you know, music is sort of antithetical to athletics or something, or these two worlds are very separate. But I mean, I wonder, like, do you think you can really learn something about how to conduct your career about about how to? I don't know, do all of this stuff from the world. No, actually not, because they are in the very unfortunate position that with the age of 30, 32, some maybe 34, it definitely ends because the body is done for this kind of sports. And now I'm 38, starting something completely new is a big advantage. So that's why I can understand that young players... are looking out where is maybe another contract looking if the time where you can earn money with something you can do well where you have put all your youth in to be able to do it well is so short and so limited you don't even know it's lasting you your knee is injured and then maybe with 26 that was it so I have understanding for that everyone is following his own agenda there. You're now, I mean, as an artist, pretty well outside of the club world, outside of the sort of underground techno world. It's also too late. Yeah, yeah, whatever. No, I mean, too late. I cannot play anymore, like 4.30 in the morning. I have no power for that. I'm good at midnight. Yeah, of course. Are you still at all interested in this world, in touch with this world? Are you still listening to new dance music? I don't listen to music at all. I mean, I do so much music. Everything I do is music. So the rest of the life, I'm fine that it's music-less. Also with a child now, football, vintage cars, a lot of things I'm interested in, politics. And no, no time for music. I mean, yes, I have time for music. I would maybe listen to much more music if I wouldn't do this as a profession. But because I do it as a profession for so many years, And also, yeah, I feel it necessary to also keep my ears in silence for long times of the day. So when you come home from the studio or come home from a tour, from a big gig. Especially then not. Please, also the taxi driver, please stop the music, the radio. The silence is as important as the sound to hear what's inside of yourself. You know, you grew up in East Germany. Lichtenberg. Lichtenberg, East Berlin. Do you ever think like if you could sort of go back? to you as a young boy and sort of whisper in your ear and say, this is what I'm doing now. Would you believe it? I mean, it would be bad because then the little guy would do shit because he knows the big stardom is coming to him. You know, that's why you should never know anything from the future. And also, if I don't know, my parents would have gave me like a big money or here. So please don't stress us. Here's money. Buy what you want. When I was like maybe 18 or something. And also I would have maybe not done it. So it was always what I want to become. And I had to make a life out of it. So you think maybe that upbringing, like that personal history kind of gave you a little bit of a push. It gave you a little bit of a fire. I mean, when you have no fire under the ass, what are people tending to do? Sitting down, drinking maybe coffee, chilling, talking to friends. So there's no life to be made out of that. I won't be mine, you're the one for me I'll be mine, you're the one for me I'll stand up, don't clap, you're the one for me I'll be mine, you're the one for me I'll stand up, don't clap, you're the one for me The one for me, the one for me I stand up, don't cry, I'm not The one for me, you live for the good life The one for me, you're the one
