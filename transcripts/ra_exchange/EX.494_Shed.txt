Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Rene Pavlovitz is one of the most influential and consistently great techno artists of the last decade. You could pick out almost any of his 15 plus aliases at random. and found a discography full of tracks that changed modern dance floors. Head High, EQ'd, WK7 and Wax, just to name a few of his better known monikers, are all essential parts of the techno canon, which is to say nothing of his era defining albums as Shed. Pawełowicz is fresh off the release of a new LP called Odebruch, so he came by RA's Berlin office for a conversation with Will Lynch about the concepts underpinning the record, which is his most thoughtful, personal, an arguably strongest album to date. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Shed is up next. Yeah, we did an interview quite a long time ago for the blog Little White Earbuds. I don't know if you remember that. But at the time, you described your process as being super straightforward, just sort of like you have an idea, you sit down, execute the idea, and it's done. I think it's the first time that it's changed with this album. A lot of things changed when I started to think about creating the new album. So it was the first time that I took some time off and tried to get on my own, sitting in the studio and making music. Actually, it wasn't happening. So I had the chance to have four weeks without family So I took all my stuff with me to the house in Oudebroeck But the only thing I did was for two weeks. I was fishing The whole time so it's it's really close to the old it's a river and I thought now it's silent everywhere, no one who's disturbing you, you can write music and make music the whole time, but it wasn't, not at all. So I was, yeah, for two weeks I did actually nothing. And then the pressure increased. In the end of the four weeks, there was one and a half track. In the end, it was a good decision because I had a lot of ideas and kind of feelings or like emotions in my head. So it was very easy to write the music after these weeks at home. That was really cool to do it like that. In the end, maybe that's part of the process, this sort of sitting there, not getting anything done and thinking about it. Yeah, it's all about pressure then. You sit down and say to yourself, no, please, make a tune. And it's not, I don't like that. I'm lazy, I have to say. I guess the ideal situation is an idea comes to you and then you react to it. Yes, it is. I mean, it's the first time that I had something like a concept. So I knew that I would like to name it Oderbruch. It's about the area in Germany. I had a lot of ideas. Actually, the track names were first. And then I tried to... bring some music to the to the names so to the titles it was yeah 80% was easy and the last week I tried to no I changed some tracks with the titles I made some tracks for this title but I changed the track title in the end sometimes it was I was cheating myself yeah What do you mean cheating yourself? Yeah, it was a bit, it was a, it was a, I made a track and it was about the river. But afterwards, I had these 10, 12 tracks. I simply changed the track to when it had a new title. So it was actually not made for Dioda, for the river. It was made for, I don't know, something else. I simply switched it. It's actually not true what I did. Can you explain kind of how a track... would be about a river. Like in what sense does the river... It's all about floating. It's about the water, of course. We have these jetties at the Oder, these kind of land sticks. And it's always about the sound when the water is floating above the jetties. And that's what my picture is in my head about the Oder, about the river Oder. That was my try to make music about something. I mean, it's really crazy to make music about something that you can hear and you make music. It's actually absurd. But I try to find a way in my head to translate pictures into music. And you said that was a new thing. Absolutely. Absolutely. So actually, I don't have a plan what it is about actually, like having a name or describing a city or a street or a tree or whatever. That was the first time that I did something like that. And it's changing the process of making music. That's what I think. And you don't start with a bass drum. And it's more quiet in the end. That's what I have to say. And there's more stereo. It's more about the sounds on the right and the left than in the middle. So you mean when you start with an image, I guess. as, I don't know, as a jumping off point. You're saying the music ends up, you think more about things like the stereo field than you would if you were... Yeah, because there is more space. When you make techno, there's a big bass line, a big bass drum, and that bass drum is about... 60-70% of a techno track is the bass drum or bass line. So, and if you don't need to push the limit, there's more space where you can play around with sounds. What made you want to approach the album in this different way? Yeah, I had to do something new to be a mid-40 guy who's still doing techno. So it can't be the future, actually. Yeah, I thought I would like to make music that I would like to hear at home. And I'm not listening to straight techno at home. Your last album was called Final Experiment. Yeah. Was there any... kind of meaning behind that name? No, not at all. It's always, it's actually always fun. There's a label called Final Experiment. There was a track. on an album I think on the second one called Final Experiment so it's always playing around with with something so yeah it has there was no reason for for anything so sure so this is the first time your track titles have had that level of meaning yes serious it's really serious Yeah, really. Yeah, I thought a lot about this. And I'm really happy to do it with Oscult because it's actually the right place for it. How so? How they think about things, how they create something, the whole... the whole behavior at Berghain it's it's it's actually what I like so it's I was I was talking to Alex from from Osgood I don't know one and a half year ago and we were just talking on a on a party for Steffi's release album last year I think and it was just talk not anything about releases or making music or something like that just just talk It was cool. And then the idea started to grow. I had this idea in my head and I was asking him and I told him some things about it. And he said... About Oderbruch. Yeah, Oderbruch. And he said, it's cool. Good idea. Let's see what you're doing in half a year. And then I was starting to do some things and it was good. It's a good place. You put a lot of music over the past 15 years or so. I guess this kind of... what you just described as this sort of new creative process for this album. Have you gone through many sort of different approaches to making music over the years? Or is this kind of the first time? I think it's the second one. The second big change. Yeah, the second big change. The first one was really in the beginning. So I think around... 2007, I think, when the first Equalizer and Wax came out. There was a certain point where something changed. What changed exactly or what did it... What was your experience of that change? I found out how to create a proper dance floor track. And when I started to release music on the first label, like solo action, it was not easy to play. I mean, it was okay music, but nobody played it because it was hard to mix and the sound was really bad. Then I had a chance to listen to my stuff on a dance floor because some people I knew played it and I was on the floor and I was checking out how the frequencies are and something like that. And then I really tried to get a proper bass drum. So that was the point where I started to think about it, to create music in a different way. And it was more the easy way because it's much easier to create. techno tracks than something with some serious music, I would say. But once you figured it out, it seems like there was kind of a floodgate opening. You just kept pumping out these killer dancefloor tracks. It was, it was open, the gate was open suddenly. So I can't tell you. For instance, I think the first three wax and two equalized records were made in one week. So I made these tracks in one week. So I released them in three years. So it was, it was suddenly there. So you were in this, at that period of time, I guess it was just like you were in this kind of feverish. constant state of making music or you just got yeah exactly exactly and and also because it was new for me to to to play as a dj or live and to uh to listen to my own stuff uh yeah that was the that was the change the big change i feel like you also went through a period where you were trying out loads of different things and you seemed to kind of just know how to do all of them. Like you did a couple dubstep records with Panamax Project and you had these, you know, serious techno kind of bombs, then also these sort of housey things and you're still making the kind of... IDME music is shared. Because I like the music. It was also in the 90s, I bought techno as well as house music or breakbeat hardcore stuff. So I was always on tour on all the dance floors. So I was not only into techno. It's so boring only to listen to techno, for instance. I don't want to find out how to do it or something like that. It's only because I like it. So a proper bass drum is a proper bass drum. It doesn't matter if it's in a house record or techno. So actually it's techno and house. It's actually the same. That's what I would say. I guess to me, it might be hard for you to have perspective on yourself in this way. But to me, I feel like many people hearing you would say like a lot of people like all that music, but the ability to kind of to have original ideas in those genres and to competently make that music. that's something that kind of sets you apart from other artists. It seems like you can kind of just try out all these things and, and kind of nail them. What's your reaction to that? I have to say it's hard to get respect from all the different scenes. It's always when you do techno, I mean, Shed is techno or something like that. And it's not easy to play as Shed on a house floor because all the house people wouldn't say it's cool. But as a hentai, Elias, it's okay. For instance, it's not easy to do UK rave stuff. or drum and bass, because this scene is totally different. So you can do a record, but they wouldn't care. They don't buy it, because you're not part of the scene. And for instance, also with dubstep, it wasn't easy to do a dubstep record and to get the chance to play a dubstep party or something. That was not happening, because all the hardcore dubstep guys... they didn't know anything about me and that's that's okay that's good that's cool yeah beside of uh pinch for instance there was something different as i said with uh drawn base or something like that and it's still it's it's still that a lot of people didn't know that i did this record or the wax record or the equalized stuff And there's still a lot of people that don't know anything about the other Elias. And that's sometimes interesting. Is that kind of what you wanted with making all those different aliases? I don't want anything. I don't care, actually. I have to say I really don't care about this. It's the same music. It's actually the same. It's a different speed. But the plan is always the same. So the creating procedure. In what sense? What is that creative procedure that's always the same? How does it work? If you would like to do something for the dance floor, you have to start with a bass drum. That's the first step. You can't start with a string sound or something like that. Then it's going into the wrong direction. So first of all, the bass drum must be good. So that's it. I mean, in the end, you can hear that it's always from me because the feeling is the same. The drum plays are the same. On the topic of your kind of broad range of different projects, you've got about 20 different names listed on Discogs or something like that. The most recent one just came out this year. By mistake, it's Hoover 1. It was a mistake at Hardworks creating the file, the first file, and it was going out to all the download shops and now it's called Hoover 1. Wait, so it's meant to be called Hoover 1? No, actually it was Hoover. Right, okay. But now it's called Hoover 1. So with Hoover, just to take that as an example. does that come into existence like you have an idea for a track and then you think like Maybe this could be a new name or, you know, how does it work exactly? I make a lot of tracks at home and sometimes they are there since two years now or something on an HD. And suddenly I'm listening through all the older tracks and then there is a kind of a creating process in my head that this track from this year and the track from last year I made, they could fit together. Then I start. to think about doing something new or yeah something like that that's that's the process actually there's there's no idea uh in the beginning of creating a or i do a hoover now and i do drum and bass or hardcore no that's that's not the point so it's always the the opposite actually so you're making music without really a clear plan and then the sort of organizing it or saying like this would work for this record that's just like a separate process yeah I mean when the allies is there when there's a record out the second record is a different thing so because then I start to release something that is like the first record or create something that is that fits to the other one to the one before but creating a new a new allies is I don't know, it can happen today or tomorrow that I think this and this fit together and we can do something new. That's something new. But actually it's not. Yeah, but I mean, the Hoover one is, it's because I love the UK rave stuff. So I was showing that I love it. I guess this might be a tedious question for you, but the incredible range of different names, is that connected to the way you feel about... identity and music or is it just that you like creating all these different aliases? No, it makes things easy for me because I can release a lot of stuff. That's what I would say. So if I would do everything under the shadow lies that it's nobody would listen to it anymore. So that's what I think. It's about music and it's what I'm, what I mean in the beginning of the interview, it's, it's about the music. It's not me. So, and that's what I try to to show that's that's it's because of bringing out a white label not with my name on it or something like that i mean it's cool when people say ah it's it sounds like renee and it is so good but it makes things not very easy to get bookings so that's that's the the the problem is what i didn't think about in the beginning so but it's it's it's it's okay I can live with it what's your kind of day-to-day like are you making music all the time do you make music most days or no it's it's um it's um I make music for three weeks and then I stop for three weeks. So it's something like that. So I can't do music the whole week or every time. So no. It's always a kind of refreshing period. And then I go to studio back again and do some music. And then I do some for weeks, some family stuff and don't do music or make music and yeah, something like that. And when you're making music, are you fairly productive? of like you start things and finish things? Yeah, yeah, yeah, always. If I don't finish it, I will never ever touch it again. So it's getting lost then when I don't finish it. So like beginning to end, how long would you work on one track? Yeah, it depends. Sometimes it goes very quick and sometimes it takes a week. What's very quick for you? Yeah, five hours, I would say. Yeah, sometimes. I mean, it's repetitive stuff. So you only cut, copy, paste. So that's it sometimes. You said before that the middle-aged techno artist can't be your future. I guess for someone in your position, I don't know, how else can you play it? Or, you know, what can you... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. 10 years ago, I said... that I would like to stop with when I'm 40. So that was four years ago. So I think I will tell the same story in 10 years. I mean, I love techno and all my friends are with techno. So it's hard to get up by night and to drink alcohol the whole time. I don't need to. I know I don't need to drink. But actually, it's not hard. It's still okay. I can live with it. It's still fun, but sometimes I feel really old when I look to the dance floor and I see all the people there. Sometimes I think, come on. I could be your father and sometimes more than this. But actually, it's my problem. So when I was 20, I thought about a DJ that was older than 30. I thought, come on, go away, please go away. But today it seems to be different. So I'm always... asking is it isn't it isn't it is it strange when a 40 years old guy is here in front of you and play techno or something and they say no no it's okay it's it's it's okay for me it's strange sometimes i mean i ask partly because i think it's quite a common experience that um many people have this at the center of their lives and it's not clear where that goes. But then maybe there's no reason to worry about it. Or maybe it's sort of like a dated notion that it's a young person's game. It's not on me to stop. I think for me it's still okay. As long as I don't get a beer can onto my head when I play or something like that. And they say, go away, old man. So it's all okay. But I don't feel old. It's crazy. It's kind of a midlife thing, I guess. So I still feel like 30 or something. And now I see I'm 44. And I can't believe it. I really can't believe it because I still live like I did 10 years ago. And it's only in my head, I guess. So it's hard. In a way, I would say you're very fortunate that you have something that continued to... Basically, your relationship with making music has seemed very steady over a long period. Is there any way you could explain kind of what you get out of it? Like when you're making music, what is it? We said you, for instance, a minute ago, you said you said that you would stop when you're 40, but you're still doing it. What keeps you in it? I don't know. I'm still nervous when a new record comes. comes out or so I'm I still like it to to send the stuff to the mastering studio so and I still like to create the labels so it's I'm still curious about the manufacturing thing so that's still what I like I still stamp all my records myself so and it's it's all about this going to going to hardwax and go and stamp thousands of records and I live it. I love it. That's all I can say. And it's not on first sight the music. It's about the whole thing. So I really, I can't sell myself. I can't promote myself. That's my problem today. But I still like the idea of making a record. So it's still this one, to have something. in my hands with my music on it. So it's still about this. With your most recent album, If I Can Offer a Personal Opinion, I think it's particularly strong. Something about it feels like everything came together in a way that's kind of hard to describe. When I'm listening to it, I wonder if your experience of it was... any different than say the last one like did it feel to you that you were particularly in the groove or that this one was going well can't remember the last one no no that's it i don't know if there's a big difference between these ones i could For me, it's always the same. There's no difference. It's the problem of the artist, maybe. So I don't know. It's always about the feeling that gets you when you listen to these tracks. It's not about the kind of music, not if it breaks or... electronic techno it's not about this it's about the this certain feeling that you have when you when you are listening to to these tracks so that's what's important to me in my itunes playlist it's not it's not oderbruch it's not final experiment it's called from the first to the last one it's stp1 stp2 stp3 so it's it's all about this shedding the past thing It's the title. So this is kind of a constant thing. It's just you sit down. Yeah, it's very personal. So it's my record. I don't care what other people think about it. It's cool when they like it. But it's me. It's a very personal thing. It sounds to me like it's this thing that's running the whole time, kind of, that you tap into. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And sometimes you have a lot of tracks that... Fit together and you can do an album that like it was the other almost before This time it was a different thing. So, yeah, that's maybe the difference. But I think the feeling, the mood is always the same on my albums, I think. It's always this, oh, it's like, not like a depressive guy, but it's an emotional thing. It's about, I don't know, it's a certain mood. That's what I like to have on an album. It's always hard because it's always about the past. When I try to explain my music, then it's always, I have to talk about the 90s, I have to talk about shedding the past was the first one. And yeah, the guy seems to have big problems with this. It's nuts. It's in a positive, melancholic way. I'm not depressive. That's a funny one, though. I mean, that's a basic part of the human experience, like letting the past go. But when you talk about it, they judge you, you know? Oh, come on. He's crying the whole day because he's getting old now. But that feeling that you're saying that all your albums share is a very particular kind of... in between emotion I would say positive melancholic positive thing that's what I and it's there should be melodies where you can that you remember you know sometimes it's a track it's cool but you don't remember it next year so that's what I like when you when you hear a melody a certain melody and this thing yeah I know that it is this trick or from this hope that's that's cool *music* Bye. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ so ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ you
