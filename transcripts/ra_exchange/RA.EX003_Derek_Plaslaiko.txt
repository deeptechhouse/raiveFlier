Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. You may not be that familiar with this week's guest, but I think you should be. Derek Plaslaco is one of my favorite DJs, a guy who grew up in the Detroit area. is a resident DJ at one of the best parties in New York City, and recently someone that has made the move over to Europe. More importantly, for recognition in the techno scene at least, he's also just put out his debut record on Perk Trax, a throwback 12-inch devoted to the acidic sound he so clearly loves. I talked to Derek last month about all of this and more. Did you grow up in Detroit? Sort of. I mean, I was born in Dearborn. I grew up about 15 minutes south in a town called Woodhaven, which I love so much. Why do you love Woodhaven so much? I don't know, because no one's heard of it. It's more irony, I guess. There's really nothing there except a Ford stamping plant. So not even the Ford plant, just the Ford stamping plant. Yes, the Ford stamping plant. That's all in Woodhaven. Which now, since there's so few employees at it, there is now a Kohl's and a, not a Home Depot, a Lowe's in the parking lot. These are American convenience stores. Walmart, I guess. Kohl's is more of like a clothing thing. And Lowe's is like a Home Depot. So like a building construction type case. How far away? It was 15 minutes from Detroit? Yeah, 15 minutes south. It's in a community called Downriver, whatever one calls it. And it's the funny part about Downriver is that you can go into any of these neighborhoods and really do feel like you're in a different. neighborhood, you know, different classes for sure. I don't know, it's just, you can tell usually what you've drifted into. A lot of people, I think, you know, certainly in the dance music community, I think have this impression of like Detroit being all this one thing. It's all sort of the same. You know, you talk about being near and dear born and obviously like people like Matthew Deere. were in Ann Arbor, where Ghostly started. Can you talk, I guess, a little bit about Woodhaven, you know, like sort of where that falls within spectrum of like the area I mean were there other people around you growing up I mean there were people there but there are other artists yeah no no I mean that there were but there they're more in different probably different cities like there were a few kids in Grosse Ile that were into you know this music there are a few kids Trenton, a few kids in each city I guess but can't really think of anyone from Woodhull. Keith Kemp was from Gros Egel, Eric Hopp and also his brother Adam Hopp which were two really promising DJs from the mid 90s. Eric was closely associated with Richie. Yeah, they were in Lincoln Park. James Colbert was another one. He was from Grosse Ile. But, you know, I mean, all these, you could ride your bike to all these places, but they're not, you know, not the same high schools. You know, there was no one in my high school that I went to that was into this music. So how did you get into it? Through the radio. Like when I was like 10, the people across the street were very into other people. My friends across the street were like 40. older than me they were really into break dancing so they would listen to the wizard and you know play the tapes after after school and break dance try to you know practice break dancing in their garage and whatever and in order to gain their approval, I started listening to it a little bit closer and found out I really, really liked it. And would record the tapes myself too. Then listen to them on the school bus. Were there ever any breakdancing? Is there breakdancing in your past? Not very good breakdancing. But there was breakdancing. Anyone that knows me knows I can't really dance. I mean, I attempted, but I couldn't really do much more than spin around on my back and not with much grace. But it was hip-hop and I guess electro and all this sort of thing. Jeff was playing more electro and techno. A lot of the songs, it was funny, I wouldn't know what these songs were for six or seven years later. It was just what I remember being on The Wizard. And there was also Electrifying Mojo, it was funny. Mojo would start at 10 o'clock on what then was Power 96. Um... He would start at 10 o'clock and so would the wizard. So the wizard could go anywhere from 10 minutes to 40 minutes, 45 minutes or so. It's usually more like 10 to 20. And then I would, you know, it'd be bedtime for me. How old were you? 10. Okay. I was 10. Mom would, you know, yell, shut that off. I'd just turn it a lot lower and then listen to Mojang. It would be on until... at least two in the morning, but I probably would fall asleep around midnight. Did you start buying records? No. Not really. Not at all, actually. I didn't know what any of it was. I didn't know you could get it. I didn't know where to... To me it was like it wasn't even... Since I couldn't really associate any of these songs outside of the context of The Wizard, I didn't know exactly what I was listening to. It felt like I was listening to The Wizard. Like this is just what he's doing. I didn't know he was a DJ. I didn't know he was... playing other people's music or anything like that, you know, at the time. You know, I was a 10-year-old kid, what do I know? Of course. But yeah, after a while, I started, like, you know, just over time, things would start to pop up separate from that, from those, you know, songs I remembered for the two years I listened to it religiously. When was the first time that you saw a DJ in person? Do you remember? First time I saw one and was impressed by it? Or first time I saw it? First time. I mean, you talk about the wizard and just sort of being like, here's this person in a studio somewhere. Right, but I didn't, but see, I also didn't associate with him. he did with like, say like a wedding DJ. I was very aware of those or high school dances or middle school dances like that, but they were playing music. I knew he wasn't, you know? So it was, you know, and then I think, I think actually that's not entirely true. Cause I do remember near the end, like hearing like two live crew, like, come on, babe, you know, or not come on, babe. What was it before? Oh God. I can't remember, but it was, you know, hearing things that I didn't know, you know, or had heard. And then realizing that maybe that's how I started putting it together, that, oh, he was, you know. But I didn't really have, like, a desire to get it for myself. It was just more, you know, I'm hearing it on the radio and on my mixtapes, like, you know, I already have it. You know, what would I... need it separate for if I can listen to it off these cassettes. When did that change? When I started working at a record store, like, I went at, like, 16. Why did you, I mean, out of all jobs in the world. Why? Why was a record store when you were 16? Because that's where I was hanging out anyways. Okay. I was riding my bike to smaller record shops in my area. There was one called Slick Disc and also Here Disc. And anytime I would go downtown to Trapper's Alley, which was in Greektown, downtown Detroit. go down there like age like 14 or whatever I was always old friends with older like older kids and they had driver's licenses and stuff so we would go to Tigers games or whatever and you know, end up in Trapper's Alley for dinner or something like that and there was a Harmony House in there. So I would shop for, you know, songs, like music there. Worth them all, basically, you know. It wasn't like a really good record store or anything, but the two shops that were along West Road in Trenton and Woodhaven, those were more independent record shops that carried a little bit more outside the norm. I just, after a while of going to those shops and also record exchange, which was the store I ended up working at, I started to realize that there was more out there than, you know, what I'm reading about and Rolling Stone or hearing on the radio, especially definitely MTV. Okay. What else is there? And then just. Slowly got turned on to other things from there and like the early, you know techno the sound of Detroit You bought that when it first came out? Not when it first came out. My friend Chris Rahano had turned me on to it. Chris Rahano and Keith Kent. They had turned me on to that especially. Down, you know, just and then also waveform, Jeff Mills waveform transmissions volume one and even sheet one, even though I was like 93, but still it was like I was working at the shop. That's kind of how it all started anyways. I was like playing these CDs in the shop and a couple friends of mine that would come in and they'd be like, "Who's playing this?" They were total ravers. And this guy Mark Moss, who's still... Actually, you saw Mark play at the festival. Yeah. ADM. He and this other guy, Brian Pangborn, they were just like, "Who the fuck is playing this?" And trying to figure it out. "You should come out with us." What to like a rave? Yeah, like no. I don't dance. Was it I don't dance thing or was it were you also like because in the Midwest I think especially me growing up there's definitely a type of raver and you're like I'm not that or yeah I want to be a part of that. Was there ever that sort of? I don't think that was really it. I don't know. I never really had any kind of animosity towards Ravers or anything. Maybe a little. I can't quite remember. I guess maybe there probably was something like that. We're talking 20 years ago. I have no idea. But yeah. But yeah. I mean, they just tried to get me to go out. I eventually caved like a year and a half later. Do you remember the first one you went to? Yeah, I remember the name of it. It was a party called Bite. And it was a week before Thanksgiving or so, maybe two weeks before. And it was at a space on Paquette in Detroit, which they used again a couple years later. But it got shut down at like 3 o'clock in the morning or something like that. When I got there and saw that, you know, it was very different from what I thought it was going to be. What did you think it was going to be? Um, well... For instance, the main thing was that these parties were called raves, and I really didn't like rave music, by definition. I like techno, but I didn't like rave. So I, not thinking more about it, just assumed that that's what was primarily played at these things. And to an extent I was right, but I think that had kind of passed. I kind of missed that by the time they were trying to get me to go with it. But yeah, and then the one after that was thrown by Kevin Saunderson. It was called Journey Through the Hardcore, phase three. And we got there really, really early in the night and we're one of the last people to leave. And I met some people there that I danced with that I'm still friends with to this day. Which is pretty cool. So it's quite obvious I guess from the get-go. Yes something from then on out it was every weekend Yeah, it was it was it was absolutely every weekend. It wasn't DJing had never nothing didn't cross my mind for a long time But from then on out it was like, okay, I want to get these records, I want to get this, mixtape this, 12-inch that, I want all this stuff. Tell me a little bit more about partying in Detroit around that time though. Was there a... You said perhaps you didn't get to see it, that rave had passed and there was something different. Well... I wouldn't say rave had passed, just the fact that they were playing rave music had passed. Um, I mean, there's still a lot of, a lot of like, I mean, shit, I was wearing a flashy light and handing out pixie sticks. Like you couldn't, you couldn't like, you couldn't come within 10 feet of me and not be busy or, or, or be not busy and not have me go here, here's a pixie stick. I mean, I bring hundreds of them. Like, this is what I was known for. in the mid 90s. That was 94. So it's like this is what I did every weekend for two years at least. Could have been a far different DJ name for yourself, I suppose. Yeah. If you hadn't gotten tarred with that brush. Plus Laco's pretty funny though. Plus Laco seems like an unlikely last name. Yeah, it's made up. Oh. Why did you choose the name Plasleiko? Well, it's stolen, really, back in 94, 95. no one had cell phones then. And you may have a pager or something, maybe. But everyone hung out basically, my friends all hung out at like five different spots. So you'd stop by Record Exchange. No, no one's there? Okay. Stop by Denny's. Oh, no one's there? Oh, you stopped by Tony's house. No, Tony's, no one's there? Okay. So you're driving around in circles. you know, basically trying to find each other. Then by 2, 3 a.m., you'd find each other. Now, there was also the truck stop. And the truck stop had video games and, you know, the Detroit truck stop at exit 32 on I-75. They had video games and stuff, and that'd be another hangout for us. And so we would go there, but then there's also other people that hang out at the truck stop, not just our people. And one night, My friend Christopher Hano, he came in and this guy Joe was playing video games or whatever. He's like, hey man, you seen anybody tonight? And he's like, yeah, that Derek Poslaco kid was just here looking for you. Now, there really is a Derek Poslaco. I didn't know this because I didn't go to his high school. But he, you know, Poslaco put child. to push off the scheme. So, you know, it's kind of, it got turned around in Joe's head. Chris just thought it was really funny because I guess like, you know, this guy's not part of the circle or whatever, but you know, he just found it amusing. And so yeah, it came time to play my first party that I got asked to play. I was just like, oh, what should I put on the flyer? And my friend Chris was blunted in the backseat and he's just like, you should put Derek Blazleko on the flyer. And I was like, all right, that sounds good. But I mean at the same time, you know, it was kind of funny, well not funny, but like a friend of a motor driver. And through so much transformation, you know, period, like finding myself again and like dropped out of high school again. And, you know, it just felt like a completely different person. Like I knew what I wanted to do, you know. sure of it you know absolutely so I felt it felt like it made sense because I felt like a different person anyways so plus like oh was born but I didn't know so not going to the high school I didn't realize that his last name was poslaco so now when I finally 2,000 or something Google Plez Leko. You search for Plez Leko and you're not going to find anything related to me. So it's almost like an Autechre song. It's like Autechre in general. It's like Google search Autechre. You're going to find nothing but Robert Schoenberg. But then there's also another side of it too where this apparently legend had it that right around the same time that Dave had died, this guy disappeared. And no one knew where he went. Like no one knew, you know, just one day there was a for sale sign in front of his parents' house or whatever. And like, he was just gone. Come to find out, like, you know, he, he, he, like, he's actually at the church. that my mom goes to, that my sister got married at. I think his wedding was at that church or something. That's the first time I ever saw how his name was spelled. So you've been checking up on him throughout the years? No, I haven't really. In fact, I'm waiting for the day that I'm at some club in Detroit or whatever and he's just like, dude. Because, like, well, there's been friends of his. I mean, he knows. He's aware of it. He doesn't care from what they say. But, like, there has been maybe five people over time that have been like, you do know there is, like, a Derek Poslaco from Down River or whatever. I'm like, yeah, I know. And, like, that's what I tell them. It wasn't intentional. It was more like a joke. Plus, I never thought I was going in this scene and everything but it was you know had i known it would have saved me a lot of headaches and miss booked plane tickets and stuff you know you're like don draper from madman you stole someone's identity thanks for spoiling it for me i haven't really started watching it yet That's good to know. Oh, it happens in the first season. Come on. Oh, I got three episodes into the first season and stopped. Spoiler alert. But as far as the parties, they were mostly in abandoned warehouses around Detroit? Yeah, for sure. There were only a handful of spaces that really got used all the time. There would be other spots too. I couldn't tell you the addresses and stuff. Were there a number of places that got used over and over? Yes, definitely. Packard especially. At one point everyone called it Club Packard because it was almost every weekend. And were police coming to shut it down every weekend? Well, there was, there was in the, like early 2005, there was a really big bus. I always get it confused as to whether or not it was 1515 Broadway or 1315 Broadway. But I was out of town that weekend because I was in, I went to Milwaukee to go see Houghton do his live show, the last damn live show that also got broke up. That was a crazy light. Bye. You talk about Milwaukee and obviously that was sort of key hub in a way for some techno parties, drop bass network. Is it based out of? Yeah. Where are you going around in the Midwest? I mean to Milwaukee and other places, Minnesota for example. Not Minnesota, Chicago a lot, Indiana a lot, Ohio a lot. More just the direct surrounding areas and then up to Milwaukee or Madison. Madison actually didn't happen until like 2000 for me. But yeah, I would drive if there was something interesting happening. And it looked cool. I would go up and drop my hat. It was like not even really a planning or a thought. Like if it were 6 o'clock that night, we were... were bored and didn't really feel like staying in Detroit. Yeah, screw it. We'll go. Show up at midnight or less. Have a good time. Was there something going on almost every weekend, it seemed like, somewhere in the Midwest? Oh, yeah. That was worth... Oh, Detroit, too. Oh, that we're going to? Yeah. Yeah, I would say so. Well, it depends on what you mean by worth it, you know? But, yeah, I would say that at least every other week, if we wanted to, we could go out of town, but we also had so many good things happening in Detroit every weekend, too when most promoters respected each other and you know definitely towards the end of the 90s that wasn't the case but you know they would you know oh this is my week oh okay we'll plan another one you know when did the club motor um in detroit come about i want to say 98 maybe 97 roughly around then was that a oh no It would have had to have been 97, maybe even 96. Okay. Was that a big deal? It's really funny that you're asking about that. I was looking through old Metro Times stuff online, and I found the article that Robert Corral had written on the end of Motor. Have you seen this? Yeah. And just like all these things that he was mentioning and talking about. I mean, he really did. I was I actually wanted to send him an email and say, wow, you really did a good job, you know, of putting it all in perspective and how it all went down and everything. Because I really don't. I recall a lot when I read it like, oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot about that. Oh, my God. I forgot about that. You know. But once when you read this article, I mean it became clear to you that it was a huge thing where a lot of different things happen. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I don't remember what my opinion of overall was at the beginning. Certainly one of the things when I talk to people for the oral history of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival. all of its iterations when i talked to them about motor they said that one of the things was after a while it sort of became okay we're going to motor this week you know right like time after time it became one of the only real like club clubs that was bringing an international oh it didn't become i mean it was it was the only one that was really doing that I mean, there would be things at St. Andrews for three floors of fun every once in a while, or maybe even industry every once in a great while, but nothing like how Motor was. I mean, Motor was open Tuesday, Friday, Saturday, and some, I want to say some Thursdays too. And you could go there and hear techno in-house. any of those nights. That wasn't the case with any of the other places that were going on. There wasn't even any little spots that were doing that at the beginning when Motor was doing it. They really were the ones that basically took everything out of the rave scene and went into Motor. Actually, that's another thing that I just remembered. That's another thing that was said in that article. it was like booking agents were calling up Motor like freaking out like book my guy here book my guy here like you know I don't want just to get him out of playing raves you know because it's so unpredictable if the cops came or whatever shady rave promoters you knew your artist was going to get paid totally no problem yeah yeah you book him yeah for sure So when did you start DJing? When I started DJing at Motor or DJing? Just DJing in general. It was, I mean, I bought turntables soon after. I mean, I'd already been buying some records here and there, but I bought turntables, like the guy I mentioned earlier, James Coburn, I was going to go out and buy one belt drive turntable from Best Buy. $99 and then he sold me two turntables two of the same turntables and a mixer for 100 bucks so I was like okay and then I just decided to teach myself I guess that were you mostly teaching yourself completely yeah completely teach myself how long were you sort of in private, trying to mix two records together before you... Well, it wasn't really private. A lot of it had to do with hanging out with my friend Aaron, my friend Brian Mitchell, my friend Keith Kemp, and Gwen and Jacqueline, and just the random cast of characters that could be around in that circle. and you know we would end up in their living room or their basement or whatever like bringing the turntables over in mixer and just playing the records you know going to record time that day going shopping and then coming back and playing them because you know Everyone still lived with their parents and like, you know parents were gone So let's set them up at their house or whatever and they'd be there all week or whatever it was just like not in order to make people dance because we We did not know jack shit about what we were doing But I guess that's kind of how I guess that's probably more where I was doing it. When did you first make people dance? Oh, God. I don't know. Do that. I've seen one or two people dance. I mean, I was asked to play a party called Nightcap. I mean, I randomly ended up playing at like some poor boy parties and some of my friends, my friends Johnny Sacco and Alan Bogle, they would throw some parties every once in a while and like... There would always be a second room. Like, they'd have their lineup, you know, for their main room. And that's what they would promote. And then they would have a second room, really small, really shitty sound system. And they would just, that's where they would play or some other friends would play. And they would just ask people, like, that week. You know, okay, come on, don't break some records down. You know, sometimes they'd ask me and, you know, I would be possibly the last person that would possibly get to play if the party was still going or whatever. Well, the first time I ever got asked to play, like really asked to play, was I think it was '96 or '97. It was a pajama party, this huge party that this guy TC, kind of a legend in Detroit, like he had thrown. And it was two rooms already. He came and talked to me and was like, Yo, I just got a call from Matt Mike and he says a buddy of his is coming to town and wanted to know if I can put him on my lineup this weekend, but you know, I told him yeah, no problem and he was like well, he's kind of one of those guys that needs like Oh his own room like he just needs to you know, just if you could get like a small sound system and let him play like all night in that room, that would be cool. You know, what Mike Banks says, you know, TC or anyone else in their right mind does. When someone needs a room. Right, exactly. They get a room. Exactly. So I'm thinking to myself, who the hell is Mike Banks trying to get like to play for? Eight hours or whatever, you know, and I was just like like who's the guy? He's like, yeah, it was very for first of all He's like and I need someone to open up for him, you know Just to get the room started and you're my guy you got to do and I'm like Who who is it? Who is it? He's like, oh this guy he's from Paris. I don't know Larry Larry Gardner And I'm like, Laurent Garnier? I'm like, you basically want me to open up for my first Ask the DJ gig. You want me to open up for basically the guy who made me want to DJ. X-Mix 2 was absolutely without a doubt what I heard when I decided that I wanted to DJ. And I was like, what? Are you kidding me? Like, yeah, I'll do it, you know? I had my two hours, 10 to 12, and Laurent train spotted me like twice. Twice? Yeah. I couldn't tell you how good of a job I did. I know I got yelled at really hard for running the mixer into the red, but I learned my lesson well because Mike Fotis is a good person. He's the sound guy from Detroit who is still around, who does a lot of the work. the sound of the festival, if not all of it. You know, very knows his shit, big time. But he's not very... nice about things when they'll let you know how he feels he'll definitely let you know and uh he came up and screamed at me and he's like you hear that you hear that you hear all that how that hurts yeah watch this oh oh look at that it's not in the red anymore you can hear exactly what the fuck's going on out there now you know okay don't let me see you do that shit again walk away okay and then i learned my lesson so if you have to pinpoint one or two people from Detroit sort of that you know DJ wise kind of you out in those formative stages or even past the formative stages who would those guys be I would have to say definitely definitely definitely definitely Claude Young He was basically the one that taught me that I should, like in '94 when I was still working at the record store, I was buying everything that I could that was available on CD, even if it was . It was just kind of like, no, you should buy it on vinyl instead of CD, even things like Global Communication. and stuff that I was into. He was just like, "No, because you're gonna regret it one day when the vinyl's not available." It's like, "What if you do wanna do this? What if you do wanna play them out?" There was no CDJs then or anything, so he was more like pushing me, like, "No, spend the money, extra money, and get the vinyl rather than the CD." So that, I think, is a pretty, it kinda got me in a different mindset, And then he was also very encouraging when he noticed my taste and stuff. He was just kind of like, you should do something with this. Were there a couple of records that finally he sort of was like, this guy's all right? You have to ask him, you know. I mean, we talk music a lot, but I mean, I remember the thing, the record in question was Made in Voyage by Global Communication, which on the album it's called something else, but the CD singles, there was like two remixes on each, like a spiritualized remix and stuff. And I was buying that, and he was like, you know, you should buy that on the album. And I was like, okay. And then I went out. bought on vinyl. I wonder if that also in a way helped you become a slightly more diverse DJ because you're buying things that you would almost think in the back of your mind to buy on CD and never buy on vinyl like a spiritualized remix is something most DJs it's not like dance floor functional no of course not um but i mean that you know that i was really into spiritualized then you know still am yeah you know so it was like it was kind of like a more completionist thing too plus i loved you know the original a lot are you a completist uh used to be I used to be. Now, to be honest, now there's not, well, I've also amassed so much vinyl that there's no way I could possibly like keep doing it, you know, keep on owning all of it. That's kind of a, you know, like living in New York definitely like made me less of a completist. I mean, there's still certain things I'm sure. you know I want every Perlon record no matter what just because just because I stopped being a completionist or completist doesn't mean that I can't keep buying Perlon records you know there's certain things that you remain a completist for sure about for sure are there any other DJs I mean you said you were working at the records I know like Mike Huckabee was working on it. Yeah, definitely Mike Huckabee. He was a huge, huge influence on me. Like still to this day, I consider, I've said it, I say it to everybody, I may have even said it to you, but like I never heard him play a bad record. There was only one record that he played one time where I was just like, eh. And I can tell you exactly who it was. It was Moose T's horny. So it was sort of the exact opposite. You probably ran up to the DJ booth to find out finally the one record that he's playing that you didn't like. No, I knew what it was when I was working at the store at the time. And this was before they had the vocal mix. Do you know the song? No. It was a huge, massive hit. It originally was on a picture disc. And, you know, picture discs always, you know, grab attention. So we would listen to it. The flip side, Bad Boy was fun. That was really cool. But Horny, I was just like, what are you doing? He's like, it sounds like Vegas. And he would make this motion where he's rolling the dice. Every time he played it, the horns would blow up. And he was just like. Roll the dice out. But like that was probably the only thing that I was ever like questionable and I think after hearing it so many times I think I even I think he even turned me around. Aside from obviously watching him not play bad records, conversations, just spending time with him. For sure. For sure. Is there anything you can point to that you know in your DJ arsenal that comes from Huckabee? Steve Rockman. For sure. Definitely Steve Rockman. Thank you. ♪ ♪ Huck also really like I mean I can't say I wasn't into these records anyways because in Detroit they were kind of hits anyways but he kind of taught me to listen to Basic Channel a little closer like I bought them because I like the groove and I or whatever, you know, but he was kind of like, you know, there's more going on than just, you know, this loop, you know. And, yeah, I mean... I'm eternally grateful. I remember like at one time he had a camera. I can't remember what it was. I think I think it was he had a record release party for a record that didn't come out for a long time after that. His first deep transportation record, if I'm not mistaken, could be wrong. But I want to say there was like a card or like a big sheet of paper or something like that, like an art easel kind of thing or whatever. was kind of like to write comments on or whatever and I remember exactly what I wrote I couldn't remember what it was on but I remember what I wrote I was like I was like Mike Huckabee thank you so much you know for everything well I'm not exactly I guess I can't remember but I said something along the lines of like thank you for everything over the years without you I'd surely be playing some bullshit things What I like about your DJing is you know how to open up for people. I mean, you did a lot of that in Bunker. Were you a resident? Still are a resident, I suppose. Yep. In New York. I mean, was that a lot of what you did in Detroit? Yeah. When you were DJing? Oh, yeah. Yeah, for sure. Like the guys at Motor and when they were booking the Necto and stuff like that. I'd get asked to open up for a lot of really good gigs. They knew. There was a small handful of us that kind of they went around with, you know. We're gonna just fit it was just a matter of like okay Let's figure out over the next two months where we can fit these particular guys in you know these guys are coming to town who would fit with them you know and Who could we take a chance on? Outside of that you know so they wouldn't just stay within the five six guys that they would always have opening whatever they would definitely try to find Other kids so it doesn't look like it was just us and they're playing favorites and stuff but the big ones they would definitely pick from a small pool you know like ones that they were flying from overseas or whatever it wasn't for our benefit it was more for their benefit so they knew that they were going to have like you know not in terms of the people that were there but in terms of like the right room the right reception for you know luke slater or marco corolla whoever. What's the secret to opening up for Marco Carolla? For example. Well, back then it was really easy. I mean, he was playing like Marco Carolla was from 98 to 2000, which is like banging, banging, banging. So just don't do that. You know, keep it slower, keep it a little, you know, a little warmer, not quite so in your face. Basically, I don't know. What's the secret to opening up for Luke Slater then? Same. He was the same then. He was always playing really fast. Were you always up in the... for more harder yeah yeah definitely lean towards that everyone knew that was my my love I mean even though I had a I was playing house every Tuesday you know at motor you know for family do you know about this party we ever talked about this no and I want to ask you because I mean you said you were listening when you were listing the dates Of Motor, you said, you know, Tuesday, Friday and Saturday. Tuesday seems like a, hmm, what was going on on Tuesdays at Motor? Tuesday was an uncalled family, promoted by a guy named Adriel, who's still around to this day. He had given me my first gig at a party called Family. That's what I was getting to after TC's party, the next time I was asked to play. But the first time I was ever on a flyer was Family. But that was like in 96 or 97. I can't quite remember. And then he started a night at Motor. Tuesday nights called Family that was more of a gay night, a gay house night, but not like, you know, high energy, but more like how Ken Collier would play it, like, you know, back at Heaven and stuff like that. I wasn't on originally. There was a guy named Jeremy Christian and then Echo, who Jason Kendrick, he stayed on. me and then for some reason Jeremy was leaving and this was like I remember going to the night like around like everywhere or something of I want to say 98 and Jeremy was leaving and Adriel had just asked me he was like yeah you did get a new resident I'm like well who are you thinking of he's like I don't know you and I was like Alright, I mean I was certainly buying house records and stuff like that. It's certainly hard to like, you know, question his... his motives at the time, but you couldn't have been known as like the house guy. No, I definitely, I absolutely was not, which is, which is kind of what appealed to me for, you know, because then I would have, I'd be forced to spend more money on house records, you know, and which I was buying every fucking techno record that came through, you know And plus I was working at the record time already too so it was just like okay now I can now I can delve off like dive in and spend more money on house, you know I mean, but we were also playing techno - I mean we were playing Perlon records and and Playhouse records and stuff like that. I remember getting Perlot No. 1 and running up to the shop or running up there and be like, what's all this? Oh wait, no, it wasn't Perlot No. 1. It was like 2,000 abdominals, whatever number that was. Like, want to say No. 9? Something like that. But we were stopped in the record time anyways, or like from record one. Was Perlone in Playhouse kind of a big deal? In Detroit? Amongst certain circles, yeah. Definitely. It was, I mean, like I said, when we got the first one in, I showed it to everybody. And thinking how weird it was. Now you listen to it, it doesn't sound weird at all. You know, I mean that changed even up to what number three or four, you know, it doesn't like the difference It sounds like normal house compared to like where they went with it, you know But I remember at the time like well, this is something really fucking fresh and different Sure so you were playing Quite a bit in Detroit. And when did you... Sometimes when you have your name, there's something in parentheses after it. It's Spectral Sound or Ghostly. How did you hook up with those guys and that crew? They kind of came to me. It was just more or less like they were coming... to family, you know, and they were... They were specifically coming to the house night as opposed to techno nights or was it... Well, I didn't really get to touch on the party. I mean, the party was huge. I mean, it was a big deal. It turned out to be a really, really big deal after a couple of years. I mean, we would get like... Adrian would know the numbers better than me, but I'm pretty sure we would get like 300 and 400 people on a Tuesday night, which in Detroit, that's a lot of fucking people. There were people that were going out on Tuesdays that weren't going out on the weekends anymore. That was their night out. I mean, it was a big night. And definitely like a testing ground for the sound that Spectral first represented and the Ghost League first represented. So that's what I mean when I say like when we would play techno. I mean, I wasn't playing like, you know, banging, banging, you know, 132, like light it up shit, but more like techno edged things, you know. They would come and they would be like, "Here, we want to bring you this white label. Would you like playing it or whatever?" And you'd track through it and be like, "Yeah, I'll run that, sure." You had to track through it first, though. You're not putting it in. No, no, no, no, no. They knew. They knew. Most people, I would always say the same thing. I'd be like, all right. If I had any doubt that, you know, if I had any doubt about the label that it might not be something that I would want to play right then and there, then I'd be like, oh, man, thanks a lot. Boom, to the back of the crate. I'll check it out when I get home, man. Thank you. You know, but it puts those guys to be like, all right, this could be When did you move to New York? I moved to New York in July of 2004. I was dating a girl at the time and she moved about six months before me and we kind of had called it quits at the time or whatever and we were talking and I went out and visited her once and she came home once too. around like May or something like that. I was like, okay, you win, I'll move. Or maybe, actually it was June. It happened really fast. I mean, you weren't like thinking about your career as a DJ. No, not, in fact, if I was thinking of anything, it was just like, fuck, it's over. I moved to New York with one Crater Records and that was that. I moved there just in case while Tronic Treatment was still going on. Just in case I might end up DJing at a house party or something like that, I'll bring my records. Did you know? I mean, you said you knew Tronic Treatment was going on. Did you know much about the New York scene before you got there? Not a ton. I knew those guys, that was about it. I had met Function before. I had met Adam X before and stuff like that. Frankie Bones and... Yeah, I certainly met people from New York, but I didn't know much about the actual scene. So you got there and you were ready to play Storm Raves? Oh yeah. I thought those days were done anyways. I didn't know that. I didn't have any clue where it was. I just mainly, you know, I didn't really expect to. get there and start like flinging a mixed CD around like, Hey, this is me. You know, it just kind of felt like there was a new chapter beginning and didn't know what I was going to do, but I was going to, I knew I wanted to work on music, which I didn't do much of at all. But you started pretty soon playing out. Yeah, I had a few big mouth friends who were constantly telling people, you should book this guy, you should book this guy. And eventually people started booking this guy. How did you end up meeting Brian Kazanuk, who's the sort of... I guess he wasn't the founder, but he's the guy who's in charge now, of course, of the bunker. Right. From going to the bunker? Mm-hmm. Why was that a party that you were going to? Felt like home. It didn't feel like home the first time, though. Or, I mean, you didn't know it was going to feel like home when you went there the first time. No, I mean, it felt like Detroit. Oh, okay. Yeah, I mean, it felt like Detroit in the 90s, just a very dark party, you know, in a basement. This was when it was at... Subtonic. Subtonic, yeah. Which was... Tonic was a sort of like experimental jazz venue and they had this very small basement underneath. Yeah. So the first time you went there, it felt like Detroit. Yeah, I mean it just, it was a dark party in a basement and they were playing music that I really enjoyed and I started going back. It was a weekly then, every Friday. It was a weekly. Were the lineups quite varied as far as what sort of music they were bringing in? Or was it pretty consistent? No, no, no. They were very varied. It was a free party at the time, so Brian never really could book people. He would just kind of get whoever was coming through that was visiting New York. that might want to play something like that. I think Tejada played a couple times. Would he even be grabbing people who were playing bigger clubs the next night or something like that? He might not have any money to pay them. It was just whoever basically wanted to come down and do it. And then things kind of started popping up here and there. I don't know if it was word got out that there was a cool place to play. You know, just like people would go back and be like, yeah, go do this or whatever. started to see if maybe if we charge five could he start sustaining bringing people in and stuff you know and one of the things that was so striking to me about that party when I got to New York personally was the fact that it was five dollars it was only five dollars right when did you get to New York? 2006 maybe? 2005? It was kind of a situation when they started charging. Yeah. There was a lot of hemming and hawing. Yeah, there was, but I mean, and then it just did come down to, you know, it's five bucks, come on. Yeah. You know, do you want to see these people play? Like, chip in, you know. When did you become a resident? Summer 06. Yeah, somewhere around six. Why? There was a couple people leaving. At the time, it was just three residents. It was Brian, Unjust, and... Oh, what was Carl's DJ name? I forget now, but yeah, he was moving to Oakland or Berkeley, one of the two. And Ivy was, yeah, she was busy with school. Ivy Unjust. Unjust, yeah, sorry. Yeah, she was busy with school, and Brian just kind of wanted to take the party in a different direction. which he didn't really make very clear to me when he first signed me on. And I actually had a conversation with him a couple months later. I was just like, I noticed that the experimental nights are not happening anymore. You know, and he was just like, yeah. I'm like, well, I'm worried that, you know. People are gonna think that I came in and like Turned this into like a you know a rager party or something like that and because it just seems to be a thought you put He's like yeah, that's what I want and I was like okay So I was like nervous that people were gonna get back. You know give backlash on that cuz you're gonna I'm like you're you know We had a really cool interesting crowd going on you know people that did like to dance and people that didn't like to dance Mm-hmm, We only want the people, well not that we didn't want the other people there, but it just wasn't really appealing to them. And I think it would be doing Brian an injustice to say that the party hasn't retained an experimental edge. No. Well, but not to the extent it was. Of course. There would be nights that there was no dancing. Or, you know, there would be dancing, but it wasn't the intent. You know, it was more of a listening night. So, yeah, I just kind of noticed that that was changing. I was just like, you sure about this? You're going to start alienating a lot of your core crowd and everything. I think his attitude was probably like, well, we'll gain a new one in the process. And he was right. So I guess I was worried about nothing. And those people still pop up on the anniversary and stuff like that. I think over time, a lot of them have kind of come around to... to what we are programming there and everything. It seems like the move to a monthly party was important in terms of defining what the bunker is about. Now that, now we have like, they have a Berghain residency, you know, sharing and there's two rooms. Of course now, which is different, it's held in a different space than it was when it was in sub-tonic. It's a book assembly. It seems like one room is house. or something else, the other room is tight now. Yeah. Yeah, it was the anniversary. Yeah, totally, you're right. It was John Roberts and I remember talking to Brian at Setup. We didn't know how the second room was going to fare. We didn't know if there were going to be people that would go in there. In dance. Yeah. Would there be enough people to cover this? To open up, basically doubling our space. Is this going to work out? we wanted to make sure that John had a good crowd to play for, you know, in front of him. So we were like, so should we put in, you know, in the back? And I was like, and we both kind of discussed it. And it was just kind of like, I think it's brighter and lighter in there and it's darker and harder in here. You know, I think that's... kind of how it should be programmed. You know, John's going to sound better in there. The only debate we're going to have is, is there going to be enough people to cover it? And it worked out perfectly. So thus began how we tried to program, you know, the rooms. Or Brian programmed the rooms. When did you start making music? When did I start making music? First thing I ever did... in the attempts of making music was in summer of '99, and I say summer because it took me all summer. I was booked to play this outdoor festival called Interstellar Dream Fest. And it was kind of like a showcase, you know, a camp out festival thing. And it was like a showcase of all the scenes in the Midwest and who the promoters kind of believed in. And I knew that I was going to get a pretty great slot. You know, like a nice one sun setting kind of thing. And this guy, I think Dante was playing before me. He was kind of a favorite. So it was kind of like, yeah, you're going to have people in front of you. And I was like, okay. And I really, really wanted to do a remix, which would now completely only be described as an edit, of Sympathy for the Devil by the Stones. And it's a tribute to my dad. Because my dad wanted that played at his funeral. And I stole that from him. Now I want it played at my funeral too. And you is the next game. I watched the glee while your kings and queens fought for ten decades for the god's sake. I shouted out, who killed the bees? When after all, it was you and me. Let me please introduce my... I wanted to play that as an opener, but I was like, okay, well, it's got to be mixable. So I worked all summer using acid. program and sound forge like cutting it and trying to place it together so that it was sinkable so I could mix out of it cleanly for a while and not just you know cut over or something like that and yeah I did it and now I can do it in Ableton I could do it really good in a day and I could do it in a minute and a half with Ableton. You know, like do it with what I did, what I did then. And anybody could, I'm not saying... - You've been making edits for the past 10 years. - Nothing. - When did you first start doing original productions? - I've dabbled for the past 10 years, I would say. but nothing that I was really, really serious of or sure of and really enjoyed. So why was, you know, in the past 12 months, I feel like you've been really focusing on it. You've been trying to get your stuff together. I just felt like I was ready to do it. I had a couple of decent experiences of making some things that I felt were finished. got turned down by a net label. You know, and Kate Sento really was pushing me and my now ex-girlfriend was really pushing me, you know, that I should really be doing this. You know, this is, you talk about it, you want to do it. Get over the fear of people like... it or not liking it and just do it. You know, you're only gonna make something that's good enough after you've made things that are not good enough. Of course. You know, but I didn't want that. I wanted to be making exact, I didn't know how to translate what was going on in my head into programs and... how to do it. I could hear the sounds but I couldn't make the sounds and I didn't, I sure as shit didn't know how to do it. The first track that I heard from you and it's a track you played I think at the party that I went to last week is very acidic. What, at Bar 25? Yeah. That's the Glass Bead game. I made that a year ago. Is Acid a huge touchstone for you? That sound. Because certainly in Bar 25, you know, you were playing a lot of Acid. Funny, a lot of people commented on that. I get the feeling that a lot of people don't play Acid anymore. Yeah, it definitely is. It sounds kitschy to say, it sounds like it's some kind of catchphrase or something, but I've said it for years that I just think it's the purest form of dance music there is. Like I've always loved it. It's always felt right to me. It's never like well Overall, that's never felt cheesy to me. It's not it's nothing that doesn't sound dated Do you think that's perception people think it's cheesy? Well No, I mean, I I think it's I think it's more To them, it sounds old. Yeah. Old school. To me, it still sounds fresh. You know, granted these songs, a lot of the songs that I would play in that, in that type of thing are old, but they don't, I'm not bored with them. They don't sound old to me. They don't. Yeah. They just feel, they feel right. They feel like they're, I feel like part of them or something. They're part of me. They're definitely part of me. You what always it was always my favorite moments of any Detroit party whenever there would be an acid record played do you remember the first one you heard no I don't I do not and well I mean I can name a bunch that I had heard before I knew what acid was but as far as like in terms of one I mean we used to a girl I mentioned earlier like Jacqueline and Erin, we used to joke around where she used to say to us afterwards leaving a party like, oh, it was really cool. I got to hear the cork sound. And we were like, yeah, we couldn't figure out what the fuck she was talking about for like weeks and weeks and weeks. And like, we're like, okay, well, if you get to hear it again, let us know, you know, whatever. And, you know, she'd come running up and it was a hardware party That's the cork sound! That's the cork sound!" I was like, "Oh, okay." And then we later, you know, we'll piece it together that, "Oh, that's acid. That's acid house." Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you
