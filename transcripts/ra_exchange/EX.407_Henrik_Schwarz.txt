*music* Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resonant Advisor. This week's exchange is with Henrik Schwarz. The German producer's roots are in house, but it didn't take him long to look beyond the sound for inspiration. Soon after a life-changing experience at a classical music concert, he started incorporating orchestral elements into his beats, becoming one of the key artists bridging those two worlds. But he's also made some of the biggest house tracks of the last decade for key labels like Innervisions, Running Back and Mule Music. Ahead of the release of his latest album, Scripted Orchestra, we invited Schwarz to RA's Berlin office for a chat about his career so far. In conversation with Matt Unicombe, He looks back at his formative years as a resident DJ in southern Germany and his ongoing fascination with the classical sound. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Henrik Schwarz is up next. *music* So what's the usual Thursday for you then? Because I can imagine you're pretty busy. I'm pretty busy, but I spend more and more time working on the right balance. I am busy, yes, but I'm also trying to create free space. That is, within the last two years, I'm working more and more on that because I think when you have space... then there's room to create something and so I take a lot of care about that and in a way yeah the Thursday might be a day where I'm open to do new things and yeah like today. So did something happen two years ago like was that the busiest point in your life that made you think like? oh, I need to get a better balance? Yes. I mean, this orchestra stuff I was working on was pretty intense. I had to learn a lot that I didn't know. And at some point I found out, yeah, but when you're traveling so much, this is not going to work out because it's getting too much. And then it takes too long to recover from the weekend. And so I need to stay home. If I really want to do this. I need to take care and make room because otherwise I'm going to go crazy. I guess the thing for you is that you can have a real life in music after DJing. you know so like uh yeah it's especially important for you to stay balanced maybe you're doing a lot of stuff next to electronic music you can do that till you're 80 years old uh you know i hope so yeah yeah let's let's see yeah let's see where it's going but i definitely realized that the dj stuff and the touring they take over everything easily and and then there's nothing left So at some point I really decided it has been a conscious decision to say, OK, I'm going to do less gigs to have room. to create and because I realised that's something I want to do. It's very important for me otherwise I just don't find the time to do new things and then it gets boring. How much were you playing at your busiest? I mean I think I never took it to the levels that other people do. It's hard to say because there has always, since a few years, there has always been the live stuff and the electronic stuff and then also like experimental things I was doing with bogey or something. But I actually never counted how much it was. Yeah, I guess because for you it's a full week. You have clubs on the weekend and then ballets during the week. Sometimes, yeah. That's true. I was thinking about your situation and you don't DJ and in a way that frees up a lot of your time for your own music. Like you're lucky that you don't need to be looking for new music to play out. I mean, I don't have to listen to promos, yes, but still. I'm listening to many, many things that I discover and that I'm interested in. I mean, yeah. So for example, for the last five years, I just started a new project, but I had to listen to 700 string quartets for the last five years. So five years ago, I decided I want to go through that. And then I collected stuff I wanted to listen to and I asked people, so what should I listen to? And that was actually work in a way, like listening to promos. You listen, you listen, you listen, and trying to find that one thing. So how is it when you're listening to classical music? Because for me, for example, I don't know so much about it. I've been to orchestras, and it got me thinking, like, if you're a classical music head, do you skip through tracks to find what you like? I actually can skip because... there might be just those four bars I was looking for. And as this music changes so much all the time, if I skip, I might miss it. I mean, when I started all that, I had no clue about classical music too. And I just thought, yeah, I went to concerts and there were a few things that I really liked. So I thought, OK, so where, how can I find out more about that? And so you listen to many, many things. And it's the same with when you listen to electronic music, there might be 90 percent that you don't like. And you're like, this is so much work to go through all this. But then you find that. one thing that just changes your life again. And so it's worth the struggle. I think it's the same in classical music as in any other music. So what was it that drew you to classical music? Like, what does classical music have for you that electronic music doesn't? I wouldn't say there's anything in there that electronic music doesn't have, but I just... I went to a few concerts out of interest. So there was one that especially got me and that was the cello concerto of Witold Lutoslawski. I had no clue who this guy was and I just ended up being there in the concert hall. And usually in those classical concerts, in those evenings, they play a hit. for everyone and then they play something that everyone knows and then in the middle of the two they play something freaked out and the cello concerto it starts with just a cello playing one note for two minutes and I was freaking out because I have never heard anything like that and then there's this crazy line it sounds like an acid baseline. And then again, you have that pulse that goes on. I was shocked. And so through that, I've... I went home and I investigated what was going on and then I read about this guy who was doing random stuff into the sheet music and also worked with math to write his stuff and that was so inspiring to do what I was doing that I thought, so there must be more. And that's how it started. And then I listened to... Yeah, Ligeti atmospheres, that's also something where I went to the concert hall and then you have this kind of 3D visual sculpture above the orchestra that seems to be there just from the sound. So this is something I didn't know from electronic music. It was super impressive. And there's so much you can take from the inspiration you get. It's amazing, isn't it? Like I say that I had like a similar like experience where I just thought it was so powerful. I went to see this Christian Yardavy guy, Estonian slash American composer. I could really see the similarities with dance music. There are these moments where you think it can't get any better. And then they add something really beautiful. Like, for example, this part is like some really euphoric string section. You think like, wow, this is incredible. And then some voices come in. And I was scared to look around because like it was so touching. Yeah. Like I can, yeah. Yeah. It's really amazing. You look in someone's eyes and then you start crying. Yeah. Because it's just, yeah. It's crazy to think that this has been going on for hundreds of years. It really I've been in a few concert halls now during the last couple of years. I was working with these people and I'm also thinking about, so where are the similarities? And at some point I also thought, well, they are music freaks like we are. And it's really about exactly what you just said. You go there to freak out. But somehow the classical music world has lost the connection to people like us. Yeah, because you have no clue what you want to listen to. And then you go to a concert and you don't like it. You go to another one, you don't like it. And then you stay home. The door needs to be opened in another way. Well, that's what you're helping with. I'm not sure because, well, everyone calls this classical music in a way, but I'm in no way connected to classical music. So I'm just using an orchestra. I think that's very different from this whole, yeah, this whole world. Like they are, it's something else. And I'm coming from a totally different background also. So this is, yeah, there's so much overlapping. And especially when it comes to the discussions or how do these worlds work. together this doesn't work but for me it's yeah the classical music is difficult also for me yeah after this experience I had I was thinking like what are the actual similarities and I guess the big thing is that first of all you need patience like to listen to a classical piece 20 minutes or longer yeah similar with the techno track a lot of it is without lyrics I guess maybe that's where the similarities stop For me, it's something else. For me, it's about being a music enthusiast. As you said, you went to a concert hall. If you hear the right classical piece, you're going to freak out in the same way when you hear a techno piece. And so it's about being a music lover. And I would also say that if you take a classical music listener... and give him the right techno track, it will be the same thing. Because it's about sound in the end and how it touches you and also the fact that you need to be an open person that wants to be affected by music. and wants to be changed maybe by music. And that's the experience I had with many of these musicians and classical audience. They come to be inspired. And I think that's where I see a similarity. Being a music fan. They're seeking these powerful experiences. Yeah. They're just not listening on the radio to some pop song. It's like they want to be deeply moved. Yeah. You put yourself in a music situation to experience something. So is there a techno track you could show a classical music fan? Is there one that comes to mind? If you've met the biggest classical musical nerd and you said, what track could you show someone? I think it's very dependent on taste. I mean, I would need to know, so what is the classical music you like? And what is it? Then I could think from a DJ perspective, what is the techno? I would play them. I don't know yet. I haven't thought about it. I mean, there's many people who, yeah, they love classical music that I don't like. It's difficult for me to play them some techno, but there might be some classical stuff that they like in me too. So there might be a chance. to find something that they find interesting too. You mentioned that you had to learn a lot about classical music. About music in general, yeah. Because you were never really trained in music before. No. That's pretty impressive. The fact that, yeah, you've become one of the most musical producers around without that formal training. Yeah, I mean, I think that many of us started from that perspective. I think for me it was the same. I had a huge love for music, but for some strange reason, I just never learned an instrument, which is weird. And I see that from now. I wonder how could it happen. And I think many people in the electronic world, they are people who love music and then you start collecting records and then you might start becoming a DJ. And then maybe you become a producer. After a while, you maybe play live. And then you play live with musicians. I mean, that's how it went for me. And so I got a lot of support from Pugge Veseltoft, for example, or Cahill Elsebar that I was playing with. They were the first real musicians that I was working with. And they were saying, man, this is cool. And I thought, what do you mean? yeah, the way you play the laptop. And so I got a bit more confident because I would have never dared to play with them. But they were saying, that's interesting, go on. And so from there, when there's more musicians coming, then you have to learn. I mean, until that moment, I did everything by ear. And so finding a chord might... take three days and then you come to a point where you're just too slow and this is something I don't like so I had to I had to sit down and and learn I learned now for five years and I think I learned a lot and that's good it feels good also when I started it felt like, ah, I should have done that way earlier. I did it because I had to. But when I started, I thought, oh, yes, it's actually not that difficult. Because I always had thought this is, all this music stuff is like the theory thing. It's so difficult, but it's not. There's a few things, a few tricks, but... I think it was worth it. Did you take lessons or you did it alone? I took piano lessons, yes, and also theory lessons. I read a lot of books about instrumentation and everything I could get. And I listened to a lot, of course. And yeah, so that's what I did. It's impressive. Do you have many people asking you for classical music recommendations? I guess lots of people listening to this maybe have some small interest in it, but don't really know where to start. Take me, for example. Like Ricardo Villalobos, old US house music. Where could I start? maybe similar stuff that I enjoyed. I don't know, because I come from a techno background and I was attracted by, yeah, by, by Lutoslawski, for example. That's pretty difficult already. So it's, but, but there's these radical moments in there that I really liked. And then there, I mean, for me, the most inspiring one is Ravel. Everyone might know the Bolero, which is a bit, yeah, it's a hit record. Yeah, but once you start investigating, it's an incredibly radical composition. And then you, I listened to so much Ravel during the last few years. And there's so much that I... I can't believe how great it is. The harmonies and how he builds stuff. It's something else. It's the harmonies, isn't it? These harmonies are so amazing when they get it right. Yeah, but also the sound. It's revolutionary in a way. And that's why it's inspiring. And it's not so difficult to access. And then when you go later than that... So maybe this is a recommendation I would say. Anything between 1900 and 1950 is maybe a way to start because that's where the music was very developed. very modern from our perspective and not too far out. Because after World War II, it got a bit out of hand, I would say. Difficult to access and also from my perspective, that's when actually they broke up with... their audience or they that's where they lost us and that's why it seems maybe so too difficult so difficult now to get in again because you you you listen to these things and you're like oh i don't get it yeah that's the thing it's all about finding the right thing for you the door opener yeah so stravinsky of course i mean if you if you listen to sacre that's techno it's it's pure techno And if you listen to it in the concert hall, then it's even easier to access because that's different from a recording, but it's very close to what we love. And Mahler too, very physical, very, yeah, it has a lot. Can you still listen to straight house and techno? Do you still get a joy from it? Oh yeah, totally. Yeah, I couldn't do what I do if I wouldn't. For me, it's all about... How do you say that? It's about the range. So you start here and you go to there. And so depending on your range, that's your perspective on life, I would say. But I read your beginnings were in hip-hop. Yes. That was the first music that I actually wanted to buy. I was raised in South Germany and we had a really cool radio station from Switzerland that I always listened to Friday nights. They were playing the freshest hip-hop. And I was very, I was blown away for the first time. I mean, even before I was... like a fan of funk and soul and stuff like that but yeah then when these hip-hop things with the samples of funk and soul arrived these guys like being really Angry. And girls also. I liked that. But there was no, at that time, you couldn't get vinyl or anything because it didn't, it was, it wasn't available. So I went to Zurich, for example, to... So when did you move to Berlin? 1999. A long time now. Quite a while ago, yeah. Did you know anyone here before you moved? No. Well, I guess it's very different from the South. Yeah, yeah, it's very different. But I was super happy when I arrived because I immediately felt that's actually the place where I should be. So it felt very right to be here. And were you DJing in the South before you moved? Yes, quite a lot. I was a local. resident DJ in a few clubs down there and I had never thought that I would be a music professional at any point. I thought, okay, so I'm this resident, that's cool. And we had a few international guest DJs coming. But I had thought that's going to be, it's going to be over very soon. So I thought I was too late to be part of that. And that was, I don't know, 97. So 97, I thought it was, it's going to go for another two years. I had been lucky because I was a local resident DJ because I had a great time and I played with great people or I warmed up for great people and I enjoyed that a lot. So when was your last DJ set? Very long time ago. And you don't miss it at all? I enjoyed it a lot doing it. I'm pretty sure I would still enjoy it. But at some point, when I went into playing live and producing, there was also a time when I played live and even DJed after that. But then I found out I don't have enough time. I can't handle both because you have to be after the new stuff. If you're a DJ, you... yeah, you have to listen to all these things and you spend a lot of time doing that if you want to do it right. I decided I want to produce. And that needed also a lot of time. And I was working also in my normal job. What was your normal job? I studied graphic design. That's also how I came to Berlin. So I came... to be a designer, not be a musician. It's like Ben Clock, wasn't he also a graphic designer? Oh yeah, was he? A few of you guys are. So when did you quit work full time? On a Friday at the airport when a customer called me and I was on my way to a gig and so the customer called me and said, can you change that headline from red to green or something? man, I'm at the airport, I can't. It was a difficult situation because it was about printing some, I don't remember what it was, but I wanted to do my job well. So I realized this is not going to go on like that. Doing both is just not going to work. I said, OK, let's try if this music thing is going to go on. It did. Was there a difficult period in between quitting work? I don't know, were you already playing a lot? I was playing enough when I quit. That was all right. But there was a difficult period before that. So at some point I quit my employed work and I got self-employed to be a self-employed graphic designer. That was pretty tough in the first few months. Yeah, so... But when I started playing, it was actually all right. Everything was cool. Yeah. And so what year was that? I think that must be something like 2002. So I guess now you've been a full-time musician for longer than you were a graphic designer? Yeah, true. Yeah. Nice. Who were you friends with in Berlin when you moved here? What kind of things would you go to? I think for the first two, three years, I was only working. I was doing nothing else than that. Yeah, we started at 11 and we... finished 12 or 14 hours later. It was, I came here for all this new economy madness. Yeah, we built websites for big brands and also, yeah, it was all new. And it was pretty exciting to be part of that. It was really cool. But we were working our asses off, so there was nothing else. And so, yeah, my friends were my colleagues at that time. I didn't see much of Berlin. Do you miss having this regular life, going to an office? No, not at all. It's depending on what you do. I think when you like what you do, it's all right. Yeah, take care of that. you do something you enjoy and then I think the situation is not so important anymore. In the early days of your house in Techno, was there ever a time where just electronic, four-to-the-floor house music was enough for you? Or did the kind of desire to experiment come with time? It was maybe the other way around because I was... I was listening to a lot of jazz and because from the hip hop background, I was investigating the samples and all these things. and they were playing techno on Tuesdays, and I was playing my jazz dance night on Wednesdays. As we were in, the club was pretty small, and we were all like some kind of a family, so I also went there on a Tuesday, and I also went on Saturdays just to be there. investigate what's going on. So they played this techno stuff on Tuesday and I was there and I didn't get it. I was attracted by it, but I just couldn't get behind what was going on. And I thought, this is so far away from what I like. Yeah, because I like these chord changes and this very complicated jazz stuff. But still I went, because there was something that I wanted to find out. And then we had Jeff Mills coming to play on a Tuesday, and he played, and... And that was the moment when it clicked for me, when I was thinking, but this is jazz too. The way he did it was so free and open. And yeah, I immediately stopped everything else and dived into that. I wanted to, yeah, I was totally blown away that suddenly I had found out how it worked. And I found the key into that world and I realized, okay, this is actually, that's the way I should go in this music. And this is maybe the thing I was always looking for, to get this open space or something that showed me like this huge... or possibilities and that was all in electronic music for me. And also the fact that I thought this is something I can do myself. This is for the first time I thought now I can make music too. This is also something I found very interesting because I always wanted. But then if you have no idea and then you touch the keys of piano and you're like, hmm, I get some nice sounds, but then the next combination I try just sounds shit and it has no connection to the one before. So how does it work? But with techno and drum machines, so I started to experiment. 909 first? Nope, it was a Alesis HR-16. I don't know, yeah, it was very, it was easy. And as I had never thought that. anyone would ever listen to this stuff. It was super easy too. It started as a hobby. I guess that's like that with a lot of people. It starts off as a thing that you don't take so seriously. Yeah. Yeah, you never think you're going to make a career from it. Yeah, you start by playing around. So how long until you were making music that you were happy to show people? Very long. Released my first record in 2002. Mood Music. It's a good record. Yeah. If I hadn't met Sasse, I mean, I played this from a CD, my own stuff, when I was DJing before him. because I was warming up for him and I only had one CD because that was a very expensive thing at that time. So I had burned one CD with my music on it. And then I played one of the tracks. Zazie came to me after the night and he said, what was this one? Try to keep playing it. And I said, ah, nothing. And he said, yeah, but you had it on CD. And I said, yeah, it's my CD. So he said, give it to me. I was thinking this was only this one CD I had. But I gave it to him. Yeah, and he released it a while later. It was the A-side. Wow, so even then it took someone asking you. It's not like you were showing your music to everyone. No, I was super shy in showing my stuff to other people. Did it get a good reaction when you played it at parties? I can't remember because I was so excited about playing it. I don't know. Even your early tracks, they were very musical. and melodic. I guess that's your style. Some people hear something like a style. I can't hear it myself. They'll say that sometimes to me. I can hear your whatever, signature. Okay, I can't. Can you tell me what it is? How does it work? I don't know. How was it in 2002? If you put out a record, do you then get gigs from that? Is it like now? Giles Peterson played it in his show. And on the next day I had a booker and I had gigs so I went to the UK and that was such a I couldn't believe it I went to London to to play I was freaking out and and from there it kind of went on it actually yeah once I started it It didn't stop. I guess you were working full time when this was happening. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you tell your colleagues what you were doing on the weekends? No, because it wasn't, I mean, I didn't know if this would go somewhere or, yeah. It's like everyone's dream. Yeah. To have this experience. Yeah. It was a dream. Also for me, it was, me and my friends, we were always making jokes about that. Ah, and then, you know, one day we're going to release a record. And everybody was laughing, yeah, because it was meant as a joke. And then suddenly you have the first... 12-inch in your hand. It's really, you don't forget that. I guess the difference between those years and now is that you'd already been DJing for years and years. You knew how to mix well, you knew how to play at a party. Where now, you can put out a record, have 10 gigs, and you've never played anywhere outside your bedroom before. Yeah, that's possible. So yeah, I guess that was one advantage that you had. You'd already been a resident for so many years. So going to play in London, even though it was scary, you still knew how to mix and you still knew how to... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Technically I could do it, yeah. Yeah. When did you meet Dixon and these kind of guys? Because this was also a huge thing for you, the Innovisions connection. I think we played... I didn't know Dixon from Berlin. I think we played a party in London again. So we went to the airport on the next day in a bus. And so there was this guy sitting next to me in the bus. And so I said, hey, who are you? And so it turned out to be Dixon. And we were on the way to the, I think we were on the way to the airport. And so we started talking and there was some kind of connection. I think on that car ride, we decided we're going to meet again and see if there's more. Yeah, so we did. And a few weeks, so we started to work on a track. At some point, Stefan said, hey, I think we could bring some other friends of mine in. And that's when Frank and Christian came in. And that's when we did Where We At. And so that one was pretty successful for all of us. And so we thought, ah, this may be a good combination. Do it again. Yeah, we should. And from there we were kind of seen as a, we just played a lot together from there. after the release of that record. So when did you decide to totally focus on live sets? I don't know. I think it just got less and less with the DJing because I kind of, I was still doing it because I liked it, but it still got less and then at some point I got more requests for playing live and then... Sometimes when I realize it's better to spend all the energy on one thing or when I realize it's too much to do both things well, I realize I don't have enough time anymore to listen to things. And then when you have other people play the interesting stuff, I'm like, oh, I didn't hear that one. I know that your live show is also... pretty versatile. I was reading that you can essentially play any piece of your music. Yes. I can do that, yeah. So of course, it gives you a lot of freedom. Yes. Lots of people kind of do the same thing every weekend. Yeah, yeah. I think for me it would get boring. It's also important for me to keep it fresh. My file, it grows and grows and grows. And there's still everything in there from day one. And I find it very interesting to be able to jump. It's like carrying a huge box of records with me and then I can even tweak them in any direction. So sometimes it's fun to just press play in some random position and see what's happening and then play around with this kind of random accident because that keeps the energy high and I think that's very important. play live. You can also adapt to the situation so much easier. Yeah, it feels like not so many live performers can do that. Do you get to see many other DJs or many DJs play many other live sets? Yeah, sure. There's always people before and after me that I might listen to or if I'm at a festival and there's someone that I... that I like, I go there and listen and yeah. And do you like what you hear these days? Probably getting less, but I don't know if that's me or if that's them or what it is. Of course, everything has changed quite a lot, but still there's many times when you get surprised and that's what it's about. So what are the big changes that you see? It got very, very, very professional. So when I started there... Nobody was talking about sound systems because we were happy when it was loud. So you didn't really care about the quality. I even wonder sometimes how did it work? Because there was a lot of really bad ones. But that actually didn't make a difference. I like that especially the sound is on a very high level now, where sometimes it gets a little bit too much control, because for me it's always about freedom. If everything is very formatted and under control, this is not the situation I see this music in. You mean like security guards and fences? Or you mean like, okay, Henrik, your bus is at 10 o'clock. You play at 10.30. That's also fine, I think, because that's the professional part of it. And also the security people are very important because they protect. You can freak out in an area that is protected. So that's important. But to create this open space where unexpected things can happen. So it's more about that. And this is maybe what is getting a bit less because if you are a successful festival, you want to deliver. And that's the same for, I think it's the same for many successful DJs. They need to deliver even. That's their job. I like when there's also something unexpected. And they can deliver because it is their job. But you would actually look for something unexpected. So as this is so professional, maybe there's not so many unexpected things happening. Yeah, I wonder where you find that now. Because I know exactly what you mean. I guess DJs are so scared of messing up a mix or losing people on the dance floor. There's a lot of competition also. But I think with live acts, I can see that sometimes. And at least I can say for me, and also when I play, I try to surprise myself because otherwise it's also boring for me. I need to, and I hope that it's jumping. into the audience too so i think that that part is very important i guess that's why you're able to play live so much it's because you yeah you emphasize this freedom because you can play anything yeah i find that very important so i put a lot of energy in preparation that the freedom is there and that that things work yeah even if i do something unexpected or even i i put stuff into the live sets so that I get surprised and I need to react. I think that's very important. Do you usually come away from your sets with a good feeling? Because you're taking it very seriously. A few weeks ago, for the first time since I do this, I was not happy while I was playing because all the stuff that happened before was such a disaster. that I was on stage and I couldn't get rid of the bad thoughts, which I usually, I never experienced this before. And that was kind of impressive. So I was thinking about it a lot. How did it happen? Why was this so bad? I mean, I think I still played okay, but I always had this thing in my head, which I usually don't have. that was the only moment I can remember where I thought, yeah, I'm not feeling right now. Yeah, because you seem pretty positive. I can't imagine you being upset. It's pretty difficult to get me in a bad mood, yeah. It's not when things go wrong, because that's... Yeah, it happens. It happens, yeah, but it's the way how this is handled. And what about when you're producing music? Do you feel, are you in a good mood when you're producing or are you getting frustrated? Oh, I think there's a lot of frustration. Yeah, it's always a fight. And I mean, that's the bad thing about the knowledge. Once you know, it kind of, it always also limits you. So there's also a big part in... in reminding myself of the old days when I was just working by ear and do that again. I think that's very important because there's a lot of frustration if you know the rules. There is something in your head that tells you, but you can't do that now. Because it's wrong. But that's actually the important moment. And you have to decide, yeah, but I go by ear. Like I always did. Because it goes back to the freedom thing. Yeah, exactly. chords don't work yeah actually yeah of course if i feel it it's right then it should be right and and you should follow that instinct kind of thing um yeah when it works i get excited of course i think it's always a struggle to to get an idea in a way that you can hear it that's the That's the difficult part. How can you get it out of your head into something that other people can hear? So when you get a new project like the silent film or Berlin Ballet, are you using ideas that you've already had? Or you see something and then you use that as inspiration and create? I mean, I'm collecting a lot of things, ideas, and writing things down also. So when a new project comes, I don't go in there and I have an idea already. So I usually listen first to what's going on because I find it's important to make something that fits. And then it can be... a tiny detail that makes something not fit. And so I'd rather start from scratch. But I might use an idea I already had because then I remember that there was this one thing I did. Maybe I can use it or maybe I can use parts of it. And yeah, like that. Do you have lots of recordings in your studio, like ideas for tracks? Thousands, yeah. Really? I think so, yeah. Wow. 99% is crap, of course. Maybe even more than that. And do you test some things out with your live set? I do that quite a lot. I mean, that happens quite a lot in the hotel room before the gig. Yeah, there's this one bass line. I just play it quickly and I drop it into the live set. And then at night I just try it out. And I see if I can... I do that more and more now because I feel a bit more confident in playing. stuff live, producing live on stage. That's also something that I like a lot. Sometimes it goes right and then you have something really strong because you kind of, somehow the energy of the room goes into that recording or into the creation process because you are so under pressure. because you have to deliver within seconds. The whole process is very rough, and I like that. And so sometimes you get really strong results from that. So you produce a track in real time, and it takes only two minutes. And that can be a source for a new production. And if it works, I'm really happy because that's... I think that's the best way of producing in a way, because then you have that kind of switch the brain off and just use the energy of the moment and your fingers play something. And then you choose a sound and then you're like, oh, okay, this is cool. I've got a new track now. Yeah, you've got a new track, yeah. Yeah, as you say, this dance floor energy is somehow there. It's like a spark. If you're lucky, you can grab it. So it needs some training, yes, but yeah. Immediately you realise this is something strong. I can use that and that's really cool. So when you're playing live, is it like DJing where you're thinking ahead a few tracks? Like you say, OK, they really like this melody now. Maybe in a few tracks I'll put something like this. Are you in the moment grabbing clips or you always have an idea about where you're going? I think I don't have enough brain power to foresee. It happens pretty often to me that I'm at the end of a track and I don't know what I'm going to do next. But that's the DJ thing. Then the DJ brain switches on and I'm like, OK, so what's next? And then I need to, yeah, and then I jump there. So that works pretty well, I think. Has it always been like that with your live sets? Because I can imagine it could be pretty scary to be up there, the tracks running out, you need a new... It actually got more difficult maybe three years ago. Something weird happened and it never got back to before. Around three years ago, I could remember every single clip in my whole life set. and every track and every track name. And because I've sorted everything alphabetical, so I can access everything very quick. That's important. So I have shortcuts to go to all the tracks that start with P or whatever. And what happened, it got too much. So more track names than I could remember. even if it's my own stuff. So what happens now, sometimes I know what I want to play, but I'm thinking about the track name and it doesn't come to my head. So I'm on stage and I know what I want to play, but I don't know the name. So that's bad. Somehow it got too much. Or maybe my brain power just goes down. That's also possible. I don't know. Before I I was always, yeah, now this, now this, now this. And I have that still, now this, now this, now this, but I don't remember the name. How do you have the clips named? Like Fat Bassline 23? Well, it's organized in tracks. So I have the track name or the remix name and then all the files that belong to that. piece they're all in the same kind of more or less position so i i know if i want that bass line i have to jump there and then then it says baseline yeah yeah what do you say give me Now, what do you say? Give me a little second. Ah, what do you say? Now do you, George? Not LCU Come on man Come on Jared I was too sure you wouldn't be one of them man Come on Jared Not you man Not you man, not you Come on man Come on man Jared Come on Major, come on man Come on man, not you Major Come on Major, not you man Come on, man. I mean, I mean... All the other motherfuckers, yeah, but you, I mean, I always thought, man, you, man, Jared, you the one. You're not gonna be one of them. You're not gonna be one of them. But now, now you turn out to be one of them, Jared. Oh, man, not you. Not you. Not you.
