♪♪ ♪♪ Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Gregor O'Halloran and I'm a freelance writer at Resident Advisor. Ibiza 2011 was a roaring success, with dance floors busier than ever, quality music pushing new boundaries and the usual fun and games along the way. There were also a couple of major actors who we'll look back on this year as a defining one. To explore 2011, we talked to three of the major players on the island. First up we headed over to the famed DC10 venue to catch up with Andrea Polino. Andrea, alongside partner Antonio, is the promoter of Circa Loco and also programs the other parties at the club, which this year included combining the perhaps uncommon genres of disco and techno, as well as one of the best underground parties on the island, Pandemonium, on Fridays. There we go! The season 2011 for DC10 was great with the three parties. The main party is Circo Loco, that was the next level. And after we did other two, that was the Wednesday night from disco to techno and the Friday night with Pandemonium by Tania Vulcano. And at the end of... the season 2011, all the three parties did a strong concept at the end because we have actually like the Monday with a lot of new artists, the Wednesday that was like a concept between the old style of music and the new style. of house and techno and the Friday night that was the classic party from Tegna that is there for a long time you know it's 12 years that is with us is still there. What's the meaning behind the next level which was the concept for Circa Loco this year? Last year we started with a new era and it was something to say we want to change okay and in the last season we tried after the new era with the concept of the next level we tried to search something that was more more powerful after the new era I understood that you know was something strong that was coming I decided to call the new season the next level. What's your philosophy for putting on these parties at EC10? I try always to make the concept of the party around the music this is the main idea after after this I need to look artists, sound system and people. All these three concepts make the party great. If you work on the best way with these three things, I think you will have the best party. Let's talk a little bit about the artists then, especially for Circa Loco, because those who've come from the new era last year, some of them have really developed this year to become big names on the island especially. Yes, this year was a big surprise. After the confirmation of the main artists that we have like Tanya, Clive and others, it was a strong moment. for people like Jamie Jones, Seth Roxler, and the guys from Vision Quest, Davide Squillace, Mattias Tanzmann, Dean Sandrom, and then Ganancia, and also too many more, because this year they arrived and all these DJs arrived, I think, with the main idea to make something special. and when I was there at DC10 during the set of these people I understood that something was going very very well with music and the music was changing the best way after the last years with minimal and other kind of music I mean you mentioned minimal that that was always a sound people associated with with DC10 but these artists, they play different styles of music, not just to Minimal, but to each other as well. Yes, I just want to say that with Minimal, I want to say that it's a period that was in Ibiza with the music, and this period changed, and hopefully you have a new style of music, you know, like... artists like Jamie Jones, if you just listen to the last production of him and other people, they make the difference. And this is what we were searching exactly for the club, bring a good DJ, a good producer, and at the same time make the concept for the club with also our music. And this is what's happened this year with the people, because the people arrived there and also the artists, the track, everything. The main concept was running on the best way. People like Jamie Jones this year. Jamie's played at the club for many years, but this year was kind of a pivotal year really for him, wasn't it? Yeah, this is the big surprise for the club. This is what makes it really emotional. you know my job because when you look at one artist that was waiting 10 years inside the club and waiting waiting and try to make the best and arrive after 10 years so stronger is i think it's making this person different because yeah because jamie is one kind of guys different from the other because it's one guy so cool so quiet but you know it's so around the music and I just saw the interview last time from passion magazine that was which was the inspiration from from Jamie in Ibiza and He said that it was Clave Harry and for me it's the same because artists like Clave in Ibiza are the main artists that are there for a long time. They never change. They have the same people that are around. This is so cool that you have some artists like this around. You don't have just the big names and the people that go around on the commercial. the story of big DJ and I love to have people like them in the club actually because this makes me happy inside because I have people that are cool that are real around. And Jamie and Kerry both were awarded prizes in the DJ Awards as well they won I think in the Deep House category and this This kind of brings back everything you were talking about before with the old and the new because Kerry is one of those artists that's come to play for Circo Loco in the last year or so. I know Kerry from 20 years and last year in September when I was to decide how was the final line-up for the closing. I was around to make the decision to bring something different. And you know, I know Kerry for a long time. I know that he's a very good artist, he's a very good producer. He's making the story of the house music. He's coming from New Jersey. He's at Go School. He's also an engineer for Pioneer, EBM. He's one person that is special. I decided to start to talk with him like a couple of weeks before and say: "Hey, Kerry, okay, I want to do you at the closing party, introduce you in Circo Loco and try to make something special." But you need to understand that after, you know, the story of the American music, you know, that now is a little bit commercial, something is going to change. And the result was that Kerry was coming here and... one year is around the house music movement and this was great for him because he's one person that was coming with the young people around because I think he's the father of all the DJs inside DC-10 because they not just for the age just for the experience and how he did in the past is It's something that all the other DJs are looking at and it's making an experience for them. And this message arrived very strongly. The DJ Awards, I don't believe this kind of thing, you know, I don't care if they won the DJ Awards, but I believe something that is important, that the message with Kerry and Jamie Jones is arrived there, is arrived around, this is more important than all the rest. Bringing people like Kerry in is an example for me of how sometimes, especially at Circa Loco and at DC10, there seems to be a creativity in how things are done. For example, Matthias Tanzmann and Davide Svillacci play back-to-back regularly. Throughout the year, there's been hundreds of different back-to-back pairings. I know you're quite influential in making those happen. What's the idea behind them and how did they come about? The idea is to make the situation more friendly. to make them not in competition but to put all of them in the same level. This kind of thing I think is making the balance, you know, sometimes. When you have like two kinds of DJs that are a little bit the same or have something that the other one doesn't have and you mix the two qualities at the same time, this is making the set great. And you know, when we start... I remember one of the first, it was so long ago, it was Richie Houghton and Ricardo Villalobos and this and that, after Tania Locoda. I don't know, I don't want to mention how many we did in the past, but these make a big difference. Because you see the people that are looking at this kind of scent and I think they... is making like more show and also is making sometimes more quality and it's important you know to to put like one time this year was inside like a dead and clive and i was in the main room listening The set was incredible, amazing. At the same time, we did with Dan Ganassi, another time with Jamie Jones with Set Rocks, another time with Tanya with Tatooine. I don't know how many we did, but all the time these people were making the 100% to make this set great and make the people happy. This was the most important thing at the end of the day. Interestingly, with the other parties that are at DC10 on Wednesdays and Fridays, a lot of the artists from Circa Loco have been involved in making them successful too, haven't they? Wednesday night and Friday night this summer was great because for the people it was possible to go there and listen to a different kind of music from the session of the Monday, the next level but in the same time it was like the Friday with Pandemonium was the confirmation of a great artist like Tania. For me, something with the music that he's doing is always special. I have a sound that is different from the other. Also was bringing all the artists from his good record, people like Tato, Tuchillo, Willy Graf, and invite all other good artists that... was around this party and the concept was great because it was probably a good house music party for the Friday night. And the Wednesday night was the main concept that we did was to try to mix the old school house with artists like Tony Humphries, the legendary Nicky Siano and other people from the old school. So this is from Disco to Techno? Yeah, from Disco to Techno, the Wednesday night. and try to mix with the techno artists. On the Wednesday, obviously the two parties that make it different during the summit, or the three, four parties, because, you know, three, four parties was very strong. The two-man party was... the Vision Quest, I have the idea of these four guys that is something very special and cool. All the four guys are different, one from the other, because we have said that it's something that you don't know these guys, how is, he's a great DJ, but in the same time he's a great artist, he's an actor, it's something that you cannot explain, you know. The other party was Hot Night Shred with Jamie Jones and Richie Ahmed, our department and other people from the label. And also this one was great because we had a great time with Jamie making the last two hours there for this party. It was incredible to see him. I was emotional, I was sad, I was, you know. there to make something very special. Also, Mattias did a project with Martin Butrich and Davide Squillace, and Better Lost Than Stupid was the name. Sorry, I was going to forget. And also the party that we did last year that was... the party with the fire and David Esquilache also this one was great and at the end of the season I can say that you know the night was moving better after the last year of DC10 also the music was going better because I think that all these new artists that we introduced because a lot of these are artists that are coming from from the Monday and with the label that they have, with the concert that they did with the record label and the party, we have something more in this E10, something that we can introduce not just on Monday for Circo Loco but also for the night. It's interesting because most people would probably prefer, DJs would probably prefer to play on the Monday and be part of Circa Loco, but the Wednesdays and Fridays are kind of probably a better showcase for them, really, in some ways. Yeah, because... they don't understand what is this town exactly because for me just going there for one DJ is something special and I have some people that come and I don't know for the Wednesday or for Friday They are coming with the idea that they are going to play for the best clubs on time and when I see them and they say "Hey, I'm going to play DC10, I'm so stressed, my emotion is so bigger at the moment, I don't know what I will do" It's good to see these people stressed, this kind of DJ stressed to come there because it makes me happy to see how they come to play there. And I think they play good always for this reason. We talked about a lot of the key artists for Cirque du Loco and at the club this year. What about some of the new artists that perhaps haven't played so much but may do in the future? Who kind of made a... big surprise or big impact? Okay I want to say first for the music because for my concept of music basically Martinez Brothers and Soul Club was a big surprise for me. These guys are incredible. Good music, good style, good concept, everything was great with them. You know, I listened to something that was incredible on the terrace, on the car with them, on the after party that we did the sand that was mixing at the same time, all four, you know. all these new people because are too young that are coming you know I can say a lot of name because we had I don't know how many guests how many people I don't want to forget like I can say people like Deirdre, Dan, System of Survival we have a lot I don't want to forget you know one of the of the DJs that we had. But what I can say is that all these kinds of DJs, they are coming with something new. This is why they were there. One of the biggest parties this summer for sure was the closing. I mean, it was one of the strongest lineups I've ever seen in Ibiza in terms of the quantity of DJs, but also obviously the quality and who was involved. Yes, I think this party was crazy. When we did the line-up, when we started to book the DJ, we arrived at one point and me and my partner Antonio, we saw the line-up just on the computer on one document and we said, hey, what are we doing? Is it correct? We have all these names on the day. I don't want to say how many refused for this party. know what just great to say techno artists like Ben Kloc, Damian Lazarus, Da Fire, Allen Allen, Timo Maas in the main room, other one, but in the same time I see on the terrace like the Vision Quest guys, Kerry Chandler, Matthias, Davide, Riccardo Villalobos and Zip and also on the garden. We had the style of music that was right for this kind of concert, that was The Garden. It was great to see people like Soul Club and Seth Roxen and Jamie play back to back. The set of Tanya was amazing. I know that one of the kind of things that I really hate is when people say Ibiza used to be better years ago or DC10 was better years ago. How would you respond to people who kind of make that accusation? I can say that for me DC10 is always the same. Maybe something changes with the music, with the artists, but the party is always there. It's always Circo Loco. is the same name and nothing is changed. The main director, the main people there and this is important. Also basically we have some DJs that are there for a long time and this makes a strong concept, a strong family and others new are coming and we make this family bigger and bigger. But around I cannot say Ibiza has changed, it's better, it's not better, because this is stupid. I think the people that are coming sometimes say, ah, last year was better. before was the after-hour, three years ago was better. But at the end it's always Ibiza. If we have more freedom, more party for the people, more concerts around, for me it's better. And we don't need to say it was better before or now, it's always the same. What do you think then, talking a bit more generally, how do you think about the season in general in Ibiza, some of the key trends that you've seen maybe developing on the island? Yeah, the season, I think around what I listened to, because I don't know in any party around the window, I cannot say this party was good or not good, but what I listened around that, you know, all the club full, a lot of people around. and this was important for the island. After I don't know which kind of people was in the club or in the other club but for me, for my idea that it's this attend what I see every week and every day in my club was good, was very good to see good people coming and... and see good parties every night. There seems to be a little bit of a relaxation of how strict things are with the after hours. There certainly seems to have been more parties and different events happening. Next year, is the possibility that Circo Loco might open earlier on the Monday? If it was for me, yes. But it depends on the authority, not on me. My idea to open in the morning is always the main idea. This is born on Monday morning. I remember just the concept of the biography that was a Monday morning in Ibiza. Next we headed to Ibiza town to visit Pasha's Danny Whittle, who has been the main inspiration for the club's continued rise over the last decade, being chiefly responsible for booking and organising all the parties that take place at the club, including adding Luciano's cadenza last year, and Pete Tong's Friday Night this year. Those nights fit alongside already established commercial events featuring David Guetta, the Swedish House Mafia and Eric Murillo amongst others. Covering a wide range of issues, we saw how 2011 went through Pasha's eyes, as well as exploring whether there is a place for hip hop music in Ibiza. The 2010 season was so good, there was kind of a certain amount of pressure on us to continue with that. and it did. I think the numbers are up across the island as well, which helped to move the momentum on. And I think, you know, Pete coming back again gave us another angle. So generally, I would have to say that the season was really, really positive. One of the sort of challenges that you have compared to perhaps some of the other clubs is that you have some very commercial nights and kind of some underground nights at the same time. How... How do you balance and how do you manage that sort of problem? You know what? I think all the clubs have that problem. I really don't think it's purely passion. probably the only club that doesn't have that problem is DC10 and the nights they're not underground they're closed. You know, all the other big clubs whether you're talking of Amnesia's Foam Party or Cream which is reasonably commercial compared to say Cocoon or you know Space with some of their more commercial nights compared to... you know, their Kayakuma night, I suppose, then you put in their, some of the trance big boys, I suppose you could say was slightly more. commercial but when I think when you look at Pascha our commercial nights are bigger than most other people's commercial nights which is why it kind of sticks out more like a sore thumb but the issue is at the end of the day like like every club you know we have to pay the bills as well you know and we've got over three or maybe 400 people working for us here in Pascha. They all want to take home a good wage. So you've got to run a business as well and at the same time try and keep one foot in the underground stroke new breed camp. And ultimately everybody starts off in the underground. Most people start off in the underground or in the new breed and ultimately end up in the commercial. because ultimately that's what human nature is. You end up getting married and having a kid and then you want to send it to a nice school and you want to buy a nice car and a house. So suddenly you want to get 20 grand a gig instead of 200 quid a gig. So that's kind of the natural progression of the way things go. So over seven nights in Pascha, we tend to try and cover that spectrum as much as we can. And luckily, you know, I think ultimately it's down to quality. And I think if you do something commercial, but it's still good quality, then it can work with good quality underground. Everybody recognises, for example, the DC-10, you know, Circa Lonca nights, very cool, very underground. event but it's also quality it's a quality event and the same thing with the Swedish House Mafia you could say well they're quite commercial of course they are you know they're sold out I think they sold out Madison Square Gardens in 20 minutes but at the same time what they do is of a high quality whether you like it or not so I think I think that you know the common bond across all of that is just keeping good quality one of the of principle changes have passed you in the last couple of years certainly one of the biggest talking points on the island was when Luciano came in and his cadenza parties began It was obviously a success last year. How has been the second season? Incredible. I mean, double last year. And to be honest, I think it's going to double again. And I think what happened with Lucci, it's a strange one, really. It's like, you know, what is underground? Underground to me is doing something that nobody expects you to do. So it's like for a DJ, you know, it's going to an underground club. because you're an underground DJ, is that really underground? or throwing everybody a curveball and doing something that nobody expected you to do. You could say it was quite an underground manoeuvre as well. And I think that's what Lutie did. I think at the end of the day, he looked at what was going on around him. He didn't want to just do what other people were doing and go to a specific night or a specific venue. He wanted to do something that nobody expected him to do. He wanted to present his sound and his music to other people. You know, the problem is, to a degree, sometimes people think that, say, for example, if you've got some money or a credit card, you can't like cool music, which is total bullshit. You know, most of the people that go to DC10 or whatever, they're not penniless paupers. You know, there's kids in there with plenty of money and, you know, they'll drive a nice car down there and so on So I don't think you can just link the underground with penniless kids. You can have a good taste of music and still be married with kids and have a credit card and a nice house and a car. It's down to a matter of taste. So I think Lucci just thought, and I thought as well, I mean, I was kind of courting Lucci for a couple of years and his management, if you like, about bringing him to Pascha. Because I actually think his sound fits in Pascha. I think those kind of Latin beats, you know, that sound he's got, that deep, heavy bass-driven sound actually works. It's sexy. At the end of the day, Luciano's sound is really sexy. I think Cadenza's sound is really sexy. And I think that fits in Pasha, without a shadow of a doubt. One of the features of his music this year has been, again, you talk about it being sexy and... kind of deep bass lines, this type of thing. There's been a lot of 80s vocals, a lot of acapellas, this type of thing. He's almost become kind of, the show is built around him very much, isn't it? The night is built around him. Yeah, it is. I mean, don't get me wrong, there's some really good DJs that come along with that package. I mean, that is a package. Luciano himself has... become a bit of a phenomenon you know and but also again I mean two years ago who'd have expected Lucy drop a Britney Spears vocal or something like that that again is that him showing people, look, I'll do what I want. You know, I can do what I want. I can play these big drums. I can drop these big bass lines in and, you know, these screaming keyboards. And then, you know what, I'm going to drop an 80s vocal on the top of it and have some of that, you know, which I like as well. You know, it's, you know, he's proving as well that he doesn't want to stick to some kind of routine of what sounds to be. I mean his job and every DJ's job out there is to create new, is to do things differently. Now you know you could say well using 80s vocal isn't new but in his context it is new and now who knows what he's going to come up with next year you know so I think that it's their job not necessarily just to do what people expect them to do but to actually deliver something that It's a little bit left of centre and something that you'd really not expect them to do. But he has definitely become a, you know, a huge figure in the world of DJing worldwide. I mean, the demand for him now has gone through the roof. And you know what? It's going to happen again. It's happening to Loco Dice. It's happening to Marco Carolla. It's going to happen to Jamie and Seth. And they'll all go down that road at the end of the day. I'll safely put money on that. One of the things about Luciano, especially in the last year, is that his music's become even more accessible. You know, the vocals and kind of... familiar tunes and familiar melodies. Again, you mentioned Jamie and Seth there and that sound again is quite accessible. Is that the trend now? Do you see that as kind of the popular trend in Ibiza? I think at the moment, yes, you know, it changes. I think, let's be honest, it went down the road of this minimal sound and, you know, it was like flogging a dead horse with that. I have to say, the first couple of years of that was very good and very creative. three every nine tracks out of ten were terrible you know when people were doing it because it was fashionable but they're actually forgetting it was shit you know and it needed to evolve it needed to fill out again and you know and I think people were coming a bit more musically aware and you know it wasn't just just about a trend And I think that's what happened. I think House is back again. Now, how long that's going to be, who knows? Another DJ is going to pop up and do something different and do it in another way, another style. You only have to look at some of the guys that have been playing down at DC10 this year, down at Circa Loco, to see that there's a big... You know, Kerry Chandler. back playing one of the coolest nightclubs on the planet. So I think that, you know, there's definitely a swing towards a fuller sound and a more, not necessarily more vocal, but a more musical sound, a more melodic sound. But by next summer, that could have all changed again. It really is who's clever on the... scene who's going to come up with just a slightly different angle and then this is what's great about house music because it just keeps turning a corner every now and again and going in a new direction but as I've always said and most people agree I think it all stems right back to house music it's just a different delivery really. I mean Pasha historically is obviously you know built on being a house music club a true house music club I think Defected is probably the best example you have of that now like in terms of in terms of the old style of house music in terms of a true house music night it's very much kind of underrated and and I think it surprises a lot of people when they actually come and and see what the night's like listen I think Defected is one of the best nights in the club without a shadow of a doubt and they've actually gone deeper over the last couple of years I mean if you go you know listen what they put out on CD is very much about selling and it's very specialised towards doing that. What they actually do in a nightclub is very much about setting their vibe in a nightclub and it's generally a lot deeper, a lot cooler. smooth the sound. Musically, their night's a fantastic night, one of the best on the islands in fact. And Simon Dunmore, who happens to own the label, but to be honest, musically, taste-wise, his taste is awesome. When you hear Simon DJing, he's as good as anybody. One of the new nights this year was Pete Tong's All Gone Pete Tong night. I think one of the most interesting things was how you balanced or how you managed to balance having Matthias Tansman one week, Laidback Luke the next, Fatboy Slim the next, Lauren Garnier. What was the difficulty in having that? how did you overcome that kind of problem well you know they're changing each week yeah i mean this is the beauty of working with pete you know pete's kind of the godfather of the scene to a degree especially from the uk and you know he's somebody that i think most most people trust when it comes to working with him and so on uh You know, and so most people will go and work with him and he will just change a little bit to suit the night, whoever he's playing with and whatever guest he's playing with. So it tends to work. I think one of the problems is, you know, listen, some of the big stuff I was a bit disappointed with this year, some of the big superstars, Usher and stuff like that. It just... It just kind of didn't feel right. Then we'd then, you know, a couple of weeks later we did Matthias Tanzmann and it was a better night. So it just shows you really that as much as you want to try and, you know, not be musically snobby and try and allow people different options and reasons to come to pass you, you don't want to kind of cut anybody out. You want to at least give one or two nights that somebody might like and they can come and taste the flavour. You know, you don't want to be the same every night and be inclusive or exclusive. Too exclusive. The, you know, I was amazed this year at just how, I want to say underground, but it isn't underground. It's just how much good taste is coming back into the scene in Ibiza. You know, I don't think it's about being underground and kind of dark and moody and this kind of feel. But I think people now in Ibiza, generally, people come to Ibiza, have really good taste in music and it's getting better and better. And as much as you can have your big stars and the kids will always come out for it and pay, the responses you get, the kind of, and the pressure you get from it is mostly from really good music. good quality music. You mentioned Usher was at the club and I know there was a number of other kind of hip-hop and R&B stars who were not only at Pasha this year but in Ibiza Ludacris was here, Seal played live, you know there were hip-hop stars at MTV with 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg. There was also a kind of a backlash to that, what's your opinion on kind of... the fact that music's come to the island this year a lot more. I actually really like it. You know, I mean, again, I don't like being snobby about music. You can't tell people what to like and what not to like Snoop Dogg's thing sold out and was absolutely packed So nobody can tell me there wasn't a demand for that People, you know, he's a master at his game There's no two, nobody can sit there and say Snoop Dogg's shit I mean if you don't like hip-hop, okay, but nobody can say he's bad at what he does He's a master at what he does Also, you know people like David and the Swedes working Dizzy Rascal, you know, working with Ludacris and so on. You know, I think what's happened to a degree in America is I think a lot of the kids got tired of the violence and aggression and so on that was wrapped up with hip-hop, basically. And I think dance music has become the new thing in America for kids that isn't so aggressive. You can actually enjoy it. and have a smile on your face and still be cool. And so I think there's been this bit of a crossover, you know, that's obviously happened. I think a lot of it's got to do with that. I think, you know, kids don't... kind of want to have to walk around with the trousers hanging around the knees anymore with the with a gun and a knife and so on in America. I think they see something different in dance music and I think that's played a major part in the transition. So I think what's happened there is that some of these very very talented R&B stars also want to do want to be involved in dance music and who can blame them it's a great scene to be involved in. So I think these guys coming to Ibiza, if there's a demand there, if somebody wants to pay to go see them, if somebody likes that thing, then I don't think anybody anywhere should tell people what they should and shouldn't do. I wanted to ask you on a kind of personal level really, that... Obviously you've got a really long history within the dance music business. You were there when it all started and have worked across the board in all sorts of things. How do you feel now working with artists like David Guetta and the Swedish House Mafia that are kind of almost so far away from that original ethos of dance music culture? And even to the extent where you're working with hip hop and, you know... worldwide, global, multinational selling artists? I'm proud. I'm proud of that. I'm proud of the scene. I think we, you know, the scene has been created that never used to exist. And if we all want to go back to illegal raves and car parks and nobody making any money except the drug dealers, then, you know, where's it end? You know, it's like we might as well not drive cars. or go shopping, you know what I mean? The world evolves, there's no stopping it, whether you want it or not. And the scene's evolved into a scene where it's a multi-billion euro industry now. There's people making good money, there's people with jobs, there's people, you know, there's people now. I actually think in a way it forefronts the music scene altogether because I think it's the one side of music. that embrace technology quicker than anybody else. I think we embrace... the idea of download, we embraced the idea, you know, so I think in a way it leads me, it's right at the tip of the arrow now of the music scene and rock and roll and that kind of stuff is almost dragging behind in its wake because they're just not into that technology and it took the record labels 20 years to realise that, you know, kids were going to nick music. I think house music has shown the record industry and the music industry. how you can actually make money from music, you know, and still give kids music to a degree, you know, so... You know, I'm really proud of what the house music industry's done. Them times will never return. I had some of the best times of my life in raves where there was no dance music in the charts, nobody had heard of them, and to a degree, you know, E's weren't even illegal initially, you know. So, and then everything changed, and it does. But I think what we've done now is we've created, well... there's been an industry created. that people now can enjoy, can get work in and can help to develop. But I think anybody that's involved in dance music should be proud of where we're at at the moment. And there's still lots of very cool, very underground stuff that's pushing it all forward. Coming back to Ibiza, I know you said this year was generally busier for you and the island as a whole. What kind of things... have you seen this year that have really kind of interested you or a trend maybe that's sparked your interest or an artist perhaps? - Listen, you know, I think the one thing that's really stuck out this year is how high-end this side of the island has gone. And again, it's unavoidable. At the end of the day, when you talk about world crisis and banking crises and this, that and the other, I mean, you wouldn't think so in Ibiza, that's for sure. The boats are four times longer than they were three years ago. And also, having opened Leo. You know, we've seen that world even more. I think what's happened to a degree is the world's crisis. There's been this demographic shift. You know, you've not just lost some people from the bottom end of the market in Ibiza. You've gained some at the top. So there's the kind of people that maybe used to go to Saint-Tropez or Monte Carlo or whatever. Now they're coming to Ibiza. And I think what you're also getting is a lot of people... who've grown up in the last 15, 20 years of house music and now they've got money but they still love house music so they're coming to Ibiza. So that was quite... a very obvious shift in the island I think in the last couple of years and certainly this year I've noticed it more and more. I think what we've got to be very very careful of on Ibiza though is that San Antonio kind of stays the same. I think what happens and I'm a firm believer in this is you buy love and loyalty when you clash with somebody. very early age. I mean the banks learned this years ago. If you get somebody to set up an account with you when they're 15 or 16, they're probably still banking with you when they're 60. And I think this is part of Ireland, the way Ibiza works. Kids come here at 16, 17 for their first holiday in San Antonio. They have the time of their life. They fall in love with the island. A year later they come back again. Three years later they go to play. or whatever, a year later they come to a better town and you get this relationship built up. I think if you take San out of the frame and there's no entry point for kids, I think that could be the doom of the island to be honest. So I really feel that we need to maintain that balance of good, fair, cheap holidays for young kids to come and fall in love with the island. but at the same time, them boats are just going to get bigger. It's a 20 by 40 mile island in the middle of the Med. There's kind of nowhere else to go, you know. 2012, I know the work never really stops at Pascha, so what's... What's the forecast for 2012 at the club? You know what? I'm already working on it. People are already calling managers, agents are already, what are your thoughts for next year? What are you doing next year? It's a chicken and egg thing really to a degree. It's like there are certain people obviously we want to continue working with so we've got to wait for the okay from them. You get the okay but it needs to be clarity. it needs to be sure and then you start looking at the holes that you've got and you start to fill the holes. I mean I can't say too much there are definitely a few DJs that I would love to get into the club in one way or another. We are now as you saw yesterday we're doing some big renovations on the club which I think is going to be exciting for anybody that likes to come to Paschal. Onwards and upwards really, we just keep going on and hopefully keep getting better. Finally I made my way to an empty Amnesia to meet Valentino Barriosetta, who has been instrumental in pushing Amnesia in the last couple of years in his role as brand and marketing manager. This year Amnesia had long running successful parties like Cocoon and Cream, joined by new additions like MTV and Tonight. All of which we discussed in depth, as well as digging deeper into why drinks prices are so high on the island. Okay, Valentino, tell us about Amnesia 2011. How was the season? Well, I think it was a great success. We're really happy improving the results of last year's. And I think it has been especially a good year because we had two new parties coming on board, which were Tuesdays with Tonight and Fridays with MTV. and they were both really successful. So I think all the parties did also better than last year, improved their numbers, and I think the overall result is really, really good for us. Tell us a little bit more about tonight, because obviously this is a brand new concept with some brand new music for Ibiza and Amnesia. Well, tonight was a really risky night. new party for Amnesia, obviously bringing Dubstep in the main room was not really the sound that would fit with the VIP area, which you know is really big at Amnesia. And we have to really take care of that area when we program and we book all the talent. And it worked very good. We were really, really impressed from people like Jason Stathos, Krilex, Sub. Focus, Animag, and all this crew did very, very well and bring a new sound to the club. Eric Pritz did also very good, having his own party for the first time on the terrace and swapping with Animag on the main room. And I think the potential of this party is very good. The result for the first year was amazing, and we're really happy with the crowd they brought in. And for Fridays were also really, really good. I think we're also a new concept, bringing live shows on our big stage in the terrace, maybe following the trend that other people like I Beat the Rocks started many years ago. And this allowed us also to bring like a new... a new type of crowd and work on a new niche. Tell us a little bit more about the challenges for Friday night and some of the major successes you had on that party. Well, I think that one of the major successes of that party was bringing... big, big talent to Ibiza for the first time. Like, for example, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, Primal Scream. I think that those nights were really epic in Ibiza and all that were in that night will remember the show forever, I think. were like really, really those nights that you will for always remember. And this is something special besides the numbers, which were also really good. Obviously, there were some weak nights, like in all parties. But I think in terms of brand for us and brand values for us, it was really good to have MTV as a partner. It gave us a big exposure worldwide. I think we brought something new that was not competitor of Thursday night or the Saturday night, which is really important because, you know, we are open seven days a week and obviously fitting a new party. It's sometimes something tricky because you have to take care of all the promoters that are already working with you for a long time. You have to make a party successful, but you don't, you cannot take people from other nights and fight with other, other. promoters that are already working well. So I think with MTV we achieved this, we had new talent, we had a new type of party and we did pretty good. One of the other features of the night is that as well as the live band in the terrace there was also kind of a normal night if you like in the main room. How did you balance and plan that? Well, this was a big challenge in the beginning because obviously we had the big talent on the terrace, which we knew was going to be full. like for example 50 Cent or Primals but obviously the mine room is still quite big and we didn't know what type of sound we should bring in and definitely finally we thought that bringing electronic music to the mine room on a Friday night would be a good idea because you don't have any good offer if you like electronic music on the weekend. So for those that come to Ibiza just for the weekend, we thought this was going to be a good idea. And we tried to make quite an underground program and bringing new names like Audiofly or Mandy. And I don't know, these type of artists are not really like the... biggest talent but a really good artist and bring really good music to the club. Let's talk a little bit more about the rest of the week at Amnesia. I mean, there are some really huge nights such as Cocoon and Cream. Cream, obviously, the more commercial end of things. Tell us a little bit more about Cocoon this year. Well, I think that Cocoon came back really, really strong this year. They have always been good. Obviously, they have been increasing the numbers for the last 10 years. But I think that this year they brought something fresh with a new campaign, Cocoon Heroes. They did something like a really, really creative campaign, in my opinion. And they also brought new names on the program, like Seth Truxler or Nina Kravitz or Maedric, for example, in the closing party. And I think they came back to be the best party on the island again. After maybe suffering a bit last year during the first parties, even they have always been doing very, very good. But I think they are now stronger than ever, in my opinion. I mean, the type of music that they have playing at their parties most regularly, that's become the big, successful, popular trend in Ibiza. And for the closing party, again, it was kind of the similar type of sound. it's difficult to put into words what the closing party is like can you can you try and do that oh craziness it's wild crazy and one of the best parties you can ever go to I think the closing party especially because obviously we have some flexibility when it comes to the time to the time hours we can open and also it's very special because everyone is about to leave the island everyone is already relaxed you know people is not more busy like in the middle of the season maybe everyone is a bit stressed But on that night everything is done, everyone wants to smile and to enjoy for one night. And this makes the atmosphere and the vibe really, really special. I think we became one of the biggest closing parties on the island in the last years. And this has been a really good improvement. from our side and I think that thanks to the good program first of all the good DJs that are with us every year like Richie, Logo Dice, Marco and the likes and I think for those that haven't been here they shouldn't miss the next one definitely because it's something everybody will talk about during the year you've mentioned a couple of times the word brand and I know that's one of the things that you're really closely involved with. A few years ago, that didn't exist here at Amnesia, really. Or at least not officially. What does that mean to you? And where are you trying to take this? And where is Amnesia as a brand now? Well, Amnesia has been a huge brand for the last years. It's not like I have brought Amnesia where it is right now. Obviously not. Amnesia is one of the biggest brands in the music industry. But it's true that we had to develop it to the next level. I mean, it's a worldwide brand. Everyone from South America to Asia knows what Amnesia is and what Ibiza is in general. And there were many things to improve. And I think we have done pretty good this year with the new magazine, with the new website, with the new iPhone app, with different little things here and there, you know, that just make the experience of our customers better with the club, the engagement with our customers. And obviously that gives us a bit more of exposure. quality maybe if you want to name it like this. I'm going to put you on the spot. I know one of the things that everyone always talks about when they think about Ibiza and clubbing is the price of drinks in Ibiza. How can you try and justify the cost of a rep? in amnesia or the cost of a drink in amnesia? Well, this is a tricky question, actually, and it's one of the questions we usually get from our customers or from people close to our team, you know, but I think that once you work in Amnesia and in a club you understand better the level of costs that a club like this has. I think that every night we throw parties that are more or less like a festival with 6,000 people. and we need a huge structure to sustain all this. When you come here at 10 o'clock in the morning and you see 20, 30 people changing all the dressing in the room, and then you see all the level of talent that is coming to the club, is playing every night. You see the radio studio that we have in the club and all the people working around the radio which has an amazing audience all over the world. All the little things, like for example also the magazine which was launched this year and has also a full... time, team, working just for that, you know. And this makes obviously that we have to increase the prices of our last, of the final product. And I think that also the cost of living in Ibiza, of the life in Ibiza is very high. The salaries are very good, very high. and this also has a final impact on the prices. What else happened in 2011 in Ibiza then that was interesting for you? Musically, I think that seeing hip-hop artists like Usher in Pasha or Ushuaia. Snoop Dogg or 50 Cent here, Amnesia. This was really, really impressive in my opinion. To see how those guys have pulled tickets and have filled the clubs has been really surprising from one side and interesting from another. I think musically was one of the most important things I've seen this year. Also the new dubstep artists that have played for example on Tuesday night here at Amnesia, also in other clubs, have been doing really really good. Do you think there's a real market for Dubstep in Ibiza? Yeah, it seems so. I mean, from our experience last year, I think it's definitely a market here for Dubstep. Chase and Status had the club really, really packed, you know, and other artists did very good as well. not only with us, I think also with other clubs. So I think definitely Dubstep is a sound that is coming really strong into Ibiza. Which of the parties did you make it to this year that impressed you? You mean outside of Amnesia? Outside of Amnesia, yeah. Well, I have to say that I like really, really a lot Ibiza Rocks. I've been a few times in Ibiza Rocks and I really like the concept. and the program they have. Especially like the life of Chasing Statues there. So dubstep is definitely a sound that is doing pretty good here. And to be honest... I haven't been that much around. I think that Matheoplex was one of the DJs that I really liked. I heard him once at DC10 and I really like his sound. And I don't want to say Seth Stroxler because I guess it's one of the names that everyone is going to say, so everyone knows already about Seth Stroxler. And besides those names, I couldn't say any special name. Let's talk a little bit about Amnesia 2012. What kind of plans have you got for next year? Well, for next year, we are going to keep more or less the same. We are really happy with the promoters we have. Everyone did pretty good. And we just have to improve in those areas where we have to improve. From my point of view and from the marketing area, we are developing different tools and applications for mobile devices and different online tools also that are going to be good for the customers and are going to make their experience better at the club. and nothing really big for next year. - Okay, and finally, can you summarize how the season was in general in Ibiza this year? - I think it was really good for everyone. Everyone is talking that it was like much better than last year and everyone seems to be really happy, which is great. I mean, we are living on a paradise, you know? Everyone is talking about crisis. In Spain they have 22% unemployment rate and we are saying that it was the best season ever. So nothing to complain about. We are really lucky people, you know.
