You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour! This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour, RA's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. I'm Martha, producer of The Hour, here to guide you through this month's episode. On the show this month, Zakia Sewell meets members of J-Flag, a human rights and social justice organization that supports Jamaica's LGBT community to discuss their relationship to the country's dancehall scene. One of the things that I love about queer dancehall spaces is how absolutely revolutionary they are. It's revolutionary to see a male body and a male-identified body twerk. and wine it destroys these notions of gender that dance are heavily constructs in its own curious way, but then allows for people to do whatever they want with it. And Carlos Hawthorne reports from Dusseldorf at the closing party for the influential music venue Salon des Amateurs, an incubator for DJs and artists like Vladimir Ivkovic, Toulouse Low Tracks and Lena Willikens. I'm Lena Willikens and I was born at Salon des Amateurs as a DJ. The name... says it all. It was a place where there was no The temptation that you have to be a DJ in order to play records there, that gave me as a total beginner, gave me the freedom to organize parties there. First to Berlin, where we captured a conversation between Japanese percussionist and composer Midori Takada and Parisian musician La Fonda, who recently collaborated on their project "La Reine Bleue". Hi Midori-san. Hi Yasmin. Welcome to Berlin. Thank you. We have seen each other since the record one time very quickly, but it's kind of the first time we actually have time since the record. How was it for you to work on this together? The recorded work that I know from you, you didn't work with vocalists. I put the melody line, your part. I played by piano. But you didn't notice. That's your part. I know. There was like this massive misunderstanding. No, no, no. I received a file from you with two different... versions of the song one had a beautiful melody with the pianica and another one was without that line and so I was listening to both of course the one with the melody was so beautiful but I didn't understand that it was in fact the part that you wanted me to sing I thought okay the part with the pianica doesn't have any room for me to sing so I started singing on the other version the empty version and then I got to Japan and I played you the song and you said okay that's really good but what about the thing that you're supposed to be right singing and I was like oh so then it became I think that it's I really enjoyed the process of working together because also it came of an accident no you had scripted everything and then at the end it was a happy accident because I did something yes it's a very miracle it's kind of a miracle like I created a song and then you were like, okay, that's good, but let's add my part and then the way that your part and my part... married to each other was kind of like a miracle because they kind of became call and response but you didn't decide that and I didn't decide that it just happened I'm sorry I didn't know your name in Japan So I didn't have any information about you. I get your promotion video. I didn't know your range of voice. Everything. Was a mystery. She's very mysterious. I wrote, composed your melody line. That line is a very important melody for me. So many years I tried. to put in the percussion ensemble. Really? I didn't know that. Or I played by myself and played with Avery Graney, percussionist of England. Of course. Oh my God, I'm obsessed with her. She's amazing. She's deaf, no? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, she's amazing. So we played together. Yes, it's beautiful. It wasn't. my image a little bit. I need voice, not instruments. Then I wrote melody for you, but you add more rich improvisation on it. Yeah, I mean, I wrote the song, yeah. That the melody lines are increasing, increasing. First of all, I was really nervous because I didn't know it was supposed to be my line. I didn't work on it. And it's quite complex, for me at least. It felt, you remember it, it was quite counterintuitive for me. The rhythm of the... Shrek itself is quite complex, the time signature. Every time you think that you get a groove, it takes out the carpet, you know, underneath your feet. As soon as I would start getting comfortable rhythmically, like, ah, okay, I understand, I would get proven that I didn't understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's an African structure I used. From where? From our Ewe tribe. They live around Ghana or a very small culture. Music is very, very deep, especially rhythm construction is very, very, very amazing and complicated. But it's interesting because the nature of the melody, the affect of the melody is so romantic. It's so like French 19th century or beginning of the century. It's like sati. It's not African. It's not African at all. My feeling. Yeah, my feeling too, for sure. But the way that it sits within the percussion is not Western. Rhythmically, it's not Western. The effect of it is very... But melody is very, like, mid-century. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, for sure. When you were like, okay, so now you're going to sing this part. and I was like okay and I was really nervous because I was like ah it's so complicated You know, I loved it, but it's one thing to love something and to perform it was something else. But I feel like the way that I engage with vocals in general in my music is such a personal process for me. I write my lyrics alone, I write my melody alone. And it was such a pleasurable experience for me to be the interpreter. of your melody. I've never sang someone else's melody in my life. Never. Usually I try things, then I go back, I record, then I listen, and then I structure. You know, I'm really terrified of improvising. I'm really scared. I think it's one of the scariest things. I don't feel that. kind of freedom yet and I think that also in a way I think that studying classical music me too it really damages it's really damaging you too I'm damaged from it for sure For sure. Yeah. It's a difference because you recorded the first one as you like. Yes. After that. Yes. It's the way you like. So maybe it was hard for you. I mean, it was. It was hard because, again, the thing that you wrote was counterintuitive to me, but it was very pleasurable because I really enjoyed being directed. That's not improvisation. You wrote a score and you made me sing it. conducting experience to have you be in the room with me and conducting my voice physically leading me and yeah wow yeah god yeah conduct yeah I've never had that experience vocally because you know I played the flute did I tell you that I played classical music for maybe 12 years yeah yeah yeah I didn't really enjoy that I know that you also started with classical music, no? Yes. And you didn't enjoy it either. I had a debut concert. And you were playing percussion since the beginning. Yes, a percussion concert with the orchestra. But suddenly I changed. You changed. What made you not pursue that style? I met African music and minimal music. When I layer things, which I do a lot, it has to do with when I write music, I feel bigger than what I can contain. In a way, layering for me is kind of like a way to... create space inside of me or make make myself bigger more spacious because the the relationship that i have with music is not a first person relationship it's not um you know kind of like a diary about my feelings or my emotions or my love story or whatever that is I don't really write like this as a first person experience. I think that the way that I like to make music is when I use the first person, when I use eye, it's always bigger than me and it's always, it starts from inside but it's also many eyes. The layering in a way I think it helps me to express that the point of view is not the point of view of one person. Different character. Yeah. I feel that I carry the voice of many. Thanks to Midori and Lafonda for bringing us into their conversation. They'll perform together at the Barbican Centre on the 7th of April. Carlos Hawthorne spent some time in Dusseldorf late last year to witness the three-day closing party of Salon des Amateurs, a nightclub which has been forced to close in order to repair some serious water damage. You're listening to The Hour with resident... Dusseldorf, a city famous for beer, craftwork and its bustling art scene. Tucked away in a corner of Kunsthalle, one of the city's main galleries, is Salon des Amateurs, a former café-turned-nightclub that today ranks among Europe's best. Opened in 2004, it's known for its daring anything-goes music policy. Most nights swing freely through tempos, moods and genres. At Salon, weird records are given pride of place. This free-spirited The curated ethos has nurtured a number of artists over the years, among them globetrotting stars like Lena Villikens, Vladimir Ivkovic and Jan Schulter. These three, plus a dozen or so others, returned to Salon in November to perform at the club's three-day closing party. The closure wasn't permanent. Salon is old and following some severe water damage in January 2017, in bad need of a refurb. But even so, the blowout suggested there was more to the situation and met the eye. On Saturday, November 3rd, I took a train from Berlin to Dusseldorf, arriving in the city of Leipzig. at Salon just before doors opened for the second time that weekend. Over the course of the night, in between spells on the heaving dance floor, I pulled several of the club's key players to one side in an attempt to find out more about the story behind the closure. In the next 20 minutes, you'll hear the voices of resident DJ Arne Bunjes, aka Rearview Radio, co-founder Detlef Weinrich, aka Toulouse Low Tracks, Jan Schulter, Lena Willikens and Ralph Brengans, a long-time regular and owner of the local record store Hitsville. And there's already a queue at like 9:30. Here's Arne Bunjes who runs the Theme for Great Cities label and has been a resident at Salon for around 10 years. After trying and failing to find a quiet spot inside the club, we settled on the terrace outside. A few feet away, a large queue was already forming, though doors wouldn't open for another 10 or 15 minutes. This weekend is like the last weekend the salon is open until further notice, because there has some reparation to be done and this will at least... like half a year or like maybe even July. There was water damage early last year, is that correct? Yeah, yeah. So I guess this is related to what happened then. They put everything dry in the last months and they somehow managed to keep it open while doing that. But now they have some agreement with the city of Dusseldorf, which... owns the place to do like proper reparations. And like a big point is also like the city of Düsseldorf or the museum wants a café back. The state the salon is in right now doesn't fit expectations on a museum cafe. Okay, interesting. So they want it to be a cafe during the day, but they're still going to allow a salon to happen at night? On weekends, we function as a club and doing more cultural things under the week, like in the evenings. How do you think that will affect Salon? I don't know for sure, but maybe it will go... back to just be open up to maybe four or something like that. Detlef Toulouse-Lautrec put it in a recent interview, to get a little bit of hysteric, those super long nights, back to a little bit more unhysteric. Okay, so you think it might kind of... Yeah, just kind of limit the extent to which parties can open. Okay, so it might kind of lose a little magic or something. Yeah, no, no, no. I wouldn't say that. Maybe heighten up the quality again or be like maybe a little bit more mature. Well, you mentioned there was a night last night, there was an older crowd, but more recently a younger crowd has started coming to Salon. Yeah, like in the last two years or like three years. Yeah, you could recognize that with more younger residents start to throw parties or becoming residents because they're being... doing regular evenings. Also the crowd got younger and discovered the place for themselves. And that's important for the music and to keep the crowd fresh and to keep the place. Yeah, totally, totally. And I mean, are there any other places in Dusseldorf to hear music like this? There is one other club, but it's more like focusing on techno. And the music policy here is kind of as eclectic and wild as ever. Yeah, there's no one telling you what to play or what not. Totally not. The younger guys, the Fader boys, Aki and Rasputin, they came to the club as guests and they saw what could be done and they are like super all like music enthusiasts and they all wanted the difference to like just being a house club or what. Yeah, sure. So, your set tonight, what time does it start? My set is starting at 1. Okay, so what are you anticipating in terms of where you're going to start? What are you anticipating the mood being around 1? Tonight will be like super crowded instantly. We're talking right now, there's already a queue. Yeah, I guess lots of people are coming here this weekend because they won't have a chance to come for another few months. Yeah. We have your radio. Welcome. Salon is different from other clubs, both musically and otherwise. For the first 20 minutes on Saturday, as people in winter coats poured through the door, a friendly dog surveyed the scene from a spot on the couch. Later, a man sat sketching with a pencil and pad. At one point, I heard someone say to a guy collecting empty glasses, don't work. too hard. Within a couple of hours, the place was packed with people of all ages. Those who couldn't find a spot on the dance floor stood on the windowsill or on benches along the walls. Jackets lay stuffed behind couches. The atmosphere was heady and sweaty, powered by a soundtrack that was constantly morphing, from jangly guitar music and 80s hip-hop to oddball chuggers and Italo disco. My favourite set was by Philip Johndoe, who lent hard on bassy sounds like reggaeton and instrumental grime. When I finally left the club, at around 4.30am, people were still queuing to get in. You're about to hear the voice of long-time regular and local record store owner Ralph Brengans, who I stumbled across on the night completely by accident. I initially tapped him on the shoulder thinking he was Detlef Feinrich, but then we got chatting. So how regularly have you been coming to Ceylon over the past 10 years? Two or three times a month. Wow, okay, really regularly. Yeah, so, yeah. What does it mean to you, this place? It's an open place, you can do what you want. meet friends here and yeah it's a bit of a family here. So obviously the club is closing or the venue is closing for a period how do you feel about that? I feel sad but there's not a change everything is broken there and it's the toilets so we need a break after a break maybe it's a good start again. Yeah what will you do for the next five or six months without Salon? I don't know. I hope I will be surprised. Will you still be coming here for the next 10 years, you think? I don't know. Maybe. Maybe we'll meet up again in six months. We hope the best. When I found the real Detlef Weinrich, he was sneaking through the crowd on the way for a cigarette. He wasn't playing until Sunday night, but he decided to come down for moral support. Yes, I'm Detlef Weinrich, so also to lose low tracks. And I was starting to... I played with two other guys, Aaron Mithion and Stefano Brivio in 2004, so I'm one of the owners and members of the salon. I mean, this weekend is really based on more the residents from Dusseldorf, you know. I mean it's really hard to stop because of course there's so many other people you could invite, all the people from Amsterdam like Taco and it's endless you know but you have to make a kind of decision so and I gave it up to be honest to Arne from Dreams for Great Cities to make the organization because I'm in a way also too busy and maybe also maybe a bit too close to the Salon, emotional wise? Sure. So, yeah, this is obviously a closing party. I mean, why is it having to close? So many years the place is in a kind of a bad condition and especially the city which is, of course, they're complaining, you know. What changed with the local government and the attitude towards Salon? People are afraid about energies, you know. They like to talk about energies and then it comes to the museum. If it's like history, which people can... handle it as a, okay, this is a thing like we can make a kind of advertising, talking about the city and the history of the city, like Ratingehofen and everything. But if it's happening, people are afraid, you know. If it's dead and we can put it in the museum, people are really ready for it. And of course, this is ridiculous, but it's happening very often. What renovations exactly are you doing to the space? Everything. Everything? Yeah. I mean, it's a basic, well, everything the same, but it's a new bar, just a new floor and new toilets. Okay, everything. And is that related to the water damage from last year? I mean, the water damage is actually the whole house. I mean, they didn't... realize that it was really a problem of the whole house. How did it happen? People want to make things cheap, you know. You have to pay it sooner or later. Does this closing party feel like a kind of end of a specific kind of era for Salon? Yeah, maybe, maybe not. I have no idea. I mean, this is about being patient. You have to wait sometimes and it's coming again, kind of energies. Yeah, it's nice. You notice a real mixed crowd in there, like very young people and then 60-year-olds. Yeah, of course. That's nice. I mean, that's a perfect idea about a social place, you know. It's important to be relevant. I mean, that's the point. I was due to speak with Jan Schulte on Saturday, but after performing live as Wolf Muller, he said he felt completely overwhelmed. We caught up the next day instead, just as Salon was reopening for the third and final night. My name is Jan Schulte. I am a resident DJ at the Salon des Mateurs since 2008. So this is also a 10-year celebration. This used to be my living room. I came four times a week when I had the chance. Wow, amazing. So you... when you were playing and when you were not playing? Yeah, of course. Since the moment I found out about this place, I came here as often as possible. Sometimes even alone to just hide myself behind the speakers, I would just end up listening all night and not being talked to. The first time I DJed was after two years I came here. I had so shaky fingers that I couldn't even light up a cigarette. Amazing. And it still feels special playing here. For me it was... really weird starting to travel as there's no space like this and everything I know I learned here so everywhere else I went to I was limiting myself in a different way not being as free as I was here at home of course. Yeah it sets the bar very high. Yeah that's it and that's interesting. It was interesting for me starting to travel finding out it's actually nowhere as free as here. Does the vibe kind of on a party like last night does it feel similar to where it was when you first started going here? No. Yesterday it was actually ending up by having shit tons of people that were here for the first time to come here at least one time and the first years it was still in this mix of being a bar that suddenly turned into a club without it being planned. So it could be like 25 people dancing or 200. For me and my friends it was just a total relief as I thought club music is boring at the time because every other party was minimal techno here in the area. And then this space was just super refreshing and always surprising. The club is obviously closing for a short period. Why is it closing? They found out that they have water below the floor and so the city owns the building. They also wanted to go back to the original state which was chessboard, carpet, floor and more cultural program. On the other side I experienced a time where it was more cultural program. It was totally different. It was more art students here. Actually it was full from Tuesday to Saturday and these days it's just yeah nobody's coming within the weeks anymore. I stopped doing the events I did within the weeks. I did like free jazz events or movies like we shot special films but yeah let's see how it works out with being more cultural again. as they just stopped it because nobody came anymore and this party scene overtook the place a bit. Okay, but generally you feel optimistic about the future? Of course! I come from this place and I will try to keep this alive and I was a second generation Salon DJ. We're the third generation now. Man, this is like, for me it's super fascinating to see that it's actually possible to still have people... following in the same momentum which is happening at the moment so that's going to keep on of course. Nice one Jan, appreciate it. Lena Willikens' flight was delayed on Sunday afternoon, which meant we missed each other in Dusseldorf. A week or so later, she recorded some thoughts on the closing on her phone and sent them over. I'm Lena Willikens and I was born at Salon des Amateurs as a DJ. That's the place where I started. DJing. In the very beginning I was a barkeeper and bouncer. Then I started to take more and more records with me while I was barkeeping and started to have a regular night organizing parties there and after that I was in charge for several years with the programming of the Friday nights. Detlef Toulouse-Lautrec was doing the bookings for the Saturday. In the very beginning, it never intended to be a nightclub. So it was a cafe, a bar, a place where friends would gather and listen to music. but not necessarily a nightclub. So the name Salon des Amateurs says it all. It was a place where there was no expectation that you have to be a DJ in order to play records there. That gave me, as a total beginner, gave me the freedom to organize parties there. In the early years of Salon, it could easily happen that Aaron Metzion, one of the founders with Dead Left Together, one of the founders of Salon, He would just come with a bunch of his Sandra records and play jazz, free jazz, on a Saturday night for all night long. So this was kind of normal and no one questioned it. In the beginning there was never the intention to have a good running business. I think this is quite important. It was more the luxury that we had a place where we could just hang and have a good time. The salon has to close because of water damage and no one can really tell how big, how severe that damage is. So they have to remove walls, they will remove the floor and then after starting removing the floor they will see how severe the damage is. How the lawn is located is also very important, it plays an important role. It's located in a museum, Kunsthalle and Kunstverein. The building itself is owned by the city, which makes it now not really easy for Salon des Amateurs to deal with all the renovation stuff and everything. way more bureaucracy. That's why it also took so long from the moment we figured that there was this water damage till the action that it finally happens that the renovation is starting. It was for us a big relief when we knew, okay, finally now they will fix it. It took so long because so many people had different opinions on what to do now. And now it's kind of clear, okay, it will be closed for a while. They will tear down some walls. They will open the entire... floor then they can tell how severe the damage is. That's why we also have no clue when Zalon will open again but the concept of Zalon itself we will see how it will change. It will change for sure. For the landlord, which is the Kunsthalle, the museum, it's really important to have a cafe in the house. And this was a deal from the beginning. Zalon can do whatever, but it has to be also a café where the staff from the museum can go, have meetings, can drink coffee and so on. Now it might be that the concert, when Zalon reopens, will focus more on that and less on the nightclub action. So we will just figure out, but we all don't know. We just hope that we still will be able to have magic nights at Salon. But no one can say. So let's keep fingers crossed and we will see what happens next. Bye. As you can tell, no one is too concerned for the future of Salon. Like most long-running venues, it's undergone numerous changes over the years. What started out as a cafe and hangout for local art school kids is now a revered nightclub with fans all over the world. In whatever form it reopens, it will remain just as dedicated to weird and excellent music of all varieties. Plus, with plans to start running a wider cultural programme, it may evolve into a hub for other art forms. However frustrating some of the council's views are, adapting to change comes with the territory. It may be the end of a near-exhalon, but it's also the start of a new one. Despite the huge risks in being visibly queer in Jamaica, a vibrant and growing LGBT community were able to hold Pride celebrations last year. J-Flag is an organization supporting the community. Zakiya Sewell went out to meet some of their members. Jamaica is an island rich with musical cultures, but it's always been a place of extremes. Extreme beauty, extreme violence, extreme creativity and extreme prejudice, especially when it comes to the LGBTQ community. The small island was once named the most homophobic place on earth. And while there have been some improvements over the years, homophobia still infiltrates Jamaican politics, religion, social life and music, most notoriously in the country's most beloved genre, dancehall. Dancehall's been under scrutiny in recent years for its intensely homophobic lyrics, which often incite violence against the LGBTQ community. But there's a growing number of young, queer Jamaican activists who refuse to turn their backs on dancehall. Instead, they're reclaiming it for their own purposes, creating safe spaces for their community to express themselves to this music, which, despite its problems, is an important marker of their Jamaican-ness. This year, a well-known dancehall artist, De Angel, did the headline performance at Jamaican Pride, a major landmark of increasing acceptance. I caught up with Javion Nelson, Glenroy Murray and Suelle Anglin from JFLAG, a Jamaican pro-LGBTQ human rights organisation who are spearheading this movement. I'm Javion Nelson, the Executive Director at J-Flag. I'm Glenroy Murray, the Advisor to J-Flag. And I'm Sue-El Anglin, Associate Director of Marketing, Communications and Engagement. Could you just sort of start off by telling me a little bit about what J-Flag does as an organisation? So J-Flag is a human rights and social justice organisation which advocates for the rights of people with disabilities. the livelihood and well-being of LGBT people. And we've been operating since December 1998 when we were launched. So this year we celebrate 20 wonderful years of advocacy and activism in Jamaica for the LGBT community. And we organize our work around five key areas around public tolerance, providing services to the LGBT community, organization sustainability, policy and legal reform, and community engagement and mobilization. Could you set the scene for me a little bit and just describe what it feels, what the experience is of the LGBTQ community in Jamaica in 2018? In 2018, the experiences are nuanced and diverse. I start by acknowledging that there's still a lot of problems that the community faces. We still get reports of... violence, harassment, and discrimination in Jamaica. But a lot of those experiences are complicated by issues related to class, as well as socioeconomic background and access to education. So people, they're more educated. you are and the more well-off you are per se is the less likely you are to have certain experiences of um homophobia and that doesn't say that if you're rich or if you're upper class you don't experience homophobia it's just that the ways in which you experience it are different and more subtle and more institutionalized but at the same time in 2018 there are many spaces for people to be them be their true selves and be able to have you know safe spaces and to interact and there are different levels of tolerance and acceptance in different spaces in Jamaica. I know that in London at the moment there's a real kind of burst of LGBTQ people of color who are creating spaces where they can dance and you know listen to music and celebrate and come together and that has been a really kind of important phenomenon that's been happening the last few years do you have similar occurrences in whereabouts are you based we we're based in Kingston yes we have a thriving LGBT community in Kingston especially so there are lots of events on a regular basis on weekends you sometimes have two or three events that are happening of which dancehall music is a key feature and we have like our pride celebrations each year and lots of other events organized by J-Flag other LGBT organizations that provide spaces for people to come together to fellowship to meet each other and to just have some fun in different ways. And what kind of music you touched on dancehall but what kind of music will be played at those sorts of in those spaces? When we play dancehall, there is a lot of soca music. We love soca music. But you'll get a mixture of mostly dancehall and soca with a little bit of hip-hop and pop. But in a lot of these spaces, what you'll hear, it goes from soca music to dancehall. I know that sometimes when people talk about dancehall, they seem to fixate on the homophobia. there's no doubt it's there in a lot of the lyrics so How do you negotiate that with the work that you're doing at JFLAG? And, you know, what is a kind of very anti-LGBTQ sentiment expressed in the music? The work at JFLAG actually is about acknowledging that as LGBT Jamaicans, we're Jamaicans and we have uniquely Jamaican experiences. And it's about demonstrating to the wider public that nexus of queerness and Jamaican-ness. And dancehall is a raw representation of Jamaican realities, norms, and values. And for us... It's looking at the reality of how queer Jamaicans more or less enjoy dancehall, coalesce around dancehall, and fellowship around dancehall. And so for us, it's acknowledging the problems within dancehall in the way we communicate and talk about the issues, but not treating dancehall as if it's a monolithic genre. and acknowledging the differences and nuances in dancehall and that saying one thing doesn't necessarily mean that this is what an artist truly believes and understand that dance hall is a performative space and it performs strong views and sometimes aggressive views about Jamaican culture but it doesn't mean therefore that Jamaican culture is fixed in time. And I think, I mean, it's art so you create your own interpretations of it and I always like to look back at a chapter in one of my friend's theses that he wrote about the gay party scene in Jamaica and it was one of his first ever parties in Jamaica and he described how shocked he was when he stepped into the space and heard some of the same songs that he was taught not to like, not to appreciate, not to listen to and just how queer bodies were gyrating to that kind of music and how people were using it to also sort of protest back. some of the things that people were saying about LGBT people and for him that was a real profound experience and he began to fall back in love again with his country. I remember I had a conversation with a group of female promoters, I ask the same question, you know, how do they enjoy the different spaces with, you know, a lot of these lyrics that are homophobic. One of the things that they pointed out to me was that when we're in these spaces, we listen to this music and we use it to almost to mock these artists and say, you know, oh, you're trying in a way to make us feel, you know, like bad or you're making us feel, you know, ashamed of who. we are but we're using this to let you know that it's not affecting us and we're going to come into the space and when you you play it um in a way as to hurt us we're going to let you know that we're not hurt by it we're just going to dance along we're going to enjoy ourselves and we're going to leave the space and then we go back home to our girlfriends or you know to our boyfriends and that is it So I guess it's very important to acknowledge, just like Glenoy said, about the performance of dancehall. And so you go into a space and you perform what is required. But then when you leave that space, that performance is done and you go back to your lives and you move on. I think one of the things that I love about queer dancehall spaces is how absolutely revolutionary they are. It's revolutionary to see a male body and a male-identified body twerk and whine one minute and then the next minute Jenna bounce to popular dance songs and lebe lebe and do all of those dance moves. And it destroys these notions of gender that... dancehall heavily constructs in its own curious way but then allows for people to do whatever they want with it and so i think that's revolutionary and that's been my best takeaway just seeing how in many ways it liberates queer people from strictures of gender that it itself creates and perpetuates it sounds incredibly empowering there's a difference to like sort of listening to this music and just absorbing negative messages and internalizing them and then to actually take hold of that and to make it your own I think is incredibly brave and powerful. Are there any particular artists that you can rely on not to have those sorts of messages, homophobic messages in their work or is it a case of whether they do or whether they don't we're going to listen to it and enjoy it regardless? I don't think we can say that we can rely on them not to. I think there are a lot of dancehall artists that tend to... not go in that direction. And so if you look at a lot of the female or maybe like in that direction, you'll realize that their songs are not really done a part of, you know, singing about homophobia, but it's about, you know, maybe just like it looks and, you know, like being sexy and that sort of thing. And I also think that just the ways in which homophobia is being performed in dancehall has changed a lot. So if you look at the lyrics of dancehall songs, maybe like the 90s, early 2000s versus now, it is still there, but it's a lot more softened or in, I'm trying to find the word. to say it's not, yes, right. So it's no longer very explicit and raw and in your face, but it's more in very subtle ways that you have to know about the language and understand the context and the culture to really understand that that's what they're saying. So it is still there, but I think it's very important to give credit to the ways in which they're doing it now, so it's not so much... in your face and out there, but because of the performanceness that you have to do in dancehall, you know, to be taken seriously as a dancehall artist, that has to be there. So I think we must acknowledge the ways in which they're trying to navigate these kind of ways as well. But I don't think we can say we rely on... any artists in particular, but I think they are trying in their own ways to kind of navigate the spaces different. I think dance, I'm just, I tell you, dance all grows with Jamaica. And I think as a result of that, you see that softening. that Suel talks about, of a move away from hardcore, sometimes excessively violent homophobia to what I consider now a more heteronormative approach to dance, where you're just talking as if there are only heterosexual people in the dance, which is a significant shift. I'm not saying that there aren't species of homophobia, there are. And for you to boss in the dance hall, there are certain things you have to do. You have to have enough girl. You have to declare that you're not a fish. And you have to say you're a bad man. And if you're a woman, you have to say you're not a good man. You have to say you're not a good man. But once you've established that. and I've gotten enough support from a hardcore dancehall base, you can, you know, jump off into many different spaces. So understanding that the artists have to do this and then understanding that as Jamaica's culture moves forward, we can talk about things in new and different ways, and dancehall will be at the forefront. talking about those things and I think also what is important is to as our culture goes beyond you know just the little borders of Jamaica and you're realizing that a lot of these artists are now going into different parts of Europe and you know all over the world I think what they're also realizing is that their fan base is now growing. And so they also, like I said, their only way is to be mindful of the messages that they're sending out. So even if they're not saying, you know, yes, you know, we love whatever, you'll find that they'll tend to answer certain questions in a very politically correct way. I know like from time to time, you know, they'll put up, you know, like little messages like, you know, I love all my fans. I know I respect all my fans sort of messaging. So I think that is also important for us to acknowledge when we talk about the two spaces. Could you tell me a little bit about Pride this year? So you had a dance all over. artist, Dangel, is that her name? Doesn't sound quite right in an English accent. Dangel. So very, I think maybe like a week before Pride, I was having a conversation with JV and I said... what if we were to go out there and ask a couple of artists to come to Pride? I wonder what the reception would be like. And I remember I was just there in the office and I said, you know what, let me just try because the most I can say is no. And so I was there sending out emails to as many people as I could. And we got a lot of responses very quickly, which was very surprising for me. A lot of people were saying, you know, this is something that's very interesting to us, but, you know, it's very late now and it's very close. And, you know, we're already booked out for this time. You know, this artist is not available. But we got a response from the Angels management and Jada Kingdom's management that, you know, yes, we're interested in something like this. And I was very sure to say, you know, this is pride. in case you don't know what Pride is. You know, it's a space with LGBT people and all that. And they were very excited. They were like, yes, you know, I'm totally on board. You know, if you want me to do any sort of videos to promote Pride, let me know which they did. So it all happened very quickly. I didn't think I even processed what was happening until I think at the event when I saw her. you know, on stage and she came and people were just so like, oh my God, D'Angelo is so excited. And, you know, she was in the crowd with them and she was talking and, you know, people on the stage just getting on board. She was just there with the flags and she was waving and she was like, I love my fans, I'm loving them, I know, can't make nobody turn off the door, living a life. And it was just like you saw on people's faces that they couldn't believe that this was happening one. And just to feel like I no longer had to separate my identity so I didn't have to be straight acting here in a dancehall space. and I didn't have to be this over here, I could literally be in the middle, being my authentic self. And I think that was very important for them to experience. As Jamaicans, as young people growing up, that we love our dancehall, and we love the vibe scouting, and we love the dash out. And to be able to experience that in your home country, not overseas where the culture is different and the context is different. But to be able to get that on Jamaican soil, in your language, in your culture, in the rawness of who we are as Jamaicans, I think it was absolutely beautiful. Did you have any feedback from the artists about their experience and what they felt being there? Oh, yes. I spoke to Angel. I remember when she ended her performance, I know she was saying she was so happy that she did it. You know, she was a bit, you know, like afraid at first. And she was saying she was so happy that, you know, she went ahead and she stood her ground and said, yes, this is something that she's going to do because, you know, she knows she has a lot of fans. And she loves her fans and she wants them to know that she is here with them. I know she supports them. And she was there talking to, like, she was just there talking to people like, you know, she was just one of us, sort of thing. You know, she was taking photos and like a lot of people were just talking to her and saying, you know, I can't believe you're... pride and she was like yes and she was doing like some little videos for other people um i remember there was a couple of things from canada that was there i know she did a video with them and she was saying happy pride jamaica and you know i'm here and big up with a canada sort of thing but um The feedback that I got from both of them was that they were very happy to do it and they were open to doing something like this again if we ever wanted to engage them. So I guess you can look out next year who we'll have for Pride. But yeah, it was very exciting. And for people in the crowd, it's a kind of acceptance, isn't it? It's like, OK, right, they're here and they accept us. And that must be a kind of incredible feeling. a couple of them on stage to dance. She called up her chica and I think that was the moment for me that I said, oh my gosh. She was doing it right because I think any dance hall artist could have just, if an artist were to come, could have just come and done a very basic performance of just doing your song, have the crowd cheer and leave. She decidedly tailored her messaging to say, You know, people were saying this, but I love you guys. Live your life. You know, money come full. You know, the kind of narratives that we as Jamaicans will love. And she saw someone in the crowd and said, you come here. And she called her up and there was a blast. And then other people just kind of fed off of that energy. And she went on the stage and then she came down and interacted with the crowd. I mean, it was just so beautiful. I love seeing when we don't have to prod people to do great things. And we didn't have to prod her at all. And I think it just demonstrated the untapped. possibility of the dancehall space to be more for the community and to acknowledge that the community the LGBT community is a space where dancehall thrives I think I mean I wasn't there because I had something else but I was watching online and I cried because it was really so phenomenal and touching. And as Sewell was talking just now, I remembered how the process of selection of the people who would actually message came about and why Angel was one of the people we talked about. And we were talking about her, you know, her song, and so, and all that kind of thing. And it was exactly as we said, it would play out. And I think that was really touching, you know, she bringing them up. And how the girls and guys and everybody just carried on when they heard all the songs and the crowd favorites. And it was, I think, really, really phenomenal. I think one of the things too is that, you know, she got some backlash online and she was very busy on her Instagram page, for example. Constantly responding to people, telling them that she's booked and busy and it's not because she doesn't have business. she's chosen to do this, it's that she really believes in equality and that she loves everyone, which I think was really, really good because she could have ignored those, she could have changed her mind, she could have just done what everybody else would have probably do. It's interesting because you kind of mentioned that as people working in human rights that you don't really have the conversation about music. that much but you know music is so integral to our sense of who we are and our identity and it might just seem a matter of choosing genres but as you said you know if you were to say all right you know we're gonna we're gonna listen to rock music we're gonna listen to some european music instead then you're almost kind of saying well we we let go of our jamaican-ness for the sake of our queerness and that's not a decision that you should have to make so It's incredibly important. I mean, are there other genres that kind of come? You mentioned soca. Are there the same issues with other genres or is it kind of specifically dancehall? Well, with soca, it's a much more liberating space because I think soca's themes tend to be around fun and joy, expression. and all of that. And so the queer community actually finds Soka as a great space for representation and visibility. And really, they flock to Soka spaces and they're usually very opening. And I have to say kudos to a lot of the promoters. They've really grown. Not that they were terrible at the start, but they've really grown in their acceptance. of the community and how they've, you know, provided space to the community. Because I've been, I went to a couple of Soka parties this year and trust me, sometimes I was like, where am I? You know, it was, it was amazing just to see how people are just able to be themselves. I think what's great about Soka is that it allows both, you know, the wider society to be, to recognize that they can share space with the LGBT community and it's fine. I remember one of the parties I was at, me and my friends, we were just dancing and whining and twerking, and a girl just came beside us and said, you're doing it great. Oh my gosh, I wish I could dance like you. And I see that a lot in those spaces, and I think it's so beautiful. see that possibility and soca does create that kind of space for a lot of people especially during the carnival season yeah we we had big freedom for pride in 2017 2017 um i know she he has a different flavor i think it's more like that bounce hip-hop sort of mixture. I remember when we first announced that Big Freedia was going to be at Pride, people were like, Big Freedia, Big Freedia, or is this like, is this another Big Freedia? Like, which one of Big Freedia is this? And we got a very good reception, not just from the LGBT community, but from just people in general, they were like, oh my God, like, Pride, you know, has grown this big where you're having a big artist, like, you know. a big free that I saw in a song with a Beyonce and a Drake to, you know, be at pride in Jamaica happening. And I remember when he came, um, and after he performed at the breakfast party, uh, he did a video and he was like, if I had known that the vibe and energy at Jamaica pride was. this amazing. I would have been coming to Jamaica from whenever. And so it's not really just about dance because there is homophobia in other genres of music. If you listen to hardcore hip-hop and rap, you will see it there. For me, I think it's about... Each year, as Pride goes, to kind of bring in different genres of music that people here in Jamaica enjoy and people who have left Jamaica for whatever reason in the diaspora to kind of bring everybody together and to kind of share that space where you can come and enjoy all the different genres of music that you love. So we would definitely love to have a big name in Soka come to Pride one year. And, you know, have that to kind of, like I said, have that space where we can all come and share our different identities and exist. And I think, I mean, just to add to that, when you talk about the diaspora, my strong view is that it creates a sort of healing for a lot of people who had to interact with dancehall in a way that they felt they couldn't. Queer dancehall spaces. provide us an opportunity to re-engage a lot of the music that we understood as being one way and that we could only receive them a particular way and being in that dancehall space allows us to work through a lot of that sometimes trauma that we have and negative experiences and learn to relive it in a different way that honestly you can only get in Jamaica you can only experience dancehall a particular way and I'm going to say in its most authentic way, in Jamaica. And it's very powerful to have somebody who may have had terrible experiences in Jamaica to be able to come back there in a dancehall space and renegotiate those experiences and develop a new appreciation for it. And I think that's one of the great things. about what queer dancehall spaces generally, but also Pride does for the diaspora. There are these queer spaces, queer raves in Jamaica, in Kingston. Could you describe some of them? Are there any specific ones? Where do they tend to be held? Are they in clubs? Are they more DIY? Just a sense of what that scene actually is. looks and feels like? It's varied so you'll have them happening in different spaces. I remember we were a part of our own Robin in the community and what our own Robin is it's like it's a group of people that come together and you know you have an event all of us go and support your event, my event all of us come to support my event and so we were in it as an organization. And I remember there was one in particular that was happening on Spanish Town Road. And if you know about Jamaica and Spanish Town Road, you know that that is a place that has nothing queer or nothing LGBT because that in itself is a very violent area. And they were having a road mobbing there. And I was like, you know, maybe this is not the one for me to go to. Unfortunately, you know, we won't be able to come to this one. And I remember when they sent me the videos on Spanish Town Road. And if you saw the community on Spanish Town Road, on their head tops, on the walls, on tabletops, and they were just carrying on. And I remember I sent it to Draven and I said, have you seen what is happening on Spanish Town Road? And I think that speaks a lot about the envelope that is being pushed in the community and about creating spaces not just in very urban areas, you know, like, you know, Kingston or maybe like a new Kingston that is, you know, that you can say maybe this is a safe uptown space, but about pushing the envelope and going into these inner city areas and creating spaces for the community to participate. and to be visible and to be able to live and, you know, negotiate your experiences there. And I think we have to give a lot, and I say it all the time, that a lot of the entertainment and I guess you can say like visibility in the community that has been happening maybe the last five years or so, we have to give it to, yeah, it's a group of ladies, a group of women that are really pushing the envelope. And when I tell you it's been... pushed it's been pushed um and so there are different places all over kingston in rural areas that they're really having these events um yeah so it happens all over and it takes all different shapes and forms you have some of them that is really just like street dance level where it's just out on the roadside and you know you just come dance and drink and the others that will be in a club setting, bar setting, where you come in and there's a space inside that you are. But it really is just happening everywhere and everywhere. I mean, you go to some of the parties and they're being held in very public spaces, and there's one space that people go and sometimes you see others who are... at the space for other reasons, leaving and passing through. And it really shows a beautiful coexistence of queer Jamaica and the rest of Jamaica and that it can actually happen and that there can be this peaceful coexistence and liberating space. And in a lot of ways, I think the party spaces have really contributed significantly to the movement because it radically transcends. transforms communities and occupies space in a very cool and interesting way, which I think as advocates we have to continue to pay attention to and recognise the utility of those spaces. In the UK we have a really strong Caribbean community, so my grandparents are from the Caribbean, lots and lots of people came over in the 60s. And so at the moment, it's sort of like the grandchildren of those Caribbean grandparents who were like... resisting against their conservative views of their parents and often homophobic views and as I mentioned you know there are a lot of these spaces coming up now places like Babes, Pussy Palace where queer people of colour are coming together and letting loose. I was wondering if there's much kind of dialogue between the scene in Jamaica and the sort of diaspora in the UK or elsewhere whether you've been to any of these nights or heard of them? And whether there's a kind of an opportunity for like collaboration and conversation across borders. Yeah, well, that's one of the things that we want to do is to begin to strengthen that relationship that we have with members of the Jamaican diaspora, particularly here in the UK, where we've not had that strong relationship. because we feel that through Pride, for example, people can come home and come home to celebrate with Pride and to revisit those spaces that they would have fallen out of love with or that they've never been able to experience. So, for example, last week we were in Manchester and we met with two people and they are of Caribbean heritage, but they've never been to Jamaica and really want to come to Jamaica and never realised that there is actually a Pride celebration and that they could actually come. for something like that to begin to experience what their grandparents or great-grandparents had and knew about and talk about and really experience it in a very queer way and I think as we go forward that's one of the things that we need to continue to do I mean we have Glenroy here for example who we'll have at different um spaces to continue to do that kind of engagement for us here so that we can build relationships and strengthen them and um you know, have all these wonderful spaces for people to really contribute to the movement, but also meet and experience Jamaica in a very different way.
