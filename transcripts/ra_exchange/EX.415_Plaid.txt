Bye. Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Plaid. School friends Ed Handley and Andy Turner were b-boys and graffiti artists long before they turned to electronic music. But since kicking off their careers as part of the Black Dog, production and composition has been their main pursuit for three decades. They've been Warped Star Awards since the label's early days and developed a strong penchant for collaboration along the way. One of their enduring partnerships is with the artist Felix Thorn, the man behind Felix's machines. an assemblage of self-playing instruments that Platt have been composing for since 2009. At Terraforma in Milan, Platt and Thorne performed the latest iteration of the project and met up with RA's Holly Dicker for a candid chat about their careers thus far. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net. and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Plaid is up next. It's the Saturday of Terraformer. It's 33 degrees outside. I'm with Plaid, who have been here since... Thursday, because they had to set up their Felix machines for 10 hours. It's a pleasure to play with the machines. And yeah, actually, it's so much more relaxed than a regular gig because we get sort of two days on site rather than the usual kind of flying in, doing the show and flying back the next day. So, yeah. especially here in Milan it's been incredible, the site is so beautiful. Can you talk a bit more about actually setting up this structure and kind of describe what it looks like? I guess it's a heavily customised drum kit and it's built out of all sorts of percussive instruments, various household items. There's some bathroom racks in there and just sort of candle holders and all sorts of stuff. yeah, I was just using whatever I had. Although the... The newer stuff has more design associated with it, so it's more of a built-out stock material. The machine structure itself is built specifically for our collaboration, and we've been working together on and off for about eight years now, the odd show, and the machines have sort of developed alongside our collaboration. kind of informed the way they sound. The structure that we saw yesterday, how old is that? Is that kind of a recent thing? Was that a new build? So the machines have existed for 11 years now and have slowly grown. And this specific configuration is built for our projection mapping system. And it means people can see it. from all angles. Andy, tell us about playing with the machines. Felix's machines is about 20 instruments, something like that. And we send them MIDI information, so we write pretty much as we always write. And all the clever stuff is done by Felix. And he translates our note information into sounds. So they're all struck instruments, pretty much, which we're fairly familiar with. And yeah, we just compose. systems and the MIDI information is converted into music. We were lucky enough to get a residency at the Attenborough Arts Centre for a week which was a really productive week for us. We developed the video mapping system which is a sort of max patch and we wrote new tracks and We had a previous residency in France for Infini Records in a place called Normandou, which was in a quarry. So we've had these two chances to go away, have the machines there, write with them. Because obviously writing for virtual machines is quite difficult. You're sort of imagining how it sounds and there's this latency thing. send a note it doesn't necessarily play immediately so all of these things you kind of need time with the machines and yeah the the last big one was this the Attenborough Art Centre in Brighton who were very generous with their time and microphones Yeah, take us back to when you first started working with them. You said it was difficult to imagine playing on them. Yeah, we saw them first at a festival called Faster Than Sound in Suffolk on Bentwater's airbase. I think when we first saw them, we thought we could work with this. This is sort of what we do made physical, you know, this idea of precision music and computer music. I think that's one of the exciting things about it. As I think Felix had talked about this idea of acoustic synthesis and this inversion or this circle where you take synthesis... That's engineering, right? Kind of, yeah. And it's an interesting idea. It doesn't necessarily mean much, really. But conceptually, it's sort of you are taking this very precise music out of the computer and making it physical. And then you've got all these errors introduced by just mechanics, things failing and things not quite working right and things degrading. So you've got this sort of entropy, which is, I guess, pervasive. part of real you know real musicians have that as they get older and as they make mistakes and things like that so we've got this easy way of working with musicians so speaking of real musicians do either of you play an instrument um i play uh brass a little bit um well i used to i don't particularly for what we do these days but I can still, flugelhorn, yeah, is my instrument. What drove you to play it first, pick it up? I mean, at school, right? Yeah, at the middle school I went to, there was quite a successful brass band. don't remember choosing the instrument particularly I think it was one of those things where you know there was probably one spare yeah did it choose you yes like the sorting hat the sorting the sorting flugelhorn um uh and uh yeah and so um yeah I was really lucky because um I got to travel a lot um when I was quite young um with it with this school band and uh the thing and ed you kind of went straight to drum machine and samplers right how did you get there we we both we both loved uh what what we used to call b-boying which was hip-hop early hip-hop culture so we we would mc and do graffiti and do all of the different aspects of early hip-hop it was very exciting you know the um mid 80s it was just kind of spreading worldwide and uh we were we were really into it we were do you have a graffiti name uh i stole my name off one of the new york city breakers um we all kind of just took our names from people we yeah yeah but you know awesome hey Yeah. Yeah. You know I was bad. Yeah, yeah. No, I know you were bad. Yeah, we did. We had, obviously, we had names. But we changed them occasionally because we got bored of them or we realized it was whack, you know, to have that particular name. But we got rid of them when we started making electronic music. Obviously, we don't refer to each other with these names anymore. Can you tell us the names? We can't remember. Well, yeah, Andy was also May, and then later... he was playboy for a little while? I was actually playboy to start with because I did, with the school band, I did a show in Venice and I bought like a playboy sort of headband because like headbands were a thing back then. And so I called myself Playboy because I had a Playboy headband. I really had never seen the magazine at that point. I was about 11. Yeah, Pladba. Yeah, Pladboy, yeah. No, and I stole my name from New York City Breakers. There was someone I really admired who was called Kid Nice. which is a ridiculous thing to take someone else's name for no reason. So no, there's no interesting story to that one. Plaid boy. That's pretty interesting. So you used to dance? You used to do breakdancing? Yes. What was your signature move? I was kind of quite good at sort of power moves. power moves so like windmills and couldn't really i could do kind of a couple of flares but not i wasn't before i collapsed but yeah and all the sort of floor work so yeah i mean windmills i suppose and then i just towards the sort of end of when we were into breaking this move called halos kind of came in where it's basically like a windmill but you you kind of don't use your arms You're laughing and it's actually very... No, I'm imagining it. No, and yeah, it's... I mean, actually, these days, it's fucking incredible. I still... follow what kids are doing now and it's unbelievable yeah there's still championships every year and and it is like sort of olympic level gymnastics you know you you see what the the national teams are doing and they're doing stuff that's not quite as difficult as some of these breaking moves which is yeah it's evolved like everything else like the cyclists have got faster the the breakers have just got incredible now but obviously there's no focus on that it's become a like a jazz scene you know it's it's it's this thing with its own folklore and an own but yeah we still sort of dip in obviously we can't do it so well anymore because uh When I'm drunk, I will occasionally attempt a windmill, but yeah, it doesn't go well. You know, the weight distribution's changed quite significantly. And doing it on gravel doesn't really work. So you... You danced, you emceed, but did you ever mix? Did you ever play records? We were, I guess back then we, because we were both in Suffolk at the time when we sort of met at school, although neither of us were born there. And we, so we were kind of, we could just about pick up some of the London radio stations. with those old FM aerials that you, you know, like the Y-shaped FM aerials. And you'd kind of like teeter around on your bed, kind of trying to sort of get a good signal. And we could just about pick up some of the London radio shows and then, you know, you'd record it on cassette tape. And then we'd kind of share cassette tapes amongst us. And, you know, it was a big thing if you kind of... We would also kind of pop into London at the weekends occasionally and go to Groove or Black Market. Yeah, and you'd get those mixtapes from America, which would be Latin Rascals and... Who's that? Red Alert. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there would be these long, hour, two hour long things, which is where we'd get to hear the latest music. But we couldn't actually get most of it on vinyl because it didn't ever get here. You know, there was no market. But yeah, so I guess I'm asking more... about scratch DJing? We had our DJ, one of our DJs, Scratch Daddy Addy, who we've done other work with under the name of Kushti at some point, which was more some sort of drum and bassy stuff. But he's still a friend of ours. He was kind of our main DJ, really. So he still scratches and does. But you were never personally interested in doing that. I mean, Andy, you... I started DJing just... after that, about 16, but then I was living in this big house in Ipswich with, there was like five of us, and one of the guys was a DJ, and so he had 1200s, and that's where I started kind of mixing this guy Lee Geddes. But at school, no, we didn't have the, it was totally kind of tape mixing then. So you kind of, you'd put mixes together, but it was with a pause button on the cassette machine, you know. So how did you go from throwing windmills to raving, I guess? Did you go to raves in the early 90s? Yeah, well, we started hearing this music slowly creeping in, so we'd hear all the hip-hop, but then we'd also get to hear this sort of house music and music from Detroit at the same time, because it was all kind of lumped in together. And then I think Andy started this raving before I even really knew what it was. But I'd heard the music, but I hadn't necessarily been to the parties. And then I think it was Santa Pod or something. It was, yeah, like late 80s, in fact. And so I left home and I was in this big house in Ipswich and we were all super hip hop. purists i think we sort of straight up a lip hop i think you know like and you'd stiff up stiff up yeah um and you you know you there was you know no drinking no drugs you know just it was just about being you know being dancers and and then there was just this sort of this moment that um i think we went to a sunrise like Simon who was one of the crew and and then it all yeah it's all been downhill from there basically um but uh but yeah so got into this sort of um pattern of going to the the sort of raves that were off the m25 basically and you'd sort of meet up at a service station somewhere and they'd give you the location and then you'd kind of go to the go to the rave And yeah, that was the sort of introduction. But there is a strong crossover between early hip hop and what we do now, basically, which is electro. And, you know, some of those guys like Juan Atkins, for example, you know, they were making the music we were dancing to. And then they transitioned into techno. And it's, you know, but it's basically more sort of syncopated kind of rhythms, not so much the 4-4 thing. And that's still kind of what we love. And then when did you decide to start making music? What was the trigger for that? It was just a lead on really from doing these experiments in hip hop. So we'd MC a bit and Scratch Daddy would do some scratching and we'd kind of make these beats. And so we ended up with a thing called a promer, which was a really early sampler where you'd actually just, you could burn your own E-prom. chips so it's like these chip you know like a chip you'd literally put into the sampler um and it was very short you you got like 1.2 seconds i think something like that so you'd have to cram in so in order to get a like a drum break in you'd have to go like that with the record to to get it into the sampler Ed is spinning his hand physically on the desk. So you'd get these breaks that were slightly, the timing was slightly weird, you know, which is maybe some of the charm. But yeah, you'd have to get as much as you can into this one point, whatever seconds it was. And yeah, that was the first stuff we made. And then I got a synth called a D50. which is kind of a shitty digital, sorry, not a very good digital synth. And yeah, it just developed from that really. So you kind of quite attracted to digital and computers very early on. I've read somewhere that you kind of, you did have analog equipment, but you... transitioned quite quickly we yeah we we loved the idea of compact travel and and we yeah we did we the irony yeah and we uh we did have all that we had lots of um analog stuff but it all just broke and it kept breaking and we'd take it out on the road and it would just get mashed up and we'd have to send it in for expensive repairs. You know, it would cost hundreds of pounds to get this stuff repaired. So when, you know, when laptops came around and you could do everything in a laptop, we were just so happy with that idea. And we sort of still are. I don't understand, you know. I mean, the resurgence of modular is really lovely. because there's all these new, weird, modular things. But for us, software is a sort of real breakthrough. Yeah, I mean, we kind of, I guess, left the analogue thing behind in 96, because we did a tour with Björk and got paid quite well to do that. And so we got our first MacBook. then and prior to that we'd been using Amiga computers and but they were sort of desktop style but so yeah the first laptop was in 96 and I guess we held on to sort of the analog stuff for about a decade but we just found we were just not using it so much you know and We sold a lot of that, actually. And we always had a sort of liking for digital sounds anyway, like FM synthesis, which you can do equally well inside a computer as you can an external hardware device, anything digital, obviously. Computers do very well. But, I mean, there is something beautiful about the hardware, analog synth. Obviously, it does sound different. It's just not something that we were totally obsessed with. No, I was just going to say, yeah, I mean, analog is amazing because it just sounds good immediately. digital tools not so much these days but earlier on you'd have to kind of work with them quite a while to get the sort of sound you wanted i mean these days you can And, you know, the presets are amazing and you could pretty much kind of just load something up and write a good track with them. Back in the day, we were, yeah, we were, you know, having to work with it a bit to get the kind of sound we wanted. So, yeah, it wasn't as immediate. So bringing things up to a bit more of a present day, you've worked with quite a lot of players, the South Bank Gamalean players, the machines to an extent, also with the London Sinfonietta. Is there a reason that you've kind of gravitated towards? We're fond of collaborating, I suppose. We like working with other people and, you know, you learn a lot with every collaboration. And so it's generally a pleasant experience. I mean, you know, also there's a restriction to, you know, to working with specific. instruments and so it kind of pushes you a bit with your composition. What was sort of one of the first major collaborations that you did? Was it with the Sinfonietta? Well, we did that repeat stuff, I suppose. I mean, we did some earlier kind of electronic collaborations. Yeah, we did some stuff with Mark Broom and Dave Hill, which was, yeah, these sort of slightly more techno-y 12s on their label. And we did some stuff for, that was pure plastic. And then we did some stuff for Peter Ford. label. So that was the sort of electronic collaboration but the first stuff with players and stuff I think may have been Yes, probably be the Sinfonietta. And that was Gillian Moore who brought us in to do that. What exactly did you do? We wrote about half an hour of music and alongside a couple of other Warp artists, yeah, Miracalix and Squarepusher. Yeah, it was a sort of collaborative show between... Warp artists and the Sinfonietta. And we all just wrote music for them to play and added electronics to that. Yeah, it was the percussionists specifically within the Sinfonietta. So it was all the mallet instruments and the sort of drumming kind of percussion stuff. Have you now sort of, or have you always maybe had an attraction to... Instruments? Drums, perhaps? Struck and tuned instruments, they've always sort of featured and we've often tried to synthesize them. Like FM synth is really good for these sort of metallic struck sounds. Yeah, and that's one of the beauties of working with Felix in a way is that it's all glockenspiels and struck instruments. I don't know, why did you end up with that? Because it's the easiest thing to do. Yeah, I mean, I guess it's the easiest thing to do. I remember you telling me one time, or maybe we were sitting in another interview, that you wanted not to be the focal point of the music and you wanted something physical and visual. which I think kind of ties into our sort of early sort of... Yeah, it's a bit confusing because there's a lot of moments during our show that I just want to rave to it and not be part of it. And I think that's the nice thing about it is that you can just let it do its thing and listening to the music is sort of more enjoyable than creating it live. And I guess combining those two makes a lot of sense. It's also great that people don't look at us when we do these performances, isn't it? Because everyone is sort of looking at the machines and you're kind of just part of the audience, basically. I mean, this is something that you've quoted quite early on. I mean, I read an interview that your early performance performances you insisted on performing off stage yeah that didn't last very long because no promoters would really allow that and we also didn't have any visual elements so literally just an empty stage with no lights just this sort of sound coming from most people didn't even know that there was a performance they just thought it was some preamble sort of music. So yeah, we hadn't really thought it through properly. But there was a good concept behind it, which was to break away from the kind of idol worship. idea of personality driven music where we just wanted it to be pure and about music um so yeah the the the the intention was good maybe the you know the practical side of it didn't really make much sense but i think it's something that has stayed with you in terms of you've always had a very visual element to your performances yeah so it's not really the focus is you two playing per se I think that's interesting why do you think why has that happened why We genuinely think that music is the most significant thing of being a musician and we don't want to distract from that, I suppose. We do now provide the audience with some kind of visual show. Thank you very much. People tend to personify anything that's happening. That's true. Whatever you're hearing, you're going, oh, what's creating that? There's a person behind that doing this. Yeah. No matter what you're looking at. Well that was, yeah. It's good to confuse people in some aspects. No, totally. I think that I remember actually when, because we had this thing with the Black Dog which was our sort of earlier, earlier kind of collective and we didn't do photos and we again always had this idea that it shouldn't be about the individuals, it should be about the music. But then that in itself, not doing photos, became like hype. And so, you know, it kind of undermined, you know, the reason for us doing it. It became kind of glamour in itself, not... That's how we ended up with our name, really, actually, because we just didn't want... We wanted the worst name. possible in a way well we wanted the most unglamorous name possible so it was it was this sort of idea of this lumberjack this not you know not saying that lumberjacks aren't cool because they sort of are but they're not they are now they are now exactly yeah so we were trying to think of a word that was awkward to say quite unpleasant like pad it's not particularly nice word and that's not glamorous at all you know it was to do with these czech shirts which were sort of redneck or something you know it was it was just the worst possible name that we could we could think of and we stuck with it yeah and we get asked still after almost 30 years how to pronounce it which is amazing i mean it's like Almost every excuse. Welsh is obviously Welsh for party, plaid, plaid. So that's a big part of it. Obviously, it's more beautiful when you say it as plaid. It's kind of got a nice... What's the Welsh connection for you? We've both probably got some Welsh in us, I would imagine. You're making that up. Well, you've got a Scottish name, so you know. I've got, yeah, I have Scottish, I don't know, somewhere. Anyway, so there's some, yeah, whatever. You said Welsh, I don't know why. No, no, because plied is literally the Welsh word for party. Plied is the Welsh party. Plied means... Do you have a big fan base in Wales? No. No, we played a club in Cardiff one time, didn't we? No, I mean, it's because we're called plied, there's a bit of confusion with the political party called... Applied to, obviously, not loads, but occasionally. So, yeah, again, it wasn't the perfect name for a band, really, because it's also the name of the Welsh political party. Which you knew at that point? We hadn't really thought any of it through. Yeah, I think, yeah, I... I recall it being because we were both kind of working and, you know, the, you know, sort of the plaid shirt was like this, you know, when you've got out, when you take your suit and tie off, you kind of put on like something a bit more comfortable. And it was, it was more about kind of like a. It was like a hobby and it was like the fun bit of our kind of life. But yeah, I don't know. It was a dumb name really, wasn't it? We should have called ourselves something much more like sexy and techno. Yeah, like three or something like that. Oh no, the phone. There are no cool names left really. I don't know where to go from three. How would you spell it? I guess with a PH. PH, PH and then the number three. Backwards. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, we dream the same dream. Yes. So speaking of dreams, visuals have always been a very important part of what you guys do to the point where you even made essentially a visual album, Greedy Baby. Yeah, we did that with an artist called Bob Jarocz who... We worked with for years and toured with, and he used to make these beautiful, or he still does make these beautiful things with Super 8 and, you know, old film. So it had a really lovely old analogue textural kind of look to it. Then we, for various reasons, we started doing our own stuff and we've started doing more kind of generative, geometric kind of algorithmic sort of stuff. And we still obviously, there's a few directors we've worked with as well to make videos and we sometimes show them. But yeah, we've started making these programs that respond very immediately to the music. As in you've written your own software? Well, yeah, that might be a bit grand, but it's a thing called Max where you can make your own patches, which a lot of musicians use and a lot of visual artists use. And it's kind of like Lego. And I... I really want to talk about Tech on Kincrete because it's one of my absolute favourite films. How did you end up getting involved with that? By extremely good fortune. The director, Michael Arias, came to see us perform in New York. He was producing at the time and had, for whatever reason, decided that night that if he ever got in the position to be a director, he wanted us to come in and make the music for him. And yeah, we've continued that relationship with him. I mean, Tekkon is a beautiful movie and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone. Can you maybe, for whoever hasn't watched it and you really must watch it, Can you describe a little bit or give us a teaser of what it's about? Briefly, it's about two brothers who live in a fictional city called Treasure Town. And this new kind of element, they're basically street kids. And this new kind of element moves into the town, which has kind of... some sort of alien vibe and uh and and the dynamic of the town starts to change and so you follow the brothers as as this uh as they kind of start to deal with this new intrusion it's it's yeah I guess it's about sort of business and I don't know there's corporate relationship between the brothers as well there's a sort of slightly yin yang thing going on as well yeah one is very innocent and sort of pure and the other is kind of tougher but they both changed through the movie. I didn't pick up the whole alien element of it though. I can't think of that bit. It's sort of presented almost like an alien invasion but it's also... Well, they literally can fly. Yeah, but I think... I think it's the homogenization of sort of globalist corporations kind of thing represented with these alien influences. Yeah, it's not specifically alien, I suppose, but I guess it's alien in... It's not the B in track. Not UFO alien. No, exactly, yeah. It's that cold corporate, you know... alien it's not human you know it's like which we all experience I guess in some ways so to bring it a bit more up to date what are you working on at the moment we're we're just um finishing mixes on our next studio album um which is going to be called polymer um and we'll be coming out with warp later later this year um and and we we've also been um working with michael arias again on a japanese tv series um called tokyo alien brothers um which is uh which is also based on uh on manga by Teo Matsumoto who was the original illustrator creator of the black and white which became Tekkon And so, yeah, but this is a live action sort of take on this Tokyo Alien Brothers. Yeah, and it's been fun to work with Mike again because we've sort of developed this, we've stayed in touch, obviously, and he's done a couple of other films in between. And there's just a lovely relationship with him now. He can kind of say, he can look us in the eyes on Skype and we kind of know what he's saying. he can tell us off for being late and stuff like that without being too upsetting. So, yeah, it's just good. It's like this sort of decades-long relationship now. Like you guys. Yeah, brothers. It's all about this sort of brotherhood or this... Something like that. Or sisters, obviously, as well. And, you know, puppies, butterflies, and all the lovely stuff. so ♪ ♪
