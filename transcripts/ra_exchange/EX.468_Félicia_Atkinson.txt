♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. Our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I am the tech editor at Resonant Advisor. The exchange this week is with Felicia Atkinson. Atkinson is an artist in the broadest sense of the word. She infuses her music with influences and references from poetry, theatre, philosophy, visual art, or pretty much anything that strikes her imagination. She builds intimate but thought-provoking environments that sound something like 20th century avant-garde music but with a much-needed modern shot in the arm. That sense of carrying the torch for experimental music is further emphasized by her label and publishing house Shelter Press, which she runs with her partner Bartholomew Saint-Saëns. In conversation with Charles Ravens, we get an insight into Atkinson's latest record, The Flower and the Vessel. as well as some of the thought processes and techniques that shape her compositions. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Felicia Atkinson is up next. To use, to spare, you to stop. To stand up, to fall, to turn. Leave the measure, the point. So we're here at Resident Advisor, but you, unlike a lot of people who do the Aria Exchange, you're not a dance music producer. I guess, first of all, what's your relationship to electronic music? Do you go clubbing? Do you listen to that kind of music? I don't go clubbing at all. I used to go dancing younger, but... Not so much to electronic music, actually, more to oldies or rock music. I listen to abstract electronic music or ambient music, but at home, I don't know. It was never my culture. I respect it, I admire it in many ways. But since I was a teenager, I would go to live shows, even diffusion shows of serious electronic music. But I've never been into the club culture. You have worked with dancers before, is that right? Yes. It was interesting to think about that because I suppose being a dance music journalist, it's... Weird to remind yourself that you can dance to things that don't have a beat. Yes, yes, exactly. Actually, I'm really interested in the connection between dance and music because I feel it's a way of listening. And I was asked a year ago to give a kind of performance, but very not performative, just a voice and laptop. as a training for dancers. And it was so enjoyable because they were moving and they were listening in a way I always dreamt of, you know. So actually, I'm really interested in this idea of, like, actually last summer, I was invited by Resident Advisor to play at 7 a.m. in the morning in Berlin for the 24-hour event. I was seven months pregnant. I woke up at five. I took a cab. I went to the club. I played my show and I came back and I enjoyed it. I feel like an old lady, very interested in playing for people who are in the middle of something greater in their time frame or going there by walking like a sleepwalker. You know, I go there, I deliver something and I leave. So I wanted to start as well with the new record. So it's called The Flower and the Vessel. I guess your records quite often have quite specific... ideas behind them, quite specific inspirations which you talk about and share with people. So would you like to just introduce some of the ideas that have shaped this one? I was very interested in Ikebana. A bit by surprise. I was reading... a book about it, and I was very impressed by the philosophy behind it, this idea that you find structure, you find harmony, and a way also of choosing things in the chaos to make some beauty and harmony, and that Ikebana could be a way of thinking. I'm going to pick three elements. the vastness of the world and make a bouquet out of it. And it seems very superficial, but it could be also completely essential, like what it is to pick a few things and make them a whole or a system in general. So that was one of the first concepts I had. And then in general, I thought about the idea of what it is to have a creative gesture. to make something. So I looked at guides. I started to look at those guides for Hand in Hand, actually. Ceramic guide, how to guide, how to make a ceramic, how to make a bouquet, how to make things in the world, how to transform elements to make a new one. And of course, since I was also expecting a baby, it resonated in me. I'm making an album, I'm making a baby, I'm making a bouquet. And also the ambiguity of it. I'm responsible to add things in the world. And is it a good idea? How can I make it the best I can and also how can I not control it because you can't control everything. The record starts with your voice whispering which I guess has become a kind of signature of yours in a way. Tell me about how you landed at that as being a kind of natural voice because I guess that it's obviously influenced perhaps by Robert Ashley who I know you're a fan of. Tell me how you kind of decided that this was the right way for you to use your voice. I think it was the easiest, basically. Because I was really, I studied music as a child, but I dropped it for theatre and writing. And I enjoyed writing a lot. I enjoy listening to people talking. I'm a bad technician. Even if I use tools, I'm really bad at explaining how I use them. The most simple thing I can do is talk. You know, I can do it everywhere. Then it gave me comfort, like this is a tool I can bring with me everywhere and I can just have my phone and use it. So also because coming back to dance, I saw some improvisers dancing, just coming in the space with their body, that's it. And they were making something out of it. And I was so impressed by that, the fact that you can go hands in your pocket to somewhere. and carrying something important with you, but no one can guess. What I also was thinking about is how easily people now describe, not just whispering, but a lot of the kind of sounds that you make as ASMR. So now there is this term for this thing, but I guess you were doing it way before you knew that. Yeah, exactly. I learned the term by reading an article about my work. And then I became really interested. But what's interesting is I believe ASMR is often delivered through YouTube. So there is this strange connection between an image that is not interesting and a sound. In that case, I think it's very different from what I do because I try to remove images. They come with the text, but I'm not showing any image directly. It's really a recording without image. But the idea of something that is very close to your ears and can get in your ears and get out. Making space, because I think music has space, mostly. Making space in the brain, finding rooms, like a video game. That's interesting. Do you play video games? No. I'm boring. I don't go to clubs. I don't play video games. That's interesting to me, though, the idea that you're not giving an image because we live in an image culture. And I wonder if that's something that you see as perhaps music is a way of getting away from the kind of image culture that we live in where there's just so much to take in. I think it's creating your own imagery. with all the images we live through. I don't reject technology at all. I know it exists and we use it, but I feel imagination. is so important, especially nowadays. And there are so many, for example, now we look at things, people playing instead of us, people dancing instead of us, people making music instead of us. And I feel there was this slogan in 68, l'imagination au pouvoir, imagination as power. And I truly believe in that. Yeah, I think that I do. have a sense that as years go by and I spend more of my time kind of consuming other images that my own imagination perhaps suffers in that way. Do you attempt to kind of preserve yourself from influence in any way? Do you make a conscious attempt to not look at Instagram or not watch things or not? No, I watch. I watch. I love watching things and I love TV shows also. I'm very inspired by the TV shows I watch. Oh, what kind of TV shows do you like? For example, DOA. I really enjoyed DOA and Britt Marling, the actor. producer, she goes into, at one episode, she goes into a room and she speaks with a big octopus. And she, it's, for me, it was a metaphor of playing a show and what we told about before going in the middle of the night somewhere and leaving. I found it so accurate, for example, this image of appearing somewhere and disappearing. But so I take the images, but then they are reconstructed, also transferred, translated into sound. And this translation for me is so important that we see images, we make sound. I could eat bread and be inspired by the bread. You know, it's always going from one thing to another. I think that's something from having read some of your older interviews and listening. That seems to be something that you do either more than other artists, or at least you're willing to explain it more than other artists, this way of synthesizing a lot of ideas at once and quite difficult ideas potentially, or ideas from different art forms, and somehow putting it through you and coming up with something. And I wondered how much you... know what you're going to make or how much it is a kind of perhaps a sort of meditative or chance process it's both it's uh i know the tools i want to use or i know the questions that uh shakes me but i don't know where it's going to lead me so it's mostly it's the same I love cooking, but I'm not a technician of cooking either. But I know the ingredients I like and to whom I want to cook. So it's basically the same with music, you know. For example, I saw that show, Catherine Bradford exhibition at this gallery, Campoli Prestigios. today and I was very interested by her paintings she's I think she was born in 42 and it seems like she's so dynamic so young and I don't know now I have her paintings in my head and it will resonate with I don't know something I will drink and then it will make a song And tell me a bit about the actual sonic qualities of this album, because it does feel a bit perhaps thicker or there's a little bit more going on in some places, perhaps melodically a bit richer. How did you end up on that kind of path? At the beginning, I didn't know what I wanted to do. I knew that Hand in Hand was very bare. I built it like a desert. I was thinking always about the record spinning and this flat thing spinning, which is not the world because the world is round. We don't have to forget about it. But then for the flower and the vessel, it was raining so much when I was recording it. And I was not sad at all. I read that it's... the sad hotel rooms where I wrote it but it wasn't sad at all I was actually very happy writing it because I felt I felt not alone I felt a baby my partner was next to me so actually I felt crowded and then this crowd of feelings, not people, because three people is not a crowd, but still a group of people, the rain and all the drops of the rain and the landscape, layers and layers and layers. And then when I recorded, I felt, ah, I would love different kind of sounds, studio sound with instruments, specific instruments. but also very digital sounds, midi, logic midi sounds, iPhone field recordings. Like the cabana we talked about, it's like there are several cabanas in the room. Not one big bouquet, but more like several cabanas in the room. And you also, on this record, there is a... a guest on the final track. How did this guest collaboration come about? Thanks to Stephen O'Malley, actually. So we were friends and we released a record of his on Shelter Press a few years ago. And he was doing this radio show that unfortunately is no longer working at Red Bull Radio. And it was such a great show. And he said, hey, do you want to come and maybe we can record something? So this is how it happens. And it's this magical studio in Montreuil in the suburbs of Paris. And they have very good microphones. They have tons of synthesizers. They have good guitars and old amps. There was all this equipment we were very curious about. And Stephen brought one book, Des Pierres, which is a book by Roger Caligua, a French writer, about stones and images of stones. And I own this book also, and it's one of my favorite books. You collect stones, right? I collect stones also. So it was serendipity. First, he invited me, but also he totally understood without asking what I was looking for. And then, so it was improvised. I played a few keyboards, the Rhodes, the Walitzer, the Jupiter, did the voice, and he added layers of guitar and produced the track. Et voilà. Do you find it easy to work with other people? Because it seems to me as though you probably have a lot of ideas in your head that might be hard to translate with somebody else. I thought it would be hard and it was so easy. It opened my mind and I feel that maybe the next record there will be more collaborations. But also it's because Steven is a great artist and a great human. So also I was very lucky, you know. It was a good start to change my thinking about that. And I guess he's quite an experienced collaborator. Completely, because he plays in a band and also collaborates with so many people. But I did collaboration with Jeffrey Cantu. And we're going to record also in studio. So that will be a step. So how did it work with Jeffy? How was it different working with him? So we are friends also, but we don't see each other very often because he's in New York and I'm in France. So we started collaborating while I was living in the Alps just by sending tracks. And we never recorded together, just sending a track to each other, exchanging like letters and adding layers. But now we feel we should actually record together. So next time I'm coming to New York in September, we're going to record. So maybe 2019 is more about being in the same room. So I didn't know this until just now. So the track names, which are single letters, actually spell a quote from Susan Sontag. And that in turn is a Baudelaire quote, is that right? First of all, could you kind of explain what the quote is and why you chose it? But also I'm kind of... I'm intrigued by, again, these references and the way that you are using outside ideas and bringing them in. It can be very dense, I guess. And I wonder why you choose to work in that way, if there's a sense of, for instance, trying to not exactly educate your listener, but... but bring them in on things that you know? Why reference such specific things from art and philosophy? It's a good question. I think for me it's keys. And it's the way I learn also, because I'm an autodidact. for many things. And many things I discovered were just by reading a note, someone quoting someone, or the title of a painting, and then it leads you to a novel. So yeah, it's exactly how you put it. It's not to educate, because maybe that would be a bit presumptuous, but... to share little riddles and say, hey, look this way, there is something interesting. And while I was recording... I had this book on my desk and there was this title, Objet mélancolique. So I was reading and I read this sentence, Objet mélancolique, melancholic object, and comme un seul narciss, which means like one narcissist with the ambiguity of narcissists being looking at yourself, but also looking at the other. And I felt the exchange with Jeffrey was a bit like that. recording things and being in this melancholic state of the daily life and also sending him sounds, but actually his sounds could be mine and my sounds could be his. And I thought, well, it's not an explanation, it's not an illustration, but it gives a little constellation of ideas around the record. same with the last one sorry which which is around sylvia plath and i felt the same like all those poems i was reading of her remind me the music but it's not an illusion of the music it's more context possible context it's a it's an unusual way in some ways to to write music but it reminds me I guess of perhaps a kind of lineage of counterculture if you like that is perhaps not exactly harder to find now because if anything all these things are easier to find now but the methods of passing that on are different because I think in an era that's probably before either of us really, people would learn from weekly music magazines, record shops, video shops, VHS mail order lists, all those kinds of things. And now there's a different kind of quality to that lineage of art and philosophy and film. So I wonder if you see yourself as perhaps being a bit of a torchbearer. Absolutely, completely. And I relate to that. I'm born in 81. So when I was a teenager in high school, this is the way I got to discover things. And I'm very attached. to it, to exactly what you said. I love interviews. In my record, there's a lot of cut-ups from interviews. I enjoy reading them. I'm so fascinated by the idea that you hear the voice of someone from, I don't know, 30 years ago, or read it, and suddenly the presence, the person is in the room. It's so vivid and also so easy to understand because it's their own words. There is no complicated theory. It's just two people talking like we are. So yes, the culture of magazines, of record stores, video stores, they shaped me. And maybe there is something then staying in the records. In that case, I mean, do you ever go to write something and it comes out as actually just something completely personal, just some kind of love song and it has nothing to do with any film you've seen or bread you've tasted or anything? I never ask myself that. I think they are all personal. I mean, there are different entries, I would say, always. The private one and the public one. And actually, this is for me very important. The record was, in many ways, speaking about exactly what it is to be pregnant, what it is to... Because all the time I was like, I'm playing, because I played shows also during that time, and someone is listening from the inside of my body. How crazy it is. And that's the most personal, for sure. Before that, I would have just moods, you know. This song is a bit sad because maybe I was a bit sad. It's that simple. But for me, it's not one or the other. Let's say that in each thing, I feel there are different levels, different entries, a bit like if you look from the sky or from the ground or different point of views. And it's this kind of... variety of point of view that interest me actually. And do you tend to work in a kind of as they say first thought best thought type of way do you get things down quite quickly or do you spend a long time working out compositions? I work very quickly but I prepare very long I think about like I have this box in my head this is going to be for my new record And I put tons of stuff in it. And after a while, boom, I go. And does that mean that when you finished a record, those ideas are done for now for you, that you don't need them anymore? This I don't know. I think the idea stays, the questions, because I never find answers, you know. Let me ask you a few questions about your earlier life and how you got into things. Now, I've discovered that apparently one of your first jobs was answering the phone at Earcom. Yes. Wow. That's quite a precocious kind of thing to be doing. How old were you when you were doing that? Oh, I was... 19 or 20 and it's yeah at one moment in the we should explain in case anyone doesn't know that it's the it's an institute for I guess avant-garde electroacoustic electronic research exactly it's a research institute rather than a studio and it's connected to Centre Pompidou so it's really in front of the Centre Pompidou in Paris But at that time, many musicians were working at the desk. People from those French labels Active Suspension and Clapping Music, who were electronic labels from the early 2000s. And so I got the job from a friend who said, hey, I'm leaving it. And I was actually very shy at that time. It put me a lot of effort to answer the phone. But I saw Pierre Boulez coming and I was giving him his restaurant checks, you know, to go to the restaurant. He had a lot of them. And yeah. Did they have subsidized? restaurant as well they had free food they no they would go to the restaurant with those checks but I think they would I don't know I think you pay a bit for whatever But people were very nice there. Were you already interested in that kind of music? Yes. Yes, because weirdly enough, my dad, who is retired and was a psychiatric nurse, so nothing to do with music, but he was really, and he is really into contemporary music. So I would listen, I would go. to Irkham as a kid, actually. And I was terrified. And for me, it was music that was very scary and very male and very serious. So as a teenager, I rejected it and went to rock music also to difference myself. But then after graduating, I came back to that music slowly, bits by bits, first by answering the phone and then making music. Yeah, so you had some classical training as a kid. as a child and then just kind of stopped playing for a long time yes I because I felt there was a kind of social complex where my parents don't understand like they go to see shows but they they have no notion of classical music they don't know how to write music, and all of the other students at the music school, they were so good, so technical, and parents would help them. And after a while, I felt really, I don't know, not at my place there. I was not classical enough, so I stopped. I went to a theater school. I went to see rock shows and I discovered my own thing. And I know that, so you were in a few different groups in your 20s and one of them, Stretch and Relax. Part of the point of that group, as I understand it, is that you were using things that weren't instruments. Yes. So you were trying to get away from everything that was traditional. Exactly. And this is how I... came back to music actually it's by two projects this one and with Sylvain Chauveau doing only the voice so it's time it was like not playing anything and trying to find other ways to get in and with Elise she was she's still a contemporary dancer so she was not interested in playing instruments she said I can't do that but I can I can touch a wall I can move a chair And so I said, yeah, and me too, actually, this is how I feel. So we did, for example, a show at Instants Chaviré. So this was, I don't know, yeah, almost 20 years ago. And we would wear those masks and we would just crawl onto the piano or under the piano, throw stuff to the piano. We were a bit angry at the music also, I think. We wanted to be in the music but not play the music. And in those days when you were starting to release records and working with people, it was the start of quite a big transition away from... as we were saying, that type of physical, personal, countercultural, underground, etc., into things like MySpace and being a laptop musician, which was a new thing at the time. Tell me about how you kind of fit into that. Was that a particularly exciting time in Paris? Was it a good DIY kind of moment? Is that why you kind of suddenly got back into music? Good question. I think there was, yeah, it was an interesting time. But also, I was more hanging out in the dance scene at that time because I did this project with Boris Charmatz called Bocal. And we were improvising. And the music culture in Paris at that time was really male-oriented. So I didn't feel very welcome. So I would go to see shows. I saw many and actually it educated me a lot because I saw also the Présence électronique show, I saw Ikeda, I don't know, Panasonic. everything but this for me was serious guys and I was not a serious guy so I couldn't fit and but there was a squat also called La General that still exists in another way but it was really big at that time and many shows were happening there so I would I performed there I would go there to see things and the laptop yeah I had my first laptop because it's expensive a laptop so it took me a while to get one and then I discovered GarageBand and that saved me my space and GarageBand actually because suddenly I had feedback from people all over I don't know Australia who do the same kind of music it was was very liberating. And also to see, I would play guitar without playing guitar. So I would do laptop and guitar in a very weird way. I don't think it was that good, but it was very joyful. And even these days, so you use your iPhone most that's a key instrument for you and my computer both what kind of uh i read a quote from you where you were saying that you you love to use machines you don't understand yes and tell me about what kind of other how do you how do you go about sourcing machines that you don't understand and then trying to use them it's a bit I feel bad about that because I feel I should learn. But it's just, I feel incapable. Like my brain is not working to read a manual. You know, I have, I don't know. I'm not built for it. So instead of that, for example, I just spend a week at Ems studio in Stockholm with the Buchlas. It's been the second time I've been there. And each time I found a few sounds that I really do like, but I don't know how I went there, you know. Yeah, and the Buchla is, from what I understand, notoriously quite difficult to... It's very difficult, you know. But it depends what you want to do with it. It's like everything. I'm looking for simple things in a way. I'm just looking for a few sounds. I'm not going to make a whole album about a boucle. I would be totally bored also to just do that, you know? So it's more like being, again, coming back to Ikebana. Okay, maybe I'm in a very steep forest. It's difficult to climb. But I found one little spot that interested me and I'm going to stick to it. And at the time when you were kind of getting back into music, as I understand it, it was actually poetry that was a big influence for you. Yes. I wondered if you kind of see yourself as more of a poet than a musician and why you haven't just done poems, I guess. I mean, what is it that, how do you put those two together? I think it's a question of scenes also, because I really enjoy the music scene, the music community. I discovered a bit the poet community, but I found it way more serious. And less, I don't know. I feel so good in the music community. Also, I do art and I don't like as much the art community. I really feel the club scene is interested in the non-club scene. The non-club scene is interested in the club scene. The rock is interested into electronic, electronic to contemporary. I don't know, world music. There is so much curiosity in the music scene that I don't find elsewhere. So I think it's the people, basically. I felt at home right away. And do you, when you're putting words together, are you, I mean, tell me a bit about how you put words together, because obviously you borrow words quite a lot. So what's your kind of... What kind of techniques do you have for finding things or what tends to appeal to you? What do you find yourself looking for? It's mostly chance. So first, I read things, I buy the books, I spend time doing this. Then I'm in the urgency of the music show or the recording. In the music show, I just improvise. So the words that I'm saying live are just always improvised. Sometimes you can hear the same ones because they come back. And also I answer back to the recordings I play live. So sometimes it's my voice answering my voice or things like that. And live, it's the same. I put a few books around me, like instruments, and I have some words in my head also, notebooks, and I grab them very quickly. So it's really like playing dices. And does that, when you're picking words live or thinking of words live, does that also affect what you're playing or is the playing more fixed? It influences it for sure, for sure, because, or maybe it's the opposite, it's the music that I played or that I'm playing that influence the word I'm picking. So really, it feels like had you tried to be just in a poetry scene, you wouldn't have been able to complete your ideas, I guess. Yes, yes. What I really do like about music is also the absence of words. So words appear and disappear. And there is a moment where I put them away. And this for me is very important also. Right. And there are plenty of times on your records where you can't really hear the words. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Let's talk a little bit about Shelter Press then. So the new album is, I believe, the 112th release. Wow. Tell me a bit about, so it began in 2012, is that right? Tell me a bit about what you imagined Shelter Press to be then. Yes. And perhaps we can talk about what it is now. So Shelter Press is Bartholomew Sanson, my partner and me. It's mostly him in the days now because he works full time on it and do art music and now we have a baby. Yeah, who's looking after the baby? The label. So back in 2012, Bartholomew had another imprint called Kaogumi Books for a few years and he was... publishing zines, almost a zine every week. That's crazy. And after a while, he was a bit tired of it because I think he felt like he'd done anything he could do with the imprint. So he wanted to stop. And I was interested in creating something with him where there would be music and text and images. And we were in this artist residency, you know. Ohio, where there were a lot of Amish around building their own houses and making their vegetables and stuff. And we were a bit inspired by them in a weird way. This is how we called it shelter press. We were like, okay, this is going to be our house because we are travelers. We are renters. We don't own a house. We're going to travel a lot. So our house is going to be shelter press and we're going to invite people at the table. So in between 2012 and now. The table has changed many times because we changed also because at the beginning we were younger and we had different ideas, but it's a very personal press still. And this is why we say we don't accept demos mostly because it's like being at your own living room making dinner. It's rare that you accept people knocking at your door, you know? I guess also in that... time period a lot has changed just within the music industry and how things run how has how have changes in the wider industry affected your priorities if at all It's every day a challenge and a question. How do we do that? How can we make it sustainable? What run we should do? How many records? We try to make them very beautiful, but then they are very expensive to make. Is it silly or not? Bartolomé still ships everything by himself. We have no car. We take the bus with bags of things. But we have very good distributors now also. So we do direct sales, but also through Boomcat and Forced Exposure. And I think it changed a lot. And actually, it was a big help. For example, Boomcat, the way they supported us. at the time where we didn't have also any PR, we were doing the press ourselves and they helped. So I think the evolution of shelter press is also related to the people who decided to... help us or help to spread the world about what we do so it's never something you do alone it's something in a community and now we are going to do this residency for six months in Switzerland in a place called La Becque and we want to make a little, not a pause, but just a little breathing to understand where we are and what we're going to do. So actually, we have a lot of questions in our mind. And one of the recent things that Shelter Press released was a book. called Spectres, about music and listening, I guess, which included quite a lot of well-known names in the experimental scene. There's something about this book, with pieces of writing by people like Chris Watson, there's something about the existence of this book that makes me think. you think there's a lack of space to talk about these things. Is that the case? I mean, what was it you were trying to make a space for that you thought was missing? For us, this book is very important. It's actually, I think, the beginning of a new step for Shelter Press, you know, in many ways, because it made us think while reading the contributions, which is awesome. You know, you think about a book and then... What people send you back is so good that actually transform you. And that was a collaboration with GRM. So GRM is Groupe de Recherche Musicale. So it's, there is IRCAM we talked about before and GRM and François Bonnet, Kassel Jagger, he's an amazing musician and thinker and now the director of GRM since a year. He wants to reshape GRM and rethink it and make it. I think, more present and actual also for his festival Présence électronique. So Bartholome, François and I, we thought about what could be a collaboration with a magazine every year with text about what is... sound today again we don't have answers but we we we exchange about one topic a year and as contribution and so it's an ongoing research i would say but we wanted it to be um mostly written by musicians for musicians not exclusively in the next one there will be also some people who are not musicians actually but more people who write a theory or things like that but the idea was that it would be a magazine easy to put in your pocket not too complicated to read accessible not only for universities even though it's also for them but we wanted to be I don't know honest somehow it's Zef Coming back to this idea of passing on cultural knowledge, I guess it's a space to have not serious conversations and stuff, but deep conversations which can be hard to find elsewhere. in music journalism and also without keeping it in some kind of academic territory. Exactly. This is very well put. And I think that's very important because musicians have much to say, not only about themselves, but not only musicians, music journalists, music theorists. about how they listen and not only about, oh, this record came out, I have to write about it or I just released a record, I have to talk about it, but to be a bit out of the context and then go deeper into ideas. Absolutely. Finally, I just wanted to ask you, I guess, about the sort of... some practical aspects of your life. So you live in Brittany, right? For now, yeah. For now. But you're quite nomadic, I guess. Yes. Why have you chosen that as your current place to live? And why not be in Paris, let's say? Does it help you as an artist to be somewhere like that? It's many reasons. The first is economic. Paris is impossible to live in. Each time there was a reason. When we moved to the Alps, it's because I was teaching in an art school nearby and Bartolome was also working with this art school. But the city was a bit of a posh city. We wouldn't live in the mountains, so we remote ourselves in the countryside. And it was amazing. But after a while, we were like, OK, this is like being 70 years old while being 30. So we have to change that. And then Han was a bit for the same reason. And now I think we want to move again. But I enjoyed also the fact that the life was not expensive and very simple. And coming back from playing shows, I go in a very simple town where no one cares. And we talk about other stuff, you know. But now I miss it also, being in a big city. So after the residency in Switzerland, we don't know where we're going to live, basically. I think we're going to put stuff in a storage for six months and see. It's the drama of my life. I never know where I belong. Also, I think because... My mum is foreigner and there is this thing where I can't find the good. I don't know where I belong exactly. So it's good and bad depending on the moments, I would say. Do you find that liberating or stressful not knowing where you're going? Both. Both, really. In a way, it's amazing because we go in a city and we're like, oh, we should live there and maybe we can. And sometimes it's like... How are we going to make it? I would love one day to own a house, but like everyone, it's complicated. Do you think that it's become more difficult to make a living as an artist as time has gone on? This I can't compare. I think maybe the level in general of life is so expensive. that, yes, for sure, just to... And especially if you play music, you do art, you need a studio. This is why I keep voice, because the voice, you don't need a studio, you know, to use your voice. But, yeah, and now there are only a few cities where things happen. And that scares me a bit, the idea that... Actually, we tend to believe we can live everywhere with the internet. But in another hand, it's very difficult to live in a midtown in France and go to see shows. Yeah. Is that different, do you think, that it used to be that there was more culture in small towns? Speaking of Rennes, for sure. Like Rennes in the 80s and 90s was really... very musical city. I think maybe it was in Manchester or France somehow, you know? Yeah, I think it's more and more difficult to put shows because the economy is so hard that now to find warehouses or music spots, it's very tough. And now it's difficult to play shows in not big cities, basically, to find fundings for that. Finally, then, as a slightly more cheerful ending, as you are so good at bringing in all of these many ideas and things that you've been thinking about into your music, I'm just curious about what is your current... what are you reading? What have you just seen? And what have you been thinking about that's in your head right now? I don't know. I don't have a lot of time lately having an eight-month baby. So I have to go take advantage of anything, anytime. For example, I spend tons of time in parks because... I think it's healthy to bring your child outside. And I look at trees and I'm very, very interested in trees and how they change the cities because most of the trees we see, they are imported, they travel. They say so much about how the city changed. So I'm not saying I'm going to make a record about trees, but they are very interesting. I'm interested in general in musicians or composers who thought music was a way to communicate with... non-humans, you know, whereas it was actually, for example, now Plantasia has so much success, but I understand why, I guess. It's because this idea that music can be a language to get connected, to get in touch with non-humans, whereas there are aliens, plants or rocks, that I feel really interesting. So yeah, this idea of music that could reach other dimensions. That's a great answer. Wonderful. Thank you. Thank you very much, Lisa. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
