Thank you. I can recall a certain magic in your eyes. Each time that you are here. A kiss so passionate that it has been mesmerizing. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I am the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Patrice Rushin is the type of musician whose skill set cannot be neatly summed up in a few sentences. After studying to become a classically trained pianist from a young age, she arranged and composed three albums of jazz fusion for Prestige Records in the mid-70s, all while landing sessions playing with the likes of Donald Byrd and Jean-Luc Ponty. She was already a leading light in her scene and one of the few women leading their own bands at the time. But it was with a five album stint for Elektra Records that she would have the most impact, bringing virtuosic musicianship and songwriting, and now her voice as a singer, to various flavors of disco and R&B. If you haven't heard her music yourself, you've almost definitely heard it sampled. from countless hip-hop acts to Mary J. Blige and George Michael, and most notably in the Men in Black theme song. Apart from her own career as a musician, she's also a veteran music director, calling the shots for big-budget tours, awards ceremonies, and TV shows, and she also composes symphonic pieces for orchestras along with a host of film soundtracks. In the wake of a new compilation just released on Strut Records, Zakia Soule spoke with Russian and RA's London office to learn more about her prodigiously multifaceted career. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Patrice Russian is up next. Bye. So then love, touch me, hold me, don't let me go I love you so Hi, this is Patrice Rush and I'm here to talk. Fantastic. Short and sweet. Well, I just want to say thank you so much. And it's a real honour to be able to chat with you. Thank you. And I'm very excited to hear about your musical journey. But I thought perhaps the best place to start would be at the beginning. And if you could give me a sense of your kind of upbringing, your musical upbringing and where it all started for you. Okay. Well, I started very, very young. I always liked music a lot. My parents had me in a preschool. They both worked, and I had a younger sister. So she's six years younger. So for the first five years, I was by myself. And they put me in this nursery school. And it was the teacher there, I think, that recognized what she thought was a musical ability because I was kind of a kid. small as a kid and kind of shy. But whenever we did anything to music, any kind of singing or any kind of dancing, that's when, you know, she noticed the big spark. And she told my parents about it and they said, okay, well, what do we do? And they found a program that was designed for small children, but it was actually a graduate course for... music education, music educators, music education people who were going to teach at the University of Southern California. So I was part of this little kids group that they were observing things about these kids as far as their musicality and where it came from and how to use some of those concepts to be able to teach young kids. And I was in this program for a number of years. And at five, you get introduced to an instrument. I was three at the time. Whoa, that's so young. He's very young. But we were singing and dancing and waving scarves to music and being taught. musical concepts at a child's level of feeling the music and being able to communicate about it a little bit while they were making major discoveries about certain theories about how they might go about teaching kids and how early childhood development was part of that. Anyway, at five, I started playing the piano. played classical music because that was pretty much the vehicle to get that instrument worked out. But at my house, I heard jazz and R&B, pop music, the music from television. Our radio or TV was on all the time. And so I heard a lot of music. And that's the kind of stuff I wanted to do, the stuff that was in there. Who's doing that? So as time went on, as the years went by, continued to go to my piano lesson all the time. But I'm growing up here in Motown and Sly Stone and the Beatles and picking out that stuff on the piano, too. And realizing more and more that the vocabulary. of music that I wanted to do was more in the popular music and the contemporary music end. And I went to high school and it was an all black high school and the teachers were pretty progressive. And one in particular who was in the music department used the idea of the music to help to teach us history, social skills. By giving us information about jazz, which is America's classical music. And that was invented by people that look like us. And that helped us. be able to understand more the value of that music and how it was the popular music of its day and how the information that we could have to add to the vocabulary of the traditional music and Western European tradition that I had been taught through the piano could also now be augmented with some other information. And that's when I knew I wanted to have music as a career. And I really wanted to write. I wanted to write for film and TV. I wanted to compose, orchestrate, all that stuff. But I didn't have the path. I didn't know. how to get there. And long story short, living in Los Angeles, that's where I grew up, there were lots of studios and recording sessions and television and motion picture sessions. And I got to go to a few of them just to watch and observe what those musicians did. At the same time, I was loving dance music and understanding more and more about how that was put together. And at the same time, I was also enamored with jazz and with what that part of the tradition was as far as having you know access to that musical vocabulary so it was like a a chameleon, you know, wanting to do all of these different things and trying to find ways to be able to do that. And I think that's what a lot of my music reflects, many different layers and ideas. Well, absolutely. You've moved seamlessly through such different worlds, different musical worlds. So what was it that actually made you decide that you wanted to start making music of your own? And were there any particular... influences any particular that was there a eureka moment where you decided that actually you were gonna start to make your own music well i always liked uh like i said composing and songwriting and things like this i didn't i didn't think of it as a an offshoot of anything other than just being creative and having that i the idea that there would be certain ways that i would like to see certain things put together but I also knew that from the standpoint of skill how creative that could be to develop your skill to be able to offer and to serve you know other people's musical moments too and I liked that I like the idea of collaboration a lot so in wanting to become this versatile player who could do it, whatever, anything. That was the goal, at least, because I love so much music and many different kinds of musicians had sort of entered my life, you know, either through people that I met or played with or was asked to play with, studio work, my peer group. I just wanted to be involved. I just wanted to play. So I didn't really have that moment of saying, well, I'm going to do my music. It was, again, an offshoot of service. As I was leaving high school, I participated in a jazz festival. Our high school, we used to do a lot of battle of the band competition type of. things. And this particular year, there was a combo division, a small group division. The band didn't win, but the combo did. And the idea was that you win a spot on this major jazz festival, which was the Monterey Jazz Festival. That's big for a high school band. So in 1972, my combo played this festival. And it was from that that people heard me and saw me in the context of playing jazz and wanted me to consider signing to a label. That was the last thing on my mind. I was going to go to college. How old are you at that point? I'm like, you know, what are you, 17 around that time? Wow. And I just said, well, you know, my aspiration was to be good enough to be able to play with these wonderful names of established artists. But I didn't think I was there yet and I had stuff to do. But I also needed money to go to school. So I signed a small deal at Fantasy Prestige and did three albums for them. And I was allowed to pretty much experiment to do what I wanted to do, you know, in the context of what it is that they were getting as this jazz musician that they were signing. I remember, I mean, because I always knew you for your more R&B, soul, disco kind of stuff. And I used to work in a record shop and I remember discovering Prolusion and Before the Dawn and being like, is that the same British-Russian? I couldn't believe it. And, you know, to this day, Jubilation is actually one of my favorite songs. I love it. So how did that? Yeah, a lot of people don't necessarily know that you had this kind of former life as a jazz pianist and as a composer and a band leader. So how did that first record come about? And what was the process like of putting it out there? The very first one, Prolusion? Yeah. Well, it was not really glamorous or terribly abnormal. I put together some pieces to play for the ensemble that I needed for the recording that they wanted. And they got the musicians together, some of whom I knew, and we went in and we recorded. And back then... There was very little in the way of, for me at least, overdubbing. We did everything live. And then there was one track. on that album where we did a lot of overdubbing because the technology then synthesizers were relatively new you know as far as being used in uh you know in music like this so that experimentation with those colors and that sound so i had this song on there called puttered popcorn great name and uh it was really allowed me to experiment and became so of a I guess a turning point because it was kind of a clue as to where I was going to probably go to take the aspect of music that I love which was based in groove but be able to experiment with these different orchestral colors now with synthesizers as part of that palette and recording and overdubbing in the process because I did most of the parts, you know, one by one. So that was very different from some of the other stuff that was on the album. The next couple of albums that I did for Prestige began to kind of, I guess, utilize, looking back now, utilizing more and more of those concepts of being able to stay part of the tradition of jazz, which involved improvisation. and being in the moment, but also the idea of music having a particular personality and each song having a particular emotional content that I was looking for. And that experimentation also ultimately led to me playing other instruments on the records and then ultimately to doing some singing. to ask you about about that period because I mean part of the reason I was so kind of shocked and amazed to discover your early records was because there were very few female composers making that kind of music at that time and you know were you conscious of that at the time and you know you were sort of leading all male bands? And, you know, what was that? What was that like? Great question. And no, I wasn't I wasn't aware of it in that way. I mean, obviously, you know, you look around and you say, oh, OK, I'm the only female in the room right now. But that at the time. wasn't unusual because I think most of my life the music was genderless it was about the being able to make musical moments and that most of my peers that happened and they were and they happened to be male at that particular time I think there was an awareness at least among very young men that they just wanted the stuff played you know and if the girl in the room can get it played, then fine. It didn't, it wasn't a thing. In fact, I was very protected by my immediate peers. They really looked out for me, you know, because they knew I was very serious about the music. And I think I tried to project the idea that, you know, we were all studying together a lot and playing together a lot. So I had that environment of my own peers treating me really respectfully. And that informed what I thought it was going to be like everywhere else because I had never experienced anything any differently. So even though I would walk into a room of. you know, professional musicians, many of whom were older than me or something like this, I didn't feel less than confident that I would rise to the occasion of whatever was needed musically. And I think that that fed my ability to focus on what I was there for, for the music. And it was much later in my career that... I realized that, you know, other people's baggage about being female, being female or being black or being short or whatever their given phobia was. that that could have an influence on the music because up to that point it had not had an influence on it at all. That's amazing to hear that you felt completely supported and respected and that probably gave you the confidence to be able to move through some of those different spaces as your career developed. Absolutely. I mean, I was aware I didn't see a lot of women. And the ones that I saw, you know, we would talk, but that wasn't really the subject of what we would be talking about. about. So yeah, I think the biggest thing I could say was that at home I got support and with my immediate peer group I got a lot of support. So there was this kind of gigantic shift in a way in your career after those early albums on Prestige from continuing the arrangement and composing and songwriting, but going from being an instrumentalist to a singer. How did that come about? Was that a kind of conscious decision? Had you been singing the whole way through? Where did that come from? Well, I liked to sing. I didn't consider myself a singer. I was an instrumentalist who happened to sing. The turning point was when I was signed to Electra. They were actually looking to. find ways to maintain certain aspects of the jazz tradition, but to do it in a more commercial way. Elektra before that had been a very, very, very strong pop label. They had Linda Ronstadt and Motley Crue and the Eagles, you know, so that was their thing. But they were trying to expand, and they were also trying to expand into the black market. And musically, the trend that I guess they saw coming... was this mix of music that had commercial sensibilities, but also maintained a certain tie to the jazz aesthetic. So I was signed around the same time as a person named Grover Washington Jr., as Lenny White, as Lee Rittenhour. Donald Byrd and the Blackbirds. I was signed around that. Dee Dee Bridgewater. Oh, wow. We were signed right around the same time. And if you notice, the common thread in there is that all of us have some roots in the jazz tradition, but we're, you know, at the time, also young enough to do some of these other things, which were also part of our tradition. tradition that were not superimposing. It didn't feel like it was superimposing one thing on another. It was kind of organic and just finding a platform to be able to do that. And a lecture was attempting to give us this platform. So singing more was something that they suggested as a way to sort of bridge. the two things. And I was fine. You know, I said, okay, I had the budgets to be able to continue to write. So I did all the string and horn arrangements. So this was feeding for me a larger purpose from the standpoint of me, the orchestrator, me, the producer, you know, me having this access to this bigger palette, you know, to be able to express and explore some other kinds of music. How do people receive that? Because I know a lot of the jazz musicians who made their careers on more traditional sounds in the 60s and 70s, when they turned to this fusion, when they started to incorporate these more soulful, synthesized elements, you know, they were, some of them were really crucified and criticized for selling out. Oh, yeah. Did you experience that? little bit of heat. Yeah, it took a little bit. People were confused. And it's unfortunate that that confusion was created by, I think, a very limited marketing strategy and marketing system that record companies formerly had, where, you know, you would be in a particular bin. You're in the jazz bin, you're in the R&B bin, you're in the pop bin, you're in the rock bin. You know, when people go into record shops, they don't want to be. confused. They want to just go to their area that they like and they want to find who they like. And most people don't really operate that way in real life. Now those barriers are all gone. You hear something that you like, you're going to turn your friend onto that thing. You're not going to worry about what category it fits in. You're going to just check this out. They're going to like it or not like it. They're going to tell somebody and they're going to tell somebody in there. They're not going to worry about what category it fits. So I was the marketing person's nightmare because my music could fit it, had some aspect of all of those different bins. I was part of each one of them. And they didn't know where to put it. And rather than modify a strategy, a marketing strategy to accommodate. People who were, especially of my generation, who were a part of many different musics, authentically part of many different musics and styles, you know, they forced us to have to choose. And having to make that choice or... apparently make that choice, you know, yeah, there were people who were really upset about it. And I received some critiques that were pretty harsh from the jazz community thinking I had turned my back, but the music was still too jazz to be pop. still too black to be pop, still too this to be that. You know, it was all these in-betweens. And it was a horrifying period. I think that the thing that saved me was I had been allowed to do the music that I wanted to do. So I was always having fun, and I was always grateful that the audience didn't buy in all of that and they accepted the music that I had offered. They accepted that because it felt good to them. There was something in it that resonated with them. And that really is the most important thing. I think it probably stems from what you've talked about. I think there's a difference where you are the kind of sole custodian and creator of your own music as opposed to... a vocalist that's something that, you know, that a record label is trying to push and trying to contort into different shapes. When you are, you know, the creator and you are the arranger and the songwriter and the instrumentalist and the vocalist, it's probably much easier to kind of stand your ground and do what feels right to you. You touched on it slightly that, you know, when you started moving through different musical worlds to, you know, that. the kind of jazz scene that you found yourself in originally, that you got a different response. I mean, sometimes there is more room for vocalists, female vocalists, than there are female instrumentalists. What was it like when you started to navigate this kind of more poppy R&B world? Yeah, it's very different. It's very different. The idea, I think, and some of the stereotypes of what singers are about, I got to experience what people would immediately think. Whereas, you know, if they only knew that side of me as a vocalist, let's say, they would talk to me differently. And sometimes it wasn't pleasant, you know, where there's this idea that singers just sing and they don't know anything. And I guess, you know, that can be up to a certain point. I guess that could be supported, you know. But that wasn't me. So when people would say certain kinds of things and I could check it. I said, wait a minute. You know, it was a different, it was a little bit different then. So I was like, wow, that's interesting. Also, I think that there are other things, though, that you learn. For example, in the more popular music side of things, there is a little bit more attention to certain kinds of details in terms of the performers to kind of protect their energy, to kind of protect. Their environment, now some of it goes way, way too far where, you know, the room has to be painted a certain color. But the idea is that people will buy into that on the basis of the artist needs this to do that. Where with the jazz musician, it's like you're lucky if you have a dressing room. So to see all... All of these different things and how the music and the perception of the artist and the perception of what's important can definitely frame the experience, you know, that I had and to see it from different sides, you know, because I've been on a lot of different sides of it. which has been so cool because in the background, there's a lot of things that are going on to make the foreground look and feel a certain way. And some of that is taken advantage of by the foreground. Sometimes they forget that they're not in it alone. So there's a lot of good things that have come from it. For me, it's an adventure. I enjoy every minute of it, really. How did you find that sort of being, because, you know, when you are behind an instrument, it's a different experience. You're not having to sort of be there. the front of the stage with one staring at you and you know you're you're channeling this musical flow through an instrument that is not your own body I mean did you find that a difficult shift or I mean going from to being on the center of the stage as a vocalist well you know because I was an instrumentalist and first and foremost the idea is that you try to get to the point that your instrument is part of your body. I forget about the keyboards when I'm playing and I don't know what other people do too, where they're just hearing me through that. Now, obviously it's a physical thing and it's in front of you. It does stand between you and your audience. I try to even place myself. on a stage when I can in such a way that I prefer to sit to the side with the tradition of you being able to not only see the keys, but to see me and to see my body. I'm not always successful at that because it depends on the venue size and all that type of thing. But the idea is to bring you into that space. You know, I'm going to come to you with the music. And I'm going to hope that in receiving that, then as an audience, we're working together for an experience. Because that's what music is supposed to be. It's supposed to be experienced. As a vocalist, that experience is a little bit different. There's less stuff in between us, probably. You have the benefit of being able to relate better because my body, it looks like yours. And so when I move or something like that, you might be moving too. And there's not this other mechanism that you don't necessarily do that you're having to cut through. So there's all that other kind of stuff. But at the end of the day. The music itself and the idea of its presentation and what you bring to it in terms of your joy, that's what translates the best. So could you tell me a little bit about your process when you go to write a song? You know, what do you have to do? Do you lock yourself away? Is it a collaborative process? Is it something that's very intuitive and free form? Is it something that's more structured? How do you go about your creating? I can say yes to all of that. It varies. It really, really does. Sometimes it comes out of just working with other people. talking and just playing together and then an idea gets sparked and you continue to develop that idea. Sometimes I'm by myself, you know, and it might have to do with something somebody said or something that I did or something I'm thinking about. Other times it may come from You know, an outside source that says, listen, I need a song for an assignment. I need a song for this motion picture or I need a song for this young artist that I'm doing or something like that. So sometimes it's like a song with a deadline, you know, give me something. you know, something. Turn it out. Turn it out. Exactly. Yeah. So it comes from a lot of different places. I think that the biggest, the biggest thing that people don't understand is that that process is aided by, by having skill. And I know that there are a lot of people out there saying, no, you know, you just flow and it just, yeah. You can do that too. But that's a heck of a gamble that what it is that you're going to do may or may not result in something that really reflects where you're coming from. Sometimes having some skill gives you that point of departure or if you get stuck. allows you to be calm enough to know that you'll find your way out of it because you know that there's different things that might be possible to kind of restart that creative flow and creative engine. So learning about the thing that you love to do, learning about it and learning about what other people's processes might be, working with different people, collaborating with people. That's a big deal because it informs you in a way of where you are, but it also gives you the idea that there's all these other possibilities. the basis of somebody else having maybe a certain slightly different point of view that might spark the third idea which wouldn't have happened with either one of you alone. So it's all good. You've had a very long and incredibly inspiring career. in that you've managed to kind of keep reinventing yourself in a way that feels like it's had a natural flow to it. And I think it's always really inspiring when you meet artists who haven't just stuck to the same thing, but have kind of... pursued something that's kept them growing and changing but a lot has changed in the course of your your career and I wonder you know what what you think some of those changes are and for young musicians who are perhaps starting off today you know what advice might you give them or you know how do you feel like things have changed since you started off? I think the biggest thing that has changed for me is that all of those categories have kind of like broken down. That's awesome. That's exciting to me, but it's also challenging because now when all the categories are broken down, you have a lot of stuff that's out there. Everybody has access to music. Everybody has access to recording. See, that used to be the prize for being really good and for having something to say. The recordings were documentation of. That movement, that trajectory towards something that was worth documenting. But now everybody has access to it, meaning that you have some stuff out there that is really not great standing right alongside stuff that is just incredible. And audiences are now having to find their way towards whatever is good, better, best, you know, as opposed to radio maybe dictating things going a certain way or marketing dictating things always going a certain way. So it's challenging for the artist because for the young artist, that can be a very mixed message. It can be very confusing. It can take you off your course. So I tell my students the first day of school, I remind them that, why are you doing this? Because if the idea is because you want to be famous or something like this, that's cool. but fame is a result of something. So what do you want to do? Let's not talk about the other part. Why are you doing this? What is at the core of your doing this? And if the idea because you love the music and you love the idea of being able to... Contribute to that in some way as you as you navigate and learn all of the different possibilities. If that's at the heart of what it is, you're on the right track. Because the other part is in this day and time, you have to be your own motivator. You have to be part artist, part entrepreneur, part. you know, business person, part collaborator, part psychologist, part, you know, you've got all these different aspects to keep going while you're developing. And it's hard. It's difficult. And there are no promises at the end of it that it's going to make you super successful. If your definition of success is getting a Grammy Award or being famous and playing Wembley. If that's what you're shooting for and that's the only thing that's motivating. you let me tell you it won't be enough and it won't probably happen very easily and there'll be no joy in the process so the idea is to get in touch with what I like to call your why why are you doing it and this isn't anything because when you figure out why you're doing something that spirit that motivation means you have to do it it's just because that's part of who you are And how you're going to do it and what you're going to do will come together and reveal itself because you're in tune with why you're doing it in the first place. So that has served me. And that's what I try to pass on to, you know, young people who are. really interested in something, it doesn't have to look like it did for your parents or everybody else. Our careers as creatives are almost like portfolios of activities that are all related to our why, but that may take on different iterations. So people say, well, why are you out playing? with so-and-so you should be doing your own thing because I like playing with so-and-so and I am doing my own thing playing with so-and-so and I'll have another opportunity to play and do my music at that at that moment at that time and then so-and-so will be playing with me or whatever it is the idea is I want to make music with great people who have real intelligence about where it is that they're going and an attitude towards serving the music and enjoying life. So excitingly, you've got this compilation coming out on Strut and it's, you know, you're going around touring and performing this music to, I imagine, quite a different audience to who it might have been, you know, back in 79. You know, what does that feel like to you to kind of to recognize that your music is still continuing to touch people and not just of the original generation that may have been there around when it was coming out for the first time, but to a younger generation who've got this from their parents, perhaps? Right. That's like the biggest compliment. songwriter or composer you know you you hope that their efforts and will be relevant long after you've recorded it or written it that's the ultimate compliment about something within it that resonates deeper than any chart number or number of hits or likes something that resonates deeper than that so that's exciting for me haven't done uh any touring specifically to the compilation just yet but we are intending to which would be really cool and to be able to perform that music you know I do at home in the States, you know, occasionally do sessions and things and special concerts where I do perform that music. So I'm aware of what that feels like. And it's awesome to see the mom and the kids all grooving to the same thing. It's really cool. And whenever I'm out playing, people always tell me, you know, oh, I'm... I know your music and I played this or, you know, we do it in my band or I heard Men in Black and then somebody said, listen to this. forget me nots and they said oh my god you know so that that recognition is super it's really really awesome I'm interested to know what is your favorite composition of your own what's the favorite song that you've that you've written because you've obviously had songs that I mean yeah you mentioned the men in black which was an incredible huge world hit I mean to a kind of crazy scale But I mean, was that was that one of your favorites or is it a lesser known, a lesser known number? You know, I don't know that I have a favorite because each each song, you know, it takes me right back to that day or that that time that we recorded it or that it was written. So I don't know. It's kind of like how do you choose your favorite child or something? You know, I don't know. But what's fun is to hear now people are sampling my music all the time. So I've heard all these different, you know, creative iterations of so many of my... my songs which is kind of nice and um that what I think I take away is just just to keep doing what I'm doing which is to enjoy enjoy it and try to do everything with a certain level of commitment and excellence that gives it an opportunity to be able to be inspiring to someone else So how did you feel when you were approached with a major, major Hollywood blockbuster wanting to remodel and reshape and recreate one of your best known songs? Well, it's an interesting story. I got, this is back in the day, you know, so I got this letter in the mail from 20th Century Fox, the film company. And they said, oh, please give us a call to pick up your one-time payment of $2,000 for a small sampling of your song Forget Me Nots in this new motion picture called... Men in Black. And I had seen the trailer. I go to the movies a lot. I had seen the trailer to Men in Black and it wasn't in there yet. So I was like, oh, wow, I just saw the trailers, the Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. This is going to be great. I said, well, they're going to use part of it. my song and they inserted they had a cassette tape and I said so check it out and then I put this cassette in and I started listening and I said wait a minute this is not small small thing this is a a big thing, a major use of this song. So I call my attorney and I said, well, I don't even know what to do. He says, okay, make a copy of the tape and send it to me. And I'll call you as soon as I get it. So, you know, you wait a couple of days because we didn't have FedEx then. This is before MP3. This is before MP3. FedEx, no MP3s, nothing. So I waited a couple of days and he says, okay, this is a copyright issue. You need to be sharing in the... ownership of this song as a co-writer a major contributor as a matter of fact and I think that you should ask for half and I said okay what did I know I said well do you think you'll get it he says no but I think we should ask for it because that that would be the right thing to do so we did and of course the film company says absolutely not of course we're not gonna do that so I just left it to my lawyer and he says well then you can't use her half now that's the whole music that's all the music that's us you know that's us playing on the track that's the original track of forget-me-nots with the new vocal that you know will will smith had you know and everything but everything is the same so if you took that out you wouldn't have that at all and this is like weeks away from this movie being released so i don't know whether that just sat on somebody's desk for too long and they didn't deal with it or if they thought i was It was really just going to go get that one-time payment, but we got half of that copyright. So that really was a major, you know, talk about life lessons. It's like, you know, learning that the music and the use of it has its own value, even aside from that, the value that it had given me. Now, Forget Me Not has been this kind of lesson moment for me over and over. I'm going to backtrack before it came out as Men in Black to when I released it. The record company didn't like it. It almost, by today's standards, it wouldn't have come out. Because they didn't like that whole album. Straight From the Heart was not received well by the record company. In fact, they told me, we don't hear anything on this that we could do anything with. Now, this is an album that had Forget Me Nots on it, Remind Me was on it, Number One was on it. All of these things that later became like big, big hits for me. Part of the business aspect of understanding what you're doing is being able to stand by the things that you really believe in. And that's what we had to do because they had literally told us, we're going to put it out there, but we're not going to promote it at all. So we had to figure out how to get it in front of the people. That was the idea. It's like we can't make people like something that they don't like, but you got to give them the choice. And so that's what we did. I ended up having to pull my little savings out of the bank to buy three weeks of radio promotion just so that I would be sure that it would get in front of the people in the different regions of the United States. And it blew up. People loved it. And it worked out. So that song has been a real interesting piece of valuable information aside from the music and it being fun to play and people loving it. and it being a little different for its time and all that type of thing. It also taught us some lessons about how to stand up. And stand by your own creations. And we're still having to fight that fight today. With the advent of the, you know, what I consider to be positive aspects of being able to get music to people with downloading and things like this, it left out of the equation the creators of the music. And that has to be part of it too. So, you know, again, forcing us to stand up. I want you to remember Those were good times we had Sharing the joy that we thought would last It was a lot of innovation I grew up and was just like a dream All things made me so crazy about you Was it your charm or your passion? It's not a sin to be getting nuts. Help me to remember. I want you to remember. Did we give up too soon? Maybe we needed just a little room. Maybe we just need a little time. Going as friends, giving the chance we can love again. She wasn't forever, he's not forever. I believe I want you to say I want you to remember. Bye.
