You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour. This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. The Hour is RA's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. Today's show has a bit of a DJing theme. We'll be asking a group of DJs to share their favourite tips for using Pioneer's CDJs. And Paul Wolford, aka Special Request, will be telling us how he put together his fantastic Fabric Live mix, which got the RA Recommend stamp earlier today. But first, it's behind the track. Track. This is our regular feature in which artists tell us the story behind tracks they wrote that went on to be classics. Octave 1's Black Water. It came out originally in the year 2000, but it's a track that continued to snowball for many years afterwards. What was at first an instrumental techno track, albeit a pretty emotional and uplifting one, eventually got re-recorded with a vocal from Ann Saunderson and an epic orchestral intro. It was a smash in clubs and on the radio around the world. I called up Lenny and Lawrence... Burden who explained the many chapters of the story behind Blackwater. I remember we were working in the basement at my parents home where we had put our studio, built our studio and uh We were just working on a 12 inch at first. And it just the idea of Blackwater was really one of our other brothers. We were showing them some how to do certain things as far as in the studio. And he kind of came up with the idea, their initial concept for it. And we just it just kind of grew from there We just kept adding to it at that time until we got a finished product and we felt good But you know all tracks feel good You did you did you never know what's gonna happen to any of the music until it actually hits the streets That wasn't the one we were focusing in on at the time It's always been like two sets of us. It was three older brothers, myself, Lawrence, and Lionel. We were constantly like just showing, you know, our younger brothers, Lance and Lauren, how to make music and how to operate the gear and stuff because they had constantly been watching us in the studio. And this was just part of one of those sessions where we were... showing um lauren how to operate a particular you know a couple pieces of gear uh the initial uh melody for black waters just basically was the result of of us showing him and him coming back like what do you think of this we're like man that's pretty good you know and we just started building on top of that um we just started i mean it's kind of how we do music still how we do music today is that you know one brother might come up with an idea and we all just kind of jump in the timing of you know of music is is so important i'm even with black water it took you know maybe i don't know it took a while for it to even really catch on um uh you know once again you know we we just kept we thought we had something really nice and we just kept uh working on it and and they get the idea just kind of just snowballed from the simple melody to the finished song well the main melody was uh Wow, I'm trying to remember what I think we used the Proteus strings at first. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it was it probably was some kind of dark, probably Yamaha bass line. I would assume bass sounds. It's been so long ago, man. I mean, man, wow, man. The song that. people know today as far as the main one that everyone keeps playing is we went back in the studio and we decided to do a stream mix. And it was the first time that Techno kind of met orchestra, Detroit Techno met an orchestra. And we went in and worked with the Urban Soul Orchestra. And we did a live string version of Blackwater with the music that we had composed. We did a license with a company in London called Concept. They gave us a budget to do whatever we wanted to do. additionally. Initially, it was supposed to be a video budget. We threw the video budget into... and that's how we came out with the piece that everyone knows. - We were over the moon. It was completely life changing. We heard the first strings just start to strike, you know, hearing them live. Yeah, it was something we just couldn't believe that, you know, we started this in our mob's basement and we were in the middle of London working with an orchestra. ♪ Just open up, just open up ♪ ♪ And let your love fly ♪ The lyrics actually, Ann was over in our studio, Saunderson, who actually wrote the lyrics and sang on Blackwater. And she happened to hear Blackwater. I think I played, I was goofing off on the turntables and she was like, what's that? She wanted a copy of it so she could listen to it on the way home. And on the way home, she called us and she said, you know, and I got some lyrics for the song. And she was driving and she was singing us the lyrics, just some ideas. And we were just like, you know what? We like it. "I like that, go with that." She would call us like every couple of minutes and have something different. And we was just like, "We love that, stick with that, keep going with that." And by the time she got home, she pretty much had finished the whole song. You know, we really didn't know it was really selling well. And at the time, we get a phone call from a really good friend of ours in Detroit, Mr. Jeff Mills. And he's telling us, man, you guys have a really good record there that you guys are working on. Every club he would go to, he would hear it. He'd say, man, you guys, that record is blowing up. And that was the original. version of it without vocals and stuff, you know. You know, as a musician, as a producer, once again, you think everything is special, but someone else saying it, especially someone, you know, of the caliber of Jeff Mills telling you that, you have to stop and pay attention. And that's basically what we did. We had to stop and pay attention to our record. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ It's obvious that the way people DJ has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. Companies have developed countless new alternatives to the traditional turntables and a mixer setup. But the one that's had by far the biggest impact and been adopted by the most people is Pioneer's CDJs. In 2017, these things are very much an industry standard. But how many of us use CDJs are fully aware of what they're actually capable of? We thought we'd reach out to a group of artists and ask them to share their favorite tips for using CDJs, and in particular, the CDJ-2000 Nexus. So, stand by for tips from Object, AG, James Abila, Purpur Purple, and Mesh. But first, here's the Berlin DJ Don Williams, who's regular at clubs like Berghain and Tresor. My first tip is using the master key. This is very handy if you want to get rid of the pitch bend sounds when slowing down or speeding up a record while finding the right tempo. If you engage the master key button, it totally eliminates all of those sounds. So if that's your intention, to get rid of that sound, you should use it. Otherwise, I mean, some people really like to have the human touch, so to speak, that you can actually hear how... or why you're just slowed down or sped up. The second tip is browse by BPM. Like most of the tips we're discussing today, it's best if you run your music through the Rekordbox software, which you can download for free from Pioneer's website. So to expand on Don's tip a little bit, when you load up your playlist, on the CDJ you'll usually just see track names but if you press the info button at the top the box appears with the artist name and BPM and so on. If you press the menu button at the top you can sort your tracks in the way Don mentioned. So hit menu, press down on the rotary dial to bring up the sort menu and then you can choose to sort your playlist by things like BPM, artist name, rating and key. I tend to use this feature when doing warm-up sets where I usually start very slow and tend to end up like... maybe 20 to 30 BPM faster in the end of the set than I began. And it's also very nice how you can rediscover tracks which you haven't maybe played in a long time. I find it very, very handy. The last tip I would like to share with you, it has to do with the media itself. So if you're... find yourself playing waves, AIFs, high resolution MP3s, if you can call it like that, you should consider taking an SSD drive rather than a USB thumb drive. I found out that using an SSD drive, it speeds up the whole process by two or three times. I realized that SSD drives have been really kind of a lifesaver for me in some situations because they sped up the process so much. I've got two... His object. CDJ tips, I guess. One of them is fun, but not very useful. And the other one's useful, but not very fun. I'll start with the less fun one first, which is I guess kind of obvious to a lot of people but maybe not so obvious to others, which is that if you're correcting the position of a track playing on a CDJ and you turn the wheel relatively quickly and aggressively with like a short movement, then you get this audible warble in the pitch of the record. So I'll just play this kind of melodic track now. push the jog wheel forwards quickly so you can hear what I'm talking about. Or if you do it in the other direction you get this. Which, I don't know, I find if I hear that when someone's mixing, then it takes you out of the zone a bit. The illusion's shattered a bit, if you know what I mean, and there's a really, really easy way around this, and that's just to move the jog wheel much more slowly, but over a longer period of time. I'll show you what I mean. Which you can barely hear. If you just kind of bear in mind to adjust the jog wheel as kind of slowly and gently as you can, then you avoid all of these jarring pitch ups and pitch downs. So that's like a really basic, not very fun, but I think actually pretty useful thing to bear in mind when using CDJs. The more adventurous thing that I could suggest is a feature that you get. on the CDJ-2000 Nexus and above, which is Slip Mode. It's a button that's at about 10 o'clock on the jog wheel. It says Slip, and when you activate it, it goes red, and you get a different, like a kind of loop readout display on the CDJ. Essentially what Slip Mode does is reconfigures the way that the looping and... forward and reverse direction work as well as the turntable break and turntable release and also the platter in vinyl mode. So if slip mode is disabled then when you enable a loop while you're playing back a track then when you exit the loop the playback will continue from wherever the playhead is. Whereas if slip mode is enabled then when you get out of the loop it will jump back to where the playhead would have been had you not into the loop in the first place, which means that the track stays in time no matter what trickery you do on top of it. So I'll just demonstrate that now with a track without Slip Mode on. So you can kind of see that the playback goes out of sync still in time, but the track will shift along by a few beats. Whereas if you turn Slip Mode on and try the same thing, you get this. And you can extend this as well to... to reverse and also to unquantized loops, which means you can do some quite fun stuff with like stuttering rhythms and glitches. So it's obviously pretty easy to overdo this kind of stuff. Leave it up to you how to employ that particular trick. My name is Purple Purple and I'm a DJ and producer. And I'm also part of the Bottom Up Club Nights here in Oslo, Norway. I'm gonna show you a little DJ tip on the CDJs today. You could create your own personal sound on it. I use the pitch and I love to use it on wide because then I can use the spectrum of the tempo. of the sound on it and this especially good if you want to like go from low BPM to high BPM this is really really good okay let's go So you can actually feel that you're increasing the energy in it and I love to use this. If I want to switch it up a little bit, I want to take it down. or want to take another direction in stuff, this is what I use. And that's my DJ tip for you. I caught up with James Zabila, who's known as a bit of a virtuoso on Pioneer Gear, and he's been a brand ambassador for the company. There's the not-so-secret deck switch, basically made for, like, beat juggling. If you press the sync button and then press it again and hold it in... What it'll do is it'll play whatever's playing on the other deck, it'll just seamlessly sync up and mirror what the other deck's doing completely. And you can just crossfade from one deck to the other. And the reason that's handy is I've had a few occasions where something's not working on one player. It could be just like a button stuck in where someone spilled a drink on it or something like that, or the display's a bit weird. So you can basically just stay on one player the whole time. player and that's really handy and another occasion is when I've had another act come in they wanted to take out all the other CDJs that are kind of in their way they want to set up all their controllers or whatever and they want to remove the player a link you're all the link players you can take them all out obviously if you just if you keep switching back to that one deck so that's pretty handy it comes from like the old hip-hop days where you're playing two of the same record and then just jump from one to the other, making little delays, you know, so you'd like echo the snare by just repeating it and cross-fadering over. So that's kind of where it came from. A good one, like another one, like if you come into problems with vibration in the DJ booth, is set the jog sensitivity to heavy because it can play havoc with your mixes sometimes. If there's a load of vibration and it's moving the platter around, especially if you're doing a manual loop, and you've got the loop points open, you obviously can adjust those loop points by turning the jog wheel. So if you've got those open and the vibration is changing your loop points, it can set you off. I like to use the auto loops as well. It's great if you need to go for a pee, you know that the track's not going to... when you come back and on the vibration tip as well i also the first thing i do when i come into a dj booth is i go around the back of the players and give the little link cable a wiggle and if the uh if the player light goes out if it goes great some trouble later in the night so in in that case then i'll use the backup usb or use usbs in each and another thing if you're not very organised like me and you've got really large playlists you just bung everything in it you get to the gig and you've got a thousand tracks and you're like scrolling through like oh my god it's just looks like hieroglyphics. In the heat of the moment, what you can do is you can, and this is also in the manual, but no one ever reads the manual, including me. You can push in the encoder and hold it in and you get little blue arrows up and down, and it's like page up and down. So on the new players, I think it's like you see eight tracks at a time. So you just, if you scroll down, you just see the next date and the next date and Like, I've done it a few times and the other DJs have been like, what's that blue arrow that comes up on screen? Oh, yeah, yeah, it's just a, you know, it's a page up and down encoder. I like to use the cue points as memory markers. So not necessarily actual cue points, but like for when something's going to happen, you know, like a vocal or something's going to happen on the track or maybe I just leave myself a stupid note that I have to, or whatever and amuse myself. So I've got like cue points going through a lot of my tracks just like, you know, this is where the ride comes in, this is where the, you know, the claps come in and you can actually name those things and on the new players. it comes up in the top left of the screen, what's going to happen at your next cue point. So it's really handy if you've got a load of new tracks and you don't know them very well. On a similar tip, I use the comments as well, because I used to buy a lot of records, I still buy a lot of records, but now I don't have to write on the middle of the label with marker pen. They can come up in the comments in your settings, so you can set it up you get track info and your comments scroll along so yeah until you know your records really well and know your tracks really well you can have that as an aid actually something someone mentioned to me last week was putting the um lcds display in another color yeah yeah i do that as well and that's helpful because uh like uh it stops you forgetting your usb key If you see like, oh yeah, you know, because I've got mine set to purple a lot of the time. And I can say, oh right, the screen's still purple, which means I need to get my SD card out or whatever. If I'm using an SD card. SD cards are the devil because they're just so small and you can easily lose them. Hey, I'm AG. I'm a grime DJ and radio host and some would say producer sometimes. For me, CGJs are an instrument and like a pathway. Sometimes I just use CGJs just to mix the next track. Sometimes I like to be creative and create new tracks and loop like by hand and like use the CDJ as like a manual instrument in that way like live looping and live cueing and you know playing about with it. I don't really use a lot of effects but It's mostly cue tricks that I play with with the CGJ. So yeah, that's what the CGJ is for me. It's like a way to mix tracks in, but it's also a way to like jazz up your mix. Let's set the scene. The year was 2016. The club fabric. I was on deck, I was playing a really angry sounding grind beat and then I just decided I wanted to switch it up. I wanted to, I don't know, get a bit of singing in. So I think I cued in a Rihanna track. It was her Jump On It remix. I cued it from where she brings in the chorus. And yeah, I was just literally button bashing the cue button. And she was just saying, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it. And it really opened my eyes to how much things you can do with the CDJ. I didn't even beat Match. It was a lot slower than the beat that I was playing but because I had taken out the bass and I've brought in the mids a bit higher you could just hear her voice over the really aggressive sounding grind beat and that was really cool for me. Bye. Thank you. Okay, so that was pretty crazy. Can you explain how you've achieved that effect? That was basically just two decks playing the same drum track on a CDJ-2000 setup. And then setting the pitch fader to wide mode, which basically goes between 0 BPM and whatever high number. And then if you keep it set to master tempo mode, then the Pioneer pitch detection algorithm will be... obviously trying to keep it in the same pitch and you get lots of interesting artifacts out of that and if you combine it with like a cue points loops and like the reverse uh toggle um You can do some pretty stupid stuff with it. How did you stumble upon this functionality or this hack of functionality, let's say? You know, it gets kind of boring up there sometimes. And like the gear is so well built, it's just kind of asking to be knocked around a little bit. So it kind of started from there. But also... Just like looking for interesting ways to, since my music is such, it's like a studio practice, quote unquote. It's like trying to find ways to kind of separate out different aspects of a song or a track or whatever and find interesting ways to use like a playback format in a way that's not just. you know, playing back a timeline on a laptop or something like that, just being more tactile. So this would be more of a live performance element for you? Yeah, like I like to have, you know, three or four CDJs. Like I'll break down different parts of my tracks to... two percussive sections and then maybe like a pads only section or whatever it is or it could even just be like the same file but duplicated across different players but a lot of it just kind of happens in the moment and just kind of like assembling something in a way that feels more natural and open than just a pre-planned set of moments in a night. So it would almost be, okay, it's time for a blast of this and to have some fun with it. Yeah, I mean, it's not the most ideal way to perform, and I'm always looking for other things that I can add, whether it's different, like... like adding a laptop to play different soft synths or different things like that. But I'm just, I'm really impatient with the idea of like MIDI clocks, like slaving to one master clock. I like trying to bring things together in a way that like... like things that aren't necessarily on the same grid, but trying to find ways to bring them together through different forms of syncopation. So I've been experimenting with using this VST called Scratch Track Pro, I believe it's called, to kind of, like, I have this CDJ-350, like the budget CDJ at home, and I'm trying to add it to my setup where I can kind of take a live audio input. into a laptop and then control it with that CDJ as a MIDI controller in a way so that I can play live synth or something like that or a sample and then have it kind of automatically loaded into a CDJ format. It becomes part of the classic CDJs and mixer setup. It's so industry standard. It's in every club and there's something that I like about it. the fact that you have this muscle memory of how to play back different sounds and bend things together in a way that's kind of universal or default. I like the fact that it looks default or it feels default. So I'm just, I'm basically like trying to figure out new ways to, yeah, like bring more live sounds into that same kind of physical setup in a way. If you've got your own CDJ tips, please feel free to share them with us in the comment section on RA. You're listening to The Hour with... resident advisor. The Fabric Mix series has been on a hot streak recently with killer entries from Nina Kravis and Cool Super. The latest in the Fabric Live series is just as essential. It's by Paul Wolford under his special request alias. The project started out as a sort of homage to the pirate radio stations Wolford listened to when he was young. But on Fabric Live... he shows that Special Request has come to encompass a broad range of up-tempo club music. When you think about it, mixes are often just as important as artist albums and dance music. And in this conversation with Wolford, you'll be able to hear just how seriously and deeply artists like him think about their mixes thanks for stopping by anyway thank you um you're playing fabric this evening that's right which is what brings you to town so i understand you first played the club in 2004 that's right yeah do you remember i do yeah it was it was in room one with uh de jules and um martin lansky and uh and it was great it was great but i I was, I was, I felt so rough. I'd had a friend's 40th the night before and I promised myself that I wouldn't be out late. And it got later and later and later. And it was like, I felt like death. And to this day, I think back and think, you idiot, why did you do that? You know, you're a big fabric, Davey. Yeah, exactly. And, um, And it was, you know, it was good. It was a great gig. I really, I really, I felt good about it. And Judy gave me some great feedback. You know, it was, it worked well. And, you know. De Jules and Martin are both exceptionally skilled DJs in their own right and lovely people. So it was great. It was a dream come true. And since then you've been playing fairly regularly and doing both Fridays and Saturdays, right? Yeah, I've got into every probably nook and cranny of that building at some point over the last few years. Has it been a case of the special request? stuff's been mainly Friday is that kind of what got you into those bookings yeah onto the Friday yeah definitely um and then you know there's been other things that have happened so like I ended up doing rins you know they used to do the boxing day sessions there so I did that once and um me and Howie B did room three one night you know sort of seven seven hours or so which was wild he's a an old friend of mine and that was great so you know I've really got to stretch out in there with that in mind then how large in your mind was the club looming when you were putting the mix together massive you know I think it's hard to it's hard to to pull the club out of it you know and it's it's the the good thing about it is when when they ask you to contribute to the mix series they don't give you any there's no prescription there's no you know that they and then that's what i love about the organization generally be that whether you're playing there or you know whether you record for houndstooth you know they just want you to do what you do and they trust you to give them you know something of quality And so, yeah, I think we had discussed it. We discussed it a couple of times in a very vague roundabout way. And then it was at Christmas and... This Christmas just gone. Just gone, yeah, and Rob... Rob Butterworth got in touch with me and he just said, right, let's do it. You've got three weeks, which was great. Three weeks? Thanks, Rob. Yeah, so, but luckily for me, from earlier on, last year we discussed it and so I'd kind of tentatively put a few things aside you know I'd had this little playlist going and that I'd forgotten about and also before previous to that I had two years of sort of well no sorry a year of going back and discussing another project another SR mix project, which didn't, which hasn't yet come to fruition. So I'd kind of, I'd been in the context, my mind was in the context of pulling out records and thinking about how to present such a project. And so what happened was I had all of that in my mind. And then I made sure that the way I was going to present the other thing was different to this. So, yeah, so basically I'd had these things floating around the ether. And then when they said, right, you've got three weeks, it's a case of going, right, okay, well, what about this and this and this? And then you start to... put it together. So was it a case that you had an overall plan of attack or a structure in your mind and then you selected the tracks or did you just have a bunch of tracks and then you wanted to make sense of them? Yeah, it was very much I had a bunch of tracks and also the first bunch was so disparate, you know, it was kind of like... Because that's how I always work with commercially released compilations. What I've always done is just got, you know, there's a playlist and you just fire stuff into it. And then at some point you sit down and assess it all and then take it from there. And it was funny because, you know... finally got to the point where I'm like, right, okay, let's assess it. And immediately it was kind of clear what the, you know, how it would not, you know, not the actual structure, but the rough, you know, it was, it was, it's like, it was like almost, I think it was almost, it was very close to the order in which I've been putting things aside. It was kind of like, so it was, it just. emerged itself. It was almost like, you know, without, you know, it's not that I'm channeling something, but it's, you know, I didn't have to think about it as much as I was expecting to. I was expecting to come to this, this bunch of disparate tracks with a, with a kind of like, right, how is this going to work? And it wasn't, it was just like, oh, right. There's a, there's a natural, there's a natural way up playing around with that. Okay. So how did the sort of exclusive tracks of the new music sort of factor into this? That sort of came about as I was putting it together. So, you know, you sort of, you're playing records together and you're getting a little vibe and you're just kind of working out. looking at okay well how how is this going to happen and then there were there were a couple of points where i thought right i need a transition i need a record that's a transitional record or i need a and then what there was one track that we um there was there was going to be a ur track on there i was going to ask actually if there was anything you attempted yeah i weren't able to yeah You know, I just have to say, I want this to be on record because, you know, the track Final Frontier was going to be on the mix. And we just, you know, I think Mike had a lot of things going on at the time. We just couldn't get hold of him at the time. Yeah, I see. And then we got a message back from somebody from UR later on saying, oh, you know, we would have made it happen. It was just a case of... We just couldn't make it happen on the day because we had so little time. So that was the one, there was one moment there of where I was, you know, I was concerned. And I was, you know, I spent about a week of every night just thinking, oh God, please, please, please. And then the other thing was Richard James, Apex Twin. because the rights to Cordylatron, the acoustic window track, they've reverted to him after Reflex closed. I see, okay. So we had to get in touch with him. Now he's not the most accessible guy. But, you know, having... said that he has opened up a little bit with his SoundCloud of late so but anyway we managed to make it happen and right on the day I think it was the I think it was the like the evening of the day where it was like right this is the last day we got a message back from him saying yeah you can use it so there's that and another track from him but Warp had the rights to the other track the um The track from Polygon Window. Yes. So, yeah, so for me, to get a personal approval from Richard James for me is a massive, that's a massive thing, you know. So how did you go about sort of demoing the mixes and messing around with stuff? Was that something you were doing in the computer? Were you just like playing on the decks? No, it was just playing, yeah. Just, you know, just getting everything into one, this huge, you know. grab bag playlist putting it on a couple of usbs and like there's a couple of things from vinyl that that i'd ripped so i could so it was just a case of just flipping through things so you can try and mix this out as fast as you can and then um and then yeah then going from there so yeah and there was And there was, you know, I'm saying it was pretty straightforward, but obviously within that process, there's always going to be, you know, a couple of moments where you're looking at things and you're listening and thinking, God, this is really quite obtuse. These angles are, you know, sort of, I need a protractor for this. But yeah. Yeah, I think the mix, the chord Eilatron into the Stingray track, that was a bit of a eureka. I was like, right, okay, this is early on. Okay, it must be nice when they look together. Yeah, it was great. So why did you opt to do it on vinyl and files and record that rather than do Ableton? Yeah, because the reason is because I... I did, I've done it both ways over the years. And the last, I did a whole, like a double compilation many moons ago for Renaissance, completely, you know, in Ableton, which was great. I loved it. And it was because my, my missus, it's because she, we'd been talking about it and she, she said that she loved that mix the most. And I was almost like, I was like, but why do you, don't you think it's really clinical? And she was like, no, I just hear it for being, for being, you know, I just hear the music on it. And, you know, I don't, I'm not thinking about the other stuff. And I think, I think Because she's not really into the jungle side of things, you know, the more extreme. She likes bits of it, but she's not really into the more extreme things. So I was kind of like, right, okay. So I had that in my mind as well. I was kind of like, that's really, you know, just weighing that up. And then also, you know, ultimately... Especially for the later part of the mix, and for the special request gigs that I do, I couldn't imagine. I don't even use Rekordbox. I don't play synced. I've never played off a computer in my life. It's just not something I've done. I've done it for studio mixes to get. to get a really lush level of detail so I could obsess over it as a way to explore that side, which is great. I think that it's not that I don't think it's valid. I absolutely do. But for this, I just wanted some roughness in there. I wanted the listener to feel my hands on the plastic at points. Yeah, sure. I mean, is there a mix that you think sort of embodies that? The Forest West Drive and the Dillinger, the sort of... And coming back from Shape Noise, the Shape Noise into Dillinger, into Forest West Drive, and then what ended up happening is I brought in the Dillinger tune again. And that was totally... You know, I didn't... That was just... You're recording it, because I recorded it onto a hard disk recorder, and, you know, that's recording. I'm just... playing and you've zoned out completely you know what it's like when you're playing and you you know when it's all happening you're not even thinking at all and it's just sort of mixed out you know Forest West Drive starts up and the the tension in that mix as well because what I realised later was that I'm sure that maybe I can find out from the guys but Forest West Drive that track Turtle Break, I think there's chorus on the drums. And I didn't realise that, but it almost felt like there's a real huge amount of tension because I'm thinking, God, is this a little bit wonky? Am I a little bit out here? Am I going deaf? You know, you question yourself, don't you? You have to. You have to question yourself. And I think there is some chorus. Maybe I'll find out later on. But anyway. So, yeah, we get into Forest West Drive and then I thought, actually, you know what, let's go back into it. Brought it back in. And yeah, yeah. So that's, there's the tension of it. Really, you know, it's there for all to see. And I felt good about it as well. I didn't have that. that was a bit by the seat of the pants I just thought yeah that's great let's keep it Bye. So my interpretation of the mix is that you've got kind of a chapter sting going on. It felt like, you know, there were sections you built up to something. You allow things to breathe and then you sort of switch gears. Was that how you were, in fact, thinking about it? Yeah, I mean... Generally, that's how I think of anything involving, you know, basically any of the DJ mixes that I've done. where they're not recordings from clubs. And sometimes in a club situation as well, I do think about things in chapters in a way. I mean, it's a good word to use. I've not thought about it with that analogy, but it's a good way to view it. Yeah, but then there's a point where you don't want to think as well. If it's happening in the right way, your mind switches off. But yeah, definitely, definitely. And you can see that. Yeah, I mean, there was a particular section that I wanted to discuss. It was just before you went into the jungle bit. Maybe you could talk us through it. So you have this Stefan Vincent track. It's kind of like on a chilled electro vibe. And then from there, you kind of build up to playing Dillinger. So maybe talk us through that section. Yeah. So the Stefan Vincent track, I mean, this is... I couldn't believe that track wasn't enormous because to me, it sounds like an absolute classic. I felt like it came out. I was actually surprised as well. Yeah. When I saw it was 2015, I was like, oh shit, I slept on this. Yeah. It's a real gem. And, um, and any time if I've, you know, if we've got people around and that's that records on, cause it gets played a lot around at my house. Um, I, or somebody will always say, what is that? Yeah, sure. You know, it's, it's a beautiful piece Yeah, the transition from that point into the rest of it was almost like, right, okay, I've got a friend who came to one of my gigs last year and he said, before I played, it was at Berghain actually, and he said, what are you going to play? And it was a special request thing and I said, I'm probably going to do about 45 minutes or so of... pretty electro sounding things. And he, he was baffled, you know, he's really into hardcore and all the history of hardcore and jungle and all the rest of it. And, and, you know, beyond that, but he was, he couldn't, he couldn't see the, he was like, what? How does that relate? And to me, it's just another part of non-4-4 beat-driven music, which, to me, it makes perfect sense. And the irony is I didn't end up doing that on that gig. I just went in straight balls to the wall. But anyway, that's another story. So yeah, this section. I wanted to take from the Stefan Vincent track, which is so melodic, it's so lush. To me, it reminds me of all the best sides of the most listenable side of techno. Super soulful. And then the true knot is a layer underneath it. That's one of yours. Yeah, that's right. A special request track. It's pretty much a very soundtrack-y kind of ambient thing. And then it's been EQ'd to within. an inch of itself so it's barely there but it is there as a texture and then Atomic Layers is actually just a spoken word thing from a very old Christian Vogel album that Sub Rosa I think Sub Rosa released it so between these two you're just kind of layering at that point that's right yeah so what happens is that Christian Vogel provides an end point to the first half of the mix essentially it's like the dividing line between the first half and the second half. Okay, and then you're going into this shape noise track and I really like this because it's almost like a Reese Baseline sound that's sort of signalling the arrival of the jungle section. Exactly, yeah. But it's not. That's it. You know, it's some maybe distorted guitar sound or something like that. Yeah, and when that track came out, it blew me away because I felt like it had all the power of a no U-turn thing, you know. Felt like sort of Ed Rush and Nico, but not. But this coming from a different perspective and someone who, you know, his background is different. And with Justin K Broderick, you know, from Godflesh, you know, there's a name that I know that I know his name from listening to John Peel, you know, going right back to the radio again in my teenage years. So for me, that's kind of like, right, OK, so that's a name that I know from listening to John Peel and Andy Kershaw and all of that many, many years ago. And then now we can draw the line through from... from one thing into another, and then, of course, Dillinger. And the mad thing is about that mix is that Dillinger was just lining it up so it's in key and then going, like, loop one thing and then just press start on the other. And it was, again, it was another one of those mixes where I thought, can I do this? Can I? It's pretty abrupt, really, but it's like, yeah, I can do what the fuck I want. Bang. All right, let's take a listen. New methods change the experience. And new experiences change man. In particular, in the field of music. waves penetrate very deep into the molecular and atomic layers of ourselves. Whenever we hear Sounds. We are changed. We are no longer the same after having heard certain sounds. And this is the more the case when we hear organized sounds. Organized. Find another human being. Just going back to this layering thing briefly, because we touched on it then, but you do have a few tracks where, I mean, you're playing like 30 seconds or a bit less in some cases. What was the thinking behind that? Yeah, I mean, I think it probably feels like that because I had to give them the timings, you know, for the CD. Yeah, I suppose my perception of it is like, yeah. So that's... That's maybe a little bit skewed because if you do it strictly by the timings of when your CD player or your computer clicks onto the next track, you could think, God, that was in and out. And a couple of them are a little bit like that, but yeah, they're just textural things. I mean, like the Amerta track, there's only a couple of elements of that. that it's in and out pretty fast. But then there's other times where I've just cut out all of the frequencies apart from the bottom end on things. Like on the Ed Rush. No, it's not an Ed Rush tune on there. There's a Trace. There's a Trace and Nico thing. Yeah. The Trace and Nico thing where Keith Fullerton Whitman's in. It was just a case of, right, let's... let's allow some space to put on the Fullerton Whitman track. And it's a case of, you know, you just pull everything down, but this really, really incredibly deep bottom end, which, I mean, that track out as well, you play that thing out, that Trace and Nico record, and it just sounds like it's apocalyptic. It's like, I didn't know you could go this low. Yeah, yeah, which is kind of, you know. I really love that, and that's one of the things that excites me so much about playing like this and playing these types of sets, is that I can go to a kind of extreme where, you know, many years ago I would try and do that at gigs when I've been playing under my own name, and, you know, somebody would always come up and go, what the fucking hell is this, mate? What are you playing at? There's people walking out over there, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. expectations are different but with this you know I can I can take it to those kind of extremes and occasionally heavier in a live setting talk us through the final section so you kind of go full circle with this because I mean you've started off on a sort of similar tip but then you're winding down it feels like you're layering again you sort of get into this run of like ASC and then you're ending with this uh abdul mogad track yeah so yeah talk us through that because the abdul mogad is um it actually appears earlier in the mix right that's right yeah he's there's a really interesting backstory with him i think he's um the story that i mean i've been it's it's been put to me that you know that this story may not be correct but but he's uh he's sort of um i think his background is that he's he's an ex-factor worker and he's just decided that he's going to make all this incredibly lush. And it was a retiring Serbian factory worker. That's correct. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And And it's interesting seeing if you read the titles of his tracks, they do relate, but maybe they relate too closely. But, you know, actually, no. In fact, the one conversation I had with somebody who was telling me this story, I read the track titles and I thought, no, actually, I think it is actually the real story. Yeah, I'm a believer. I want to believe. But Abel, yeah, he's incredible. He makes these soundscapes. that are very emotive and very, I mean, you could go for a swim in them, you know, and especially that one. It's very, it's a bit of a weepy. Yeah, it's a real weepy. And what I realise is that, you know, using it halfway through the mix or in the earlier section, I couldn't quite let it all bloom. I could open the door a little bit. And I realised when I was putting it together, I realised that the first time around I was thinking, I need to hear the rest of this. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Because you visit it earlier in the mix, just before you go into the Dexter bit, which I guess is the start of more of an electro flavour. Yeah, that's right. Have I got that right? Yeah, yeah. All right, let's take a listen. Thank you. Bye. you So were there any bits that you were particularly thrilled about where you were just like, shit, how did that come together? One of the earliest things that I was really pleased was Caustic Window into the Stingray track because I didn't know if we were going to get the rights to the Caustic Window track. So at any moment, I was so, you know, it was done. We had it recorded. And then I was thinking, God, you know. If Richard comes through and says no, that's like... Because the things before are set in the scene, the Alexa Perilla and then the telepathic dog from my EP. They're kind of like the beatless things where it's a mood, you know, it's just slowly coming in. And also telepathic dog, really, the first point of contact is the bottom end. You hear the bottom end rather than much more of it, and then slowly it comes out. So caustic window starts, and that's almost, that's like, right, we're off. It's the first big statement, isn't it? So if Richard had said no, or we just hadn't heard back That would have been, right, the first main statement out of the window. And then, anyway, he said yes. And then, so, but the blend into Solitude, the DJ Stingray track, in that I managed to, I felt that... I felt that the mix opened in the right way. And not only that, I managed to draw two of the, not my biggest influences, but two of the people that have inspired me in very, very particular and very, very resonant ways. I mean, what I take from those two people in different ways. ways is hard for me to articulate and so to be able to draw the line between them in the mix where it didn't feel as jarring as it could have done it could have been a you know could have been really jarring and I felt like it sort of set things up and then really you know sort of opens in the right way and it opens warmly as well because that's one of the things that a few people A few people have said to me about it. I think a lot of people expected a history of hardcore, which is valid, but for a different thing. And I wanted to kind of present maybe some slightly different textures with this. So you obviously cover a fairly vast range of styles in the mix. You know, you could almost say that what we've got here is kind of, you know, it's like a metaphor. It's indicative of like what you've been doing yourself over the last 20 years. You know, being able to wear all these different hats, adopt all these different identities and such. So you're still playing both as Paul Wolford under your own name and Special Request. How sharp do you think the delineation between the two is at this point? Do you treat them as pretty separate things? Yeah, they're separate entities entirely. Occasionally there will be an overlap where it'll be a quirk of circumstance. Last week... is a good example. I played with Young Marco in Barcelona and we did back-to-back, you know, part of his Deck Mantle Selectors Tour. And we did this back-to-back thing at the end where... I don't think either of us expected it to go the way it did and it was magic. It was like we were, it was one record on one and it was like we were brothers. It was like, at the end of it, we were saying, right, we're going to do this for 10 hours and I didn't expect that at all. I mean, you know, I knew it would be good. Yeah. I mean, you're not two DJs I put together on paper. This is it and he, He said, yeah, this is a bit of a wild card, but here we are. And the territory, I could feel, we both could feel that we could have gone anywhere, really. We really could have gone anywhere, more so than in other situations. So occasionally, you're booked under the name, and then you have to go beyond even the... you know, the already wide range of special requests, which was brilliant. But yeah, the differentiation is quite stark. You know, I would never, generally I would never play Jungle, especially if I gig under my own name. even though people come and ask me for it now as well. So occasionally you have to be strict about these things. Yeah, especially for the benefit of the promoter sort of booking you for a particular thing. That's right. I mean, if it was up to me, I'd just play. everything all the time but then it's you can't do that it just doesn't work like that for sure so if we were to broadly characterise it Paul Wolfe it is house and techno And beyond, you know, and way beyond that, but where I think the easiest way to say it is that with the things that, the DJ sets that I do under my own name, they're not going to get into, they're not going to get into sort of beyond 140 BPM. tops. It's never going to go past that. It will, you know, whether it goes into techno occasionally. See, where they may overlap a tiny bit is with a little bit of the electro sort of thing. That's where there is a tiny overlap, but beyond that, there's nothing. Yeah, yeah, I see. Let's finish by you telling us your favourite fabric. mixes or I mean you could pick one but yeah are there any like massive standouts for you yeah you know there's been tons but the two the two that I still that I still absolute all the time Matthew Johnson's that live set That is just, it's exceptional. And there's a section of four tracks. I mean, it's all amazing, but there's a section of four tracks in the middle of that that makes me feel things that I can't, I could never put into words the emotions. I mean, it's dark. It's just mind-bendingly good. And then beyond that, Riccardo Villalobos. you know, all his own material and right there you go. I mean just exceptional you know really really inspiring and really just yeah mind-blowing. Okay, that's it for the hour. Thank you for listening. On the next episode, we go for a drive across London with Actress, who sat in the front seat and tuned in and out of his favourite radio stations.
