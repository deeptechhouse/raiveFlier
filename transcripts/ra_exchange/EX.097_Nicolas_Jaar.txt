Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Nicholas Schar is what they call a bright young hope. The recent graduate of Brown University released R.A.'s number one album last year. and garnered the top spot in our readership's poll of the best live act as well. The Clown and Sunset boss has put a lot of his energy of late into building a bigger live show with a full band, one he took out for the first time in a while at this year's Mutech Festival. We talked to Jarr at the event as part of our live RA Exchange series. Find yourself a home. Find yourself a home. Find yourself a home. Find yourself a home. Find yourself a home. Hello and welcome to the last of the RA Live Exchanges at UTEC 2012. My name is Todd L. Burns. I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. And today I'm joined by Nicholas Jarre. Thank you for joining us. Thank you. You recently finished school, right? A week ago. Congratulations. Thank you. Does this mean you're touring all the time now? You don't have to wait for breaks? No, it does not mean that. I want to at least have... I want to turn the school time into making music time. So I think the touring is going to be similar. One of the things that you said in a number of interviews is that actually the school provided a nice balance for you. You would read and study, and that would actually play into the music that you make. So I'm sure you're going to have to find time now to sit down and read and study. Yeah. Also, one thing that school does or did, no, does now is, oh, there's all these books that I couldn't read because I had other books that they were making me read, right? So I feel like there's this like post-college reading list that you end up having just because of the things that you didn't have time to do. And so I feel like... There's some residue of it that will keep me at least intellectually stimulated for a little bit. What's at the top of the list? A lot of Perec, actually. Why him? I don't know. I read a little bit of him and I was like, whoa. What was his stuff? I mean, for those who are not familiar with Perec. I don't know. It's just like I studied comparative literature, which is like, and I studied mainly like the theoretical stuff. And I took as many classes that were about theory. And Parekh has this way of just talking about literature. Sorry, has a literature that talks about things in a theoretical way, kind of, to a certain extent. And that just... pleases me. I enjoy that. And so, yeah. You did your thesis on Faulkner? Faulkner and Derrida, yeah. Okay. Why Faulkner? He seems like a very fascinating individual to me. I asked myself why Faulkner many times. No, it's actually more boring than it seems. I really wanted to actually write on Specters of Marx by Derrida. It's a book that I think is incredible. I don't understand two-thirds of it. I mean, it's not like that. But the little bit that I did understand... like seemed to me like there was something there really special. I didn't know what it was. And then I was speaking to my advisor and he was like, you should maybe think about Faulkner in conjunction to the ideas that you like about this book. And so that's how it came about. It's not like I wanted to write about Faulkner because writing, trying to write a thesis about Faulkner is just kind of a... Crazy idea. What were some of those ideas that you were talking about with your advisor that were so interesting? Without going too far down the rabbit hole. That's what I was trying to see, where I can stop so that it's okay. Mainly, the idea is very, very broad. There's like a sense in Specters of Marks that there's past, present and future are just like let's do away with that for a second and let's think about things in a more spatial way. That is very, I like that a lot. I like that musically. And my new set actually, the one yesterday night. is similar in that way. Before I used to have a very linear progression. Always a little faster, a little faster until the end was some form of like, or I tried to make it some form of like, epitome, right? And now it's more like build up and then, you know, texture and then build up and then texture. And so trying to kind of space it out in a more kind of, you know, like as if it's in a place as opposed to just a linear musical progression. So that's kind of the thing that... in Derrida's work is so obvious when you're reading. His argument is not made linearly either. It's all over the place. And Faulkner is the same way. So that's one way I can go without going down the rabbit hole. I ask all these questions about these because obviously you've mentioned that it feeds into your work so much, but also because I was really struck. by your live show last night and that there were, it didn't seem to follow a linear path and I was kind of struck by these lengthy passages where it was just waiting and I think it's a tough sell to an audience at a big place to be like, all right, we're gonna... build here for a while. Yeah. And I'll give you a little bit of a release for a minute. Yeah, I realized that yesterday. It's a new set, so I'm learning still. I'm not sure about it, but I'm not sure about some things about it. Mainly, I'm sure about. I'll tell you one very simple thing. The first 20 minutes are crafted so that it's just a build-up for 20 minutes. And then trying to keep the intensity of that build-up into the tiniest silence. And Will, who plays the saxophone, has built a loop. with his using like textures or whatever that he's doing. And so I thought naively that the emotion would get transferred into that tiny moment. Instead of a release, bringing, you know, the emotion into this tiny, like non-existent almost space. But that doesn't work because people are talking, right? And this is not that it's bad that people are talking. I don't really care. It's more just people are talking and it's the reality. And it's not silent. And so the fact that that happens makes those moments more. seem like pauses, if anything. And so that's just ineffective. That's me not thinking that people would talk. It seems like context is hugely important to your live sets and how you're going to be able to pull these sorts of things off. Yeah, absolutely. What you would want to do it. monument or metropolis would be hugely different from the mercy or something yes absolutely yeah it's i mean that's that's what makes it incredible also to just to do to perform right is that If it was the same space every time, it would be the same music and it would be the same thing, you know. And the fact that here it was different people, I mean, it's just, yeah, context changes everything, yeah. Where did you find these guys who are in your band? I have been making music with Will, who plays saxophone and keyboard, since I was 11 years old. I actually learned how to make music by playing the piano. and improvising. I took a couple lessons till I knew what a C minor chord was and then I got bored. It seemed like knowing the clues to a game and I was like, no, it's more fun when you don't know. And so then I just started improvising constantly with Will, like three or four times a week. We would just play forever. Him with a saxophone, me with a piano. Then I started making electronic music, but Will has always been the person that I feel closest to in terms of anything related to music. And so naturally I said, Will, find a guitar player. I mean, it was that simple, because Will knows more people than I do. So he just found Dave. And Dave is obviously incredible. When you wanted to put together a live set with a band, it's obviously a strange combination, right? A guitarist, a saxophonist, and you. Was that always the, you said, go find a guitar player. It was immediately in your mind, I want this, this, and this, and we can do it all with that. Yeah, I don't know why, but I mean, it was more like... Will definitely has to be part of it because it's Will and because he understands everything that I'm trying to do. And then I always wanted to play with a guitar player. Always. And Dave is actually more of a, I mean, he's not more of a bass player, but he is like really a next level bass player, but I have him play guitar. So that says a lot about the way he plays guitar too. How does he play guitar? Like a bassist. It's all riffs. It's a lot of riffs and then a couple chords. but it's like the idea of having sub-bass kick and then guitar riffs on top is exciting for me because it's like we can have both worlds. It's very difficult in terms of EQing and in terms of many things. It's very difficult to have like... like a real bass line and a kick and a sub bass and you know it's just kind of annoying so I like kind of spacing everything out so you can hear everything Did you know that you wanted to be in a live band from the beginning when you first started making music? I mean, was that always the goal? Because obviously you started out just making beats and sort of tracks, I guess. Well, the first live set that I ever did was at the Marcy, 2008. I was still in high school. And it was with Will. The first thing I ever, I mean, before I even played solo, the first time I ever played was with Will. So, I mean, I think, I don't really remember, but I think it must have been in my mind. Tell me about the label, Clown and Sunset. It started 2009 or so. I guess labels... My 19th birthday. Really? 2009, yeah. Why your birthday? I don't know. It was kind of like... I had realized that... I was doing certain things with Wolf and Lamb that I really enjoyed/enjoy today. And doing things with Circus Company that I really enjoyed and enjoyed today as well. But there was a whole thing, there was a whole range of music that I just could not, I felt like I couldn't be putting it out. And I just needed to create the outlet myself. I mean, it was more out of convenience. Who did you start it with? Just Nikita Kazim and Sol Keita. And these are friends that you met in school? A long time ago as well, yeah. I'm trying to just, for now, well, it's changed a little bit, but from the very beginning, it was always kind of more... people that have been important in my life in not only musical ways, like Will, for example. And Will will have his first EP out on Clown of Sunset as well. And Dave and I, as Darkseid, come out on Clown of Sunset as well. It's kind of more of a family thing. It's more than just a label, though. It seems like I've seen you describe it as like an art house, almost. In terms of the fact that I guess today it can't just be, I don't think a label is only ever just a label. You know, it's not about just putting out music. I am interested in having an aesthetic to our showcases. You know, that's already more than just a label, I think. And then also like what I did in PS1 where I improvised for five hours straight with Will and with a fabulous dancer and a filmmaker who's filming her. Like this is the type of stuff that is exciting to me in terms of new ways for me to give music. and that I think the structure of a label can maybe help. or a structure of whatever that is. Tell me about that improvisation for five hours. Obviously, you said you've been doing stuff like that with Will before, so it must have been a little bit second nature, but it seems like five hours is a really long time to be playing. It was a long time. It was also at the end of a tour where I did like 16... gigs in a row every day so it was very stupid. Well the thing about improvisation is that since I started like everything that I do today I started it when I was young improvising right. The way I make electronic music the way I just make music in general. is through improvisation. And the way I made music at PS1 was the way I make music. So yeah, it is second nature to a certain extent. Although usually I'm not in the studio for five hours without taking a break and with like 500 people around me. That's the only difference though. What do you, when you're improvising, are you using a keyboard? Do you set loops? I mean, what is that? What are you doing? Alone or at PS1? At PS1. At PS1, what did I do? So, I actually really like the story for some reason. I'm probably the only one who enjoys it, though. I had been in Brazil like a month before, and these guys got in touch and said, we want to take you to this record shop, which has never happened to me. It was great. We just went to a record shop, and I bought a lot of records in Sao Paulo. And then I left them in New York, went on my tour, got back to New York and had a show at Music Hall and then the next day I had a show at PS1. So I had no time to listen to my records. And so then I just took my records and brought them to PS1. and I just started sampling them live, like listening to them, you know, everyone could listen, and then just started picking the loops out and doing that live. And so that was really improvised, because I didn't even know what was inside these records, you know. And so I did a lot of that. basically and a lot of programming in the computer which sadly to this day it's difficult to show to people, you know, like what you're doing. You're doing a lot, but there's no real way of showing, you know? I think that's the toughest thing and obviously the biggest reason why a lot of people try to have bands or something or have this performative aspect because it's really tough for people to wrap their head around. Yeah, it really sucks. I don't get it. I don't know what God is thinking. No, because it's great music, but it's like, oh, you cannot see what, you can't see anything. You know, it was great when Jimi Hendrix was playing guitar, because you could see him play guitar. That was a thing, you know, that's wonderful. Like, you can't see, I would love to see Fly Low, you know, do, making the actual music, like, looking at the screen, but that seems like such a stupid thing to do, like, looking at a screen But even if they showed the screen, most people wouldn't even understand. That looks interesting. Which is weird because the complexity of making that music is huge and I think it would be very beautiful and telling. to understand how it's made. I guess it's just coming up with an interface of being able to show people exactly the processes. I want to be a really good dancer. Yeah. Are you a good dancer? That's not for me to say. Have you ever been told you're a good dancer? No, not necessarily. Maybe I should not dance. I mean, only when I'm having kind of like half a good time I start dancing on stage. I don't really think about it, though. I don't really know how I dance. I try not to look at videos of me playing because then it freaks me out. Do you listen back to live recordings, though, and stuff? Yeah. It's really depressing, though. I hate it. Why? It's just, like, annoying. Because it's, like, so much worse, you know? Always so much worse. So, like, what's the point? I don't know. Do you feel like you're a little bit too self-critical about these things? What I mean by so much worse... What I mean by so much worse is that it's... like performing is so much more different than listening, obviously. So when you're listening to your own performance, I mean, it's just like two different things, right? And the experience of giving someone music is no matter what, I mean, no, this sounds a little crazy, but... I'll say it anyways. No matter what people tell you, the act of giving music isn't a psychological act, I think. I think it is like an emotional act. I think it's a sentimental act. I think it has like some form of like... Not just rational power, right? And so, like, yeah, listening to a recording, you lose that. You lose the fact that you have people here. If we were doing this in a studio, it would not be the same conversation. You know what I'm saying? And so, everything obviously changes. I mean so much worse in many, many ways. Also, the music is worse than you think it is, in a way. But, like, there's no karma, there's no spirits, there's no warmth. And the music does lose when it doesn't have those things. You say spirits, and that's something, a theme that seems to run throughout your record. your records in general. That's something you've talked about a lot in interviews. Are you a spiritual person? I think absolutely. Are you a religious person? Depending on what that means to people. What does it mean to you? It just means that... Okay, how am I a spiritual person? Let's see. I can ask a different question. No, that's a good question. It'll take me like maybe 10 more seconds. Okay. So when I'm making music, whenever I make the songs that end up being songs, because I make a lot of music and a lot of it doesn't go anywhere. But when I make the songs that truly feel like music that will be shared, it does feel different. And there is like certain things that happen in my mind and in my body that feel different. I don't know if this is spiritual or not, but I remember making most of the songs that... I've ended up playing for four years in a row now. And so what I mean to say by that is that, so imagine you make today a song that you're going to end up playing every night of your life for the next 10 years. That's not really what being a musician is, but whatever. I feel like when you're making the track itself, you're like recognizing it in a way because it's so part of who you are in this like, there's no present time, you know, past, future thing. You're like recognizing it. And I think I'm spiritual in that way, that I feel like I recognize things that like I haven't seen before. I like to think I... When you're making music, is it... I guess what is that moment of realization? Is it when you put two things together that just fit in just a very unnatural way or natural way? The way it feels when you can tell that it's a song that will be a song, right? It's more like, oh, everything is just happening and you're not doing anything. It doesn't feel like you're there. And so I don't feel like I'm doing anything. I just feel like it's happening. And then, oh, the song is done. Great. Of course, you have to shape it, right? Well, I try not to, actually. I think there's some beauty to, like, oh, this is what happened. And, yeah, there are five minutes of buildup. And then there's, like, ten seconds of silence. And then... it hits again. Like, oh, that's the way it had to be. I'm not going to turn it into a more tech house song. Just not. That's one of the things I was so interested in the album. It seemed like... There weren't really arrangements, per se. There were, but they were strange arrangements, arrangements that I hadn't really heard so much before. I wonder if that's... I guess it's pretty natural for you to try to, or to try not to inflict too much of your will on it and to just let it happen. Yeah, well, I mean, I think there's a difference between like, oh, we should go to the bridge now, right? Like the idea of, oh, now we should have a bridge. I think that idea is different than it's just happening and oh. Now there's like a water sound. I'm like, great. You know, it's, oh, that just happened. Like, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if this repeats again. Like, but I do want to say that where there is structure, and I'm very, like, serious about it, is... in putting a song next to another song next to another song with this and that transition because at least with the last album and with the next one the truth of the matter is that I had all those songs made and they were done and the structure came at the moment of making the album itself. So that was very much like, yeah, where's the bridge? That's when I was asking myself that, but in terms of songs, not in terms of, like, in terms of the album, not in terms of songs, yeah. There's also this, like, running water through most of the album, it seems like. Why? There's running water towards the beginning and at the end. But what there is throughout the whole album is me, is my voice whispering actually. It's really weird. It's just throughout the whole thing. I don't know why that is, or at least I don't want to say. The water at the beginning is because the... The second song, well, the first song is, the beginning is this collage of Vito Conchi, this artist, talking about this body of water that I just felt like it had a lot to do with the things I wanted to say with my music. But Colombe, the second track of the album, talks about Christopher Columbus arriving, you know. And I just like the idea of the song being about Christopher Columbus and being on a boat and arriving somewhere. I don't know. Sometimes you have to invent stories for yourself. So what's the story with the new album? You mentioned it's done? It's close to done? No, it's not done. I just have a third. of it probably and it's weird because i have the like the third that i do have is very like like choir church based but then the stuff that i'm more interested in now is very kind of like Jungle of the future, and by jungle I don't mean the drum and bass jungle. I mean, like, a jungle. I'm pretty sure most people would have guessed that. Oh, okay. I mean, I don't know. Who knows? Jungle's so cool that, you know, maybe... Jungle, the drum... What were you reading as you were making some of this stuff? What were you studying? What's kind of the new album? Yeah. Has that taken shape yet in your mind? No. Yeah. I don't think I can even talk about the second album yet because what I have of it is like certain very important songs that I know I want, you know, there and I'm not going to put out for sure. But I, I just. just like I said now like there's this church idea and then there's this jungle idea and so we'll see where it goes you know I don't know I don't know where it will go yet what is it about churches so interesting to you my mother told me this story about me taking me into a church when I was like one years old and like me like screaming but not crying just like screaming at like the church and like while the choir was going and I just like really tried taking myself there What was I thinking when I was screaming? Maybe that has something to do with it. I don't really know. It's stuff that happens. It's because I'm spiritual. So instead of whispering over it, you'll be screaming. Maybe. I don't know. What do you remember about Chile? About Chile? That's the problem. interviews people have even gone to the extent of being like, so did you play the pan flutes when you were in Chile? And the thing about Chile is that I remember KFC and I remember being in a French school with terrible French teachers. Terrible in the academic, terrible. But you said it was pretty formative. I'm sure it was. I'm sure it was incredibly formative. Just like KFC must have been formative in some way. But yeah, I don't know. No, I think what's formative is just no matter what, between the ages of two and nine, you're really becoming something. Like becoming a human being. So I think there must be something there. What would you regard as your home? Is New York your home, would you say? Not yet, because I've been disliking New York a lot lately. I don't know. I guess Providence. Sorry? What about New York? It's just annoying. I don't even want to talk about it. There's so much that's annoying about New York. I don't know. Let's see. I lived there for four or five years and I moved overseas and I feel like I romanticize it now quite a bit. I only remember everything except for the rent that I was paying and the fact that it was never quiet. in any place. I guess what happened, at least to me, in terms of New York, is that I lived in Providence for four years, which is like a nice little quaint city. It's also not that, but where Brown is, is. And so, and then between that and being on tour, which is just craziness, like going back to New York seems like... If I go from touring to New York, it seems like going from craziness to craziness. And that's just not healthy, at least for me. So I'm not really, I don't see it as a home because I, yeah, I don't know. I don't really know. I haven't come to terms with it. I just graduated 10 days ago, so. I'm still thinking whether I want to live there or not. Where else would you consider living? I really, it's what I've been thinking lately. I'm not sure. For some reason, I really like LA, but I don't drive. So that's problematic. It's very problematic. And I love Lisbon, but I don't know if I would live there yet. But maybe, I mean, I hope one day I live there. What do you like so much about Lisbon? It's just so sad. It's such a sad city. And sad in the most beautiful way. Not like everyone's sad, but like everyone's really happy, if anything. I don't know, there's something like really passionate, but in not like a flamboyant way. It's passionate and like dark blue, fado, you know. I don't know, I just, I love the city and I love the musical culture there. Food, I don't know, it's five hours away from New York, which is strange to think about. Yeah, I don't know. What have you been listening to lately? Good question. I'm sure I have been listening to something. Or were you just finishing your essential mix and that was... Good point. Look at that. I was listening to so much music because of that stupid mix that I just stopped listening to music. No, that's not true. There's a lot of interesting music on that, so maybe we should talk about some of those things. Sure, we can go there also. Obviously, you're mixing... Well, let's go for the obvious route. There's NSYNC on there. There's Beyonce, Jay-Z. And it seems like you have a real love of pretty pop. orientated music. You never shy away from mixing those two things. Well, so... At Brown, when I used to be there, it sounds crazy, but I used to go there, I would DJ maybe every week and maybe twice every week for my friends and other kids. And those... Performances, they weren't performances, but things. They have nothing to do with anything like last night. It was me playing Sean Paul and like, you know. It's College Kids. Toxic by Britney Spears, which I think is the best song ever. But actually, I actually love that song somehow. Maybe it's a good song, maybe it's a bad song. I don't really know. I just think it's amazing. It's a pretty good song. I just like it. I don't know. Anyway, so I do, and I've mixed Seth Troxler with Britney Spears, because I know both of those things, and sometimes it fits well. What do you look for in a pop song like that? I mean, there's got to be some sort of thread. I mean, are you looking for a really just well-constructed, great arrangement? No, it's just like when there's like actual emotion or like actual like swagger in like a pop song and like the beat is made by someone who's like, you know, who like knows what they're doing. It can be incredible. Like there's, I mean, this is obvious, but like... Dr. Dre and the Neptunes, like, did make some amazing electronic music, you know? And, like, pop music did take a lot from that. And that NSYNC, it makes me ill. I mean, just listen to that track. If anything, it's like, I'm sure some DJs could put it on their sets today because that's kind of where things are going slash went, you know? And, like... I don't think we should shy away from using music as material. It's like, it's all the same. It's all music. If the set takes it there, it takes it there. But for the essential mix, I'm aware there's a lot of pop music and there's classical music, but I was just trying to truly just show this is honestly things that I've been playing in the past six months, edits that I've been making that there's nowhere else I could have put them. But beyond that, if there's 10 minutes of classical music, this specific song by Marat Marais, if it goes on for too long, it's because during my childhood, that song went on for too long. Because my mother played that song too much. And yeah, I could have put it in for two minutes. I wouldn't have been honest to you if I had put it in for two minutes and made an edit, you know? And what happens at the beginning of that song is that there's Aphex Twin on the left speaker and Maha Maha on the right speaker. And then they start kind of, and Aphex Twin starts trying to like go to the Maha Maha side. And then Maha Maha wins, the violins win, and they go on for 10 minutes. And the song before that is There Is It's what the guy is saying. So, I mean, just trying to tell a little story. That's all. I really enjoyed the intro to it. That thing with Angelo. Badalamentia. Is that on some sort of like extra disc? It's on YouTube. Okay. He gets so frenzied. Yeah, it's beautiful. I like it. Yeah, I remember the first time I saw that a while ago. I don't know, sometimes you like see a video and you feel the person's emotions and that's great. And it stays in your mind because it's like so apparent that he was feeling something when he was explaining. And then my girlfriend had it on her computer because someone else had shown her like two weeks ago. And I was like, that's how it has to start. How'd you go about constructing? that mix because it seems like it would be a tough tough job um well there were certain things that i certain edits that i really and that i really like i've been playing a brown or whatever and that i was like oh these should go in it but Yeah, no, it was more about... But do you go about it where you construct, like, here's a 30-minute bit, and then here's a 30-minute chunk, and I can kind of connect them, or is it all one-go DJ set style? Yeah, it's more like 30, 40-minute stories. And then it's like, oh, okay, so this is the thesis of this story. what's like, what comes after this? Like, what happens after this chapter? It's in chapters, I guess. How many chapters are in this? Oh, I don't know. I wouldn't be able to say. I would have to look at it, I'm saying. But there is, I mean, the moment where there is no God, right? That edit of The Electric Prunes was very much a moment where like... there's a break and it's, what do you do after you realize there's no God? And then Pete Tong comes in and tells you there's no God. I can't wait. In two weeks, I'm going to be able to finally post it without the Radio 1 stuff. It was very difficult to listen to it with the like 30 Radio 1, like crazy. these sounds, I don't even understand these sounds. They go on for like three minutes and it's just like, I mean, I just hope that people don't think that I put those things there. Where do we go from here? You graduated. You have, I assume, many tour dates during the summer, but what's after that? Who knows? I'm touring until October 1st. And then, oh, and then Dark Side album, hopefully will be on time and will come out in November. Tell me about that project a little bit. It's you and the guitarist? Me and Dave, yeah. The guys at the right of me left from the other side. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Well... I was making music with Dave on the road last year, last summer. And I mean, I've always wanted to make rock and roll or like something with a guitar. What rock and roll people do you like? It doesn't seem to be something that's readily apparent in your influences. Yeah. Well, I guess the question is what rock and roll people did I like, right? Because I really liked rock and roll or guitar stuff for a while and now I listen to it less. Although I did have a moment where I loved the Black Keys Brothers album. I really liked that. I thought there was something amazing there. I don't know what it is though because I listened to everything else. see where that comes in. Maybe it's just Danger Mouse. I think he produced that. Maybe not. I don't know. But I really, really liked Pink Floyd. I mean, it's just... That's the most obvious one. I listened to Pink Floyd for like 10 years. Which albums in particular? Which songs, actually. Because I'm very song-based. I don't necessarily like the whole of Dark Side of the Moon. I don't like the whole of The Wall. I like Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun. This track is just amazing. I love Echoes, but the one in Pompeii. They do it live in Pompeii. It's just like the most beautiful thing. I find it interesting that you don't like albums so much. I like some albums. Or maybe it's with them. Sorry? Maybe it's just with them. No, with Pink Floyd. Yeah. No, yeah, I like some other... I don't know, I like some albums for sure. Just with Pink Floyd, I'm not a fan of... Yeah, Set the Controls of the Heart of the Sun and Echoes in Pompeii are huge influences. I can't even begin to explain to you how many times I listened to that. So is that what this project sounds like? No. I don't think so. I mean, it has a lot of Dave also. So you would have to ask Dave also what it means to him because this is not my side project necessarily. I mean, it's really like a whole other thing. There's a part of Dark Side to me that I'm excited to bring noise and intensity in a different way than my other stuff, right? I guess the intensity in my own music might come from building up, from releasing, you know, from... from reverb, you know? Whereas with Dark Side, I want it to be about noise, about distortion, about, you know, just thunders and like, it's a different aesthetic. I'm trying to... There's still build-ups or is it a constant? Yeah, there's still build-ups, but it's like more about noisy build-ups. I mean, I don't know. We're still working on it, you know? We're still working on it. working on the album, so everything is in flux. With the label you just put out this Prism thing. Yes. For those who don't know, what is that and why did you decide to do it? So, let's see. So I thought a lot about the CD format for a while and realized that Maybe it wasn't the best way to put out my music, just for me personally. Because I felt like it didn't say anything. It was kind of like a blank slate. It's like, here, this is what you put your music inside of. And someone decided that, right? And then you're supposed to put some art in the middle and a sleeve, you know, that you read things in. I don't know. It just seemed like, why does it have to be this way? And also, why, like, no one's really buying CDs. So, like, why not find an alternative or something? And then, so that was one thought. Second thought was, whoa, it would be great if you could give to someone an object where the music was meant to be shared, right? Where you had to listen to the music with someone else. That was another idea. I just liked that conceptually, nothing else. That was as simple as it gets. So then I started thinking about how to mix those two things together. Oh, how to create an object that maybe gives music in a different way. Not how to create a new medium. That's not the point. Sadly, sometimes it's written that way and it's weird. It's just like how to give music in a different way. In a medium that actually is saying something about the music itself. Because a CD, a jewel case can say so much. But like a cube will say something else. Especially if it's metallic and if it says certain things on it. audio jacks so that you can listen to it with someone else if you want. And if you listen to it alone, there's someone missing. What does it say on it? Just don't break my love, a collection of memories, of lost memories. And so, you know, I felt like, oh, maybe this could, you know, talking about context and all that, maybe this could change the way people perceive music. It's more of an experiment than anything. Does it change things? I've heard from a lot of people, yes, I had a very different experience with music using the prism. What was the best reaction you got from the most memorable? Yeah, from one of my best friends that didn't know what it was, didn't know I had done it, right? And like started playing around with it and just like heard the music and was like, maybe he was high. Maybe he was high, but I don't know. He had a very strong reaction to it. And I think it's more of an experiment than anything, to tell you the truth. And it's more of a questioning also. Should we, you know, not just put out, should we just put out CDs? Is that better? Should we just do like links? Is that great? Like, does everyone love Mediafire? I don't know. Maybe everyone loves SoundCloud. I like SoundCloud. Maybe people just want to get their music that way. It's an experiment. I don't know the answers to this. Maybe I'm the only crazy one that thinks that listening to music with someone else and a tiny little object is something memorable. It's just a question. And of course, questions are risky. I mean, it is a risky thing. I actually think it's quite risky. I don't know if I would do it again. Really? I mean, if I would have done it, if I could live my life again, maybe I would have waited. Just because it's kind of a weird thing to just do like that. Why would you have waited, though? Because it seems like this now is a prime moment to send that question out. No, right. Because it's not seen as a question. Right? I mean, it's very easy for this not to be seen as a question. And it's very easy for it to be seen as like, oh, it's like 40 bucks. He's like trying to make money. And it's like, you know, not, you know. There's other things that you could have had 10 Nokia logos on it. There's other ways of doing that. I mean, it's difficult for a piece of... Here's why, sorry. Erase everything I just said. Why it's difficult to do it is because it's difficult to imbue questioning inside something you're selling to people. And I just realized... that now didn't know that before it's as simple as that it's really difficult yeah you gotta try but it's not it's just it just incentives get like fucked up you know and so it's just like oh you're selling this but it's a question and it's like an experiment no it doesn't work especially if it's 40 bucks you know what I'm saying yeah But in order to make more, it had to be 40 bucks. So it's like, what do you do? Difficult. The weather baby on TV It's all together
