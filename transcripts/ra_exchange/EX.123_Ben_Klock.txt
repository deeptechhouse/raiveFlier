Ain't no happiness Ain't no happiness Ain't no happiness Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Ben Klock kicked around the Berlin club circuit for a number of years before he found the club that he has since become synonymous with, Berghain. Their profile has grown in tandem, step by step, to the point where both are now recognized as among the finest in their fields. Clock's reputation as a DJ has only been bolstered by his mixes for Berghain's Oscoot label and a recent effort for Fabric. as well as his productions, which often find a home on his self-run Clockworks imprint. I talked with Clock earlier this month about his beginnings in the Berlin club scene, his new mix, and what American DJ DVS-1 has taught him about playing at Berghain. you You're a long time Berliner. You were born here in Berlin? Born and raised, yeah. What was... I remember you saying in an interview that Berlin was kind of boring back in the 80s. That was my impression, kind of. Maybe others saw it differently, but maybe it was also the age I was in at that time. like starting to go out in former West Berlin was maybe I didn't go to the right places. I mean, you know how it is. You need to grow into, you need to find the right places and to find the right scene and stuff. But I always had the feeling like when I was young and traveled with my parents. and stuff and every time I came home to Berlin I thought it's kind of boring German nothing really going on city and kind of old also maybe at that age that I was I thought everyone around me is just old Maybe it was just that everyone young and cool was in East Berlin or was very close to the wall at that time. I mean, it obviously just completely changed. It just really became a completely different city after the wall came down. time down that's the thing i've always found so interesting about the city is that it um it somehow is one of the only cities where literally the middle of the city changed like geography wise like now this place where this wall was is now the middle of the city as opposed to before it must have been quite a shock for this whole thing to have changed in a minute absolutely and for me personally how um i mean i was kind of I remember that time I didn't realize anything. Like I didn't follow the process that led to this. For me, it was, I remember that I was at a friend's place looking out the window and he came in and said, the wall is gone or something. And I was like. Like, what? There was no sign, for me at least, that this could ever happen. And for me, it was really a shock. I looked outside and thought, like, really? So that means people can go back and forth between the two cities? Like, hello? Because when you grow up in a situation like this, for me, it was like it was always there and it will always be there. I couldn't imagine anything else. It was just the natural walls around us or something. What was the most surprising thing then when you finally did go over to the east side? about the rest of the city i mean i i went to the east side a couple of times before like with you you did that with uh the school class or something and um to be honest i really didn't like the east part uh it was very gray and The air didn't smell good and stuff like that. So when we had a day trip to the east part, I was really happy when I came home. There were a little bit more colors and everything was a little bit more shiny or something. That's how I saw it. And yeah, after the war came down, when I went to the east part the first times, To go to these dark areas, like streets, which were just dark at night, and no car even. You saw one street, and at the end of the street, there was maybe one car parking somewhere, and that's it. or stuff like, I mean, like I said, I was a bit bored on the West part. And in my mind was like, where should I go? Like which part of the world I want to move to or something. And then suddenly this showed up. And so I found a completely different world, like right next door. And also the people that I met, I think that was the most interesting or exciting thing to have like my first East Berlin rendezvous or something from a girl from the other side of Germany and just completely different. mindset like everything she said was so different from all that i experienced on the west side like everything was just completely different structure you take certain things for granted completely crazy to her and the other way around i said i don't look completely crazy but um i was really impressed like uh the way of social, political thinking and the intensity of discussion was suddenly... and new and surprising. It doesn't seem like even though you were a teenager and you shouldn't necessarily expect it to be, but it doesn't seem like you were very interested in the political and the social. And maybe running into these people after the wall came down, these kinds of things just stared you in the face and you couldn't ignore them anymore. Right. I mean, before it was like you grow up just in your system. I mean, we often made fun of the East, like the TV programs of Eastern television. Or every time we went through the GDR by car to go to the West side, West Germany. you know all these um security controls at the border which was just so ridiculous the questions they asked you and the way they talked and this kind of stiff system was for us a bit um an issue to just laugh about in a way and yeah i think The interest for the people on the other side really, for me, only came after the wall came down. And I remember that also friends of mine were... just stayed in the west part they were so skeptical about the east that they just kind of never went there and and i was more into i wanted to explore and and see something new and also at that time i like and i found cool clubs and stuff like that which just appeared on the east part And some of my old friends, they were just like, no, they stayed in their neighborhood in their West Berlin. And I thought, okay, just do what you want to do. I'm off. What were some of those first clubs that you found? there was a club called Planet, I think. Was an Ellen alien playing there? I think so, yeah. That's so long ago. But what other clubs? And there were some clubs which just were there for a year or so and then they moved somewhere else or disappeared. which I don't even remember. Why do you remember Planet then? Just because it's such a catchy name. I don't even remember how it looked like inside, to be honest. I was just tripping around with other people and they said, yeah, there's a new place there. And I didn't know what it was and who was playing there or stuff. Just that name Planet sticked in my head. I don't even really remember the name of the first club where I played. I just remember where it was in Oranienburger Straße, but I don't really remember the name anymore or something like that. What was the first one that really made an impact? I mean, you've said in other interviews, delicious donuts was one. Well, that's... Or did that come after? That was the club where I kind of started my nighttime work life because I used to work there as a bartender and then started also DJing. I mean, that was not the first place where I DJed, but one of the first places. So I was kind of... partly being a bartender and DJing there. And I think that was not too far from there was the first WMF. I think that had kind of quite big impact on me. How so? I mean, the way that I know about those clubs is that they were quite varied and that Jazzanova was sort of associated with them and this whole sort of kind of trip-hop, jazz house, all these sorts of things kind of... thrown into one one big at the donuts yeah not so much the wmf but donuts um yeah that was this this time between uh uh drum and bass strip hop something uh acid jazz or how it was called yeah right And then like this genre, which was also like Saint-Germain or stuff like that, you know, which was kind of between trip hop jazz and house. And so that's what I used to listen to at Donuts when I worked. And then when it didn't work, I went a few blocks away to WMF to listen to something more powerful or more fun for me. But you wanted to play at Delicious Donuts, obviously. Was that just a... man, I'll play anywhere, I want to get my foot in the door in terms of DJing. No, not really. Actually, like I said, that was not the first place where I started. It was that place in Oranienburger Straße, which was just like a random place which closed down after a year or so. And I think at some point they found out that I also DJ and they just asked me or something. I don't really remember, but I was not like, I need to play somewhere. No, actually just kind of happened. I just played at some private party. just some CDs, actually, just some random music. And someone asked me, would you like to play in our club that we will open soon? And I just said, yes, sure. I tried. It seems like there's a lot of these old clubs that are remembered quite fondly. Was there one that you felt like made a really big impact on you? Or was it all leading up to this other club that we'll talk about in a little bit? Yeah, I mean, of course, there was like the old Ewerk, which had a big influence on every Berlin clubber at that time. and Tresor, the old one. These, I would say these three clubs, WMF, Everk, Tresor. Tell me about Everk. For those who don't know anything about it, what was it like? Well, some people say that Osgood or Berghain kind of prevented this kind of vibe in a way. Preceded this vibe. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right. So. yeah when you think of Berghain and this in the 90s kind of it it had in a way a similar vibe like long nights very kind of ecstatic and huge old warehouse building um what was the music good old days of techno and Who were the DJs who were playing there? I remember Woody, DJ Woody was quite big there and DJ Klee and who else was playing there actually? I mean, all of them, like Hell and it was kind of the techno place to play. It seems like your graphic design studies and career took over at a certain point for you. And the music slowed down a little bit in a way. Yeah, it was just parallel kind of. At some point I thought, okay, I just need to do something else than just play for like little money at every second weekend somewhere. that's just not enough and I don't want to spend my life being a bartender at night all my life so at some point I got quite nice offers for graphic design and I started to do that like yeah like typical nine-to-five job But plus I still did the DJing during the weekends. And were you also making music at this time? Yes, I started making music, yeah. What was the music that you first started making when you first started out? Well, it was kind of, I would say, I just recently listened to my first record and I was like... It's actually kind of like something like Deep House, I would say. And one track was like this kind of bass-influenced, like UK-based, funky bass-influenced garage house or something like that. And it was on a sub-label of Jessanova, actually. And then I did a record for WMF, actually the first ever release. That was, again, a little bit different. That was more in a kind of electro-ish direction. Seems like it took you a while to find your true style. Absolutely. But you're happy with those releases still. You don't look back on them fondly. Like I said, I just listened to my first one. I thought actually the quality is quite good in a way. It's just completely different. It's like someone else has produced it, but it's not bad. What were some of the first pieces of gear that you bought? Were you producing with hardware or was it with software? One of the first ones was a... Kurzweil sampler. Why was that the first one that you decided to get? I always left the technical research to a friend of mine who's more into this technical side. I'm really more into, I love to use these devices and things and gears for... transporting my music but i'm not so much into the technical side of things um what made us decide that i really don't know just research and i guess we found out this is the one which is in a way affordable and does its deal its job And then we had this MC505, or what was it called? This Roland kind of drum machine producing station. Do you still have it? No, I don't have that one anymore. And actually my first two records I made at a friend's place who now has a, or even then is a mastering guy. and now has a big mastering studio and stuff, and that's where I made my first stuff on Pro Tools and a bit of analog gears for the bass and stuff like that. Did it take you a long time to get your head around it? You said you weren't immediately that interested in the technical aspect of things. No, I was quite ambitious to learn that stuff. So especially the software side didn't take me too long to get into that, to use what I can use and then try to make the best out of it. that was quite fast that I started producing something. And since I always been a musician in a way, like since I was young. Did it help early on? In a way, yes. In other ways, no. Because you tend to make like... too much music for a techno track or something like that. When you can make a piano solo, your fingers just want to do it. And then you have to pull them away, like stop it, reduce yourself. Yeah, I guess, you know, having that knowledge, it's a good thing and a bad thing. you're constantly trying to stop yourself and some of the most amazing techno tracks are the power or the urgency that come from them is the fact that it's quote unquote wrong right absolutely I agree especially when you look like to American producers, which has sometimes this kind of rawness and wrongness in the music. You hear that a real musician wouldn't... put this harmony or something. So it's kind of off and wrong, but this is what makes it special. At what point do you feel like your music started to become more like the music that you are known for, I guess is the best way to put it. It's not that your early stuff wasn't you, because it was you. Well, I guess it was really around that time of my first Berghain gigs, I guess. It definitely had an impact, this whole experience and just the whole... experience to also as a DJ to find that now you are in the place that you really want to be or you have the surrounding around you and everything turned so professional suddenly with that club around me also the music just changed in a way What did you heard about the new Berghain before you played there? Anything? It was not that I heard something about it. It was really, at some point, I was quite bored of the Berlin nightlife or the way, the direction that it was going at that time. And then I started to go out to... to the old osgut and i thought like this thing here is really an island and if i want to play somewhere in the city that would be the place which would really excite me again so of course i went to the new berghain then and I thought it's even better. So this was definitely the place where I wanted to play. What was the way that nightlife was going at that time? Why was Osgut so different? Why was it an island? Because Osgut... kept this more techno vibe or didn't really look left or right what was fancy and hip at that time. They just did what they believed in and always believed in and kind of kept this. early Berlin and Detroit and kind of this mixture of quote-unquote real techno or something. And all the other clubs went more into, yeah, this, I always say electro clash, like this kind of, for me, it was not so real anymore. It was quite becoming quite show off poshy thing in a way. And that, I think, Osgoode at the time was really one of the few places which had a great intense energy with that kind of underground techno music without that showing off thing. It was just dark and everyone was there for the music. Yeah, you know what I mean. You said that a lot of people, but not you, a lot of people said at the beginning of the new Berghain that, oh, the old Osgood is so much better. I know, yeah. Yeah, it was like that. But, you know, after a few years, they said the same thing about Berghain. They said, wow, Berghain in the beginning was so incredible and so fantastic. And now it's like this and that. I just think it's a type of thinking. It's a human tendency. It's always better than a few years ago. Everything is always better. No, no, no, no. No, I don't think, no, this is also not me. But I'm quite careful when people say something like this, you know, like Berlin is not the same anymore. Kreuzberg is not the same anymore. And like, yeah, of course it's not the same anymore. But how boring would life be if it would still be the same? and i actually uh did think that bear kind for some time had a little bit of uh um was going down in the intensity a little bit uh where i kind of in a way understood people saying yeah a few years ago it was so like wow new and and so wowish and then people kind of get used to it or start to complain but then since I think like since two years or so I have the feeling it's like wow even better than it used to be in the beginning so there was kind of a wave for me from my perception that's interesting it was maybe 2009 2008 that it was it had a slight dip in your mind maybe yeah maybe at uh was it that time could be yeah yeah around that time i would say it's so funny though because you know as you say it's so much about your perception of it right like your gigs maybe another dj is having you know these are the best times at berghain yeah i've had in my entire life right yeah um your first time there playing there you obviously it seemed to just change your life do you remember anything about that particular gig or was it just the entire the entire thing um it was the entire thing it was the way i felt like i get treated as a dj the way i always wanted it to like from beginning from the night manager or the people who appreciate what you do and the sound which is just the right sound for that kind of music and I always wanted that music to sound like that and not all the clubs have a sound system which really transport what this music can transport. Is there a certain type of record that seems to work better there or just a certain type of record that doesn't work in other places and works? Yeah, I mean, I couldn't name one now, but I remember that was one thing that I remember from my first time playing there. I was so in a, I had a good flow and I just tried out things that I know I can't try out anywhere else. And it really worked there. Like some records which have a difficult bass frequency or so, there they had that impact that they can have on the people. it really created something intense, the bass and stuff. When in other clubs, I just couldn't play these records because everyone was just running away from the dance floor because all the intensity was in the very deep bass or something. that so I just remember that I could play everything that I wanted to play and also that I could just in other places at that time I had the problem that I couldn't really I always say I couldn't step on the gas pedal or I was always afraid don't push it too hard people will run away And there I could just go for it, you know. I've spoken to Zach of DVS1 before, and he also says that there are just certain records that he brings especially for that room because he knows that they're going to work there and they just don't quite have the same impact other places. It's very interesting to think about. that a certain sound system can completely change the way a record sounds. Yeah, sometimes people say when I play somewhere else that I play differently somewhere else than in Berghain. there might be something right i mean of course it always uh if if it's like a small club i wouldn't play like big room stuff like at berghain or something like that but And most of the time when people say that, I quite really know that I actually play the same kind of thing that I would play at Berghain. It just sounds differently there. And you could play a quite minimal or housier record or something and it just sounds like techno there. So the whole vibe is a bit different there. You said that you started producing different music once you had played there a little bit. How did the first release come about? There was no label. yeah before i think it was you and marcel put out a record yeah that was the first one uh we just yeah we just became friends and tried out to produce something together and uh was pretty quick that we had a couple of tracks together and showed it to the owner and He was kind of surprised in a positive way. And I think he already had in the back of his mind the idea to maybe make a label. So we came up with something. And so the idea was born to make a label for actually the resident DJs there. Were you surprised at the reaction to the first release? I was. I really was. I think it went up to, I don't remember, like number two, number three or something on the Groove magazine charts, like readers charts. I was totally surprised by that. What happens when you get in the studio with Marcel? Why does it work so well? We haven't been in the studio for a long time now. I mean, we always... Why did it work so well? Yeah, and it actually was a different time. You know, for us, we were, we at that time, we didn't even play every weekend. So we had some weekends off sometimes. We, it was really quite relaxed. We had our PlayStation, played football and made a little bit of music. And as soon as we got bored, we went back to the PlayStation. And this is something that I can't really imagine anymore now. Who was winning most of those matches? Oh, I don't really remember. I think we were kind of equal. But it was big fun. Yeah, and very relaxed vibe. No pressure to really deliver anything or so, you know. And our friendship was kind of a newborn thing by just liking each other on a friendship and on a musical taste way. So that just helped a lot. Also, what I really liked about it was to find... decisions very quickly like uh you throw in sounds and you're like when you yourself are not sure like is this actually cool the sound here at this point and then you ask the other one and he like if you're not sure the other one is sure he says no like put it away and right away it's uh it's off it's it's out of the system and you can go on like when you're on your on your own you just think hmm is it good or bad okay I will do something else for 10 minutes and then you go back and listen to it again and still think hmm is this really good or is it bad so it's always good to have a partner there to give you some feedback what's the difference between you and Marcel because it seems like you two complement each other quite well. Yeah. He's more spontaneous and more thoughtful. He's more, even with DJing, like he thinks, okay, now I want to play this and doesn't really think of the record he played before. So it kind of makes some changes, which is actually good for his sets. I'm more like I tend to dig more or dive more deeper into a set or create in a way more deepness or something. But it's just like it's different. His background is more from the... industrial side I have all kinds of music in my history from hip hop to rock to everything I've always felt like and this may sound like a stupid thing to say that your sets the kind of techno that you like always has a hint of house to it or it has a certain bounce to it that's not exactly techno but it is techno in your hands somehow yeah i mean uh most of the tracks are just definitely techno but i would say the the way i play has uh um a certain uh groove which is when you see techno more on the industrial side which doesn't really have that groove and i'm slightly more interested in that groove side than into that industrial side um obviously at a certain point berghain became a thing A theme. For a lot of people. Did you notice it? Did you notice the change? I once spoke to Tobias Rapp, and he said one day when he was waiting outside in the line at Berghain, he just noticed that there were all sorts of languages being spoken, not just German. And I guess that's sort of the change that I'm talking about in terms of it became word got out. The secret was elsewhere. Did you notice that at a certain point as well? Absolutely. I mean. my feeling from the beginning was this is something really precious what we have here. I knew that I was part of something special. and just the whole thing from the inside to the circles around it, everything was so, worked really well and was, it was professional on one side, but it was also with a lot of heart or soul or what you want to call it. And it was big, but it was underground. There were not so many clubs which are like that kind of size, but didn't have that commercial vibe or something. It was really its own thing, but a very unique thing and very precious thing. And I thought this will just spread out just naturally because it's just good. I guess the thing that is most amazing and it almost never happens is when it becomes that big, when it becomes much bigger than that, it loses the impact. And I'd say that... arguably it's changed but it hasn't necessarily lost yeah much of its impact yeah there is really like a certain kind of magic around that place um it's just uh It's just something special. It's like you can go to other clubs and not to put other clubs down, but it has a certain time span. I mean, like one night after a couple of hours, you just get tired or something. And that kind of just happens that you really don't look. to the clock anymore and you just uh it just time flies by that is so fast and then you see it's like 24 hours later it's just very unique in there and um so coming back to this when it changed I there were like a few steps also this like our first record that that it was so well received and then um also what happened in Berlin that uh like artists like Richie Horton, Ricardo Villalobos moved to Berlin, kind of created their base in Berlin that helped Berlin a lot and the scene a lot. And more and more people from everywhere came. Like a couple of things which led into this direction. For me, it was also something like that to realize outside in the line, you almost don't hear German anymore. And you hear Spanish, Italian, English. And also this kind of easy jet rave thing helped, right? I mean, the cheap flights. And it just got very big then. What do you put down to the fact that it's maintained its relevance over the past few years? Why do you think it's stayed the same in many ways? You mean the same in the relevance? The feeling of the club. Yeah. Well, that's the certain magic. I don't really know, to be honest. It's just also for me, like I just realized how long I've been doing this. played there now i've been playing there since what was it 2004 or so do you see any end to it no not really and that's a great thing like i'm not getting tired of it at all and i every time i get in there and go up there uh i just think wow what an intense place and It's still the same. This feeling is still for me being there so often. Tell me about your Fabric Mix CD. It's just come out recently. Did you approach it any differently than you did your Berghain Mix CD a couple of years ago? In a way, yes. In other ways, no. My approach with combining old and new... unreleased stuff that that approach was the same um do you put away the old tracks that you use in a mix cd do you not play them out anymore because you put them on the on the mix cd Sometimes I even, that was also the same with the Berghain mix. There are some tracks that I never actually play, that I just put on the mix CD, but I never kind of, it just doesn't happen, that I really play it out in a club. But that's okay for me because I think it's kind of a different approach to make a mix CD or to really play in a club and create a vibe in a club. It's just two different things. And I'm not trying to put what I do in a club really in a mix CD in certain ways, yes, but in other ways I think it's just a different type of... kind of work is it just strictly mix cd is deeper and that everything needs to be more i can listen to it in a car absolutely yeah that's kind of what i think the approach should be that you can listen to it more than like one or two times and not get annoyed by just club banging techno. Like I said before, I think techno should have a certain sound, like a certain sound system. And some tracks are just not really suitable for listening at home, I think, in a way. Or at least I wouldn't. Like some tracks I listen at home and think, yeah, that is a great track for the club. but that doesn't mean I really want to listen to it at home. And so when I make a mix CD, I have that in the back of my mind. I don't want to make it too flat or banging and track that could work great in a club, which is more like a tool for a club. Like even artists that made some special tracks for that mix CD, like unreleased stuff, they sent me a couple of other tracks before and I said, yeah, that's nice. And I play it a lot, but I wouldn't put that on a mix CD. So I asked them, like, do you have something else or can you change it? Do you say, can you make it a little bit deeper or is it just, can you change it in general? No, no, no. I mean, I didn't want to tell people what they have to do there, but I can still say, yeah, my approach is to... make it not too banging a little bit deeper so it does some seem like someone that you have given particular advice to though is is zach dvs1 especially when he was first starting to put together tracks if i remember correctly he basically sent you just loops his first stuff is that correct well it was uh i mean i kind of discovered him him in minneapolis when he did his second ever live show and it was just 20 minutes 25 minutes And I was really surprised, like impressed by that live show. And he said, yeah, it's just these are not really tracks. It's just loops that I kind of combine in this live show. So he sent me the recording of that live show. So and then I just picked the best parts and I said, OK, make. make a track out of this part from five minutes 30 seconds to this and that so so I just picked some loops and made him or told him like these are my favorites and I would love to make a release with it when you make proper tracks with it out of it was the reason that you decided to release his stuff on Clockworks and he's sort of the first outside artist. Yeah. Because no one had really ever heard of him before. Was that part of the kind of like appeal of putting something of his out? Would it make sense to take a Marcel Detman track and put it on Clockworks? There was a point when we were thinking about that that could be like a nice exchange that I do a remix for him and he remix for my label. It was just a couple of ideas, but basically before it was just my label for my stuff. which was a little bit more raw or a bit more tool-ish than the stuff that I made for Oskuton and I think the whole idea for the label really just completely switched at this moment when I heard Zach play his live Because there were people around, like I was asking, who is this guy? And people around me said, yeah, this is Zach. He is a really good guy. And he did a lot for the scene here because he throws parties and rents sound systems and stuff. Did a lot for the techno scene, but he's not known anywhere. But he's a great DJ and this is his second live show ever. And so that made me really interested in that guy. Seems like he's learned some stuff from you. What have you learned from him? I learned that... 138 BPM is not too fast for Berghain. Because the first time he ever played at Berghain, he did the last set after me and he started playing and he went up to 138 and I was like, hey, listen, this is... Berghain, the nights go on really long so just relax a little bit, you don't have to bang it here and make a short one and a half hour sets with a high speed and he was like yeah I tried but it didn't feel right and the BPM went up, up, up And after a few hours I thought, wow, this is just really good. Still. So he changed the speed limit for you. Well, I mean, not really. I mean, before I played between something like 127.8 to 132 maybe. That was kind of, yeah, the limit. And still this is more the range where I play. Sometimes I feel if it's just like the energy is not right, I try or I'm not afraid anymore. just go over some limit. It takes an outsider like that to kind of you know you get into these routines and these ideas of what is Berghain or what is Fabric or whatever and then it takes someone who's never been there to kind of remind you. Yeah that's true. And also I was really impressed by his ability to make tracks with just bass drum, hi-hat, his famous claps that he puts on some off positions. and really like four tracks and then he has a great tune and I always think people always think this is easy to do but it's really not this is like something really special when you can do it or this is like the ideal thing to really transport something which has soul or so with really so reduced sounds like just minimal in its best way do you find yourself inspired by zach production wise in that stripping things down to their essentials Yes, it kind of always reminds me of people like Hood or, yeah, like you said, Zach, or people who are really able to make these very stripped down things in such an elegant way or how you want to call it. it always just reminds me this is the what it all comes down to this is the essence it doesn't mean that I have to do the same but it is in a way inspiring yeah it is like when you make a track and you think like at some point here now you need something more you need to add something on top uh then it makes you or makes me think um if i need to add something here maybe the basic track is just not good enough you know maybe you just start should start all over again until you find a a loop or something which is just so good that you can play with it for over six, seven minutes without adding too much on top. Do you find yourself taking things and then putting them away for a while and coming back to them consciously saying, I'm going to wait three weeks and see if this still sounds... good yeah absolutely that's what I did when I produced the album actually that was really my my plan to to make a large amount of drafts and then just coming back to them after a few weeks and then decide, okay, what is really worth to work on. So I had maybe like 30, 40 or more tracks started that I tried or 50. And then I went through all of them and went through them again after a few days and again and reduced them every time. And then I found these two handful of tracks which I really liked. And then I started to work on them and arrange them. And all that was really like the second step. Was there anything immediate, though? I don't even have to put that away. I know that's... Yeah, that happens. I imagine maybe the Martin remix must have been sort of... Yeah, that was actually something that went really quick. And that was something that I didn't have to show anyone. I just knew this is good. It's a weird one because it... Obviously, you already have Space Ape there, but the melody is just so otherworldly that it just takes you completely out of the track in a very good way, I think. But it seems like so much of your music is about keeping you locked in oftentimes. Well, yeah, but like we said before, these kind of little bit off or little bit weird things, like what make the early days of American techno. or Detroit so good was this kind of weird thing that really didn't fit to the other sounds or stuff like that. And maybe this kind of flute or whatever sound of that melody. that is what makes that track good because it's like, hey, does it really need that? Or like, this is weird, but this is good. You obviously, you know, Space Ape was already on that track, but you've worked with Vocalist before as well. I mean, is that something you... really enjoy working with the human voice absolutely i i would reject 10 remixes if i can make one with with a voice as an inspiration for me because i don't think it's that interesting to make a techno remix of a techno track and remix of that techno track again like sometimes just there's just so much more. material that is inspiring if it comes from a different angle in a way um some of the most memorable things on the two mix cds i feel like you know the junior boys yeah remix and the first one and i guess you and nina's thing uh the octave one thing uh on the new one yeah just moments i'm like okay wow and obviously some of the stuff on your album as well. Yeah. Yeah, this is kind of an interesting feel, to keep it in a techno vibe, like not too much singing on it, but to have a few elements of vocals in it, which... not going too cheesy or something, but just adds that little extra, which makes it really special. And I think this Junior Boys remix of Marcel is just amazing because it's just a very stripped-down, hoodish techno track. And it has these vocals on top, which you usually wouldn't expect or so. And yeah, this is just, I like that kind of stuff. Are you working on another album or are you thinking about it if you aren't working on it? No, I'm not working on it yet. I'm thinking about it. But first... I think my, I mean, I'm working on some remixes, some with vocals. But before I think of an album, I think I want to make another couple of, maybe like one or two 12-inch releases. I think like one on Clockworks, one on Osgood. And then maybe later next year, I will think of an album more intensively. From what I've read, it seems like you take the album almost too seriously as an idea. But it's almost like I wouldn't even start to make one if I wasn't. Ready. Emotionally and physically. Yeah. I mean, for me it's almost impossible to make an album right now because I just travel so much. I think it is something you really kind of need to lock yourself up in a room and just think of what do you really want to express now or what is there that I can give the world. And yeah, maybe I'm almost too serious about it then, but I think like... Like, you know, a 12-inch, it just... it's something different. But an album is really like a statement. What did you come, you know, what did you want to say with the first one? You said that you kind of think and figure out what you want to put out there. What was the point? Yeah, I think it's something you can't really always put in words. It's more like feeling or, I mean, it's definitely... Also the approach not to make a club album, but to have club-related music. Okay, some of the tracks you can also play in the club, but it's not... the main idea behind it. So the main idea is, again, to have something more musical that you just enjoy listening to also. And not only in the club context. I think this is pretty important for an album, for me at least. What are you listening to these days that's not club music? Not much. I enjoy my silence. I imagine with all the traveling, it's promos, promos, promos. What can I play in my set next? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I totally enjoy music, but sometimes your ears, your nerves just need some silence as well to just find the energy for the next shows. ♪♪♪
