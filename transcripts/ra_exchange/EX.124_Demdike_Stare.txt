Thank you. you Hello and welcome to Resident Visors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Sean Canty and Miles Whitaker are the duo behind Demdike Stare. They make dark, droning music that sounds a bit like soundtracks to cult horror movies. But despite the sinister nature of the project, the duo are just about the nicest boys from Manchester you could ever hope for. I did so as part of the RA Live Exchange Series at the UN SOUND Festival in Poland in October. We talked about Concealed, the project they were undertaking with a live orchestra later that weekend, as well as how they almost bankrupted their record label, Modern Love, a few years ago. I guess I wanted to get started by asking you to... Just briefly explain what you're going to be doing at the festival. This concealed project. Yeah, we've been commissioned for one time to work with Sinfonetta. Yeah, and that's pretty much it really. We're working with an 18-piece orchestra and... we've worked on a new B-Spoke video piece. And when you got commissioned by them, you said immediately, "Yeah, no problem." Yeah, it was... We had an idea to work with Michael in England on a... You know, we wanted to develop... the visual side of what we do. And Matt came up with the idea of working with Symphonetta and it just seemed the logical thing to actually bring those two worlds together. This new video piece and working with the orchestra. You've never worked with an orchestra before though? No. Never. So what has the process been like for that? You've had to put notes on paper for the first time. It's kind of really daunting because we're actually working with real musicians and professional musicians. We got a friend of ours who played on our first album, Symbiosis, Danny Norbury. We asked him to create the score to certain... pieces of Demdike's "Dare Music" which he did and then we arrived this week to do the first rehearsal piece. And we weren't really prepared for what Danny had done with the strings because he's actually, he's taken some of our music and extended it and added certain bits and pieces. So the first rehearsal was kind of a bit of a nightmare because nobody knew when to start or where the piece was going because we'd never heard it until this week. But I think the third run through, we were amazed at how good it sounded. They also added a bunch of musicians as well. Yeah, we only got told a week before the festival that instead of playing with a string octet, we were playing with 18 musicians, which gave us no lead-up time whatsoever. Working with Danny, putting your music on paper, I mean, was that a tough process for him to figure out what this drone is? Not really. I mean, we basically gave him like a selection of tracks which we wanted to be able to play, but like an overly large selection. And then Danny tried to work out which ones would fit together without the orchestra having to retune halfway through. So, you know, the set was kind of devised by us and by the technical process as well. And it works kind of exactly the same way as how me and Miles worked together. You know, there was a whole listening session process where I would kind of go into my record collection and I'd be pulling out... library music, soundtrack music, and he was like, I want to sound like this. I want to sound like this in your Marie Kony record. So it'd be like, okay, right. So he took that away and he was looking through existing music, which had already been released, and unreleased music. So who are some of those touchstones that you pulled out of your record collection and wanted it to sound like? I think, to be honest, it was pretty much a lot of Italian composers. Agistus Macchi, Ennio Morricone. Ligetta. Yeah, Pier Umiliani. If they didn't want to speak after me, I'll be very specific. I'm not very good with my Italian, so... I would write, you know, there's a very, very few specific pieces, but one record in particular. was from one of my favorite soundtracks. It's from a French crime movie called Le Attendant, which is composed by Ennio Morricone. And it's a record I've DJed out for many, many, many years. So, you know what I mean? But initially getting the first email, it was just like, right. I kind of know exactly where, what we're gonna kind of base this whole piece around. What is it about that soundtrack music that's so appealing to you guys? Obviously it seems... It's atmosphere. You know, just like mood and atmosphere within a piece of music and soundtrack music is specifically designed to evoke a mood or an atmosphere. And I think, you know, it's... partnered with visuals as well. Sometimes it's music that has a lot less contents than released music which you would buy in a shop and just listen to. Soundtrack is designed in a much more overt way. Especially things like... Morricone's music where, you know, where me and Miles are kind of obsessed with hybrids and, you know, someone like Morricone who come through from classical music but would incorporate fuzz guitar or electronics. and that's you know that's the um that's a big thing for us you know what i mean as well in soundtrack music is just yeah finding the more interesting ones you said you're obsessed with hybrids how where do you hear that in your music where do i hear my bridge my music uh i just think that's what it is i think the music is i see our music in the same way as i listen to hip-hop music it's a melting pot of a lot of different influences and that's the hybrid um the visual side of things is something you guys have done more and more over the past year i would say yeah definitely yeah just because we've been kind of offered the shows where um the space is right for it and the technical side of things is right because when we first started playing shows we were getting offered a lot of club gigs and it's generally the way where you turn up on the night and they throw a bed sheet up And they're like, oh, yeah, you can do visuals. Here's the shitter's projector. But, yeah, recently we've been offered some amazing shows with the right spec. I think, yeah, just to give something else, we're just two dudes playing around laptops, and I think that has got to evolve a little bit. You know what I mean? And it seemed to be the... one of the first steps to do to kind of... It's our shield. Yeah, basically. Was that always the aim with the project, to eventually do things with large-scale visuals? Was that always in your mind when you started? We started the project to basically write a soundtrack. That was the idea that when I finally convinced Sean to start writing music with me, then he's like, OK, let's... approach it like a soundtrack. So it was self-evident that we should have visuals to go with it. And I think originally we just did a couple of tracks and they got a friend of ours to edit some movies which we really like and that ballooned into why don't we just use this on the live shows and then people don't have to look at us. How do you approach a soundtrack? Because you did recently an actual soundtrack for a movie, Cassavetes' film, that's coming out, wide release later on next year? Yeah, it's coming out in March, I think, next year. Was it a different process when you had the images in front of you? They've used existing music of the back catalogue, and we just... altered some of the existing music as well as we delivered a few new pieces as well but when they send you a film edit you know they've actually got the visuals there it's kind of much easier to write something which goes along with it you know it's it's we just approach it in a piece by piece basis. It's kind of a difficult job to do because you'd complete a piece, you'd get it exactly right for the scene and then a month later they'd send another edit through. Oh, we've changed it. Because they're constantly editing their side of things. Is it tough to work in that sort of on spec where it's like, oh, we need that little bit to be two seconds? earlier. Yeah, personalities are tough, innit? Yeah, and it is when you've done the scene 16 times. Are you planning on doing more, though? Do you want to do more, working in that kind of system where it's a little bit more major label, major studio type thing? I think, yeah, that would be, you know what I mean, hopefully the next phase for us is to definitely be working with... film and TV. Why is that something that you guys want to do so badly? I think it just works, just like Miles said earlier, that, you know, the project... was started to create music for a soundtrack for a film that didn't exist so it just this is the this it seemed illogical steps for that film existing and I think our favorite records are library records which were records released for TV and film so it's like we just really want to write library records when did you run into these records for the first time? I mean, when did you realize, oh, that's the music I'm really fascinated by? I got into library music through, like a lot of people, through hip-hop. It was the step of hearing my favorite hip-hop record, then wanting to know what that original music was. And eventually that just led me to finding library music, probably in about 1996. It fascinated me that this music was faceless. It wasn't intended to be. release for any commercial reason it was just you know these records which was stuck in these tv houses in in the uk all over the world um and we just hear records we hear library records from italy which kind of preempts a rob hood record or You know what I mean? A library record from the UK which kind of pre-empts one or two points never and that fascinates me, music. hearing things from 1970 which could sound like they could be released next week on Boomcat. Was it the same for you, Miles? I mean, I was introduced to library music through Sean. And once you kind of delve into that world, it's unstoppable. Because there's so much music. It's unbelievable. Like, even now, we see records every week. We've no idea what they are. But we really want to know. And, you know, library music, just because it was... They usually were kind of... producing these amazing studios with no finance restrictions so it's like these musicians could be pretty much at the most creative as they could possibly but you know because they have no A&R person telling them like I think you should sound like this because that what you're doing there is maybe you know not going to sell as many copies as your last record Library music is just this totally free form of music which just seems like the essence to me. I guess for me also the appeal is that you almost don't know what it was for, who kind of created it. There's no narrative of an artist growing and doing something. They just wanted a science fiction sounding record, so a classical guy would go into a studio with a load of synthesizers for the first time. and just do loads of experiments, and some of them are just amazing, you know, the biggest mistakes ever. I want to touch on, I guess, the beginnings of the project. You said you coerced Sean into making records. Yeah. How did that come? It only took 10 years. Yeah, it did. And Sean was like... He'd always been interested but never tried. He had the best equipment in the world, like every hip-hop sampler, every drum machine, but he never used them. They just sat there and I'm like, you've got to make music. And one day he just phoned me up, it was like 2008. 2007, I think. 2007, yeah, he just phoned me up and he's like, I'm ready, let's do it. I'm like, finally. And the reason was, in my head, I was like, OK, I want to sound like Pete Rock, or I want to sound like DJ Premier. But then it didn't kind of sit right, because I'm just some kid from Northern England. was going to kind of get across right, me trying to sound like a New York hip-hop producer. So that's why it took a long time just to think about what we should do together. So you bought all these machines and you just looked at them and you thought... Pretty much. You must have been experimenting and trying to do stuff. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. The lost tapes. It was just like... I never heard anything. But you know, it was just trying to sound like, like I said, Pete Rock, DJ Perrimo, the Beat Miners, it was just, that was it. And it just kind of got a little bit boring. attention span, do you know what I mean? I'm someone who just is constantly like, right, this is my thing at the moment, this is it, and then like two weeks later, like, this is it, this is it. So, you know, just to be restricted to an SB1200 and an Acai S3 for an Excel was like, it's just kind of not, it's not sitting right. Because I was obsessed with... identity and we you know what I mean me and Miles are constantly just talking about like it's all about identity you've just got to do something which you know is so true to you. We met the records and we didn't actually think the records were going to be released. It was just, he'd hopped onto me for so long about doing something together and I was just like, right, I've got a selection of records here that I think we could use and I think we could, yeah, let's just go in the studio and have a bit of fun. But they would, you know, we'd give them to the label and it was like, look, yeah, we want to put these out, these are working. It was easy. Modern Love was immediately saw it and knew that they wanted to do something with it. Instant, yeah. The first two records were self-released. Yeah. But assisted by Modern Love and then we put the CD out on Modern Love and then they were just like next, next, next. And it was a good time actually. I think just because I don't come from that world in any way and it was, it just felt like I was kind of bored of seeing generic looking techno records, generic looking, you know, I'm talking about the artwork and stuff, so there was, I think modern love just saw this as like, okay, right, there's... there's the music, but then there's this whole concept with the sleeves, which is all really tied in, you know. Did that come at the same time as the beginning of the project? You sort of were piecing together the visual identity? It's all done by my friend Andy Vortelt, you know, because I was at the time. working at Finders Keepers and I think he asked us to do something with that disposable music series which was like Finders Keepers off, you know, they wanted to release a series of records which were kind of paying homage to library records and stuff. And he was always going to be the first person I was going to ask to do the sleeve. But it was just literally in the office. I'm like, look, I've got these tracks. I'm going to send them to you just like MP3s. And he'd kind of come up with the whole Demdak style logo. And it just then triggered this whole story, I think, in his head of where he wanted to go with it. And you felt that that was the right story? immediately you yeah it's amazing you know for us we were like wow it actually puts a you know maybe a more character to the music it adds another level and we've never ever had to tear to Andy we don't like it it's like everything he does has just been perfect Because I speak to the guy every day and it's just like, even about what records he's been buying or what films he's watching. So I'm in tune, like I am with Miles about, and that's how we can, you know, we just, I just trust what he's going to do just because it's... He's referencing my references. What were you doing at Finders Keepers? I was doing export and mail order. Yeah. Packing boxes, basically. It's a really interesting record label. The stuff that they put out is so... They're still finding things. and unearthing things that I'm kind of amazed at. Did you ever go on any of those trips to find those records and stuff? I knew it made me so physically sick of a record-buying trip in Turkey once me and Andy, it was like... Yeah, just a record shop in Istanbul. It was like every single grail was there and it was like, okay. And yeah, that's the only time I've just literally, yeah, pushed it a little bit too far in a record store. You know, he's been looking for records here and in Poland, everywhere we go, that's what, it's just the first thing to, he's like, where's the good coffee? and where's the record shop? That's just, you know. Where is the best record shop in these days? Best record? For you. Country-wise? It's difficult. I think my head was blown off at Disunion in Japan. Yeah, Japan, you can buy anything in Japan. I lost it a little bit there as well. But not in the same way the Turkish one. That was like... You spent a lot of money in Turkey, didn't you? I could have been broke and a hungry man, but that was just like every single record I've wanted was there for a price. And even records I wasn't really bothered about anymore like soul and funk records. It's like I still need that record But I can't justify having it, but I think Digging wise Italy. Yeah for us Italy really I've finding library records finding a gistus match your records which then kind of go into this Conceal project because that was a you know, he was a key person for probably elemental and this and concealed. What was it about his music that struck you so much? It's astonishing. It's like a kind of really subtle mixture of avant-garde classical and electronics. And I think... Yeah, it's just, I mean, we heard these records and we were just literally inspired to write music, like instantly, like the first time. Like the most money I spent, I spent on one of these records. And the day I got it, I just listened to it once and that was it. I'm in the studio. For like three days, did like 15 tracks or something, you know. It's just, I really wanted to, you know, to get out what I'd heard. Because that's the point of when we write music, we have to hear it in order for music to come out. And with these records, like, they're in a classical studio and sometimes he's got like a prepared piano, for example, and you can hear him walk. around the piano to kind of hit the strings or whatever and it's just little subtleties like that it's just astonishing to hear how do you go about making records yourselves obviously you talked about these library music being in these amazing studios with everything you could ever want What is your process? Everything. Everything and anything. It's pretty difficult this year because we've been constantly, constantly gigging. So it's like, honest, like hotel lobbies, on the plane. It's like, you know, we live in different countries. We both you know, I probably work recently. I'll just you know, come up with like the skeleton suppose and then and then miles probably cook will do solo stuff I'll be kind of doing solo stuff and then Some you know, I mean the last time we've been in a studio together was maybe I don't know the honest John's remix Yeah, I think so. Yeah Yeah But like, yeah, we're working off laptops, so it's just anywhere we can, you know, when we're together playing. And is it a question of someone is the final mixer, or is it both of you? Well, he's definitely the more technical person. He's the meat of the project. And I suppose that is the kind of maybe come up with the concepts and the idea or you know. Yeah, Sean will tell me to put a fuzz guitar over an African record. He'll say, just put a fuzz guitar on and I'll do it thinking you're an idiot and it'll just be perfect. It'll just work. He's not scared of introducing any element which he thinks will work. And I can't really do that. I'm just very technical. I can do whatever he tells me. But I wouldn't think about doing some of the things that he tells me to do. Because I'm kind of constrained in engineering, in just how to write music with hardware or software. But you still have these constraints. But he doesn't because he's no idea about it. It's good though. It must be possible. You can do it. I guess I was interested in the gatefold thing that you guys ended up doing. Nearly bankrupted us. So I guess that answers my question. It was an expensive project. Yeah, it was an arduous task and we were so indulgent with it. We'll never do it again. Back to basics, I think. Yeah, stamp it to white labels, get it out. But it was a statement as well. It was just like... What was the statement? I think just... We just wanted to evolve a little bit, didn't we? We did kind of two self-released 12s and then the triple album set and it's just like the label said, you can do what you want. And I've always... wanted to do coloured vinyl and locked grooves and the label came up with a few really special sleeves and they were like, maybe you want to use one of these. And we were sat down with Andy Votel one day and we were just going through these kind of factory examples and we got the Ford Gatefold and we were like, we want to use that for certain. And yeah, the label's face went white. But, you know, we did it in the end. Is it important to you, I mean, having that physical product? Because on the other hand, you seem white-labeled, 12 inches, whatever. Yeah, that was kind of a throwaway comment. But, yeah, we're record collectors. We love the physical product. I think the conversation they had here a few days ago about the music industry dying, that's not our music industry. That's a different one. Ours is alive and kicking. It really is. How is it a different music industry than the one they were talking about yesterday? Just because we don't really need... that framework which is set up for those labels 20 years ago it doesn't work the same way you know like our last record we did no promotion we didn't send it to anyone and that was a reason it was just like we're just making a statement with this we you know you can press you can do it yourself yeah it's gonna drop and then there's no hype no anything if people like it they like if they don't they don't it's very simple And this is the one that nearly bankrupted you. Yeah. Yeah, we did it. It worked. Sean, making music, technical stuff, do you feel more comfortable now after working more and more? We were just talking about yesterday, you know, the roles were reversed in a way, like... Sean was finishing tracks. And, you know, Miles was buying records. You know what I mean? It's bringing, you know... Because I have... Which is a nightmare. I just want to buy records what no one else has got. Do you know what I mean? And he's kind of thinking in that way. You just find your own record. It's just like there's no point. buying the current new techno record or whatever, or house record, which is maybe going to last two weeks or something. It's just like, I just want... It comes back down to the identity thing again. You know, you find your own... I think the more honest you are with music, the more you find your own identity and you're not scared of buying something, you know, and you're not being told what to buy, you know. It's like, I actually, I like this and I don't care if anybody else does. And that's just being honest with yourself and not just, you know... You know, I grew up, when I was saying about being... this hip-hop kid, but, you know, he'd be playing me something like Carl Craig's Suspiria, and it's just like, I couldn't deny that record, but it was a time when it was like, it was so, you know, you was a hip-hop person, or you was a, you know, you was a techno person, it was like, you know. It's just like one day of just thinking, it doesn't matter, music is just one thing, you know, and enjoy it all. So it was that a light switch went off. Yeah, yeah, but it was happening, you know, at the time, I think in the late 90s, it was, you know, with labels like Mo Wax and stuff, with Carl Craig remixing DJ Crush records, or, you know, it was... hit hard to me you know I was like you know that was what because I could just see you know Carl Craig was sampling Goblin on Suspiria and I just I could just see like the parallels with with some of these techno artists and some of the hip-hop records I was buying a few years ago Sean phoned me up kind of hung over straight after going to Berghain and he's like, techno, I get it, I get it. You know, it took him to go to Berghain to do it, but he got it. It was, you know, it was physical. It was like I was listening to, at the time, a lot of the noise stuff like Wolf Eye. or Demon's Records and I went to Bergen and I saw the parallels with that too I was just like I get it it's hard and it's good Who was playing that night? Do you remember? Yeah I do Let me Code 9 No, no, no. It was hard. Noted techno DJ code nine. Fiedel, maybe, possibly, or I don't know. It was tough when I was there until 11 in the morning. Do you know what I mean? How... You said you're living in different places nowadays. Is that tough? Airport. Yeah? I mean, you were living in the same place when you started recording together. Yeah. How hard has it been to figure out the creative process when you're in different... It's harder. It's definitely harder, but it's just, you kind of get thrown into these awkward positions. Concealed is another thing. We've just got to adapt in that way. We've got to actually... Like I said to you, the most creative we are is when we're sat next to each other in the studio. But that can't happen. We don't have a studio at the moment until next month. But we've still got to carry on writing. The visuals for the thing, Concealed, that's going to take place, what can you tell us about those? I've not actually seen them. I haven't. It's a friend of ours, Michael England, who's worked on this animation piece, which anybody wanted to still keep. reference to the existing videos we've got. And that's kind of pretty much it. He's basically created this video piece which just reacts, you know, off the music and the sleeves, but still tying in with what those existing videos were. But those existing videos were obviously taken from 70s films. He's just trying to create his own 70s film. And the films are usually pretty dark in nature, I'd say, fitting with the concept of the music. But I'm wondering, when did that sort of interest in the occult for you guys be in? Was it always there? I actually don't really have an interest in the occult. It's just because it comes from the films. It's not like I've ever been obsessed with witchcraft or anything like that. And it's the time we're from, historically. is famous for witchcraft. But, you know, not in a negative way. I don't think it's just... It's objective. It's effective. Objective. Yeah, it's kind of an objective look. I mean, you know, sometimes we might reference literature or philosophy or whatever or slightly occult texts. like in the track title or something but it's more about a mood that is evoked when you listen to a certain piece of music like we were somehow unlucky to come out when Hauntology was coined and Witch House and we were like right we need to do a really beautiful ambient record next you know just to move away from that Did you feel that you were lumped in with that and you actively wanted to... We never wanted to be lumped in with anything. We just wanted to do our own thing. And it's kind of, you know, a lot of musicians have a love-hate relationship with media, like, you know, with reviewers. And, you know, we love you, Todd, but... Of course, yeah. And it's kind of like as soon as you try and do something that's maybe a little bit different, it becomes pigeonholed and then you're almost, you know, you kind of feel trapped in a way. Even though we're not, you just find it's a little bit funny that people actually have an expectation of what they're going to hear when the next record comes out. And we don't want that. It's more about pushing ourselves to write different music than we've done before and also pushing the listeners to listen to something that maybe they've never heard before as well. It certainly seems like around the time that it first came out, though, that there were a lot of artists who were exploring this sonic idea. I mean... Do you have any ideas as to why that came about? Why other artists were kind of... I don't know. ...mining that feel? It's been happening for years. Cabaret Voltaire records or Kyle records or Fabian Grissel records or Ennio Morricone records. For me, I think people tapping into that has been happening for a very, very long time. Black Sabbath, we're doing it. Cool. Well, thank you very much, guys. I really appreciate it.
