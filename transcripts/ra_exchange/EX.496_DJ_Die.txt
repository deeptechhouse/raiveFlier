As you know, special, special. Ladies and gentlemen, special, special. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Like his label mate, Krust, Ronnie Sires and Suv, DJ Dye isn't just an essential piece of Bristol music history, he's a key part of the larger story of drum and bass itself. As the 80s turned into the 90s, he saw the sound take form as various DIY cultures intertwined, drawing links between skateboarding, hip-hop, rave, punk, the squat scene and sound system culture. By the end of the decade, he was one of the new sound's crucial producers, building his name with records on V recordings and full cycle that are as highly regarded today as they were nearly 30 years ago. Along with his Bristol collaborators, he was caught up in a whirlwind of global touring as drum and bass became an international concern. But the experience helped foster a vision of music beyond drum and bass, which he's developed most noticeably in recent years on his gutta funk label. In conversation with Joe Muggs, we hear of the melting pot of subcultures that fed into the Bristol scene. and how Dice committed to taking the hard road of working outside his signature sound in order to stay true to a much wider field of influences and instincts. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with DJ Dai is up next. Hi, hello, welcome to Resident Advisor Exchange. I'm Joe Muggs and in the studio, I'm very excited because it's someone I've raved to many times over the years, DJ Dai. Hi Dai. Hello mate, how you doing? Yeah, alright. And we'll go through some of your many achievements, I don't need to rattle them off now, but what are you focusing on at the moment? What's your thing? What are we here to talk about? I guess, you know, the journey from way back, you know. from the early days moving to Bristol to where I am now. I still live in Bristol. But yeah, it's Gutter Funk. Gutter Funk is my label now. I started it back in 2011 and it was basically a place to have freedom to create what you want to create. You know, people know me for Jungle German Bass, obviously. I've done a lot in that field. But yeah, 2011 I wanted to start a label. to, yeah, I mean, just to sort of be able to incorporate more of my influences. And, you know, I've been making jungle drum bass for a long time. Time to sort of, I want to mess around with some different tempo stuff and styles. So gutter funk is my main focus right now. Also working on a project called Watch the Ride. It's a collective of DJs and producers and singers featuring myself, Dismantle, Randall, a singer from Manchester whose name is Prima. And we've been working with Pokes as well, hosting. And we're just bringing on a new guy, Ems, who's an MC based in Bristol. So yeah, we're currently touring, doing shows and writing music. I think as anyone with even half a nose for this music can tell from that list of names, you are constantly crossing the generations. You know, you are definitely not a heritage artist in any sense in the way that somehow people of the drum and bass era have been happy to just roll out the same thing. I mean, definitely. Yeah, I did have that feeling for a while. You know, obviously we came in the scene, you know, we came in. strong came in with V recordings then full cycle started in Bristol with myself, Crust, Ronnie, Suv obviously V recordings, Jumping Jack, Frost, Brian G they put us on They were the first guys to really give us the stand for approval. Started playing our tunes, giving our tunes out to the London community of DJs through Music House and those places. And yeah, we came in rolling out, you know, rolling out at 160, 170 BPMs hard. It was a great time for creativity. You know, it was like a camp, you know, and we were all feeding off each other. musically, creatively. And, you know, DJing back then was such fun, you know, because we had so much tunes in our boxes, 10-inch dub-plate boxes back then, you know. I always wanted a 10-inch dub plate box. I felt like I was a real DJ because I saw DJ L2J book them with one once. I thought, I want one of those. So the boxes were getting full with tunes, you know, brand new Crush tunes, brand new Ronnie-sized tunes, brand new sub tunes. And then from Brian and Frost, you know, we'd get the Dillinger hookups, you know. So, you know, I was going out DJing and, you know, feeling Warhead and Brown Paper Bag on dub plate and Clear Skies and, you know, some brand new Dillinger, you know, that Friday or whatever. So, you know, good times. And yeah, over the years, you know, things evolved, represent. We did that, toured that and stuff. Did, you know, other projects, Breakbeat Era. And over the last 10 years, I think I kind of like, I got a bit stale doing the same old thing. Well, it's that recent 10 years that I really want to focus in this time. But because, you know, the 90s stories have been told, I guess. Quite a few times. I think a lot of us and a lot of the listeners, you know, we know what drum and bass is. But let's just to get those coordinates, let's just quickly go through what got you to that point. And then it's like we're just super potted. Which point? To the point of being a superstar superhero. In fact, I love that. I love that feeling. No, no, I wouldn't say that. I felt like one at a time. No, no, no. The description of the feeling. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And certainly as a raver, we would have seen anyone with that double-edged box. I can remember watching Booker walking into the Zap in Brighton carrying that exact box that you're talking about. You knew he had something different in that box that no one else had. So just to quickly go through what got you to that point, you grew up in Bristol? Grew up in North Devon. Right. In a place called Barnstable, born in Barnstable Hospital. I grew up five miles outside of Barnstable in this little, I guess, community. It was a mixture of, you know, there was a doctor there, Dr Cole. whose son was DJ Skits. Hip-hop legend. Hip-hop legend, you know. Shout out to my brother Skits, you know. So I grew up there and about 10 years old, my mum moved to Bristol first to do a maths degree and I soon followed and moved from sort of, you know, the middle of the countryside straight into St Paul's, you know, to Sussex Place. It was a culture shock indeed. It was a big culture shock, you know, but a big eye-opener as well. You know, all the endeavor and I was already into music. I was already, you know, gone quickly from Elvis to punk, thank God. And then we got into Scar as well. Two Tone was big. You know, this is like... you know, a new wave was big as well. So, you know, living in North Devon in the middle of nowhere, you know, and, you know, we thought we were punk rockers, you know, we got sort of, we'd see it on TV and try to dress, you know, same, you know, listen to Sex Pistols and Clash and Dead Kennedys and all that. So this is at 10 years old. And then, yeah, shortly after that, moved to Bristol. And yeah, 1982, it was just hip hop, but just hip. So there was all these kind of... things popping up around the city, graffiti, you know, break dancers in the middle of the city. And yeah, it was just everywhere, you know, some of the early pieces by 3D were coming up. One popped up outside my school and I just remember coming outside school and just looking at it and looking at it and I started trying to draw it in my school books. Amazing. Did you know this was a local kind of hero at the time? Not really. I mean, they were, you know, mystical, you know, Lone Ranger types, you know, no one knew who they were. But you knew their pieces, you knew their artwork. So this was all popping up around the time. And there was in this place, the Arnolfini, they had an exhibition in there as well. Subway Art had just come out, the book. I was just a young kid, punk rocker kid, and then quickly saw this hip-hop thing and was like, yeah, this is what it's about. So I just immersed myself in it, really. I was breakdancing. Did it speak to the same instinct as punk did in being DIY and something that you could get involved with yourself? Yeah, absolutely. It was accessible. It was around you everywhere. I was living in this place called Totterdown, just down the road from there. There's quite a famous was placed St. Luke's Squats. And I was going down there to hang out. I was a skateboarder. So that was my main thing first. I found skateboarding. Which again links both punk and hip hop very much. Absolutely, yeah. It's the same ethos. It is just DIY and makes something out of nothing. And Crust and his brothers were... playing at this squat right yes they were around the way they were from Noel West which was like you know a mile or two up the road and yeah Tottenham was in between town and Noel so and St Luke's squat was this kind of like little hub I mean it was an anarchistic squat kind of you know the rebels living down there there was a skate ramp in there you know there was and they had sort of little festival parties there as well so I'd go down there fresh forward doing the parties in the squat at the end it was a scout hut actually so they were throwing parties there I'd hear the music come up over the hill and sort of go down there to have a look and stuff you know, with my skateboard. So this is the, this is the, the backyard area is what you can see in the Fresh 4 Wishing on the start video, right? Yeah, it is. It's a magical, like, capturing of a moment, that video, I think. I mean, yeah, now looking back at it, it is, I mean, it's, yeah, it's one of the first big videos from Bristol, you know, Flynn, cross brother, shout out to Flynn as well. He's one of the guys that showed me DJing, showed me scratching for the first time. Those guys were around. I didn't really know them. I was just kind of a young kiddie, just inquisitive to go have a look and stuff. But this whole time, parties are starting to pop up everywhere. The Wild Bunch thing is still going on. St Paul's Carnival is going on. Ashton Court Festival is going on. And I'm just a young kid from the country, just moved up and it's just blown my mind, really. Did you have a sense that Bristol had its own unique thing within hip-hop culture? Not at that time, because you didn't really know. I mean, I saw Beat Street was the first film that I saw. And that was my introduction to it, really. And then we saw Wild Style. So, you know... Because I was kind of piecing it together, really. And of course, the book, you know, the Subway art book. So, yeah, just about amongst it, really. You know, I was just going from, you know, squat party to house party. You know, I remember going to certain, like the crews that were back there back at the time, Too Bad, or one of the big DJ crews from back there. They threw this party. It was down near the SS Great Britain. And I went down hearing them play a mixture of sort of house, hip-hop, rare groove, boogie, funk. Soul, you know, and you know just and then acid house was coming in. So I'm just just yeah Skateboarding around Bristol from party to party. But it was all done as well with the dub mentality or with the sound system mentality because people Their parents were Caribbean. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, definitely I mean st. Paul's is a bit was the big Caribbean community. It still is it's getting gentrified quite a lot I mean, you know, and the other story and And the other element is, as you described, the squatters. That kind of what came from New Wave, but also the hippie kind of thing, traveller culture of the 70s and 80s. And we all live in the same area. So it's like the melting pot between those two things. And the two sides are helping each other out. The squatters have got the place to do the party. The sound system guys have got the sound system. So let's get together and have a party. You know what I Um, You know, also you had people like Mark Stewart who had come out of the pop group and were one of the most out there and avant-garde of all the punk bands. Yeah, I mean, I didn't really know about him back then. Obviously, I know who he is now and stuff. But yeah, I mean, these people, you know, there's so many different people in different areas doing stuff in Bristol and everyone's so sort of into what they're doing. You know, you might even know who's next elements goes i mean there's the whole chaos uk as well you know so ashton court festival you go up there and you'd see them all in the same field you know the punks would be over in one corner sniffing glue pogo in you know defcon crew was set up there playing to the jazz dancer funk dancers you know wild bunch were over there maybe you know milo spinning some tunes on some other sound system and this is all going in the same sort of like vicinity Amazing. I mean, you know, it's some of these stories have been told, but it just bears repeating so much. What a vital little corner and how lucky you were to be right in the middle of that. nexus of history yeah it's a big influence and then Rave came along then Rave came along yeah Rave changed everything I mean I said this before but I think for all the DJs that were playing stuff before as long as when Rave came along it's like if you didn't get amongst it and get you know jump and start playing this new sound you kind of got left behind really you know you know big DJ from Bristol Easy Groove you know another big influence he doesn't get his due as one of the inventors of Jungle as one of those people who was like carving that thing through hardcore first person i ever heard play me jungle tune i used to go around to this house and you know he played me this ib for records track and it was think it was either jungle techno or bad girls or one of those ones and it was like yeah this is jungle and i was like okay okay yeah yeah i'm about this you know and i think it was that moment that i sort of you know i completely changed you know jungleism jungle techno that's what we called it back then and yeah, just started collecting the records, buying the records, you know, with the idea to play at one of these parties in squats or whatever. So you, DJing was your focus then? Not really, I was just getting into it, I was a skateboarder, and I met this guy Jody from where, back then, he was with his brother, they were called True Funk, they had released a record on Freestrike recordings, Smith & Mighty's label, and I just got, to know them it's a lovely tune that one actually it's very sunrise kind of acid house vibe that's 4am yeah yeah their record was called their record it was a hip hop record it was called back to the beat and like Jodie was scratching his little brother Sammy at the time was 8 years old was rapping and they were just like a little you know they were a sensation in town like they Jungle Brothers come to town to promote the album Straight Outta The Jungle and they performed with them and the whole town was talking about you know these two white kids that could rap and scratch so I got to know Jodie went round there and kind of that was my another one of my big intros you know because Jodie was producing as well he was making music on the four track or a turntable and you know cutting the beats back to back to make a rhythm track, rap over the top, put a bass line on and they put out a record back to the beat through Smith Mighty's label. So that was another connection to it. I started hanging out around there, got into the scratching. I just wanted to learn to scratch first of all. How do you make that sound? You know, like, I want to learn, it's like the next trick. So, yeah, hanging around with Jodie, met up with Flynn. from the Fresh 4, Crust, started hanging out with them. Those guys took me under their wings, started going to their parties, you know, and I was kind of the box boy at the time, you know, the skateboarder kid. They were interested in skateboarding and I was interested in DJing and it kind of like, it became a bit of a trade-off. Yeah, you teach me how to ollie and I'll teach you how to, you know, cut up two copies of Preacher President, you So, yeah, I got hanging out with those guys. I've backtracked a bit now, do you know what I mean? Because, so this leads back to Smith & Mighty, you know, because they've sort of, you know, I would say this before, we're like the illegitimate children of the Wild Bunch and Smith & Mighty, more so Smith & Mighty because they really took us under their wing. and, you know, nurtured us, you know, without really sort of, you know, ever trying to sort of, you know, tell us what to do or release our music. They just let us hang out with them and watch them and, you know, ended up going partying with them because, you know, 92 had come. In the famous Raven reveal. In the famous Raven, we know about it, yeah, the Citroen, the big long Citroen. They had a deal with FFRR at deals yeah they were going to be the new soul to soul yeah exactly yeah and you know Wild Bunchy got a couple of records out and then they got their deal but Raven had come along and you know Sunrise I think they went to Sunrise and never looked back you know and we just go raving from the from their studio we go around there on a friday at like 8 p.m and sort of hang out until they get the the rave call you know i mean the bat the bat film of ring and it's like we're you know getting the citron and just check off to the oxford cheer somewhere and to this free party yeah and that again is another connection with that kind of uh hippie alternative culture because those sound systems Obviously Circus Warp, who were one of the big three-party sound systems, had a big connection to Bristol Rave. Yeah, Circus Warp, big influence. They did this party at Chipping Sodbury Common. Everyone from Bristol was there. I think that was one. I knew Crust before, but I think when we bumped into each other on the dance floor in the Circus Warp blue and red tent at 6am, there was a certain sort of like, ah, yeah, you're here. you get it. and i mean i remember just looking his eyes this is different than it yeah this you know and the rest of those next summer from 92 93 we were there every weekend you know we would just make our way to wherever the effect the free party was and that was a way to get heard as a dj that was you know the best you know place to play you i'd you know i'd spend all my money right you get 64 pounds a week every every two weeks 64 pound every two weeks for your job and out of that I think I spent probably 40 quid on records you know and then the rest maybe on a bit of you know some pasta and porridge or something And then, you know, the idea was to get to the free party and get play. That was it. That was everything. So, you know, you get there, stand behind the decks until, you know, someone got you on. It was usually Easy Groove was the guy to kind of come along. And, you know, you're on next, you know, because he had the control, you know, everyone loved him. You know, then he would come from the big raves, perceptions and, you know, always come to the free parties in the morning to play you know that was his other crowd playing to the travelers and playing to you know the real free party hardcore you know so dennis would say easy groove would say yep you're next and and that was it that was your spotlight to shine amazing and then 94 comes along and jungle is overground yeah and by that time Were you producing? Ronnie and Crust had each got a tune or two out there by that point. Yeah, I mean, I've done a couple of tunes with Jodie, first being 4AM, under the name True Funk, and then we did two Rave EPs under the name Sub Love. And they were kind of like 130 BPM, 140 BPM, rave music, you know, sampling hip hop, stabs, you know, a couple of reggae shouts and, you know, and like, you know, these kind of hardcore breakdowns, you know, and we'd done a couple of VPs for that. And I got to play at Universe Festival. festival it was a party universe was one of the big paid parties so i got to play there quite early and that was a real eye-opener didn't really go anywhere and then i ended up just going really back into playing the free parties but in those couple of years we we kind of like worked out what we wanted to play so when it got a chance to make make a record you know first couple of records i made with jody um Yeah, the sub-love EPs then led to do the tune with Ronnie. We made our first track, which was Agility, which came out on V Recordings. And then we did Music Box shortly after. And they were sort of designed to how we wanted to DJ. You know, they were like mix friendly. You know, we knew we didn't want too many breakdowns. We knew we wanted a drum intro, so it was good for mixing. And you had a nice transition point where you come across. So it made us look slick while we were DJing and made a good transition. And you all had that rolling rear groove kind of thing, which came from sample digging as a scratch DJ, did it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those guys have record collections. Ronnie's brother, General, who was in the crew called UD4, he had a massive record collection. So we'd kind of go digging in his crates and stuff. And they had breakbeats. They had some breakbeats that were covered. I still don't know the names of, because the records were covered up. And yeah, we found some beats, the beat for Music Box. which is Versatility Breakbeat, which is now used in so many German-based tunes, pretty much everywhere, even it's just the hi-hat. But so we found this break and we're like, yeah, this is the groove, you know, so made those first couple of tracks and a lot had changed between 92 and 94, you know, I think by 94, Jungle was sort of, had become a thing. you know, it evolved from hardcore rave to now, you know, in London, London had done its thing as well. I remember going to Notting Hill Carnival up here one year and, you know, sort of traipsing around to try and find the jungle stage. And when we finally got there, you know, two tracks I heard was Dark Stranger and Long Dark Tunnel. They were the two big tunes at the time and Dirty Games. you know so yeah we went back to Bristol after this sort of experience and yeah that was it it was just got in the studio more started making more music I mean that's an understatement really because from that point yeah it really snowballed right like super fast all of you guys had like major production rate right and then you add the roddy size represent thing yeah into the middle of that like you just didn't stop it was just you know it's pretty much the way it is now really you know it is just a way of life you know and just love making music love being in the studio um would spend all the time in the studio if we probably could but yeah we were just you know And we were bouncing off each other. There was a great energy. There was a great pushing forward, you know, across to make a tune that would inspire me and, you know, to go inspire Ronnie and so on. And I think, you know, we're just a good sort of bouncing off each other team. And you had it fairly well sort of split into, you had your kind of serious tunes, your V-type tunes. Then you had Dope Dragon for like rolling out the bangers. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And Rollie Size Represent and Breakbeat Era as the kind of more stage worthy festival type stuff. Yeah, because we just like, you know, if you're just making music, we just love making music. So you're in there every day, you know, not every track goes the way it should, you know, so you just make music and okay, okay, this one, you know, this one sounds better, a you know, the Breakbeat Era song with Lenny, you know, it's like a completely different groove, you know, we were pushing ourselves to try new things as well, like, you wanted to do something you'd never heard before, you know, you want to try and make something that would, first of all, impress your friends, you know, impress the crew around you, and then, you know, yeah, just maybe, you know, do something that would, oh yeah, that'd be great. didn't expect to make that we're gonna we're gonna whiz through the 90s a bit because i want to get on to like all of the other genres and things that you've you you've touched you know you had so many high points so many big tunes um you experienced the absolute explosion of drum and bass into the international world but that also led to pressures right i mean the touring and everything yeah yeah yeah yeah it was a whirlwind you know none of us were really expecting it to go the way it did and you know it was being thrown into the rock and roll lifestyle you know we were on a tour bus you know, with each other day in, day out, you know, partying, you know, we like a good party, you know, we're known for that. And yeah, rolling around the world, you know, going to New York, you know, going to Australia, going to Japan and Europe a few times. So, you know, the pressures came on, I think, and, you know, being away from the studio was hard. you know so when we did come back to try and make music again maybe it was harder to get back into it or you know because I think you know this thing is like you know almost like martial art you know or you know an athlete you have to do it all the time in order to be really in tune with it you know and you get you get further away from it and it takes you longer to get back in to really access the source that we had when we were first that initial period. I mean, it's funny that you describe it as a martial art, actually, because I thought when you described like learning a scratch as almost identical to learning a skate trick, it's really easy to see how you and Krust especially vibed on that mentality, because he talks about it from a breakdancers perspective. He talks about everything as... perfecting a move and doing it one step better than the next guy and all of that and that can be applied to any of these crafts. Yeah, definitely. It's a very hard thing to fake it, you know. It's the tunes that effortlessly make themselves the ones that seem to stand the test of time. the ones you've really got to force and make work. But some of our best tunes were just made without us even really realising we did it at the time. I've been thinking about this exact theme because I've just been on a binge of listening to Paradox. And Paradox is like, you know, he's like the Japanese craftsman of drum and bass. He makes Paradox breaks. That's what he does. And he does it on Octomed on an ancient computer. you know and he keeps sound he just keeps doing it yeah exactly again and again yeah innovation isn't necessarily the the aim it's like perfection yeah i think so i think we were pushed into a world you know from just being create free creatives into a world where you know the industry and you know having to do it for a reason suddenly the world's listening and the pressures of that you know definitely came And what no one tells young people who are about to be in a band or a collective or whatever is you spend more time with those people than you do with your spouse. You are like 24-7. with those same people so it is intense it's a pressure cooker and at a certain point you know that the pressure cooker blew over you know I think after the last tour I think we know we did so we did New Forms and then the second one In The Mode which yeah and I think by the time we finished touring In The Mode everyone was sick of each other you know the pressures of being on tour got to us And we just needed to regroup, you know, and yeah, you know, I think some relationships have become strained. And yeah, you know, it kind of ended not too well, really. I mean, without wanting to, you know, you know, these these things happen to so many, even the strongest musical groupings, but yeah. Without wanting to dwell on the negative, what did you find kept your creative juices flowing at that point? Were you kind of sick of the whole thing musically? I think I've always liked working with people. I definitely consider myself a better collaborator than solo artist. I just enjoy it more. I enjoy the outcome. I think the product at the end of it is better with two heads. Two heads can make a better, you know, better, better cake, you know, so. Yeah, I started working with DJ Clips and that helped me a lot. Also, we were moving, the equipment was changing, the technology was changing. We started on Atari's samplers. We used the Roland 760 sampler, that was our weapon of choice. And Atari Cubase and effects and stuff, some outboard stuff and some desks. Just twiddling knobs, literally. We'd turn it up until it went in the red. and that sounded good to us and we'd keep that and um then it all changed it went it went inside the computer and people started getting you know the idea was yeah you get a computer you can do stuff faster you know you don't have to cut spend two weeks sampling cutting up these breaks into a million pieces and reconstructing yourself you can do it with you know one button you know with um recycle or whatever and that's cool but i think you know when you actually did have to them up so you had like you get a relationship with each sound you know you really know it inside out you know it's like and then you know what to do with it you know you kind of may remember where stuff is and you know find the right sound at the right time And yeah, we had to adjust to working inside the computer. That, I mean, a lot of people will say that that was a creative problem for drum and bass. And I think I was guilty of it at the time, actually. I got turned off drum and bass because I was like, everything's starting to get too slick. And people have lost that kind of wild invention that came with jungle cut-ups and that kind of thing. And looking back... I realised that no, you know, there was great stuff. Of course there was being banged out during that time. But it did enter a kind of production arms race because you had this, all of this computing power at your fingertips. You had to know how to use it. You know, you needed to know some numbers. You needed to know the frequency range numbers, you know, what did what and stuff rather than just turning, you know, sweeping an EQ sweep. Which maybe takes some of the instinct. Yes, definitely. And, you know, I was stuck. You know, I wasn't enjoying what I was making to that. on my own, you know, I was struggling and also we'd done a lot. So we covered a lot of ground and, you know, to continue trying to make the same tune over and over again, got really, you know, disheartening and, you know, I stopped enjoying it, you know, so working with Clipse was, it was a breath of fresh air. Of course, but it's now Red Light. Yeah, you know, yeah, yeah, exactly. Shout to Clipse, shout to Red Light He was working with Full Cycle at the time and had come along at the end of it, you know, as things were kind of falling apart, you know, Clips came along and was like, he had a, you know, real energy about what he was doing. And, you know, we hit it off, made a couple of tunes, made a few more tunes. As anyone who's met him in person, that's like energy is the word. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, he was buzzing, had this new, he had his own sound that was bringing to the table. And I was like, you know what? I just want to have fun and make music. I don't want to take this too seriously. And again, that's something that people look down on at that period, that kind of jump up thing. Yes, there's always been that. thing but it was those tunes now stand up as party starters yeah time i don't care about you know being cool or whatever i mean or you know because when it's time to be cool i put my cool hat on and you know we'll make some cool music but at the same time there's nothing more fun than making a party tune you know that blows the you know destroys the dance floor whatever and that that is a that's a part of it as well as part of the training thing as well so you know you may need to make four of these in order to make one of these special deep ones deep ones exactly was anything else outside drum and bass kind of turning your head at that time turn of the millennium i suppose sort of time i mean we missed out on a lot of stuff because we were so engrossed in drum and bass i feel you know we missed out on the garage thing garage came along and we were just so head in the drum and we were just kind of a little bit oblivious to it, you know. And after that, Grime came along and, you know, I kind of, I was just starting to listen to a lot of boogie music. I started going back because when I'd grown up in Bristol, going to these house parties, you know, I just got on the air. for you know 80s funk and boogie and I got even more into that like I needed something to counterbalance this drum and bass seriousness that I wasn't really enjoying so you know I did this mixtape with a guy called Gus Pirelli called Laminate Radio and it was pure 80s funk and boogie and you know people loved the mix and we started getting bookings off that and you know we used to put on suits and you know go and DJ boogie and you know the whole thing was yo yo if we do this one day we're gonna get our own you know yacht and our own helicopter and you know we'll be drinking Cristal and you know all this stuff DJing for Puff Daddy whatever This didn't happen. We ended up spending more money on our dry cleaning bill. I mean, you got it right musically. There's no doubt about that. There was one mix you did for Rinse. Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm trying to think. It must be about 10 years ago now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where you went all the way from Funk and Boogie right through into Drum and Bass. It was mid-summer. It was a hot summer, I think. I think I remember the one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You obviously managed to then I was trying to do that I think I needed to go off because to me you know drum and bass jungle it always it was always about what you could bring in from elsewhere to make it interesting you know and I think by that time maybe people were recycling the same ideas and they were taking influences from drum and bass rather than taking influences from elsewhere you know and adding that to the mix you know so Yeah, I got into boogie funk and disco and got back into it. And that was, you know, and then I tried to incorporate elements of that into, you know, when I did get back to making drum-based jungle, I did a track with Jenna G, A Thousand Soul Songs, and that was like a homage to, you know. the soul and the funk and the boogie so she's an underappreciated contributor to british music the amount of stuff she has done and energy is you know dots that she joins with the people that she's worked with she's my soul sister you know and working with her you know we were big fans of her before from you know the stuff she did with future cut and obviously in love and you know other tracks she'd made so yeah me and clips worked with her first on the track work it out and then you know, I ended up working with her years later and, you know, shouts to all the Manchester crew, by the way, they've been a massive, you know, part of what I'm doing now and a part of my journey to get here as well. So, you know, I consider them like a twin town to Bristol almost. Yeah. And I think, I mean, I think we'll get to that in a bit because that's really kind of come to culmination. I think, I think recently. Yeah really. I'd heard bits and bobs, you know, I'd heard some stuff and I wasn't sure about all of it and then Joker played me Tron and I was like... this sounds like hip hop really, you know, this is, but this is sick as well. Yeah. It has, it has the Simpson stuff. Yeah. So yeah, I think Joker was doing his thing and, you know, dubstep was another sort of, you know, um, you know, different, you know, it had to step away from drum and bass. It needed to change. It needs to slow down. Drum and bass had exhausted all its, you know, BPM possibilities. It got really fast and it hero had he once said to me that if Rave was looking outwards Dubstep took exactly the same elements of the dub and the breakbeat and everything and looked inwards with it and became introspective yeah yeah yeah I mean this was what happened in Bristol sort of on another scene as well you know they started I think the Hench Night started, you know, and DJs like... And Jakes, of course, had been in drum and bass for years before that. Yeah, and he'd found another angle, another avenue to go down and was making loads of music. Headhunter was coming through that same scene, later went on to become Addison Groove, someone I worked with. get to talking in a minute yeah but um another another powerhouse of a party energy yeah yeah yeah man tony's great um and also rob smith you know started rsd as well so which were extraordinary records like yeah yeah yeah they sounded like smith and mighty but also dubstep just somehow perfectly encapsulated the connections because i mean one of the earliest gutter funk records was was my mate DJ First Aid it was it was First Aid and Pulsar actually yeah yeah yeah not to forget Pulsar yeah that was a mad one I went down to Star Delta to master some records maybe cut some dub plays and you know First Aid was working there at the time as I was leaving he said do you want to hear one of the tracks I've been working on and I said yeah he played it to me I was like this is that you know what I mean this is that Bristol-ish this is just like the real weighty dub sound system bassline another set of micro connections you know he's obviously from Devon and was a protege of Skits so Skits taught him to DJ as well true true right yeah yeah and he's now Jabberoo right yeah so yeah he played me the track and I remember just going home in the car and all the way home just listening to the track over and over and over and over again. I was like, this is sick, man. I want to put this out. And I was looking to start a new label. Basically, I wanted another outlet to have total freedom to create what I want. really have a set path not be the when you really made a statement because it was dubstep and then soaker kind of yeah sort of yeah so some of the next releases were just now yeah which um it's like trinidad meets bristol yeah yeah the um interface the producer i'd worked with him before I've made a record that come out on the Clear Skies label, another label I started before, Gutta Funk, just to do drum and bass. So I did this track, Bright Lights, with a guy called William Cartwright, who's a very talented singer, multi-instrumentist, and Sam Interface, who then become Just Now. So we've worked together. Sam was someone who lived up the road and yeah when I heard the Just Now stuff you know I was blown away you know this sounds different this fits in with this new label this new ethos that I was starting you know our thing was to throw as many curveballs as possible you know At the same time, I've got to shout out Carly. I think you know Carly, Carly Bags. She came along board and started helping me manage the label and run things and stuff. And she was mad into Soca as well. So she was like, yeah, yeah, this is that new stuff. So we put out a couple of records by them. Then we put out the Tannup record, which really blew them up. Yeah. And that... that soccer thing of like super high speed kick drums. It really fits now with what a lot of people are doing, connecting drum and bass back to Raven Techno. And definitely, it was like 150 BPMs and 160 BPMs. And then the footwork thing, which is also slowed it down as well. Yeah, that was a big influence, you know, and, you know, and something that we still exercise a lot at the moment, you know. I work really closely with Will Dismantle, someone who I shout out to be in there. I wouldn't really be sat here now. Got a phone wouldn't be doing where it is right now. And he's, he's from Brighton, right? He is from Brighton. Yeah. So he was working with, um, shy effects on digital sound boy stuff. Um, I met him at Glastonbury festival and, um, shout out shy effects by the way, as well. because his label, Digital Soundboy, was a big influence on me starting Gutta Funk. That absolutely makes sense. And I think it's really interesting to look at that time. So we're around 2010, 2011 right now. 2011's when I started the label, yeah. That was like a high point. And I think we're looking back on it now, 10 years kind of cycles and so on. when almost all the genres were peaking at the same time. It was like drum and bass was coming back from its lull around the millennium. Dubstep was reaching that commercial peak and it hadn't quite gone all the way off into the madness of the two years that followed. Grime was coming back because it had kind of had a flash at the beginning and then dip and then it was coming back. You had UK Funky. You had the weird stuff like Rusty, you know, coming from Scotland, all that crazy Rusty Hudson stuff. You had loads of different stuff. And like ShyFX, I think, you know, was one of the people to sort of champion. going out as a drum and bass DJ and totally, you know, going against the grain and playing like Street Fighter. And connecting also with Rudigan. So he was going back another generation previously and drawing all the threads of sound system. With the hard record, yeah. And this was really appealing to me, you know, I was like, and there are also labels like, you know, Talking Loud, you know, Warp and Ninja, you know, these other labels that have been multi-genre labels for years, you know And it was like, you know what? I've got to go against the grain. I have to sort of open... I've got to open my creative possibilities here. So I needed this outlet. So when we were in the studio, we didn't have to think about... And at the time, I stopped taking drum and bass bookings. I wasn't enjoying what I was going out there. I wasn't enjoying what I was making and I wasn't really enjoying DJing. because I didn't have enough tunes of my own that sounded good. I was kind of making music in a room that kind of didn't sound great, it wasn't treated right, and, you know, it was a low period. And I needed to find some sort of, you know... some sort of escape, you know, out route. You needed to find him the next exit door. Yeah. Were you putting on parties at the time? There's one video for one of those tracks and I can't remember which it is, one of those early gutter funk tracks that looks like a squat party. I'm trying to think what it might be. Which one was that? It's in black and white, I think. Not the, oh, the piece and dub. Yes. That's on Shai's label. Oh, yes, of course. Okay, so yeah, yeah, yeah. So, yeah, also other people that I've worked with that have really helped me to sort of, you know, get my skills up. I've learned a lot from them, you know, because... you know, I'm not musically trained as well. And, you know, I struggle as well like any other producer out here. I mean, so working with some of these people, you know, who I consider, you know, very high, you know, I look up to as producers. Brake was another big, big one. Working with him, he's a master engineer, master producer, master of the sound, you know, he really knows how to. shape and control sound so working with him was really helped me up my game and learn more techniques of how i think how to get get the sound again because i think like i said back to the equipment and back to the evolution drum and bass we'd lost how in the early days you know there were certain things we did without thinking about it just the fact necessity speeding up a break beat till it's a pitch is higher you know and the groove is more it's got that little bubble to it, you know? And we started like using breaks at the real pitch, thinking that was the way to do it, but you lost the groove within that. And it starts sounding more like a rock. band or something yeah it didn't have the funk man yeah so yeah working with break you know he was utilizing techniques like that and kind of you know he taught me a lot as well so he's someone who's who's come back to the old school jungle values recently in his output and he's doing it with the weapons grade production values but it's old school yeah he keeps all those values yeah so i did some tracks with him i did a track called slow down and And we made an EP for Shy's label as well, the Grand Funk Hustle EP. A couple of free drum bass tunes, and then it had the tune Peace and Dub, which was... you know, a dub tune, not, not your typical job tune, but it was our interpretation of it. It featured the voice of MC fats. Yeah. Yeah. That video, it really seems like you were trying to recapture the kind of illegal party should be in kind of vibe. Do you know what that was? That was this, uh, videographer called Tom Swindle. who I met at the time as well, we just hung out in Bristol for three weekends in a row. It was a little bit planned. We'd make a few calls. He knew some people. We went down to the local St. Paul's Old People's Christmas Party, and they very kindly let us in and filmed them. It was like, first of all, who are these guys? And then as soon as we got the camera out, they all started shucking out, which was brilliant. And then we just kind of... Went on this little magical mystery tour around Bristol and part of Tom's thing was he wanted to show the inside of the party. So sometimes people just showing us a room there was a party in or this place had parties back in the day. We ended up emotional. I think, at night, or one of them. Actually, with Star and Garter at one point. We just did a lap of Bristol, really. I'm really proud of that video. What's interesting is that it was at the same time, there was a very, and I mean, no shade at all on any of these artists, because there's some incredible music coming out, but very London-centric, Berlin-centric set of fusions that were happening, like the Hyperdub and... and the Hessel Audio. Right. So many great tunes. That was inspiring to us as well. Yeah, hearing these, you know, the Pearson Sound things. And my friend went to a thing at the Blue Mountain and heard Addison Groove and Pearson Sound playing. He came back just telling me about how the sound systems sounded and how these 808s were just, you know, just making the system pump. And I was just like... Like a meerkat, you know, like, what's going on over there? You know what I mean? I want some of that. I want some of that new energy. And that's when I bumped into Alison Groove. But it was, I mean, it was easy for us within the media and especially the London-centric media to kind of... feel that this music it sort of vaguely spoke to techno it vaguely spoke to the things that we understood um and yet you were building a set of connections that kind of almost swerved london so brighton manchester trinidad and trinidad exactly and creating this kind of a parallel version of what we call post dubstep you know that that mixed mixed speed I mean, it was very natural, you know, it's just people you bump into around at festivals and stuff. I mean, I think... I mean, I'll be honest, at that time, I wasn't in the best of minds, do you know what I mean? And I kind of was trying to find my new path, you know? I ended up running around festivals, basically, you know, doing mad stuff, you know, like commandeering golf carts and sliding down marquees at six in the morning, you know? I was kind of getting more known for doing these crazy things like that. And that was cool. You know, I got to meet some people through that. You know, I met Scream through that sort of environment. You will meet Scream. Do enough of that stuff, yeah? I met Scream sliding down the tent at six o'clock. almost not quite yeah yeah um you know but meeting these new people and i wanted to you know get part of this new energy you know it's like there's new stuff going on so yeah we were just building you know and then ended up going back to bristol and making music with people and you know putting out on car funk yeah and it it feels like it's been a steady accumulation over the past 10 years it is getting there it does finally feel like you know, we're starting to get a bit of notice for what we're doing, you know, I think I've heard somewhere, you know, keep doing dope shit until someone notices. But we did, we felt like underdogs, you know, we didn't feel like we were properly getting recognised or the stuff we were doing was harder for people to put in a category or a box, you know, and that was on purpose. It was like, okay, everyone else is going left, we're going to go. left, right and forward and back, you know, all at once. And it was a bit chaotic. And I was running around trying to make videos, trying to promote records, trying to make records, trying to do a bit of everything, kind of pushing my energies everywhere, which I learned a lot of different stuff from but at the same time it was like treading water you know weren't really getting anywhere you know it was just kind of needed some other elements to come into play to make it work and you know that's when um i met dismantle and that's been i mean how long have you been steadily producing as dimantle um god i can't remember the year we actually met It's getting on four or five, it might even be six now, do you know what I mean? So yeah, we met at Glastonbury. It's one of those conversations, you know, we have, hey, let's make a tune together. And you know, how much time does that ever come together? Not many. But this time, you know, he got in his car and drove to Bristol and turned up and, you know, we made a record, first being Over the Edge, come out on Digital technical kind of excursion and then yeah we went on just count you know form a strong bond and a partnership in the studio and there's not really anything everything that I do now he is involved in and vice versa in some way you know we sort of executive ly produced the last got a funk album has just come out all subject to vibes And yeah, just formed that strong communion, you know, and support for each other. You know, he's like probably 20 years younger than me. I don't know if he called me my man or I call him mine or I call him. Yeah, basically we mentor each other and we support each other to kind of like. Yeah. I mean, what they built in Brighton, the whole Gangoon, what was his collective called? I can't remember. I don't know, really. I think we know about his history in Brighton, to be honest. So there was just a few of them and they just put on huge dubstep raves and they would connect with just, again, the people who were slightly out of being generic. So Quest and Silky would be a big part of it. Got you. and I think yeah dismantling sound funk oriented and even though he was did the stuff that was known as bro step that kind of very noisy. Right, right. We did the computation thing which blew up for him. Yeah. I think, I mean, his musical influences and, you know, knowledge goes right back as well and he's taught me a lot about other, you know, areas and stuff and some of that, you know, the actual areas that I know about as well. So, but, you know, from coming from, I guess dubstep, but his was more sort of the tribal 130 sort of thing and... yeah I just don't think there was an actual real lane for that either so we've I think we've had to carve our own lane you know as gutter funk and do you now feel like there's a kind of network because you talked about Manchester and it feels like you know what you've now got going in this collective sense it's similar to Levels and Hit and Run and all those guys 100% man I love all those guys man you know shouts to Chimpos one of my favourite DJs in the world all them lot I've done a few sets recently with Chunky I've worked with Jenna you know I mean Fox Fox is on the album all them lot Stratz George physics you know all them lot have just been so warm and just just generous and welcoming to us lot as well and you know we really have a you know a lot of respect for them lot Yeah, I mean, dub physics breaking through was one of those things that like reconfigured what drum and bass could be and where it fit. Absolutely. And Rodergan getting hold of it and just taking it and making it his own, you know, and championing it. Yeah, no, it's been a good time. And, you know, we're still working with those guys a lot, you know, meeting Prima as well. who's now part of Watch the Ride, through DRS. DRS introduced us to her and now she's on board and we're building and working with her. So yeah, Manchester's always been, like I said, it's the twin town. And, I mean, do you even describe what your music is now? I try not to. Yeah. I try not to, but I will say from going off on these other excursions and, you know, getting the production techniques backed up together with Will Dismantle, working with Addison Groove, you know, making footwork with him and, you know, other strains of... techno influence 130 stuff whatever um it's kind of like reignited my love for the drums and the bass you know and making stuff now you know again with this mantle because we are a production team together it's like i'm loving the jungle again you know and you know we just did the track with d double original format you know kind of beats heart back to maybe those late 90s times you know and he is of course a drum and bass DJ MC MC from the beginning yeah yeah yeah so making that track with him you know So me and Will were doing our stuff, me and Dismantle were making stuff as Dismantle. We did like the Sex Machine track, which was a bit of fun, made in four hours for Glastonbury and it kind of blew up. You know, we were making a lot of stuff at 150 BPM, kind of tried to make different tunes at different tempos at all times, which makes it interesting for DJing. But, you know, it also keeps us on our toes. So we make stuff anywhere between you know 100 bpms and i think we might go to 174 these days but then when you talk about because it's all sound system music ultimately yeah i guess we talk about in bpms and if you if you think of it as sound system music then you don't need to worry about the tempo because you can always just spin it back and hit the siren i do need to get a siren put that on my to-do list now now it is and like keeping it interesting for yourself you know not just becoming stale with it so sometimes you're changing a couple of bpms though i mean we do look at things in bpm because when we're djing now it's like okay that's that temp that'll mix with that and you try to mix that old record old rave record at 140 with a grime record you've got a new mix going on you know i mean it's like what this and people are making grimy bassy yeah techno-y stuff at 115 that will mix into our boogie tracks yeah yeah yeah yeah you can go in any direction it's um you know it's an exciting time it almost i've got this kind of vague theory forming that for the first decade of this millennium people didn't know what to do with too much information it was all available suddenly the whole of the past was there anyone could dig out all the boogie and all the grime and all the what drummer 90s drummer basically they wanted overload of information and it's now another 10 years later people are learning how to stitch it together or draw these different lines through it well it does take time you know i mean and uh you can't force these things you know you might want things to happen then and there but you know sometimes you've got to give it 10 years to marinate and then it's truly ready to you know to be served up So, yeah, making tracks at different tempos has kept it interesting for us and also been able to fuse the different grooves, you know, so that rhymed, fuse the grooves, I like that. So like the text machine tune was like 155 BPMs, you know, it wasn't grime, but it had a grime kind of, you know, that grime clap thing going on. But then we could put some more jungle influences into it as well. So we'll continue to kind of, you know, flip things up on their head when they get boring. And you've just recently done a compilation of your classic diet tracks. Yes. They still sound crisp. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Shout out to If Khan on management, a.k.a. Spiritual Advisor, you know, Transmit Signal, who basically came down to Bristol, I think, three years ago and started working with Gutta Funk, started managing the labels, started managing me, Dismantle. He now manages a host of other people through Transmit Signal. And he really was the glue that we needed. I talked before about just sort of trying to do everything, not really getting anything done. We just needed the right people in place to kind of form the crew wholly, and so everybody can do what they do best. And really we go back into focusing on the music, which... I think is easy to forget these days what it should actually all be about, you know, and we have so many distractions these days with social media, with other people's music, with the phone ringing, you know, your WhatsApp ring, and it's so many points of contact now. And I think really to get to the source, you have to kind of dive in deep, you know, so deep that... you can't even hear the phone ring. And it takes someone to, you know, mine the archive and pick the key things. Yeah, sorry, back to the archives. I'm going to go off tangents. No, no, it's relevant. But the archive thing was like, so If came on board and he was like, look, one of the first things when we sat down, he's like, look, I want to do a compilation of your old stuff. And I was hesitant. I didn't want to do Although people always want you to kind of do what they know you for, you know, when you hear a DJ premiere, you want a DJ premiere beat. But what about if Premiere made some Speed Garage? Do you remember when Todd Terry made... Made his hit pop out. No, he made a jungle album, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He made that tune Blackout and he came in and dropped it. It was a bit like Piper, but it was sick, right? And then he came to Bar Rumba and played De La Soul. in his DJ set, which was kind of mad. But, you know, people don't usually want you to step aside, away from what you're doing. They want you for what they know you for, what you're the best. And it was like, look, I understand that, but I've got my own sort of, you know, journey to think about and I've got my happiness to think about more to the point here. Do you know what I mean? So, yeah, getting around to doing that, I was And Iff was like, look, we're going to do it. We're going to do it properly. We're going to remind people of your legacy. And I was like, okay, okay, cool. And as we sort of went through all the bats and, you know, started to get the tracks together, we managed to put together, you know, a product we're really proud of, you know, with a gatefold, you know, with a load of notes, you know, pictures of the equipment. and remasters of the tracks which you know we ended up getting joker to remaster who's now mastering the mixing amongst other things and um yeah he done a fantastic job updating them you know getting the getting the track sounding better than they've ever sounded before and it came out and the feedback was amazing And it was just what I needed really to kind of, you know, to help me to move on, to put that in its place and also let people know in one body of work, the sort of the legacy, which had kind of been a little bit all over the place. As is natural because the drum and bass world, for all that it was. sort of focused in insular it was also chaotic chaotic yeah yeah yeah part of why we loved it you know but yeah to get it all back in and then have that come out followed by the all subject to vibes album which is all brand new stuff which really says what we're about today you know and in one body you know could show people diverseness of the label and yeah yeah to use a horrible media phrase they definitely work as tent poles they like those tent poles you know they sort of hold up the marquee which you can sort of demonstrate your ways yeah definitely no and it's been great as well you know I've got loads of gigs off it and from being away from the drum and bass world to be invited back in to play some of the raves I've played you know, to great response and, you know, to get that love for the stuff you've done. It fills you with the positivity you need to move forward. Beautiful. I think that's a great note to end on. It's, I mean, you know, these are... Celtic and often dark times and it's so nice to see that things can be pieced back together. Yeah, we're finding our way back home slowly but, you know, we're definitely... And it's done around the community values and the sound values and all of the stuff that you actually... The integrity behind it, man. ...learned from scratching and skateboarding onwards. It's all the same thing, man. It just continues and I think it's important to remember that if you find something... that's working, you might not need to change it, you know, or you might need to wait 10 years before it starts working again, but stick with it. All right. Thank you. Thank you so much. It's been brilliant. Thank you for having me. Thank you. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Bye. Thank you. Bye.
