*Dramatic music* you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Elijah and Skilliam love grime. They were born a few years too late, though, to participate in its heyday and entered into the game at a moment when the genre was at a low ebb. Dizzy Rascal and Wiley had gone on to bigger things, and the producers and MCs left were mostly stuck retreading formula after formula. In a sense, then, they entered at a perfect time to re-energize things. They offered up a unique instrumental take on the scene that valued the producer and their ability to innovate over the MC. They've pushed this sound via their Butters label and a regular show on Rinse FM. Earlier this month, the radio station honored their impact by having them mix the latest in their series of compilations. We asked Fact Magazine's Tom Lee to catch up with the duo about the genre, the label, and the scene itself earlier this month. Okay, so starting at the beginning, when and how did you guys first meet? We both went to Hertfordshire University. I was living with Elijah's friend. in my halls and Elijah brought his decks up so we were like at times of boredom went to his flat started mixing on decks and it all just developed from there and he was one of like the only guys into grime there I presume yeah there wasn't much going on grime wise in Hertfordshire because it's just outside London so at the time it was just more like a pirate radio scene and not many people outside London were getting sort of in tune with grime and our university didn't really cater for that so yeah what year is this 2005 okay so like were you so you were both like DJing at the time not so much DJing out obviously because you're in Hertfordshire but like you were both practicing DJing and I was DJing more than Elijah was and it sort of just it sort of just built up from there we just got more into it after a couple of years okay, let's get it rolling. Were you doing radio or anything before that, like pre-uni? Yeah, I was, but about three years before that, I was with a group of MCs. Okay, so I guess fast forward a little bit, I guess you both eventually leave uni, move back to London. Is that when you started taking the DJing thing a bit more seriously? No, it was actually my final year. So it was about 2007. It was on a university radio station and a rince approached us saying they needed some... I don't think they had much grime on their station. So they said, okay, we need some more grime shows. And we done a little pilot show with Scratch R. I'm guessing Rince got in touch because they'd heard of you guys via the Butters blog or Grimepedia or Grimeforum and so forth. Yeah, that's right. That was late 2008. So we'd done our first pilot show in November 2008. And then we got a proper show in April 2009. So we were doing kind of cover shows for three, four months. And I was in my final year at uni at the time. I was kind of coming back to London to do rints whenever they were calling. I don't think they knew that, but... How did the whole sort of Grimepedia butters blog thing come about? Because it was kind of a strange time when it did come out because there was a lot of really good writing about Grime a couple of years before and it kind of disappeared a little bit. Yeah, that's why it's a weird thing when you want something and it's not there, then you kind of got to provide it yourself and that's kind of just why the label exists, why the blog existed because all the people that were writing about it. stopped for whatever reasons, many different reasons. And I just wanted somewhere where people could read about it. Then when that kind of avenue was filled, I wanted somewhere to hear it and then kind of filled that avenue and then wanted someone to release it. So we kind of filled that avenue as well. So did you always have like a label in mind as like an end goal? No, I think it was when we were here at Rinse. When you're DJing and maybe 90% of the tunes that you're playing are not coming out, it was kind of depressing. You can't really sustain a kind of momentum if the music you're pushing isn't getting released professionally and the artists you're playing are not, say, making money, but they're not kind of getting anything out of it apart from a few spins on the radio. So that's what kind of motivated me. The label. Well, it was kind of like, I mean, to me anyway, it seemed at that time you sort of had, there was no healthy middle ground. You either got released through like one of the only labels that would do it or you would sign something to a major and then just sit on the shelf for whenever. That's right. So yeah, we're trying to like readdress that balance. And then even still now, you know, we're helping people, other people get their kind of things running. So what I'm doing is still kind of really for the scene, not really for myself, just because I want to see it for myself more than, you know, for, you know, the Butters empire. I don't really, I don't really give monkeys about that still. Well, that's actually one of the questions I had down because something that always strikes me about Butters and always did strike me about Butters compared to a lot of other labels is it seems to focus on community rather than competition. And I mean, obviously doing a bit of research for that was actually reading some old Butters posts today and you were bigging up records on other labels as much as you were your own. So does that sort of community thing come from when you and a few other people started Grime Forum? No, it's this weird thing when you're kind of involved in a scene and you go to raves and you always see the same people. Not even necessarily because you're friends. It's just because you're really into the same thing. When someone that you see on a... kind of semi-regular basis make something that's incredible you want everyone to know about it it's one of them it's one of them it still happens now do you mean like people kind of you know mask it behind different websites or labels and all this kind of stuff but generally if you know these people are putting out things on their labels or on their blogs they're just really passionate about it and that's the same thing that we are Okay, so speaking of sort of communities and going to raves and stuff like that, were you guys going to a lot of the early grime nights pre-uni or were you a bit young for it? I started raving probably in like 2004, I was like 17. So, you know, the earlier grime dances were, yeah, I was too young for. But then... I'd say the things that I remember were, you know, the year when Lethal Bees' Forward Rhythm came out. That was like the biggest track I'd ever seen, you know, when I was 17 that year, when that came out. And everyone knew it. Like, you didn't even have to be into grind to know it. Like, it was just huge. So any club we went to... that was getting you know 10 reloads a reload for every verse on the song and um yeah i'll never i'll never forget that i'll never forget that summer i mean victoria park i remember seeing you know that that track that's like the biggest park in London that track getting like reloads in that park it's incredible was that kind of a moment where you were like right this is kind of what I want to pursue was that like a big moment for you getting into Grime or me personally I haven't still haven't got that thing where I want to dedicate my life to music yet I'm just I'm just really passionate about this and I think if no one else did it like how we did then it might not have got to this point yeah But other people, especially with producers, they can say, oh, I want to dedicate the rest of my life to Graham or to music or, you know, to production or engineering or something like that. But I haven't had that spark yet. I've just been really passionate about the music. And it's kind of just been every year for the last nearly 10, which is mad. Yeah, more or less. I'm on the same vibe as Elijah. Okay, raving-wise, I started a bit late. I didn't go to too many raves. To the odd ones, like the young man stand-ins and all that. but not too often because I was still young at the time and then same thing Lethal Bizzle Pow seeing that go not even in like a grime situation in a normal like liquid kind of club where it's not 100% grime so in a normal dance with a thing I mean hip hop power still going off and getting reloads? Liquid's not even like 1% growing. Obviously because we were having a chat when I saw you hidden the other day about... about raves and you sort of showed a bit of a dissatisfaction with them which I think a lot of people share right now and you guys recently did like a Big Butters label night at Cable I mean how do you see sort of grime raves and grime in a club situation right now? I think generally in London right now you know just generally with uk based and all that kind of stuff dubstep grime and house and funky and stuff a lot of people been coming out just to hear tunes and that's such a different spirit to coming out and having a party and party we did a cable I wanted to make sure it was a good balance between hearing new music, you know, being excited by, you know, brand new Terror Danger or Royalty or DWE. balancing it between you know actually having a good time and making sure that it's not a night to remember do you know what I mean over just coming out and hearing new songs because I was I feel like over the last two years I've been going to nights and I've been hearing some like amazing music but it hasn't been the setting that I'm going to remember like a lot of parties I've gone to so many parties with bad music and remember those parties for the rest of my life and I will I'll never forget them but hopefully one thing that we can do with you know profiles DJs now is kind of readjust that balance that was happening you know, for us as ravers, not even us as a scene. I mean, sort of playing devil's advocate, but do you think that's a little bit at odds with the sort of instrumental pushing mentality that Butters has always had? Yeah, yeah, I do actually. And I just think it's a challenge because no one's done this before. So, you know, when we work with like Swindle or Royalty, I don't want it to sway them so much that they're always thinking about the party but I definitely like to have that as an element to you know what we do when you come to a butters night you might lose your shoes or whatever that's cool to me that's not something that we should be running away from like I know people get scared of, you know, dubstep and, you know, wobbles and guys with their shirts off and stuff. I'm scared of that too, but. But equally you want to have fun. But you still want to have fun and there's a good balance between, for me, you know, just standing in a rave and hearing like someone just play good tunes and, you know, having a good time, you know, really having it. How's it been working? Because I think I'm right in saying that with some of your sets recently, you've had trim on them. And sort of historically as a label, you've been a label that's pushed instrumental grime in a period where a lot of people weren't doing that. So I was wondering, is that... how has that affected your sets in any way? Like, how have you readjusted to working with MCs? I'd say, like with anything, it's good to have a balance and a few different options of the way we can play. Otherwise, you know, if you're going to hear the average kind of guy, you know, Jam City, Jam City can only play Jam City or the way he plays and he can only play that way. But when we do Elijah and Skillium, we can be Elijah and Skillian, we can do Elijah and Skillian with Trim and we can do Elijah and Skillian with P-Money and it'd sound totally different to what people are used to hearing. And that kind of thing as a DJ and just as a listener was exciting to me. So part of it's like having to adapt your sound and sort of shape what you do for specific. collaborators yeah and i think a lot of people listening to us now uh are not used to hearing sets like that so you know someone that listens to you know house and techno and then they're hearing trim on on these kind of beats they'll be like what this is mad but i think because the way we've balanced it over the last two years you can get into it because it's not every week and you know it's not he doesn't he understands what we're trying to do as well so like we don't do that often we've we don't we've only done with trim and p money so we're not going to hear us with a million and one yeah it's just good good balance. I mean, do you think that's maybe something that's missing a little bit now from radio? Because I remember for me, like when I think my favorite period of pirate radio was sort of, I guess around 2005 where dubstep was getting big, but grime was still the main thing and used to get really interesting combinations like code nine and Wiley, like J five and Skepta, plastician and Skepta. And I always thought those combinations brought out like the best in both sides. You know what, I think the MCs from that period have sort of moved on. They're not sort of on the radio no more. You're sort of getting a new wave of MCs and they still do go on radio shows, such as you've got other Instagram Graham DJs. They do still sort of go on their sets. I mean, maybe it's just me. It doesn't seem as prevalent as it was. Maybe I'm listening to the wrong shows. I don't know. Yeah, I think that the artists it's more people are sort of learning what they're about rather than okay I grew up listening to YDW I don't know it's different for me because I've grown up listening to YDW whereas the next generation of kids are growing up listening to Cozy all of those kind of things so it's I can't sort of say how they're hearing it because they're fully hearing it differently to how like I was saying to Royalty which is one of our producers on the labels so you're you're hearing it you're hearing Graham so much different to we're thinking okay oh, why are these on this? How old is Rorty? Yeah, he just turned 21. And he's sort of learning about the D doubles and stuff, whereas he's grown up listening to Cossies and stuff. So he's kind of learning about it retrospectively? Yeah. That's what I think anyway. Yeah, I definitely agree that, you know, the younger people that work with us or that listen to us, they haven't. consciously grown up with MCs on the radio like that. So it is a novelty to them, whereas for us, it was just normal. We would expect Wiley to be on the radio 9 to 11 on a Sunday, and if he wasn't, then we think... like there's a problem yeah or you'd expect you know the top tier talent to always be visible but now the top tier talent you know are in the charts or you know they're doing other things hip-hop or the new talent that's coming through it's a balance between you know Graham not being as prominent as it was you know five years ago and then artists that are coming through, you know, young guys. So maybe in two years time, we'll be looking back and saying, all right, these guys were on Rince two years ago, but people weren't really clocking on to them. And now, you know, like how P Money's come through. He was on Rince three, four years ago, but no one was really kind of watching. Outro Music Presumably you've got more Butters Raves planned in the future. I mean, is that something you're going to make a regular thing? Yeah, the Butters Raves, they're difficult for venues to understand because we're balancing the kind of DJ element that House and Techno. used to so those kind of promoters they're just used to setting up two decks but when we say to them you know we want mics for you know for artists and we want you know a stage people look at us like we're crazy because they're not used to getting I know that sounds that sounds a bit kind of weird when we did cable they didn't expect us to even have mics. - Never felt like it shocked me how hard it is to get a mic at a venue sometimes. - Just trying to get people to understand what we do and not associate it with what we did, what was happening in Graham. six, seven years ago. So when we say we're bringing down an MC, they expect 40 MCs on the stage, but that's not, nothing like that has happened, you know, events we do. But I think that's an interesting part of Buzz because I kind of, I mean, if you look at Grimes kind of lineage in a very simplified way, you know, you kind of had that golden era and then there was like a, a kind of a trough, so to speak. And then it feels like and a second generation almost like it's still grime but it's grime mark two if you want to look at it that way so I mean with the Butters and Raves like would you want that one day to represent this kind of second era of grime in the way that something like Sidewinder is like associated with the first one yeah that's what's difficult about you know the label and the name Butters it's like We've been having a debate amongst us all that do we use it to push the label? Do we use it to push the scene? Do you know what I mean? It's such a weird thing. People ask me about similar labels to us. Which there aren't that many of, really. No, there's nothing really like it. But even if you just said like... another London label would be like Nat Slugs when they do their raves they put themselves on it and you know not really any guests anymore but where they're used to yeah it's become more focused on a label showcase before it is a rave that's right and I just wanna we've been trying to achieve a balance between having a label showcase and you know bringing in people from the scene actually doing it but then what happens is the people that you like you end up working with anyway so you know with trim and p money they were my favorite mcs in the last two years and then we ended up working with them so now everything looks like a butters label showcase so um you know the events next year maybe we'll bring in some people that we haven't worked with on the label that are just kind of just doing it in the Gram scene. Do you feel any pressure running a label where there's not that many other labels doing a similar thing? Does it make it easier or harder do you think? It's definitely harder because When you've got a few labels doing the same thing, you've got more people saying how great it is. And I think the difficulty that we had in getting into venues or even getting into press is not enough people have been telling the people that made the decisions. what it is and how good it is. You know, with dubstep, you don't have a problem with that because you've always got someone saying how great the latest screen record is or how great the latest, you know, banger record is. But, and even down to the smaller profile artists, they will always get more kind of high profile coverage. There's almost more entry points if you've got more labels and artists doing a similar thing. Definitely. so and and because it's been label focused for so long you know you know the functions in place to promote those things are i mean it's so easy whereas when we there's like an infrastructure there yeah like we have that still no infrastructure we're like grabbing on to you know you lot over here in house and techno the dubstep world even like american hip-hop people were coming at me and you know, do you want this? And, you know, people from America are viewing it like a hip hop and people in Europe are viewing it like dubstep. You know what I mean? Historically, have you, I mean, have you found it quite hard to get press and get coverage? I try, I try and let people approach us. That's always been my thing that I can throw out in certain places. let everything come back to us. So even though it's taken us, you know, nearly two years to get to a point. I mean we have got good press over the last year or so but it's taken about two years to get to a point where people want to dig their claws into you but I think that's cool I think if you have your if you're everywhere from your 001 then what have you got to aim for for your 10 do you know what I mean and you see so many labels do that and they get big have like a big first five releases and then they kind of just fade away. Yeah, something we sort of briefly touched upon when we said that there's not many, if any labels like Buzz around is like, you've done quite a few things that have been, if not quite unprecedented, like they've been curve balls. And a big thing I thought that almost summed up the labels ethos was when you gave away the parts to air bubble. So it was your first single and also like a single from still probably the biggest producer that's worked, like worked for the label. So I guess just like tell us about the decision to do that. I think at the time it was early 2010 and Terry Danger, he's really kind of open to anything that we say. he's like a lot of people in grime are really close minded and that's fine when you're working on records sometimes because you need people to say no I don't want to do that but not just grime because a lot of labels wouldn't have done that yeah they're too protective yeah but um because it's one of them kind of things in one way we had nothing to lose and then another way I love remixes and a lot of grime records are my favourite records are remixes and at the time no grime producer would get in grand remixes of tracks and I thought that was just a no-brainer and at the time people were getting bassline dubstep and funky mixes of their tunes that I could buy a record you know the last batch of records that came out In 2010, 2009, even 2008, you could buy a vocal with bassline mix, funky mix, and dubstep mix. And even with the grime artist pop records and stuff, they were having bassline mix, dubstep mix, funky mix without grime mix. even Funky like everyone forgets in all the early Funky records you had like a bassline mix on the other side for loads of them yeah did you discover I mean were there producers you discovered through that that you then sort of linked up with and went on to play their music a whole bunch of people man like we had like over 200 remixes of it so I'm never gonna like remember the amount of people that like a lot of people that's the first time I saw their name in my inbox and even if I didn't play it we played something from them you know over the last year or so so I mean something it always reminded me of I don't know if it's if I'm barking up the wrong tree or if it was a subconscious thing or not there at all but it kind of reminded me of something that I always thought after you know I guess say from like 2006 maybe was missing from grime was when you had like a tune like ice wrinkle ever and you'd get like eight nine ten different vocals and that like kept a tune really fresh and it made it really interesting and it kind of like examined the tune from different angles you'd see like different takes on it i mean was that was there an element of that in the air bubble thing now you're saying it is Yeah, it's like sometimes when you do things just, you know, to promote yourself, it seems a year later, it seems overly calculated if it goes well. You know, we could have done that. I got four remixes. I played them for a year and, you know, never been spoken of again. And because it wasn't that calculated, I didn't expect to get, you know, over 200 remixes. So I can't really say, you know, I didn't think about it for weeks. It was let's give it a try and you know and we've done that we've done kind of something different with every release you know making videos and doing a whole bunch of different tricks. We gave away the acapellas for trims release, which has been another kind of success because people don't really get to play with acapellas. No one releases them. Well, historically, there's barely been any grime acapellas. Yeah, I think there's four. There's Stand Up Tool from Dizzy Rascal. Sing Along. Yeah, Crazy Titch, Sing Along. There's a couple more. there's Wiley from My Mistakes from Big Dada and there's Skepta Bad Boy so there's not there's not a lot but I always wish there was more yeah that's one thing that's always wound me up so much and if you asked for them you know they wouldn't have them now so I think you know where we were communicating with Trim if we asked him two months later for the acapellas we wouldn't have been able to get them but at the time I was like That was imperative that we had it. So speaking of Terror Danger, I mean, obviously, well, as we sort of established this, Legendary and Crime Circles are the biggest producer that's worked on your label. But it seems like you really came along at a good time for him because he wasn't doing that much until the Butters released. Yeah, we kind of caught him at a crossroads. We were at a crossroads as well. We met him in 2009. early 2009 and he was like our first guest on rinse and we didn't i didn't really think about how well connected he was because he's been doing the music for so long yeah and you know he was a lot of people tend to you know you have to get to know them first before they send you their tracks and he was like when he met us he was like yeah i'm gonna load you up i was like wow i mean and he had been you know he'd done a label before aftershock you know he'd done 20 releases and worked with so many different artists recorded them done literally everything you know song wrote and caught him just before he did you know the album with Planet Moo and then he did that Code 9 was like I would have done that and then it kind of just snowballed from there and until now it's kind of if we kind of waited you know two three weeks later it might not happen that way So yeah, with the CD, when did Rince approach you to ask you to do it? Yeah, I think we got a phone call in about April. I was on the train. Guess what? What? Guess? Yeah, Rince wants to do a CD. So that's good news, isn't it? What were your initial thoughts on it? Like how to approach it? Like it was more about the current tunes and the forthcoming tunes that we sort of, that's what it was at first. And then it was, it turned into, okay, tunes that we've sort of. developed that tunes have a meaning to us basically yeah throughout throughout the year i mean on like rins and stuff so because i always think it must be really hard if you're djing regularly doing like a weekly show sometimes more than weekly and then you have to do a cd because it's like how do you make it stand out from the show how do you make the cd more of an occasion i don't i don't think you have to i think my thing was it was just a snapshot of what we were doing in the last year And I think if I had a snapshot of what Slimzy was doing in 2003 or what 10 was doing in 2000, I would value them much higher. And I wish that I did have people. even before that you know people that I was listening to on the radio and I didn't really know about them you know like EZ and Heartless Crew if I had a CD from Heartless Crew from 1998 do you know what I mean just a document yeah as a document you know I put next to Miles Davis and next to like Bob Marley because those people are up there for me in terms of do you know what I mean they're my musical kind of heroes do you know what I mean so I'm not saying like I'm Bob Marley or something but I'm saying like it's just nice to have like something from like a DJ that you like from an era when you like them because you might not like them forever because I think I'm right am I right in saying that all the tracks are from the last year Yeah, so I think the oldest track on there is, well, the only one is, yeah, it's Getto Kairi. So yeah, how it sits together is pretty much how we would play to a packed rave in London. You know, towards the end is maybe something, the way we'd finish off on Rinse at 2.30 in the morning when we're finishing off. There's about four tracks in there that I feel like I wasn't personally involved in. Because that's something that also strikes me about Butters. I'm always surprised by how some labels don't do this. One of the things you always kind of emphasise is that when you hear a Butters record, there's going to have been however many different versions of that tune and there's been a long back and forth process behind it. I mean has that been a natural thing for you or has that always been the case that you've been there like you've set out from the start that like you want to have this kind of almost A&R role in it there's so much ground that's been already been covered and you know if you make a straight up eight bar banger that's sick right now that would be sick because no one is doing that but a lot of the tunes that we get sent are things that we're already doing so if you send it to me and we've already done it then we've done it six months ago so it's really important when you know we're looking to put out a record there has to be different for everything now different from everything that's going to be like when it comes out in six months and if it takes us going back and for three months then it's worth it because you know it's this weird thing it's like you don't make money by putting out tracks so you can't you can't kind of waste the opportunity like if you're if you're going to put something on a vinyl right now it has to be like the best thing ever so it's like i can't afford to go and put you can't afford to give it 80% yeah yeah so it's this weird thing like if we were if we could sell 10,000 of an 8 bar loop by now I'm not saying that we would do it but you'd be more inclined to do it because you could because you can only sell 300 of this whatever regardless of how much how hard you go into it it's probably going to sell between 3 and 500 yeah So you might as well just go all out. And, you know, when they put the needle on and they notice, oh, that sound doesn't even appear again in the rest of the thing. Or when they get to the end, it goes... You know what I mean? Just... Yeah, like the VIP records that we did. just told them just forget the rule book and kind of just yeah literally I think that applies more and more I think it applies more the more like the less records you sell the more you should sort of reward the people that are buying them because at least they're sticking with you yeah So obviously, sales are not necessarily a reflection of quality. Everyone knows that these days. So yeah, the people that do want to go out there and especially, I don't know, I've always got this love for someone buying a record right now. Not because not a lot sell, it's because the whole plight of, you know, like you go to clubs, the decks are effed. You go to record shops, the records are like expensive or the record shop's not even there. There's just so much effort. The whole record shop culture is different. Because they don't exist no more, it's like everyone's buying them online. Before, you might go into a record shop and you might take a record that you don't even like. Yeah. But you still kind of thing now online it's like you know what I don't like that tune so I'm not going to buy it also it's like everyone hears I don't know the way it's gone like you hear tunes six months before they come out and sometimes you've already made your mind up on them yeah there's like a lack of instinct to it I think now I've seen that happen a lot in dubstep sort of thing yeah it might be for like a year you might hear a tune a year ago but when it does come out that year later you still want to go and get it and I think that if we can do something like that so that has happened it's all that yeah even like tunes for us like you know we did a record last year or this year Swindle Mood Swings like we got that in July 2010 and we kind of just built it up from there then we released a kind of fresher version a couple months later and we still play it now and it's on the CD and I don't I didn't want things to have a sell by date like even another record that we did by TRC called Skipping Rope it became the vocal for Trims I Am I just think that kind of is cool just to kind of reference back and forth. Does that sort of, because something you touched on with the record store thing, and I'd count us both in this. I mean, you guys are... like a couple of years younger than me but we're part of that generation we're like we're they basically the last generation when we started djing it was on turntables we can remember like rhythm division and shops like that and independence and even that was only like two three years ago how does that make you feel in a way because it always kind of weirds me out a bit to think that we're kind of the end point of this yeah it's like i think we can carry on the culture in a different way like skilliam says people are buying the records online and i build up a relationship with the people that actually buying our records so you know if it was in rhythm division i wouldn't even know who bought it But, you know, when I sell to a guy that's in London and I can tell him, you know, next week, you know, right forward, roll down. And, you know, we might not even have a conversation in a rave, but having that kind of personal kind of thing has been like a strength for us, like in the last year or so. You're part of a minority right now. that sells records direct but there seems to be more and more labels doing it yeah like definitely when we started I thought that was important not because of the monetary sense, because of just having that personal vibe with people. I remember going into record shops and having that with someone. And, you know, when you go to, you know, a record shop online, it's cold. And that's not how, you know, music is supposed to be. And like we touched upon on the raves before, you know, we were going to raves and standing there in silence. listening to tunes and that's that's it felt it just feels cold to me i mean that's not what music for me is about i mean it's about like having fun meet up with other people and even like me and skilliam it's like people think it's a weird thing having a dj duo how do you spread money and things like that and I think it's the most natural thing mixing with your friend in a room and that's totally natural having you know your mates around with a couple beers making funny sounds on a computer that's that totally normal rather than someone isolated you know in a room making beats by themselves sending it to someone in London to play on Rinse at one in the morning. That sounds strange to me. So what have you guys got coming up on the label? Yeah, no, it's fun. It's funny. It's fine. Yeah, coming up on the label, we've got a collaboration record between Swindle and Silky, which is kind of cool. They kind of rooted in a similar influences. Very musical. Yeah, and jazzy, funk, that kind of style. So we thought it'd be good to have a collaboration. A lot of people, yeah, they didn't know each other before music or anything. So it was cool to get them together to do that. And then like in the long term, because I mean, as we've said a few times, like you are a label that sort of, you come up with things people wouldn't necessarily expect, things that maybe haven't been done before, haven't been done for a while. I mean, what surprises are there in store for the future? Maybe not necessarily surprises, but things I'd like to do, you know, is like, you know, maybe work American. person you know like someone from a hip-hop scene or someone from a dancehall scene that would that would be kind of cool and haven't heard like a proper high profile dancehall gram song that can happen like it's just i didn't think a p money record could happen last year so maybe next year i'll pursue that a bit more so there's not much in a gram scene happening that's different so it's all like eight bars and uninteresting stuff. So when you do, even if you do this, do something little, that's a little bit different. It seems like a big thing. It goes a long way. It does. So it's like, yeah, don't, don't put a, don't try and put a stop to something and say, okay, I'm going to do this and then that's it. Possibilities are endless. you
