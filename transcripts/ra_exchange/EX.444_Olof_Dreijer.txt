Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the Tech Editor at Resident Advisor. At last year's Unsound Festival in Krakow, the final item of the conference program was a live RA exchange with Olaf Dreyer, the artist best known for his work with Karen Dreyer as The Knife and his techno records as Oni Aeon. Celebrated as his music may be, Dreyer himself is fairly mysterious. But for someone so modest and soft-spoken, he is a man of remarkably strong principles, especially when it comes to matters of gender and privilege. These topics not only inform the lyrics of The Knife, but also guide Adria's own path as an artist and an individual, which partly explains why he's kept such a low profile over the years. Speaking with RA's Will Lynch in a full auditorium, Dreyer allowed us a glimpse of his fascinating worldview. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at RA-Exchange. The Exchange with Olaf Dreyer is up next. you I'm Will Lynch from Resident Advisor and I'm sitting here with Olaf Dreyer. I guess start, join me in welcoming Olaf. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for coming. So, it's been about five years or so since the last album from The Knife and the tours that followed. And for most of us, you've been kind of out of view since then. Can you tell us what you're working on right now? Yes. So, yeah, I've been basically producing other artists. I've been doing that more and more over the last years. I don't know how many. and I really enjoy that. It's more fun to not be alone in the studio, and there are a lot of amazing artists who need... I'm feeling like I'm needed somewhere. And I've had the pleasure to get to know one artist from Tunisia called Huayda Hedfi. She's making beautiful instrumental music, really melodic, and I think music that will work really well in films. And we've been working together since, I think, many years, like six, seven years. And I'm producing her album. and I'm also playing in her band and we've been doing a short tour in Sweden and the US and it's like traditional Tunisian music with a lot of electronic sounds also and I learn so much, like I learn so much, like different rhythms and different ways to write melodies and yeah, it's cool. And then I work with a Swedish artist called Jala. She's a pop singer, but really like really out there and fun and creative and I'm working on her or producing her album. She's a great singer and she's really fun to work with. And then I'm also working with another Swedish artist called Bahare. She's making, or she asked me to help her do a modern take on Persian disco. And that's like a challenge, but I'm trying to. fulfill her wishes and it's really fun and But so those are like the main three projects I work with, I think. And then I do some other things. But my main actually thing that I'm doing is I'm going to school. I'm like studying full time to become like a youth. So yeah, we just talked about this. I just looked up the accurate word. it's like youth recreation leader but it sounds so formal basically it's to work in a youth club with teenagers like to 20 up to 20 and it's basically where they hang out after school and so that's my plan to work there and also in the studio yeah I want to get back to the studio in a second, but first, can you tell us a bit about being a youth recreation leader? What kind of work do you do with these kids, and how did you get into that, or what do you find rewarding about that kind of work? I've been working with different projects around making the life for migrants in Berlin because I've been living in Berlin most of the time. Yeah, to make the life for newly arrived migrants in Berlin to create like a fun or meaningful or somehow like... a life with music in my case. I started this music school for undocumented migrants in Berlin together with a guy called Koko who ran the Oranienplatz movement in Berlin. That was around 2013 or 14 or something. And we had like an open rehearsal activity where people from that camp could go rehearse a couple of times a week. And we provided lessons in the instruments they wanted to learn. with the goal of creating a band that would communicate their demands, basically. That's still running. It's like they go once or twice a week, and it's usually a group of five to ten people coming back, and then there is usually five to ten, or usually around five people, new people every time. So it's like a... It's quite an open type of activity. So I've been working with that and in different anti-racist groups and stuff in Berlin. And with that experience, I've been feeling like I want to work in an institution. So like something that has a bit more... structure and something that is possible to work with for a longer time usually in this work with well I guess all activist projects there is always a risk to get burnt out and so I just wanted to have something with a bit more longevity And therefore, I felt like I take this education to work with youth because it's like a group I care for. And yeah, something like that. Looking back at the history of the knife, it seems, as a listener anyway, there was kind of a slow metamorphosis. where by the end it felt fairly overtly political, whereas early on it was in a more kind of oblique or suggestive way. First of all, is that accurate? Is that the way it felt to you? Yeah. Yes. No, sure. It's true. It's much more apparent. Because although I was playing all kinds of music that was not pop music before we started, and then I was so fed up. For example, I was playing free jazz, and I was so disgusted by the male dominance in that scene. and so I felt like, okay, I got to leave this and start making pop music, as if that would be better, but at the time it felt like it would be better. I think because I wasn't so active in any proper activist work, I think all the political content had to be pushed into the lyrics of the knife. like although I didn't write the lyrics my sister did but like I think so already then it was an idea to have this pop band with political lyrics in order to like reach the masses yeah but we were still misunderstood we were I mean, there was a lot of people whose ideas I would really not go, that I don't like, that liked our music and used our music. So that's why we had to become more clear, I think. What's an example of that? What do you mean people would use your music? There is horrible examples. There is a neo-Nazi group in Sweden who used one of our songs in an advertisement for their work. It was up on the internet for a couple of days and then... I saw on their own forum that there was some member of that party writing, oh, how can you use that song? They're gay, they're socialist, you've got to put it down immediately. And so they actually... And then we filed... somebody managed to contact YouTube, like, to reach YouTube and get it down. But, I mean, so that felt horrible. Like, how can we be so misunderstood? And then we just, yeah, I thought we have to be more clear. As you were kind of channeling your politics into the knife, were you generally mixing your own political views with your art in that way? Did you find the music to be a satisfying sort of channel for those ideas? Or, you know, did it feel like it was... working in a way you were satisfied with? No, like I've never been satisfied. Like I always, I've always had this feeling that it's not meaningful enough. So I think that's also why I'm going towards, yeah, I've had that feeling like for as long as I've been working with the music that it's fun and but it's not like meaningful enough so that's why I think I want to have a bit of both like live in both the more social work life and music life and just have the music because it's fun yeah I feel like it's kind of a perennial question or a timeless question of how music and politics can mix And it's interesting to me that you've arrived at a place where they're quite separate. You're here at Unsound as a DJ. And I read an interview, you said something that you liked about DJing was it's fairly well paid and you could dedicate that to your project with refugees. Would you say you've arrived at a place where you feel that that's kind of the most optimal way for you to mix your political views with your art is simply for one to fund the other instead of mixing them as you did with the knife? Yes. I mean it's also really fun to DJ I mean it's a great it's not just for I mean I can be creative with that and I started making my own edits of songs and making it more personal. I'm also having a lot of fun with it. So it's not only that I'm sacrificing my time and giving the money to an organization. So it's the best combination of both worlds. The creative work you've done in the past, has always had a certain element of depth to it. To take the knife again, not just the political element, but the aesthetic dimension was very elaborate. There was a strong visual side and these really unconventional performances. I guess on the creative side, do you miss that at the moment, just as a DJ? Would you hope to do that kind of work again? Oh, you mean the whole presentation of things? Sure. By the way, do we speak in a good tempo? I just thought I drank a lot of coffee and I feel like I'm talking quite fast. Is it faster, slower? Okay, it's good. Faster. Yes or no, sir? So the presentation of things like... No, I don't miss it. We've done that. And it's been so much fun and I learned a lot, but I keep on, I want to learn new things and I don't miss that. No, no. I just think, do I miss it? Do I miss it? No, I don't miss it. You've often had this kind of supporting role as an artist. As you said, you like producing other people's records. And if I'm not mistaken, your only solo work was Oni Ehun, is that right? So just a handful of techno records. Why do you think that is? For someone with so much to offer creatively, what is it about that role that you prefer to being in the spotlight, being the front man? There is plenty of reasons, but I think it's a combination of a structural political one and just a selfish one. I think the structural political one would be that I would say that my political strategy in relationship to my privileges As a white man, I use withdrawal as a strategy. I don't think at the moment that it makes sense for me to take much more space than I have. And the selfish one would be that I just like collaborating and I think it's I don't want to be alone in the studio it's I learn a lot from the collaborations I also like problem solving so when I get an artist who wants their music to sound like something they have this idea and it's a fun challenge to do that, it's a clear task. I think the way I look at how to deal with privileges is usually that you can use them in a way where you just collaborate with people and use your privileged position to... to find the means to realize a project and then just use that and spread the resources basically with others. And is that what you're doing now? projects you're currently working on, would you say? I mean, yes, for sure, although I think the way it has started has just been very natural and dynamic. It started like any collaboration. We enjoyed working together. But I think, yeah, I'm totally... using all the resources I have, all my contacts and my time and yeah, to just pull out all the possible things you can pull out of my network. Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking about the band. I'm not exactly sure how to pronounce the name of the piece. Hiawal'alem. It's Hiawal'alem. That's the band name, and the composer's name is Hawaii Dahedfi. When you were just explaining the structural... political aspect of these collaborations. I mean, the band has been written up in The Guardian and things like that. And you're kind of the headline or you're sort of the reason they get that spotlight. Is that something you consciously think about? Yeah, I mean, of course, ideally, I would like my name to not be there. But I mean, this is how people start writing about her. And I think because she does, she makes so amazing music, I think people will forget about me being there and just focus on the music. I have seen that happening. So I think it... I think it works. Those two sides you mentioned, this sort of selfish, creative side and the politically minded side, are they ever in conflict? Or do you ever sort of have an idea for, I don't know, a solo record or something, but you don't feel comfortable doing it? is that political side kind of just an innate quality? I mean, that's difficult to say. I mean, because I've been in this... I mean, maybe I should just go back a few... Like, now it sounds so... Maybe I sound very, like, self-assured and clear about what I'm doing now, but, of course, there has been a process behind that. Like... 10 years ago I was in gender studies and studied like yeah post-colonial theory and gender, everything like that. And during those years I was going through a process of shame for men's violence towards women and everybody and colonial history and all of that. But a position of shame is not constructive. I mean, it's like it's not leading anywhere. It's not doing any good. So I think the last 10 years has been about finding a... a constructive approach to using those the acknowledgement of those privileges and just stand for acknowledge and stand for your privileges and not just feeling sorry for yourself. We're not just feeling guilty, I guess. Yeah, exactly. I mean, guilt, white guilt is like, it's not doing any good. Like it has to be channeled into something constructive. And yeah, so that's maybe good to mention that that's like behind the strategies I'm having at the moment. Your question, if there is a conflict between the selfish and the political. So I think no, and it's difficult to know, because I think I'm so... It's possible to think that... that I'm so programmed by many years of thinking around these things that a conflict don't arise. But I don't have a conflict at the moment. I go to school 9 to 4 every day and I go by the studio like every other day maybe and if I don't have time to work on the project I play the flute for 30 minutes and it's good, it's great. It's like I get the... the stim... what do you like? The stimuli or the stim... - Stimulation. - Stimulation from music, like... it's amazing and it's... at the moment I could imagine just doing this and just playing the piano or... playing the flute at home as a hobby but we'll see it'll probably change you mentioned that the point you're at now is sort of an advanced stage in this personal journey I mean the first album from the Knife came out in 2001 or something so basically you've been You've been a musician for nearly 20 years, I guess you could say. Yeah. That sounds a lot. Yeah, sure. Let's say 18. Okay, 18 years. I guess I'm curious, when you said you went through this period of feeling a lot of shame, are these just ideas that you were aware of and kind of thinking about in general over that period of time? Or was there a reason that these topics became urgent to you? Or, you know, why do you think more than the average man, I would say, why do you think all of those realities weighed on you in the way that they did? I think I just grew up in that. context like in high school as a teenager I have two sisters and I grew up reading the texts they read like feminist texts at that time so I mean I and that's been just my group of friends I think I'm just a product of my context like in that sense yeah I was also curious, you mentioned a few times that you're studying full-time now, and with the end goal of kind of doing the best you can in this role as the... recreation leader, recreation leader. You went through a similar process before, which you touched on, but it was a ways into the existence of the knife and your career as a musician that you took this course in gender theory and post-colonial theory, I guess. Could you explain kind of the, what led to that decision or what made you think, I need to take this class, I need to become well-versed in this subject? I guess another point that I'd throw out there is that... if I'm not mistaken, when you took the gender studies course, the knife already had a reputation of exploring gender ideas in its music. So you were kind of already a respected commentator, might not be the right word, but you were already kind of... exploring these topics publicly for others and then you decided to sort of study them yourself. Was that just a feeling of, you felt you needed to really know what you were talking about if this was going to be part of your art? Oh yeah, okay. It was less in relationship to the knife. I think I was just interested, basically. At the time, we were playing with gender and how to represent gender on stage. I was starting with my solo project at the time. And I think I just wanted to learn more and also much more about the whole term intersectionality when you look at all categories of power, how they intersect and just learn about, just go deeper into all of this. Basically, I don't see any other. It's basically just straight up personal enrichment. You just wanted to know this for yourself. Yeah, I guess I was like, as I'm thinking now, also like if I'm going to work with this, I need to know what I'm doing. I think it's something like that. Yeah. How does that kind of self-education change your behavior? Or for instance, how did that course, did that... changed the way you know that changed the art that you made or change your day to day judgment yeah I think so like I mean until 2008 or seven or so for example when we toured with a knife we had all male crew but after that we we hired all female crew and so we we completely applied our theories in into practice much more and like started to think much i mean i don't yeah i don't think yeah we didn't even think about representation in our technical crew for example or in the people we hire we had worked with a lot of men like up until then so I think up until yeah around that time around 2006 it doesn't matter but up until then we had We've been writing about gender, feminism, international solidarity. It was very vague. We've been writing and talking about that in our music, but it hadn't been applied into practice. Thinking about who you hire, how you hire, working conditions. all these things so it was much more like yeah applied basically even setting aside the political aspect a constant, I guess, in your career and with the Knife as well, was it seems like in almost any opportunity you would break from the norm and do something that suited your needs uniquely. You know, all-female crew on the tour being one example, also just the nature. of that tour. It's obviously not a conventional performance. Even going back to doing interviews with wearing a bird mask and having your voice scrambled, it seems like at any opportunity you would kind of do something slightly unconventional, sort of unusual. Why do you think, what set you on that trajectory or how did you create that? of always doing things slightly differently and also why is kind of the established way of handling those situations so uninteresting to you? I mean, first of all, we did that because we could. Like, we were in a position where we have been and we are in a position where we can. We can play with these things. I think when it comes to, for example, the masks, I didn't like so much the focus on the private person instead of the music at the time. And we were also working with... characters in our music different characters who we imagined sang our songs and the lyrics were based out of these characters and then we thought okay it doesn't make sense that we are there as private persons representing these characters it should be one of these characters and maybe that character could have this mask so that's also like the creative background to that and then we also kind of acknowledge that it's a way to commodify music to represent it with your person and we wanted to kind of play with that and so yeah a lot of I mean so there is always like political behind these things, yeah. I guess to talk about the performances themselves, it was something like the Shaking the Habitual tour. Can you sort of, as much as you're comfortable doing or interested in doing, like, walk us through kind of... the concept of what's going on there. You know, a stage filled with people dancing around. It's not clear if anyone's playing the instruments. It's not clear who the band are. How would you sort of explain that idea? Again, I have to think a bit. It was a while ago and I haven't been into this mindset at all. Last couple of years, but there is so many aspects you could talk about, but I guess I talk about now what I find still interesting. And it was a really collective process. We were 11 people on stage, including me and Karen. And the others were Shannon Funches, Light Asylum, and then the rest were professional dancers. And then we had two artistic directors. And all of us together made this show together. We gathered and everyone brought their favorite YouTube clip of different dances they liked. And then we learned those dances. And that was just a way to bring everybody into the creative process. So we had everything from Swedish folk dance to bangra to... Janet Jackson, Rhythm Nation to Italian cheesy disco 80s stuff. So it was a mix of things. And I guess the background to why we did that was not only to have a fun collaborative process, but was also to think a bit about what it means to, of course, to perform electronic music on stage. It has been done in all kinds of ways. And, okay, how are we going to do it? we're not good at playing instruments. I mean, Karen is good at playing the guitar, but everything else we kind of fake. We play it and then make it sound okay in the computer. And we love dancing. I guess electronic music performance is really about, okay, we think that a physical representation of the music should be there in some way. And then... We thought it was fun to dance, but then we learned that half of our audience loved seeing the dance and half of our audience hated it, and they wanted to have somebody playing instruments. which I now, in retrospect, can think, okay, why did we have to be so rebellious? Because it's also nice to be a bit just relaxed and cool about things. So I don't know where I'm at about these things. But I still like dancing. And then also, of course, because we are socialists and we are anti-hierarchical, and then we, of course, like, okay, how do you represent that on stage? So then it was important that all of us has equal showtime, so to say, on stage. Like, everybody danced, everybody sang, and everybody played instruments, and yeah. And that is fun and made sense, but now in retrospect I can think, okay, it is actually kind of amazing to watch an amazing musician play their instrument really well. I still, it's amazing with, what do you say, basically skilled musicians. Now when I work with this Tunisian band, I mean, they're... They are amazing at their... And it's like... It was an attempt to do something, you know. But, yeah, I don't know. And then, of course, we thought we were generous and, like, really fun and gave everything, you know. Like, we learned all these dances and we rehearsed for, like, one and a half year. And some people loved that, but some people didn't want that, so they were unhappy. But I think the thing is, we started off really kind of a bit too mystical and cryptical. Like we were, it was a bit dark, the show was a bit dark. And we didn't play anything, I think. But then we changed the show and it got much better. And then we played actually a lot of instruments in the beginning of the show and then danced. So it got better. Yeah. I know... I remember hearing that when you were making music for that album, you and Karen didn't necessarily know that you were making music for an album. You were just kind of making music together. And then eventually decided to make it the next album from the Knife. Do you still make music with Karen? Is that a relationship you still have? No, we're not making music. But we don't have any plans, but yeah, we hang out. What's your relationship like with club music? Since, you know, you're DJing. Yeah, I mean, I try to go out as soon as I can, or like when there is something happening, I'm there. But it's not happening so often in Stockholm. I moved to Stockholm recently from Berlin. I've been living in Berlin for 11 years. So it's a bit of a new life living there. But there are so many great things happening in club music. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I feel it's much more open to mix things. I feel like much more... DJs are mixing much more genres and yeah, I think it's really cool. There is a lot of fun things. And it seems like you're pretty content with your current situation, the occasional DJ gig and then doing your work as a youth recreation leader. Do you see yourself just... sort of carrying on like that indefinitely? Yeah, at the moment it's good. I'm also making music for a film and that's also something I try to actually find more and more work to do at home just to kind of for climate crisis like because it I mean every time I fly like it doesn't make sense I mean we need to we need to find a Skype club basically like DJ over Skype we need to like I mean seriously we need to do that now like and create ways to to make that fun and cool. I mean, it doesn't sound cool. We got to make it cool. And yeah. I'd like to open up to questions from the audience. Does anybody have anything they wanted to ask Olaf? Hey. Do you hear me? Yes. I wanted to ask you when you are talking about critics, when you heard critics regarding your performance on stage. I've seen your last show in Berlin, which was really amazing. How did you react when people were, you say, Alf liked it and Alf didn't like it? did you care about these negative critics or did you just were you were just like this is what we do and that's it you know and just were you affected by these critics as well yeah we were I mean when when people read the show as for example not generous and when I say generous I mean to give something of yourself and be cheeky and fun and not be cryptical and mystical, basically. Can't you be both? Maybe. Cheeky, fun, and cryptical and mystical? I think those were in one section and the generous was on the other side. So when people saw the show as basically not generous, we said, okay, we haven't really achieved what we wanted. So then we did change the show. So we did, for sure, change. We actually changed the show a bit all the time, but a big change, there was basically a first part and a second part. and the second part was adapted after the feedback. So for sure, we did take into account. But then the second round, when it was much more bright, we got new fancy, fun color lights and everything, then there were still people thinking that this is not what they want. And then they still... But most people were happy then. There were very few people. But the people who did say they didn't like it, they kind of wanted me to play the piano, or kind of to play the piano and me play the drums. And it was just unachievable goals. We can't do that. You can't please everyone as well. So I think that's, yeah. Something that I really noticed was like the evolution of like darkness to bright, like the colors was something, like the last show in Berlin was like... really, really colorful. Even the outfits, the lights, which change from the original aesthetic. Did you want me to comment on that? No, just like, I was wondering if that was part of receiving feedback, like if this evolution was because of hearing this feedback. Yeah, I think that was a mix of our our wishes to just kind of be more clear about our goal. But I would also say it was just a creative idea by the light technician. She got free reign to... to do what she wanted and she had this idea. We actually hired a new light tech for that and she was coming with all these ideas. So it was also a product of her amazing ideas really also. Hi, thanks a lot for all your, yeah, just everything you've said. It's really a lot of things to chew on. I'm wondering how do you find your new collaborations? It seems like they're all really diverse and yeah, if you're not on the road as much as maybe you used to be, I'm just curious, do you seek these people out in certain locations or is it just people that you're introduced to? They actually, they come to me. The first Hawaii work I was working as a kind of technician on this project that an NGO from a German NGO did in North Africa where they gathered female musicians that were in different ways politicized after the revolution and so there I just met two artists and they yeah we just worked since then but I've been thinking if I yeah I used to if I should start seeking out more people but I guess they'll come yeah I had a question. Thank you for sharing your very personal journeys. My friend and I, she's too shy to ask the question, but she wanted to know regarding your journey with guilt and shame, how did your education, your activism, And your processes of understanding and working through that guilt and shame impact your music, your producing, and also now your work with youth. Do you see some sort of commonality? How are you processing it? I know this is personal, and I'm sorry. It's okay. But if you feel comfortable answering it, I'd love to know more. I'm just thinking what is interesting to say. Everything? I try to apply a constructive approach with the acknowledgement of the privileges as a background. every day and that sounds really vague but I mean I have I mean in every project in every situation I think about my position based on my privileges and what can I do in this situation what Should I do anything? Should I step back? Should I share this responsibility with somebody who might have the experience that is needed to... to reach the goal that we want or something. So it's with me all the time. I don't know if that's an answer to your question. but no but I have been asking myself like why am I not excited to make my own music for example like and I'm with okay is it because I don't think that we need more white men on festivals or is it because I'm enjoying collaborating with artists more I don't know yes it's a mix of things So you touched on, there's this idea of... sort of the club space as it's almost a romanticized notion of it as um democratic and horizontal where everyone's there together and you can explore ideas of gender fluidity um and also but do you think that's still the case with the increasing sort of commercialization and also the sort of dating of this idea um and i guess you know music festivals and media such as RA also have a certain responsibility in creating that. But how do you feel it in terms of the space itself? as opposed to the music because I agree with you that I think the music is incredibly diverse and incredibly positive and there's a lot of things happening but I'm not so sure about the spaces in themselves so I was interested in hearing your point of view on that Are you thinking mostly about the power norms on stage or on the dance floor? On the dance floor, okay. Yeah, I mean, it's difficult to talk so maybe general, but I would almost have to go to like a specific club maybe. But I mean, I don't know what to say. I'm thinking that these power norms are everywhere that we have in society. They are everywhere. Do you want to be a bit more specific maybe? Yeah, I guess it's about your personal experience when you go out clubbing. Do you still feel that the clubbing space is what you would hope it would be? Oh, you mean like, no, no, not at all. Okay, go on. No, not at all. I mean... It's expensive. I mean, in Stockholm, if I go to a techno space, it would usually be white middle class or upper class going there. It's not the gay haven. In Stockholm, it's common that you have one big club with maybe three floors. And then there would be like a small room every once a month where there is a little queer club. And the people who arrange that have to then, you know, like meet the whole, all the dudes coming there and like elbowing everybody. like basically it's violent to be there like so and people in Stockholm don't know how you move in a bigger like in Berghain when you go there I feel like people know at least how to move in a bigger crowd like you don't get Elbowed? Do you say elbowed? Is that a word? So in Stockholm, I feel, when I go to this biggest club in Stockholm, basically, I get elbowed every 15 minutes. And it's like, then I'm a guy and medium tall or whatever, and then I'm thinking about everybody else. But, yeah, so, okay, I was thinking about this elbowing thing. But, yeah, so we have the money thing, of course, it's a gatekeeper. And then, now I talk about Stockholm because that's where I live. And then you have the, I mean, it's so segregated. But still I believe in the club, like I still totally believe in the club because that's why I love the club because I have the experience of meeting people from many different backgrounds.
