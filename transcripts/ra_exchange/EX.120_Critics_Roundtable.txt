Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artist labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Ryan Keeling and I'm the Associate Editor at Resident Advisor. This time on the Roundtable we're going to be discussing three topics. First up is UK techno. We'll be joined by DJ, producer and sometime promoter, Cope DiGiorgio. We're going to be talking about the concept behind him and Ben Simms' Machined series of parties where the focus is exclusively on new music. We'll then attempt to take a broader look at the UK scene at the moment. And then next, as the summer festival season is now drawn to a close, we'll talk about some of our favourite festivals and events we've attended this year and we're promising lots of positive in this section. And then finally we seem to be in the midst of a full-blown New York New Jersey garage house revival in London at the moment. We're going to be discussing some of the key proponents of the sound and ask whether or not all these retro vibes are a good thing for the scene. you So back this week with another edition of the Critics' Roundtable. I'm joined in London this evening, firstly by RA contributor Stephen Titmuss. Stephen, you're off to ADE this week, I understand. Is there anything you're looking forward to particularly about that? I am indeed. The creps and the days and days of fantastic dance. And I'm also joined this evening by Benji Lehman. Benji, you're off to ADE this weekend. I'm not, no, Ryan. I shall be enjoying some of the recent albums I've purchased from the comfort of my living room, namely albums by Vessel, Production Unit and Daphne. We're also joined in London this evening by Kirk DiGiorgio. Hi, good to be here. How are you doing, Kirk? I'm doing well, thanks. He's joining us this evening to talk about techno and techno in the United Kingdom. But we wanted to talk to you about your machine party this evening. So maybe you could just introduce the concept and such like. Machine was a club concept that myself and Ben Sims started about almost two years ago now. And the whole concept was to create a club environment that was introducing brand new techno. And there were all kinds of reasons for that without being too negative. You know, we thought there was it was about time Techno had a completely upfront image rather than becoming like a Las Vegas circuit for old timers to play old classic records. That's been done to death. And we thought, you know, we missed those days of going to clubs like, you know, Speed for Drum and Bass. uh co-op for for broken beat where you hear up and coming new music and recent kind of big tunes and that was the whole concept so we don't play anything older than a year and uh it's taken us all by storm not blowing my own trumpet but it really has kind of revitalized in my opinion the whole scene not just in London but we've taken it pretty much everywhere and it's it's it's refreshing that young people are so open and into going to a club and hearing very unfamiliar new music you said you didn't want to be too negative and we don't don't either but um can you talk a little bit more about the circumstances or like some of the experiences that perhaps led to the formation of the party yeah um it wasn't just myself um it was um a a few of us were all chatting about um how the scene had seemed to become you go to see a big name dj who were of course we're all big fans of these big djs But it seemed the nights were quite flat until you heard like something like Strings of Life or Good Life or, you know, even I Feel Loved on the Summer. And it was like... going out just to wait for these records so the crowd would respond and the rest of the night would generally just be filler and it was just awful you know absolutely awful and uh we were witnessing you know other music like minimal sort of coming in because at least it was um you know new music and stuff but to do that with techno we thought might be challenge but it was actually the opposite all the djs that we've asked have been really excited and taken it as a challenge to come and play two three hour sets of nothing but new music and rather than get a response of oh who do you guys think you are telling us what to play we've been really, really pleased with the, you know, reaction from DJs who want to come and play for us. And guys like Surgeon, you know, he actually checks on Discogs whether his tracks are exactly a year old or not. You know, obviously you can get really into that, but... It's so good that people are taking that seriously and it's been a bit of a revelation, really. Have you ever had to tell anybody off for playing? Yeah, but they've always come with the excuse that, oh, it's my own new re-edit. Ben Sims, who's my co-host, has got away with a few like that. But asking Rolando not to play his Jaguar, you can't. do that so uh he's been playing like his own secret edits of it and stuff it's been fantastic so you guys were you kind of got the sense that um the crowds that you were playing to were almost almost very used to the idea of hearing anthems yeah at this time that's what it that's what it was um not particularly when i played myself because i never never do that never played anthems I play old stuff, but they're never obvious anthems. It was more, you know, I like to go out. If I'm not working, I'll go out and see what other people are doing. And it was just from seeing other DJs and speaking to them afterwards and them almost apologizing for their sets and saying, oh, you know, the crowd want this and that's why I play. It's like, oh, come on, you know. This can't happen to something that has, rightly or wrongly, the aesthetic of techno should be about futuristic. I know that's a real cliche, but it should be. after two years of of machine and other other events clubs like berghain and trow have really pushed this whole concept of getting new producers to dj rather than the old timers coming to play classics it's it's a fantastic time in my opinion for techno because of that and um do you think this is almost dovetailed a wider sea change within within the techno scene yeah absolutely um i was thinking about it on the way down here and um the way i can describe techno is it's like a vampire It survives and keeps young by sucking the blood off other music scenes. It happened in the mid-90s with drum and bass. It got, you know, techno was in a real 140 BPM cul-de-sac. DJs who played musical techno couldn't get any work anywhere. But then along came drum and bass and a lot of soul and funk influence came back and techno had a resurgence. Now it's the whole bass scene and dubstep. A lot of those producers, you know, some of the ones we've got are untold and, you know. Great producers like that and DJs like Surgeon who've kind of introduced that whole bass music into techno. And once again, techno has found another music scene to draw blood from and reinvigorate the scene. And I think that's a really key point. What's your take on all this, Benji? I mean, have you been equally as excited as Kirk has by Techno over these last 12 months or so? Yes, very much so. Very much so. One of the things that's been most exciting for me has been the... re-emergence in the public eye, I guess, of the industrial scene, because of course it's always been there. It's never really stopped and it's always had a very strong, loyal audience. The one artist especially who I've been impressed with has been Shifted, who... has continued to really push quite a hard sound and a very danceable sound on the Avian label and I think is really flying the flag for a UK answer to what was happening in Berlin. And, you know, one of the things that most upset me about what came out of the UK during the noughties, I guess, was that I think a lot of producers got quite lazy and started to opt for quite a poppy approach. And it felt as though there really wasn't much for people who liked the darker. deeper, more serious strands of dance music coming out of the UK. And so it's really exciting to see that happening again. Equally very exciting to see a whole new generation of people getting into... the downwards back catalogue into British Murder Boys, into that whole Birmingham scene because of course it's so rich. It's not something that's just arrived overnight and it will lead those people back to not only techno but also to post-punk, early 80s English industrial music. Yeah, I think that was quite a nice analogy, Kirk, when you were mentioning the vampire and just sucking life out of other scenes and places. Someone I've been particularly impressed by has been Perk. Yep. Like the way that his path through the middle of the noughties and the kind of stuff that he was doing. It felt very much like his reference point were very much within his own scene. And he's taught quite interestingly about bringing his productions up to a level where he felt like he could bring his older influences into it. And again, it was this industrial thing drawing on these early 80s. bands that were just so influential have continued to form what like the scenes like the birmingham and downwards um crew um stephen yeah i think quite an interesting one just to take that vampire analogy even further when you're bitten by a vampire you actually become possessed by the vampire it's almost like the base scene has taken on this whole techno thing as well So just take one example, take Pangea. If you followed his career from his really early releases on Hessel, it's kind of quiet, you know, not too standard dubstep, but, you know, you kind of knew what he was getting. To now what he's making and playing, it's totally bonkers, some of it, you know, and it's got that techno influence, but also the bass influences, also ragga influences. And for me, that's what makes British music great, is this h for what is great about the British scene and British urban dance music. Yeah, I mean, I think that's an interesting strand of producer when you've got people like Panjshir and the Hessel Audio crew, you've got people like Halton and Peverellist in Bristol. you know, their core pool of influences are much removed from those, you know, from their contemporaries in Europe. But the slight twists and the variations on formulas that you guys are injecting into their sound, you know, they can make straightforward to the floor techno, but it's just something. And I've been thinking quite long and hard about this and really trying to put my finger on it. production trait or just something in the way they arranged a track but it's almost impossible and it's just interesting that for a scene like techno that very much does have its formulas like just those type of subtle variations I guess another example is Blauer and I guess he's a name on most people's lips at the moment someone I just wrote down as a perfect example this whole excitement in the scene you know someone who is taking all these influences and making it really fresh yeah i mean um i think i think the industrial thing again it comes back to that um some of those records and some of the more recent Karen stuff as well. That shit's noisy. Yep. Like really. And going for those like almost straight off the board, like onto vinyl press. Do we feel as though, I mean, we talked obviously about your own party, but do we feel as though this is really injected a new lease of life into the club scene in London? Well, you only have to look around now. Not only do you have machine, you have the blueprint nights, you know, with Ruskin and Mark Broom. So surgeon occasionally plays for them as well as he does for us. And Fabric is still doing their strong Saturday nights. And there's lots of other, you know, the problem. And we were talking about this before we record in the problem, as always with London is finding decent venues. It's always going to be the problem with London, you know, particularly. So I think it's almost a miracle that this. so many good nights at the moment because it still is and I've experienced it how difficult it is to get decent clubs with a decent sound system because one thing about these new records is that they need to be played on very good sound systems the days are you know the days of sound systems not being important went years ago The kind of music technology there is out there these days, even with the kind of lo-fi straight-to-vinyl things, the Mike Dennett stuff, it's all deliberate. It sounds raw and crunchy, but you need a very, very good sound system. So it's still hard in London, I'll admit it, but there's some great nights despite that. It's interesting, actually, because we were sat here at the very first roundtable we did having this exact same discussion. And I'm not I wasn't suspecting for a moment that the situation would have changed in the eight months since then. But it's interesting. Do you have any thoughts on on why that might be? Why we do face such a lack? of small to medium venues in London? I don't know, Benji, you're nodding. Maybe you've got more insider knowledge because I don't know if it's the landlords or the councils or just the lack of investment into clubs. Maybe clubs are seen as a declining thing for big business, I don't know, but it's so sad that probably the best sound system in London is in ministry, you know, it's frustrating. I mean, you were talking before we started about the dual party you had or the joint party you had with Plex and Colony and that being one of the better ones that you'd had for a decade. I've not seen a London night like that in 20 years since the first Lost parties for techno, I'm talking. Sorry, to put that in context, that was how long ago? Yeah, that was early 90s. Oh, sorry, not last the... The PCM. PCM was last October. We're doing the second one, second... of November and we had three rooms at Corsica Studios over a thousand people had to queue 20 minutes to get in each room it was just insane Perk finished off the night you know it's eight o'clock in the morning we've still you know half the people there it was just amazing night And, you know, we use Corsica Studios because it's one of the few clubs that's got, you know, a couple of function ones, sounds great, but it's still quite a smallish venue, you know, so London is a hard nut to crack. Yeah, I mean, I'm just looking over the lineup for the PCM party. We've got names like Untold, Liberty Sound. regis a made-up sound um phase i mean if you're talking about cross-pollination just looking at a lineup like that yeah um i mean even three years ago you wouldn't have drawn like too many parallels between what someone like untold and no and yourselves are doing yeah no it's it's uh it is an exciting time and um it's been a joy to meet these young producers as I've been going out and you know they say they're influenced by us and vice versa and the one good thing I like about this whole scene is that nothing stays still for long either. the industrial kind of influence and it really is stuck on this vampire analogy because um it's almost inspired like a kind of gothic techno kind of sub-genre and already that's becoming oversaturated and so it's yeah it's uh There's a lot of kind of function surgeon clones out there with their big sawtooth, you know, sort of synth rises and big noise clashes. And it's already flooding the market. So that's what's great about techno. You know, if you're doing music like that, it's too late. You've got to move on and always reintroducing new kind of styles. Yeah, I think the last time I was at Corsica was this past Saturday for the Blackest Ever Black Party. I think that's another fine example of a label that ostensibly doesn't have a great deal to do with techno. If you just sit down with their output, like, you know, to the layman, it would just be like, okay. where's the where's the huge kick drums yeah this isn't functional club music but um you know i'd hazard a guess that most of the most of the acts on that label are drawing as much influence from that side of things as uh i always check that stuff out and i'm sure the others you know and the machine crew ben sims and that do so yeah we always keep an eye on everything and what really helps is these these new digital um dj promo pools actually because They all club together, all the types of music. So it's great that you can, whereas you'd go in a record shop and maybe you'd hear one strand of music for quite a while and then go, now I'm getting promos from all different types of genres and checking them out. And that's a good thing about digital. Are there any other guys you two have been particularly impressed with? Well, I think I should mention... that I was at the Royal Albert Hall to see hieroglyphic being TVO and bass clef earlier this week as part of a rewired series of concerts which The Wire magazine are running. I'd certainly mention hieroglyphic being as well in the context of what's happening with techno at the moment because, I mean, we talked about the straight off the board, straight to the cut, analogue style, and of course he's been one of the main progenitors of that, I guess. When you see him live, I think it really brings it home as well how much he's willing to experiment with people regardless of whether they're sat in a concert hall or whether they're stood in a club dancing. I'd also like to mention Basscliff because I thought what he did at his Royal Albert Hall performance was just insane. He managed to... He managed to perform a composition for 30 minutes, which evolved and changed very rapidly and in a very structured manner without using a computer at all, all using a couple of modular synthesizers and a mixing desk and a drum machine, as far as I could see, with a few effects pedals. That's a fairly difficult thing to achieve. And clearly he's got something interesting to say when it comes to techno. So I'm looking forward to hearing more from him as well. Not to heap the praise too heavily on Mr. Bayscliffe, but we had him in as part of our Ether Festival event at Southbank Centre this past... this past weekend and seeing him perform with two drummers and creating what could only be described as live acid infused techno in which he was alternating between synth cowbell whistle and anything else he could bang on um yeah he was some i mean he's not somebody that i think would uh instantly come to mind when talking about the genre but um he was definitely bringing it in a in a in a unique manner One of the things that I also wanted to mention, I think that techno for me has a very strong link with a slightly higher brow strand of music as well. Modern classical music, contemporary music, experimental music, music concrets. There's a massive relationship between techno and obviously... the music that Steve Reich made using looped tapes. And I think it's a very positive thing for music in general, techno being strong, because it seems to inspire people to want to go to these, not just clubs, but to more experimental music events. And as Kirk, again, pointed out... with this brilliant analogy about the vampire, dance music is really best when it's full of people making it who are really aware of and really interested in other types of music. It's almost like a frame. I mean, drum and bass is the best example. It was just a kind of... framework for showcasing people's interest in rare groove records, hip-hop records and in a club context and so it's always best when you've got people who are coming from all over the place making it I think. So we've kind of concluded that we're in quite a good place with everything at the moment. Kirk, how do you feel we remain in such a healthy and creative place? Well, that's down to what the other side of this crazy industry, that's the people who go out clubbing and the people, the audience. That's down to them, what they want, what they demand from their DJs and performers and artists. And also the gatekeepers to this industry, the labels, the media. It all depends on which way it's going to go. And so often these great starts become sidetracked into agendas and, you know, they go the wrong way, you know, sometimes. Yeah, so that's really out of my hands and out of everyone's hands, artist and producer wise. It's been a difficult year for us here in the UK in terms of festivals. I think we can probably all... agree on that so uh without mentioning the b word we kind of wanted to inject some uh positivity into things now uh the festival season has drawn to a close so i wanted to start by asking steven about a positive experience he had at southport weekender yeah well Obviously, we said we don't want to mention the B word, but Southport Weekender is actually in the site where the B word was originally from. It's in Minehead, which is actually a Butlins family holiday resort. Obviously quite a weird place to have a dance-ish music festival. That's where they have it. And it is a totally, I'd probably say unique event. I just went on a whim. I was asked to review it and got there and was surprised to find that the average age is about probably around 35, 40. It's all straight up soul music and house music. So you've got people like Jazzy Jeff playing alongside Greg Wilson and Kerry Chandler. and Timmy Regisford, David Morales. But what's really interesting about Southport is that it's been going for 40 years and people know the history of it. It's originally a sole weekender. And people just bring a completely different style of music and DJing than they do anywhere else they'll play. Fabio and Groove Rider were playing a boogie and funk set. Trevor Nelson, who's now known for his... breakfast shows on one extra playing like Nicki Minaj was bringing some of like the most ridiculous rare groove I've heard in ages. and was absolutely killing it. You had, yeah, Kerry Chandler playing a straight-up Soulful House set, which was fantastic. He was jamming away on a keyboard. It's really, really unlike almost any other British festival you can go to. Totally unique and surprisingly messy, which is one of the funniest things about it. it they've got this semi kind of tolerated chalet parties which it's in a holiday complex everyone stays in chalets after the music finishes about 8am which is like pretty late people just smuggle in speakers start playing loads of garage until about 5 in the afternoon and the kind of staff kind of tolerate it because everyone's in the same room and yeah pretty pretty bonkers So with your limited experience, would you say that there's a difference between a weekender and a festival? Yeah, so I think the chief difference is that a weekender, if you want to call it that, is indoors. So you miss all of the terrible weather that you usually get in a British festival. The rain. the sludge the som like experience trying to get from tent to tent um yeah something i think is probably worth explaining at this point also the uh british holiday park experience uh can you summarize that for someone maybe hasn't uh yeah so it's kind of an odd one um british holiday parks have been going since the post-war era they were kind of originally set up for people and cast people to go somewhere to the seaside with their family and spend their hard-earned wages with their kids so they're still kind of set up in that way lots of kind of fun restaurants and arcade machines that you can put pound coins in and win some fun prizes so it's like a totally family orientated place um is butlin's but for one weekend a year They take out all the kind of stages where they would usually have shows, you know, with cabaret and stuff in with function one speakers and put old DJs in there and everyone loves it. I'm actually quite fortunate because when a particular UK festival was having some issues, shall we say, I was in the Welsh countryside at a free rotation festival, which was... Yeah, it was my first visit to Baskerville Hall and I have to say it was a wholly positive experience. That's good. I think the story I keep telling people is that we sat down to have some food on the first night. I think I had a burger, in fact. and um i already declared it as my favorite festival i'd been to without having heard any music um the location is just one of the most charming places i've ever seen um it's tumble down like it's not a nice hotel but if you can imagine going to driving out to the countryside to uh attend auntie's wedding when you're a kid and you're in a function hall like there's kids kids running around, the carpets are very sticky. Like it's that sort of vibe. Also appreciated like the proximity, although we didn't camp, the proximity from the campsite to the festival itself just meant that people were going back and forth. So there was none of this slog. Everybody was like. doing exactly as they pleased when they pleased um you know if you wanted to escape you could do that if you want to just lay on the grass when it wasn't raining you could do that um i think that kind of filtered through to the artists as well um most people were there for the weekend which i think really had a big effect because everybody was discussing their performances beforehand everybody was sticking around to dissect them afterwards um that's something you don't really see like people are flying in and out usually that's a it's a wholly new festive experience for me certainly um i think particular highlights two five six two was um kind of next level and something again that sort of speaks to the uh speaks to the type of environment that that we saw him in he must have been like a meter away and he was very much reacting to everybody in the front row so you get this wonderful feedback loop where he's pulling off um decks and effects tricks and and these kind of things and uh you're simultaneously egging him on so it's just it's just that type of setting where you do feel like you're that much more engaged and uh that much more close to the action i think free rotation is is the closest we have but the the big festival that well it's not a big festival but the festival that is on everyone's names DJ wise seems to be the Labyrinth Festival in Japan and I hope that something similar will come along and I think Britain is probably the place for it so you think Britain's the place for it? I do yeah because of the mixture of music and because I think it would work with people coming to this country. Like you say, with free rotation, Britain seems to be a place where people know a lot of other people, the language is easy, they'll come and stay for a whole kind of weekend rather than just do a day visit. I hope that will happen sooner or later. That's interesting. I mean, do we feel as a group like people travel from other parts of Europe to British festivals? Because personally, as a clubber, as a festival goer, I'm never really too aware of foreign visitors when I'm at UK festivals. I don't know what you guys' impressions of this are. I think festival attracts quite a big foreign audience. Okay. I don't know. Yeah, I've never really noticed it, but I don't know. Maybe I'm not looking out for it in the right places. You know, it's not exactly the kind of thing that you think of necessarily when you have had 10 pints of cider falling out of the techno tent. So, yeah, perhaps they do. Yeah, I think it would be an interesting decision. Obviously, the line-ups in Best of All, and especially the one they do travel for, definitely is Glastonbury. That is 100% get a lot of foreign people going to Glastonbury, and it's obviously the tentpole of the British festival season, no pun intended. We mentioned Best of All there before, Stephen. This was another one that you attended and had a good time. Yeah, it was absolutely brilliant. And we've kind of touched upon a lot the unpredictable British summer, but at best of all, absolutely amazing weather. It was 30 degrees every single day. during the festival and as a British person it's probably hard to explain this to anyone else who's not from Britain but British people in the summertime when it's sunny kind of just kind of lose their minds it's it's such an unpredictable thing to happen um when the weather's that good it just brings a great vibe to to the whole festival so before almost any music was played it was going to be a good one. Best of all is a really interesting festival just from the travel point of view because it's actually on the Isle of Wight, which is an island off of the south of England. So you're getting a ferry over there and it kind of adds to the whole feel and the excitement of the festival. It almost feels like you're going to Pinocchio's Pleasure Island or something like that, this kind of island of ill repute. The music itself, when we got there, absolutely excellent. Stevie Wonder headlined. He's probably the best artist to headline a festival. I've seen him headline two festivals now. And yeah, an amazing performer, but with a back catalogue that includes things like Superstitious, Sir Duke. He just gets the party going like no one else really can. Other great acts were New Order. particularly good. I've seen them play several times before not being so great. This time they were really, really excellent. And just a general ridiculous lineup of DJs, you know, from David Rodigan, who done like a five hour set, which is 50% preaching and 50% music, but absolutely amazing. Daphne and Fortet playing back to back. was also particularly good. Yeah, so basically, Bestival was great this year because of the weather, but the music was also excellent too. I'll go out on a limb and say I think Bestival was the best big festival in the country. I've been there for the last three years. Also in Glastonbury. I've never been to Glastonbury. It's not my music, to be honest, but best of all, it is something about the atmosphere of getting on an island that adds to it. You're totally right. So in this section, we kind of wanted to start with an anecdote, which we were drawing from your, Stephen, sorry, his review of Teef's recent first birthday party. Now you attended with a colleague of mine, Ben Oliver, and were struck by a certain prevalent sound at the night, shall we say. I just wondered if you could explain that for us. Yeah, sure. Well, there wasn't necessarily a prevalent sound of the night. There was a prevalent sound of a couple of sets, namely Bicep and Underground Paris. It was probably about nine o'clock in the morning. We'd been listening to this Bicep and Underground Paris play back to back for maybe like three hours. and Ben suddenly turned around and said to me, the same five elements have been running around these tracks for the last hour, and I was just dancing my ass off, having a great time. And he just said, look, it's the same Kerry Charnler kick drums. It's the same MK vocals. It's the same FM stabs. Doesn't this bother you? And obviously I was like, totally not. And yeah, it's quite interesting as well, because I wrote the review about that club night and it seems to stir up a little bit of discussion on RA split firmly in between two camps. Number one, this is amazing. I love Bicep. I love Underground Paris. 90s house is so refreshing to me right now. Number two, this is making me feel sick. I don't want... to relive the 90s and I feel almost that's the consensus in club club culture at the moment it seems like you've got Kirk over there running a club night which is totally focused on brand brand new music but you've also got people across the spectrum not just house DJs trying to dig deeper into vinyl culture into these unknown b-sides into edits of older music and stick into that formula. So would you say that you're firmly in camp number one? I'd say I'm somewhere in the middle, but my heart... That's offensive, if ever I heard one. Yeah, yeah. Well, I'll tell you what, my heart lies in camp number one with the 90s house scene. You know, I'm one of those vinyl nerds. I sit there on discogs and will pay £30 for some... ridiculous King Street record that just suddenly wasn't digitized for whatever reason. So we're talking specifically about this early 90s, New Jersey, New York, Kerry Chandler thing. But is this something that's really come to prominence recently, do we feel? Well, I think the first thing I really want to say on this is that I think you've got to be very careful about how we talk about recycling the past because... Of course, one of the striking things about this current theme in house music is that it's focused on one aspect of the 90s, which is the house dubs. And often those would be the dub version or instrumental version of a remix somebody like Merck or David Morales had done of, let's say, an R&B tune. And the rest of the record would be quite a big... quite big vocal tracks we're not hearing that we're not hearing big vocals um we're not hearing bicep play big vocals or release tracks with big vocals on them interestingly enough actually gerd um later on who records as gerd um from rotterdam in the netherlands um was recounting anecdote about how he'd recently been approached by somebody in a club. He plays quite a vocal selection in his sets. And somebody came to him in the club saying, this isn't what we want. We want big drums, little snips of vocal. We don't want songs. And he wasn't very pleased about that. So I guess that tells you something, though, about what people expect when they go to a house night nowadays. They're not expecting that big. yeah that big uh vocal line to drop um you know they're not they're not looking for the kind of verse chorus that type of moment i mean to um to put this into a kind of wider context i guess and um i'm definitely not putting these producers in in boxes but we're talking about people like bicep dj stew like ged who you mentioned like sand soda i guess is somebody who's been on that tip for a couple of years um i'd say nicholas has definitely been exploring this uh this era um quite thoroughly for the last 12 months or so and then you've got labels like local talk um robosol for lux who've uh definitely been um dallying in this uh this type of sound So, Benji, what camp, if you're using Stephen's camp one and camp two labels, how are you defining yourself in this argument? Oh, I mean, I'm all for it. I think that, you know, you have to give people what they want. um at the moment what people want is this particular style my only complaint and i i'm in good on good side as far as this goes is that i really think a couple of these producers need to push the envelope and come with some vocal tracks i think you know they need to stop avoiding the difficult songwriting elements which some of those which some of those 90s guys were so good at, and actually have a go at it and see if they can get some crossover going on, because I think it would be a real shame. To me, that's where this needs to go now. I think it would be a real shame if the producers who are currently working on... this style of music avoided it one of the best examples actually of a vocal track which has really um which is which has really done a lot of damage on dance floors in the last year is the um sand soda um remix of fcl it's you i hope i've got that right if mr reddy's listening because it's on his label and that is a huge tune, and that is, not only is it vocal, it's actually acapella for a lot of the track with backing vocals forming the rhythmic elements. It's a brilliant, brilliant track. It was released in a limited edition of 100, which sold out within an hour, and there was a caveat with each purchase that... anyone found putting it on Discogs would be outed by the label. Some serious nerdism there. But I just want to really back that point up there, Benji. Like for me, unlike techno, there's only a certain set of boundaries that house can actually be in before it stops becoming house. You know, it's got to have a certain few elements there before it actually becomes something kind of different. Sorry, just to interrupt there. Why is... how so less malleable than techno um i tell you for one reason i i really think this i think there's a real um there's a real progression within house music that's really understood by both the listeners of house music and both the people that make it and dj it so from disco comes house music becomes different strands of house music but there's always that continuation whereas techno and especially drum and bass set themselves up against that and said all right stop we're going to try and look to the future and create some new sounds house music does have a very linear progression within it and i think when you start going into a certain um kinds of left field twists it starts becoming something it feels something like it like not house and um that's that's kind of for me the summary of that But do we not feel a little bit like people are just bound by history and they're just following a sort of lineage of kind of just being very conservative with the sound and it just does maybe take one or two bold producers to kind of bust open the interpretation of what house music is? Oh, yeah, definitely. Like, you know, there's people like... Daphne that are kind of breaking that down right now as we speak. But the point I was going to make is that some great house records stick with that formula, but they put an amazing song on it or an amazing kind of sample twist that you've never heard before. A lot of really great house records aren't actually, didn't really push that envelope that much, but they're all about feeling, they're all about song, and they're all about sometimes just about finding this great sample that wasn't ever used before. It's such a horrible cliche, but I'm going to have to say it. house is a feeling um yeah there's some truth that lies within that you know that that that there is the feeling within the records that kind of makes it what it is it doesn't necessarily have to be about making something new all the time but how long can it continue to be a feeling when we're just looking to to its past do we think well i tell you what take omrs for example now omrs is often held up as a person who's really pushing the sound but to most people's ears he's actually pushing quite an 80s kind of sound in the in the machines he uses in everything you know basically the whole aesthetic you know using raw and analog gear but what makes omrs's tracks different is the melodies is the is the songwriting talent that he has. I don't reckon he'd see Omar S coming up with something that's rehashed any time soon, but he's definitely doing stuff that has a classic sound to it. I mean, do we feel at this moment, like most of the producers who are experimenting in this sound are in this? straight rehash game or are there people we feel are putting their own spin on things it's an interesting question actually like like i would say that some of the some of the best djs they are just by the very virtue of how deep they're digging they're kind of putting their own spin on it so like jeremy underground paris is a great example he really reminds me of like a northern soul dj So I'm not sure if everyone's obviously aware of Northern Soul that's listening, but that was a scene from the 70s, which was just basically said, dance music stopped in Detroit in 1965. And that Motown chugging sound is what we're going to keep playing forever and ever and ever. And the Motown slogan is actually called Keep the Faith. That's what they have on their badges and stuff like that. And that tells you a lot. I really feel that some of these guys, just to use Underground Paris as an example, they almost feel like the music peaked in 94, but they're going to find all of these really obscure... obscure records around that time that have the same vibe and have the same kind of elements that they want to deliver that sound to today's audiences. And they really are finding some ridiculously obscure records. Underground Paris, for example, just brought back this old producer called Nathaniel X, who was really loved on Discogs. His records go for $150. brought new records by him that no one knew existed um actually it was quite an interesting piece i read recently on this subject by um actually an r.a staffer angus finlayson um and he'd use the examples of um mark fell and um vessel as people were kind of breaking out of this a little bit but he asked a question in the piece why can house not shed its past Now, Kirk, do you have any thoughts on why House is so or feels so indebted to its past? Well, it's interesting. You asked me if I'd have anything to say about what you've been through. talking about and it's like literally a case of how long have you got the the weight of expectation on on house producers coming out of that whole east coast scene is immense you've got masters at work you know the whole body and soul thing timmy regisford blaze tony humphries francois k Todd Terry, you can go on and on and on. And that weighs heavily on new producers, believe it or not. You know, they've really got to fight against the whole legacy of these great guys. And I do think that's a combination of that and a combination of what you were saying earlier, where, you know, these... these producers they they kind of want to do something new but they they they also are still looking back to these guys and that's where the legacy of disco so and it's a continuum and that will always be the way with house music in my opinion um so i think you're totally correct about this continuum it it's almost like a rule that it has to have this this connection with disco with west end prelude south soul that whole legacy now the the interesting thing you mentioned about vocals about good who's someone who i've released in the past amazing producer um not being able to play you know vocal songs and i think that is a global thing House is global music. Dance music is global now. You can't really go to Romania and play gospel house music because they'll just say, I can't understand half the lyrics. I don't like it. There's no history of black music in Romania. I just want little snippets, you know, of vocals. And it's become a global thing. where it's not just a black music scene that won't work now. And I think that's where the answer for GERD lies. And as far as house music being experimental and becoming something else, just like techno, the answer lies in Detroit, because Omar S., Theo Parrish, Moody Man, that's where you get your experimental... house music that you can still actually class as house music in my opinion Samir, I just wanted to go back to what you said about people being very much in awe and feeling the omnipresence of people like Harry Chandler. Now, why are people almost trying to take them on in this style? Why would they try to better what has been done by people like Harry Chandler rather than trying to push out into their own form? do we think um because of the the lineage and it's no different from dave lee making disco records you know he makes them like they used to because it's part of that that's that's the feeling of the music uh there's no kind of tradition there of breaking out from that and It is such a lineage. You probably know I'm a huge soul boogie disco collector. And I've got boogie records from 83 with these guys' names on them. And they're nothing like house music. It is a lineage that goes back through black music. And it will always be there. And that's what they like. And I love it. I love that kind of music. I don't care if it's retro. And I wonder... I don't know enough about the production side of it, but there is also a retro movement in techno. It was huge last year, you know, with a lot of the Dutch labels like Clone and Delsin and Rush Hour, as well as releasing very futuristic upfront music. There was this whole, let's try and sound like Virgo, 1986 Chicago. And that was almost totally driven by Ableton there being a retro drum machines sample pack released for Ableton. And all the producers suddenly released these records with these sounds. I wonder if that... if there's been a New York sample pack release. Maybe that's the solution. Yeah, maybe that's what's going on. No, I mean, it's interesting because if we were having this conversation 12 months ago, we probably would have been talking about an 88, like, tracks revival, wouldn't we? Yeah, exactly, yeah. With all of those classic roll and drum sounds, it does just feel like we're moving through the ages at the moment, doesn't it? Yeah, it massively does. Like, I'm If you just think about Rockabilly, famously Rockabilly, if you're a Rockabilly fan, everyone says, Carl Perkins, that was it. He never got better than Carl Perkins. He peaked. And then everyone since has tried to sound and look exactly like Carl Perkins forever. And I kind of feel like with the New Jersey sound, it's like Kerry Chandler's 94 streak of records and MKs. Everyone's just like, all right, that's as good as it got. We're just And funny you mentioned Frankie Knuckles. This is quite a weird one, but I actually done a piece for RA with Frankie, asked him, because he's been through the lot, when do you think house peaks? And he said, nine. Sound Factory Bar that was the best and that's the era for all these records coming out so I think that kind of says a lot really about how evocative that era of music is which is now becoming around so big for everyone But how does that make us feel over the long-term viability of a sound like house music? Are we just going to be fetishising the past forevermore? I mean, come on, let's be honest. There's a massively wide range of music. If you go back to 94 and listen to a Junior Vasquez set from a Sound Factory bar, it's not all... going to be organ stabs and skippy beats and MK style vocal snippets. I mean, you know, it's going to be all kinds of mad house music. People like DJ Pierre, Future, I guess to some extent, Roy Davis Jr. Peter Prestor, the list just goes on. All of them had a really unique style. And I think as long as the people who are looking back there now and who are slightly fetishising it open their minds to the fact that it wasn't all like that and that there was a real range, they will find new directions. I've got faith as well because of the DJs like... Kenny Doe, Francois Kaye tirelessly representing brand new music at his Deep Space Night and Ron Trent. Those guys will always be interested in new music. So I have absolutely got 100% faith that it won't do any detrimental harm to this scene whatsoever. you
