Yes, it's been a long time, but you know, I can remember some things that we used to do. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the world of music. in their electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resonant Advisor. For this week's exchange, we return to About Blank in Berlin for another edition of the Amplified Kitchen, a series of talks tackling crucial issues in club culture. Titled Safe Rave, a How, too, the discussion highlights the barriers to better implementing drug education and testing, with a particular focus on the Berlin scene. Moderated by Deirdre Renan, with panelists Manuela Schulz, Dr. Henrik Junger-Behrle, and Jonathan Gregory, we hear a set of strategies for better managing drug use in party contexts, with ideas pitched to promoters, politicians, and ravers alike. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange on safe raving is up next. you You're all very welcome to About Blank and the Amplified Kitchen, which is an event sponsored by Music Morgue Berlin. And my name is Deirdre Rouen. I'm a writer and researcher about festival and drug safety and nightlife safety in general. We're holding a panel on the rather provocatively titled Safe Rave, where I think you're supposed to infer a question mark, as one of the organisers was saying, because it's not really possible to have a completely safe rave, but we want to think about ways we can make it safer, at least in the sort of turbulent situation. that we currently have in relation to drugs and drug policy. So there are three interesting speakers here tonight. So I'd first of all like each of you to tell me a bit about yourself and what your relation to this whole scene and this whole issue is. So maybe starting with Manuela. My full name is Manuela Schulz and I work with both Chill Out, which is an association from Potsdam, and Eclipse from Berlin, which is known for running the intervention in Fusion Festival, for example. And so what I've been doing for about six or seven years now is harm reduction work related to party and nightlife settings. So I'm a volunteer and a peer worker. When we run interventions in larger festivals, we mostly collaborate with a lot of harm reduction organizations from Germany. And so it's been running under the... rooftop of Sonics of Psycare. So what we offer is a service to provide information and time reduction material to party guests and people that are interested and drug users. And we also provide support for people that are having a more difficult time in a festival or just need a place to... hang out and relax before it gets too difficult for them. Thank you very much. That sounds great. And Jonathan? Yeah, hello everybody. My name is Jonathan Gregory and I'm a social worker at a project called Mancheck. And first and foremost, we are... clubs and in bars to talk about sexual health and issues regarding sexual health for gay men. So it's like HIV and STI prevention, what's your safer sex strategy, how do you prevent sexual health issues. And the other part of my work is that We also hand out harm reduction information. regarding all the substances that are used at clubs and while partying, as well as handing out, say, for drug use kits. For example, straws when you have, like, take substances through the nose, or syringes and needles and dosage helps for G, for example. And we try to talk with people, especially gay men, since we're gay. project about these issues. and the government of Berlin, the Senate, pays us. So that's also why our work is also always political, because we always try to stay in an open discussion with the Berlin politics regarding substance use and safer raving. Yeah. That's really interesting. And I'm glad to have that perspective because... It's a hobby horse of mine that the association between drug harm reduction and sex-based harm reduction goes back a really long way, like to sex worker activists who were heroin addicts in the 1980s. So that's an interesting connection to explore. And also your mention of policy and how it relates to Berlin policy. We'll come back to that later. But finally, how about you? So first of all, I'm not Andrea Zeuch, which you would have to say. I've expected. She's my partner, but she's heading for hospital right now. And since we are both dealing with drugs. I can't substitute her tonight. I'm a drug education practitioner and drug scientist, you could call. I have published several books on topics like prevention in the field of school, but also We have a group in our new organization that is heading for newer concepts in festival work. And in my science career, so that's one part of my personality, I've been looking very much at... How do people stay healthy when taking drugs? They call it in science, they call it salutogenesis. So not what's making people sick or bad in the long term, but what's making people more healthy in the long term. That's what interests me. Great. And can you just say your name for the recording? Henrik Jung-Aberle. That's my name. Okay. So just a sort of general question to start off. I'd like to hear a bit about sort of the current role of drugs and alcohol in like the Berlin scene, but also more widely, like how do you think it compares to elsewhere? And are there any sort of recent trends that you've seen? Like, how do you think it's changed? I just met a friend, Felix Betzler, who has done a study about a survey in the club scene of Berlin. And I just wondered if there was anything surprising for you guys in the study when it comes to the drugs that have been used. We see a lot of, about half of the people that have answered the surveys, half of the nightlife people seem to be using stimulants. So it's MDMA, a lot more amphetamines and stimulants and cocaine, of course. Ketamine is running with... about 30% of the people who have answered that survey. Alcohol is up to 80%. Cannabis, 60% of the people. And when I... Listen to what the colleagues write. They say that a lot of people are most concerned about mixed uses of these drugs. What do you see? Honestly, I feel like I need to mention one thing before getting this conversation started. I've been thinking about it during the day already when I knew I would be on this panel today. And now that I've spoken to some friends before the conversation, I found out I might just say one word. Because in fact, one of our fellow peer workers from the Sonics Psych Care Network and a friend of us has just died like 12 days ago. And due to a lethal combination of... prescription drugs. But not in the nightlife setting? Well, but in a recreational setting. I just felt like I needed to say a word to this because it's still affecting me when I'm talking about psychedelic care and harm reduction work. But this is not supposed to direct the topic of the conversation. But it's been shown once more that fucked up shit just happens and that also people can do wrong about drugs. And that the legal status of drug doesn't necessarily say anything about the risks. Yeah, and prescription drugs often get forgotten when these things are being considered. and even their interactions with recreational ones. So thank you for bringing that in. With that in mind, did you have any more comments? And what do you think are the current trends? What are people doing more of, less of? Are there particular risks that people are taking, do you think? So it also leads me to one more thing that I have noticed during the season in different festivals, which is that people from my perception really are dealing more with actual medication, like with prescription drugs. I didn't notice that as much as I did this summer before. And it's also dangerous because drugs like benzodiazepines, for example, can cause an addiction quite fast compared to other substances. Yeah, so it's one thing I've noticed. Maybe you want to... join in with something else? Yeah, well, first of all, I just wanted to say that we live in an amazing city. Berlin is like the best city in the world. And I think it's great that in our scene and in our club scene that we have like this hedonistic standard. that every person can be themselves. You can be queer, you can be a person of color, you can be anything you want. You can be on Saturday this person, on Sunday this person. And it's amazing that we have conversations about substance use. And I really want to say substance use and not substance abuse because many people I know... very aware of what they're doing and what they are consuming and they are very aware how to be safe, how to have a great weekend, how to have a great party that goes on for three days and they know to drink enough and they know when to chill and they know when to take some more and I think it's great because in the scenes that I work in, I talk to people. about their use of substances and enhancements to have a greater party and a lot of them are very self-aware and that leads me to believe that the conversation that we're having, especially in Berlin, in regards to other German cities I know the party is seen of, we are very open-minded and very accepting in certain circles when it comes to a positive... party positive, sex positive view on the use of substances. for example in the south of Germany, I think that in Munich for example or Stuttgart by any chance if anyone knows these cities, I mean they all do drugs. Everyone does drugs at a certain point in their lives. They are all partying and finding themselves in the nightlife but they don't talk about it and that's what's so great. When I moved to Berlin I pretty soon learned that people really talk about their substance intake, which I found quite refreshing because it allowed a... ongoing discussion. Oh. Wow. Turn it up. Yeah. Oh, I've been amplified too. Turn up the volume in the kitchen. Maybe one thing I'd add a little bit to that discussion. It's the age of party people and related to dosages of drugs that are being dealt right now. All over Europe, we find that the dosage of the MDMA pills that are treated is going up. And that might be still going up. So, when I first read my first things or talked to people in the 90s who took MDMA, the standard dose was still 100, 120, 140. Of course, people could double, triple, and so on. But now we've got a lot of pills that have 380 or 400. And that might be related to the age of users and the times. they have consumed in their life too. And that might be a topic too. So people aging when it comes to MDMA don't have the same experience. By the way, that's an interesting question. How many times are good MDMA times and how many times are people running after? Their first MDMA high, again, doubling doses, tripling doses. That's certainly a topic in the city too. So do you think that the fact that dosages are going up or pills are getting stronger might be because there's an aging user base that need more in order to get high? It adds to that. I see a lot of very intelligent marketing, market-oriented people. People in drug laboratories, when you talk to them, they are talking to people who buy their stuff. And of course that's bad news for young people who are coming to it fresh and don't need an extra large dose. and are taking these old people pills and maybe running into trouble. Old people pills, that's a nice term. Do you actually think or do you know that people are taking higher dosages on purpose? Or is it just, well, what we know from the statistics is that the dosages in the pills are increasing. But do people intend to have higher dosages? Probably a lot don't. A lot don't. It's just a general market effect. And then through the black market system, when people start dealing the substances, Of course, the intention of the person who made that pill is not present anymore. So young people might be buying it. They might be handing it over to somebody else. And you can't trust the dosages on the pills. So it happens that they take higher dosages. I think this goes back to what Jonathan was saying about it being important to talk about it. There's a UK campaign called Crush Dab Wait. which is one of the harm reduction things that they've tried to get shared around. Definitely. The first thing I'm always telling people is that if you take something, talk with your friends about it. Because you can have a great party, but the better party is if you have it with your friends. So communicate what you're taking, what you're doing, and talk about it. Because that's all what I'm trying to put into. the scene when I talk to people and when I talk to the people of the government, our project always says it's so important to bring back drug checking so that people know what they are taking so that it lowers the risk of an overdose or that you don't know what you're taking. So it's very important that the politics in Berlin jump on the train and say, okay, listen, we know people are using drugs. and they won't stop. And you can put all the labels on it that it's bad for whatever, but they won't stop. So let's just... find a consensus where we can work together in getting the pills checked and that it gets more legal and accepted that people are doing drugs because when we're talking about substance, I always feel like it's so easy to say someone abuses instead of uses and it turns very negative very quickly. This is, yeah, I'm really glad you brought up drug checking because... You're welcome. Yeah. Yeah, one of the things that I think we wanted to do tonight was to talk about how legal frameworks and drug policy in different places affect this whole process of trying to use drugs responsibly and trying to have as much information as we can about it. And drug checking facilities are kind of one of the biggest flashpoints of that, where you really see the effect of the legal framework. Like in my work, I was working with volunteer harm reduction projects at festivals in the UK, the US and Portugal. And as you probably know, in Portugal, drug checking is totally OK because possession of small amounts is decriminalized. So in fact, it's endorsed by the government and you can get your drugs checked. No problem at festivals. In the UK, it's in a really legal grey area, though it's starting to happen. And in the US, if there's any hint that it's happened at your event, the whole event can get shut down and the people who run the event can get prosecuted. And also you can't talk about it because there's so much undercover policing. So what I really wanted to know is if one of you can tell me what are the legal affordances of doing drug checking in Berlin and in Germany as a whole. Like, is it possible? Can you be honest that that's what you're doing? How much of it goes on? Does anybody know? So we're in a tiny, tiny spot, the tiny city of... Berlin, if you compare it to Germany, where one government now decided to get it going against the federal law, or at least the practice, how the law has been interpreted. So from what I know, next year it will hopefully be coming up. So the lawyers are still having their fights how to get it really. in the club scene. And I think that is a great example. I'm very much pro-drug checking. Although, if you look at the countries like Switzerland or Portugal or Czechoslovakia, where it is done, it's never done all over the place. It's only like little, a tiny section of the drug-using population that will have... access to drug checking or does want access to drug checking even. I think that the function of drug checking is something different. It tells you that Okay, take care of your drugs. It's more a general discourse that you could check it and that it's important to know what you're taking. But I think we're on a path to a more relaxed way of talking about drug checking in Germany. There's actually a pilot project in drug checking, which has just started a couple of months ago in the middle of Germany, in Thuringien. So we're going to find out about how's it going and what they're experiencing quite soon, I guess. Awesome. Are they based in clubs or do they go to festivals or both? Do you know? As far as I know, there's like a place where people can go like twice a week and give their samples and then they will return to get their results or kind of that. Oh, so it's permanent. It's open permanently rather than just at events. So as far as I know, they are not operating at events, but they have certain opening times, like on two or three days a week, where people can go apart from parties and get their drugs tested. So while formal drug checking is not possible in many places in Germany, there's a little trick that people can use. So if you're sending an unknown substance which has found the way to you, Somehow. Somehow to a toxicology laboratory at a university. And you never call it drug checking. The probability that they will do it is high. So you just don't call it drug checking because you're not allowed to do drug checking. Yeah, so once again, we have that thing where talking is vital. and you can't talk for legal reasons or you can't be perfectly honest about what you're doing. But it's great to hear these. things are happening anyway. I also found interesting what you said that drug checking is an effective tool but still it's only a kind of a service where small amount of people will have access to and I still think the general perception it also refers to what Jonathan said. The general perception of drug use... also on a social level is quite important. For example, in past years we've come across a lot of party organizers or clubs that didn't really allow information material to be displayed because they were afraid only then the police or... the authorities will pay attention to their club and find out that people might take drugs in there. And so this has been an issue. I feel like in the last... Two or three years, it's kind of changing, especially in the SONICS sidecare network. We are receiving a lot of requests from different events and smaller festivals that actually are looking for support and for that kind of sidecare and information services. So it's a positive trend. but I couldn't tell where it's coming from. It'd be interesting to know how much of it is politics changing, the political climate changing, and how much is them just getting more confident or being more willing to stick their necks out, but I'm glad it's happening. I mean, at the same time, relating to what we said before, when it comes to drugs in clubs, I think the legal situation is kind of crazy. we need to shift in the legal way that people are, that drug owners need to take care of the environments. I mean, why don't we have a law, maybe in a new psychoactive substances law, where a club owner is obliged to give drug information, is obliged to, so that all the arguments that are now present in the public sphere. So we don't want to give drug education because people then think that drugs are in our club. crazy alchemist. Everybody knows it, but they are still hiding. So we could set rules. Everybody has to put up a little sign. People under 16 don't get beer in here or something like that. Even if it's followed or not, they need to do it. Otherwise they can't start a club. Why don't we make them put out information material and those access routes to people like you. So what you're proposing is almost like the opposite of what they have in American drug policy, like that situation where if a club owner is seen to have any awareness or do any harm reduction, like giving out free water, they can get in deep trouble. That's a Joe Biden law. Yeah. Obama's buddy who brought up that law. the beginning of the 90s. I heard he was kind of conned into it or he was it was kind of slid in under his radar and he didn't even really read it. It was on the coattails of some other bill but anyway we have it now or they do so. So I've heard a bit about policy, heard a bit about some trends that might be a bit worrying. Could you talk more about sort of solutions or like harm reduction things that you've seen happening in Berlin or elsewhere that you think have been working well, that you think have got good results? And why do you think they've been working? I'm just having a quick thought because I just returned from the last festival interventions and what we experience every time is that guests are coming to us being so thankful. Sometimes they even want to volunteer as well or especially they show their deepest appreciation. And so I always tell them that they should address the organizers of the festival or the club owners to also encourage that they know, okay, they're spending money on inviting psych care services and they might also... be afraid of the authorities or something and so I think it's important to give feedback as well and show that you as a party guest appreciate that the club owner is providing that kind of special services. Yeah, that's great because often organizers are kind of in a vacuum and a bit scared. So showing the people appreciate it is great. Yeah, I think people who go out and have a party, where do you have the party? You have the party at the club. So I think they have a huge responsibility to provide information and a place where people can chill out and have water or fruits. or anything they need to get back on their feet. So what we're doing at Manchek is that we are working with different clubs and providing them a training that's called Safer Clubbing, where they can learn in two days, I think four hours per day, how to prepare their club and prepare the party so that it's... safe array so that the guests can have a nice party and that the people and the staff who work at the club are aware that people are doing substances at the party and that it's not like a top off topic so it's not like it shouldn't be discussed it needs to be discussed and it needs to be discussed on a regular basis so that what's what's we're what we are advocating and also doing with certain club owners and i found that to be very healthy and a very good basis for the for the people who work at the club, at the door, at the bars, as well as the people who throw the parties, that they are making an environment where it's safe as possible to be high and have fun. Then again, we could look at the whole question from a more behavioral perspective or from a more structural perspective. Why don't we have a law looking from a structural environmental perspective where a part of every ticket needs to be 3% needs to be spent on drug education stuff. So because the systemic things, they cannot be solved with behavioral programs. Behavioral programs only reach a tiny part of the population. So I think in talking more freely about drugs, in accepting that drug use is up to the A way that a part of methods that people use to engage into ecstasy, engage in altered states of consciousness, that that is a normal human behavior. But a part of that is also changing the discourse to we need structures that finance good work that is done in... drug education facilities like the ones you are working at. And I think that the private sector, the club owners with their ticketing could be a part of that financing system. It would solve a lot of problems. Yeah, but I think... how long does it take for a law to get settled in, to get signed and anything. It took over half a year so that Germany had a new government. I don't think we're in times right now where it's a fast process. But I do think that, especially in Berlin, we have a club scene that is very tight-knit so that people can self-organize to get things done. ahead of the lawmakers because they are not that good at the moment. There's also another thing if we look at the behavioral side I think we have very few models in the public space or in the club. scene where you can really that can share their healthy way of using some of the drugs that are in the field. We have a lot of bad models. We have accidents. But also the accidents are only narrated in a way that is focused on the last point and on the accident. So when we get a more rational way of talking about drugs, we also need positive models. So we learn from positive models. And as long as people say any form of drug use, excluding alcohol, of course. course, which definitely is a drug, and if almost of drug use is bad or feel ashamed for that, it's very hard to talk reasonable stuff about positive models. Yes, there are quite a lot of similarities when it comes to users as when it comes to gay men when you look at the history back because The social construct always wants to demonize things there that they don't understand. So when people don't understand that there are people who like to use substances to have a greater party, to enhance... whatever they're wanting to enhance, we should try to find ways to support them and be positive about it and give solutions. Like it's the same when people demonize gay people because they don't understand it. So it goes hand in hand. The society always wants people to fail in a way and not to succeed. So I think that a lot of power is... Society puts a lot of power into bringing certain people down and trying to change the narrative to a negative point of view instead of focusing on what good can come from a constructive dialogue. But what I also think or find out is that a lot of potential for improvement can also be... found within the party scene. So quite often I notice that there are certain groups of people that kind of don't allow drug use to fail or to be not the nicest experience you've ever had. I think this can be of an issue as well. Like if your own peer group is expecting you to have the best time ever together with you, even though you don't feel like it at the moment. And so I think there are certain like... Social pressure or norms. I think it's also really important to watch out for each other and to reflect each other well, even though you're that fancy type of person who's always going to the fanciest type of clubs, for example. Yeah, I think we've got sort of two interesting strands there. We've been bringing in the idea that you don't hear much about unproblematic drug use or people who have been doing it and who are fine, like you were saying. There's a lot of sort of cautionary tales, don't do that, but not very much sort of, I've been doing this for 10 years and this is how I did it. I think it's interesting the event is called Safe Rave, a how-to as well, as though it were sort of directly addressing that. like a positive how-to. But you make a really good point as well, Manuela, about in the quest for positive drug stories, we don't want people to feel pressured to not be able to say they're not having a good time. Like not to feel like a party pooper if they want to say that things aren't going so great for them. Like if you allow each other to take a break, you can probably improve the future experiences you're having. Like this is what we always tell people, like to find the right time for their party and drug experience. For example, with substances like MDMA, it's no sense about taking it every week. You will need at least six weeks of a break to have a similar effect again because your body can just do it. It's just not possible. And so it's also like an emotional and yeah. A shared thing. This might be a contentious question and it may be troublesome to give really specific details for some people, but have you seen any kind of drug interventions or sort of prevention initiatives going on here or elsewhere that you think went really badly or were really misguided in some way? Yes. I've been doing my work at a club once. I can't mention the club, but it wasn't about blank, but I can mention it. And a young gay man, I think he drank a lot of alcohol, which is always the worst when you do other substances. G and he was like knocked out and the door actually threw him out on the street and I got in a huge fight with the door I was like I'm working here and I can't work at a place where you treat people like this and I packed my things and I took my two volunteer colleagues and I was like it's over it's done and we're never coming back It was kind of a diva move, but you couldn't talk to the people in that moment. They were very focused on, he's ruining the party, and they just threw them out. So it's definitely a bad intervention, because if they knew how to treat people in this state, it would have been a different experience for all of us. So for me, as a social worker at the club, for the young men who got kicked out on the street, and as well for the club, because I think that it wasn't kind or caring, and I think that it can happen to a lot of people who are uninformed, and they just want to have the... best night of their lives or the best party ever as you said earlier and I think there was the support missing so afterwards there was a happy ending the guy is alright the man who got kicked out and actually I came back to the club like two months later and we sat down and talked and they did the safer clubbing afterwards. So it was a win-win in the end, but it got very dark at first, which I think wouldn't help. It helped, yeah, but I think that we could have handled things differently. better as a community that night. So that was definitely an example of intervention gone wrong. Yeah, I've heard of that happening with G-Cases elsewhere. I think the club's sometimes afraid of getting in trouble. So you're taking us to a very important point. I mean, the training of people working in... clubs is so important for setting the atmosphere in a club for getting people aware of basic care and don't treat people as badly as you as in your example one one reason why we can't really answer that question is because we don't have national programs for clubs we don't have one program we have hundreds of little initiatives, and that fragmented scene makes it impossible for people themselves who do the projects, but also for outsiders to judge if they work or not. So that also comes from the larger discourse. If we don't concentrate on coming out with good projects and roll them out, it's very hard to tell. what works. I could tell something more on your question. So one of the reasons we are setting up these side care services and festivals is also to fill this gap of the organizers that want to protect the image of their event and the medical staff who is in charge of all medical issues and is supposed to keep their capacities for real emergencies. and also the security staff who are supposed to create a safe atmosphere and to prevent people from climbing up stages. This is why we take care of these people who don't belong to one or the other. expert teams but they are still just having a bad time and might do silly things to themselves or others and we still notice that it's really hard to like get all the teams involved for example in events we experience Often that still many people are transferred to hospital, for example, because if the medical staff isn't informed well enough, they want to be on the safe side, which is completely fair because they are supposed to protect the lives of the people. And if we say, okay, we know these kind of cases, this person is probably going to wake up in an hour and then he or she is going to be completely fine. It's hard because we are not the professional team to... take responsibility for that kind of actions. And so there's still a lot of negative examples we experience in every season. And this is why we also need to just educate more. Educate all active people in a festival about what is going on and how to protect your visitors. Including the medics. very much this is a very much a thing in the UK scene as well with people being over hospitalized because of lack of understanding of what they're on but you were going to say something yeah on a positive note and there are a few parties in Berlin where there's a lot of fucking going on and sex and everyone has sex with everyone and there are like awareness teams like there are a few people from the staff of the club who go around and who just like, who are noticeable part of an awareness team where you can come to if you felt like you've been, if you have a bad party or if you have a bad trip or if you have been sexually harassed or anything because they want to create a safe environment. I think that's a very progressive good solution for parties where you know that there's a... a lot of people who want to do substances, that there is a kind of an awareness team at hand where they can go to or at the bar if they... have a code word. I think it was this year at a festival where you can say like, "Where's Angela?" and then they know that you're in trouble somehow and they take care of you. I think that's very great because it high-ends first of all the sense of community and the sense of that we're all partying together. We're all part of each other's happiness throughout the night or the weekend and it enables a safer environment. So I think that would be a step in the right direction for clubs and parties. I think so too. So training awareness teams, it also doesn't take a lot of experts. Of course you have to set up a little bit of training. But then it takes down the knowledge to people who really do what they do. So we can't have millions of social workers doing that stuff. No, but it's peer work. Yeah, it's peer work. There's one social worker and you can enhance and you can... provide information for the stuff, they become multiplicators and they go on and tell what they know and so it improves the awareness as a collective, I think. I think you've been talking about peers and I think, Manuel, you also described your role as being sort of peer-based in a lot of what you do. I found in my own research that the peer aspect was really, really important because almost the more people suspect you of being a professional, even if it's a fluffy kind of professional, the less they will trust you on. matters of drug use and kind of expressing that you are a peer can be a very very powerful tool for encouraging people to trust you and I don't know if you'd like to say more about kind of when you're doing work with drug users do you present yourself as a peer or like how does it affect the way you present yourself Well, it's pretty easy in my line of work because mostly I deal with gay men. So they know I'm gay and then they are talking all by themselves. And I think in the gay scene in Berlin, substances and sex and partying is so tight-knit. So it always comes to substances at one point when I interact with other people. So it's always pure work. And when I talk to, when they share about their use or what they like to take or whatever, I can decide if I feel comfortable because you always have to feel comfortable on both sides because I can't, I would never assume that I am the person who knows best because every person is their own expert, thank you, their own expert in what they're doing. So I can only give suggestions. or share my stories. Two years ago, I've been high on this and that and like, how about... drink some more water because I forgot to drink and it was a bad night but there's nothing more I can do than to offer a ear an ear yeah but it's always better if people feel that you talk to them on the same level and that's what I think we're all always doing yeah I'm not even sure if it's necessary to tell someone that you've had similar experiences as well. But since you've had that experience, you might be more accessible or more empathetic to that person which is undergoing a similar experience. So when we train our peers, we always leave this decision about what they want to share from their personal experience and their personal lives to strangers, of course. So everyone has to decide for themselves. It's about feeling comfortable, as you said. some find that it's helpful to get into this conversation and maybe exchange situations everyone has experienced. Or it can just be more helpful to understand the situation that a person is in. Or it can also inspire your ideas about... how to solve this situation. Maybe if you've... having memories in your mind of what has helped you or a friend of yourself, it might also help you to improve the situation of that guest you're dealing with. So I don't know if you experience it like I do, but in my experience, being a good listener and not talking all the time about your experience is... is a major thing. So if you don't have a concept in your head that everything that is surrounding drug use must lead to a bad end, you just listen to people and listen why they do it, how they do it, and then you could come in. I never talk to people actively about my own experience. I have talked about my first LSD experience on the radio and even on TV, but I never do it when I'm in a situation where somebody wants to share something because there's also that danger of... that drug heroism that some people have. I have this and that experience, and yours doesn't come close to mine or things like that. So I would be cautious with actively sharing. If people ask and you have something to share, that might help, yeah. Well, what you're saying is also true. I wouldn't hope if I was in a difficult situation, someone told me about the worst trip they've ever had. I think it's a thing that from watching various sitters do it while I was volunteering myself, like you're all saying, I think it has to be handled with care. Sometimes it just lets you intuit what to do. Sometimes just a few sentences about something that happened to you can make a massive difference. But also, I think there are all kinds of ways of conveying. that one is a peer without necessarily saying it in so many words. And that's kind of especially a thing in America because there is, especially at Burning Man, the awareness that anyone could be an undercover cop. So you have sitters who are sort of obliquely telling their... acid crisis stories very carefully to someone who maybe is insisting that he's just drunk even though he thinks he can manipulate chi or something like that. And there's this kind of saying things and not saying things that goes on. yeah you can usually get it across that you're a peer without necessarily saying it that bluntly or you could also cover it by saying like I've known someone who's undergone this and that experience and that person tried to do this and that. Maybe you want to try as well. It could possibly help you like in that way. Yeah, I've seen that used. Sometimes it's not, peer doesn't have to mean I am a fellow drug user. It can just mean I'm a festival person. I've been around a lot of people who have had. drug experiences. Like one of the best sitting experiences or cases that I witnessed, the lady in question, her teenage daughter had had a very similar bad trip that she'd seen her through some years ago. So she was able to use the experience from looking after her daughter to look after this young man. So appear as in bound up with the scene, not necessarily the other thing. I think there's also another... aspect when it comes to talking to people about their drug use and maybe supporting them or listening to them. There is a section of drug users who have most problems with drug use and cause a lot of problems for others. And these are often people who have a number of life issues going on or psychological disorders. And I think we need to be simply open for that. So when I talk to somebody, I'm interested in why I do what you do or what makes you happy. And often it is not drug use that makes people happy. Sometimes the way they're using drugs makes them more unhappy. although they are looking for that happiness in their drug use. So having an ear for a basic life problem that is not solved is very important because it might not be solved with the use in a certain club atmosphere. Absolutely. But since I'm working in clubs, there are not a lot of people who come and say, like, this is my problem, help me find a solution. So it's more like... I always try to have positive talks with people and positive interactions because I'm trying to respect their party because I'm working there, I'm sober, I'm working, but it's their party. And I always want people to allow themselves to have a good time. So I think that in other contexts, that's definitely a good talking point. but for my specific line of work, I think that that wouldn't work. I think it very much depends on the type of intervention you're doing. What you're saying would be very relevant for a psychedelic sitter, for instance. The kind of thing you're talking about in clubs is quite different. Here's the thing. Kind of if you could set up any kind of intervention for safer clubbing, safer nightlife, safer festivals, regardless of policy, like if there were no policy constraints or financial constraints, what do you think it would look like? I'm going to start and you can add if you like or change it. Thank you for starting. So it would be. a party that had at least one chill-out space, preferably outside with fresh air. And if it's cold outside, an indoor version as well, where people can relax with reduced sound level and places to lie down or sit down, which is comfortable. And people would have access to free water. Well, it's about the best case, right? So also access to some snacks like fruit or like salty snacks. And all staff would be... educated about what is important to have a good party so to be aware of like people's boundaries and not overstepping those and about drug use and what to take care of and would have an open eye for difficult situations of whatever kind so this refers to the staff at the bar and the wardrobe and the entrance and the security and everything. They might also have a short way to contact medical staff. Maybe even police in case sometimes people just show up and they are causing stress and you don't want them inside the club and they wouldn't leave so you need support from the outside but in the best case you would have like cops that won't like try to get into the club or something but cooperate on a fair level. Yeah, this is to start with. And I also think, I just thought about the entry fee and about prices in general. I would find it really romantic if it was possible to create parties with the principle of solidarity about prices, like referring to the entry fee and drinks and stuff, because if people really want to go out with their friends, but they are astute or whatever and don't have a lot of money, and then they already have to pay like 15 euros in the entrance. then they have to buy a lemonade for euros. It's just a whole lot of money. And so it would be interesting to try if it was possible that people that can afford to give more would pay more. So those who cannot would have access to a drink as well. It would be the best way. we didn't need drug checking because there was a legal way of how to take drugs and know what you're actually taking. But yeah, since this is quite far away, we would at least have a drug checking service in this party. Now we're getting into large scale policy, but yeah. It's like, let's build the best club ever, Utopia. I would just like to focus on one idea because I met a very interesting guy on a conference in Prague who is programming virtual reality applications. And in a club, in an ideal club that has everything that Manuela has been talking about, I would also like to see... a few virtual reality applications where people who can test a little bit of what the others might be doing. It's incredibly realistic what people can experience in these virtual reality applications. So some people might choose not to mix some drugs if they experience how the world looks like and feels like when they do it without. So we can have that kind of training in a club too. So like VR simulations? of a really bad experience. Yeah, why not? Good and bad. Yeah, I think, I guess, you'd be missing the sort of cognitive aspects, but at least you could get what it does to your senses. Yeah. So that's really interesting. How about you? Everything has been said. It's like a... great start so there's nothing more to add free condoms maybe I missed that part like information material like condoms and lube and snorting tubes and stuff would be necessary as well so just sort of give people the information and materials they need and let them sort it out for themselves The awareness team would answer questions in the club, but it's always great to take something with you when you get home and when you're bored after the party so you can read. Ah, okay. So how that works. So it's always good to have good information material like flyers. stuff like that. Something that's been really interesting for me about a lot of what you've said in this question and earlier on as well is a lot of the talk that happens about drug use in clubs focuses on the idea that clubbers are ignorant and they need our help to stop making terrible mistakes. Or, you know, if they heard about the risks, they would stop using drugs. But you've all focused on... The club owners and organizers and festival organizers being the people who really need education and awareness. And I find that quite refreshing. Like the idea that clubbers themselves are quite clued up. and quite responsible. There's nothing like the clobber. People are really different and there are really silly people out there. But silly people are people who have not made a certain experience or need more guidance from their friends or something like that. So there is nothing like the clobber. I wouldn't talk about that this way. I can only talk from my experience, my work experience, and I have really good experiences because I really do think that there are a lot of users out there in the Berlin scene that are very self-aware how to do the drugs, how to take care of themselves, and it's kind of an... self-empowerment really a thing if you are able to get the knowledge and to act after the knowledge you have to have a better party and to talk about it openly. So I really do think that there are a lot of well-educated people out there who get often mistreated by society. or mislabeled as abusers when they're actually users who are very self-aware and good at what they're doing. Yeah, that's what struck me as well. It's not so much that there is a characteristic clubber who is always right, so much as that the focus is so often on them being irresponsible, which causes those who are responsible to kind of get brushed under the carpet. Did we can ask you something back? So you're talking to three Germans. And so do you see cultural differences in... London or in Dublin where you come from? Would any of these questions have been answered differently in these countries? Yeah, definitely. Well, I don't have much experience of the Dublin scene because I kind of left before having any fun. Well, that's why you left probably. In large part, yeah. I think it seems as though my impression from tonight is that the conversation is more open here. I mean, people do talk about stuff in London, but there's a lot more kind of furtiveness about it. More sort of... I don't know, being afraid what you say or not necessarily articulating all this stuff. And probably more shame around things like sex clubs and queerness and stuff as well. So that's not quite so sort of refreshingly open. Well, I've heard that in London they do a lot of fucking on chemsex and stuff like that. Oh, they do. It's just all usually in private houses. That's kind of a problem that's developing in London at the moment because gentrification has closed down a lot of clubs, especially gay clubs. And there was more of a structure in place in areas of London, like Vauxhall, for instance, where there were a lot of kind of longstanding gay clubs. The railway arches are all getting sort of sold and the rent's too expensive now and a lot of the places clubs used to be are gone. So you have kind of the gay scene moving to parties in private homes. But the problem with that is that often it's rather unscrupulous dealers who are running the parties with sort of not much oversight and bad drugs. And there's kind of more opportunities for harm there, I think. It's not a scene I'm personally involved in, but I get the impression that there's this wider systemic thing where... The gentrification of the city has led to these health impacts in really unexpected ways. Yeah, kind of less openness in general. And that's one aspect of it. I think there are probably lots of other things as well. And we're also living in the Berlin bubble a little bit. Things look different in Hanover and in the north and the south. It's a world city that we're in. So we became a very open, we developed a very open discourse. Yeah, I'm getting that impression. It's good. I would like to come back to what you've said before about us talking a lot about the organizers and club owners. So I think it's important to make Thank you. forget that everyone is responsible for themselves and also for their friends maybe as well. So what we often find is when we set up our spaces in festivals, for example, that some people who already know this kind of psych care spaces in a certain event, for example, really rely on that. And so in the beginning of the festival, they come and get equipped with everything they need which is basically something we support but on the other hand we cannot be in every event ever and so we also try to be an inspiration and kind of a memory for people like to remind them of getting prepared before the party and before the festival. And so people should actually keep in mind that they should get some earplugs before they're going. to a party and not only rely on like that they're going that they will be able to receive it at the event so I just felt like this needs to be mentioned too that people still have to keep in mind like how to prepare themselves for the party And also to think of the time after the party, like, do I want to get home in a really messed up living room, for example? Or do I like to cook when I'm really wasted after the party? Or should I maybe prepare something in advance or prepare a number where I can... order some food or something like that. Yeah, so what I'm hearing is that the sort of harm reduction or psych care volunteers can't be everywhere, so they need to kind of pass on a set of skills that people can then use themselves. But it's just like intertwine. It's like it takes like, in this case, like... a lot of people to tango, not only two, but a lot. It takes the owners and the users and the club staff. So it's like a combination of everything. So if everyone is more self-aware, then everyone is having a better time. It's quite easy, actually. Yeah, and I'm still for pushing even the club owners a little bit to create those atmospheres because it will not come from simple appeal to their conscience. And there's also another problem that we have been talking about. In Berlin, a lot of the services that you guys give are given to the fancy clubs in the middle, in the center of Berlin. But there are a lot of other dancing clubs around where maybe more people than in the center are going to that don't get any attention because they're not so fancy people from... Other parts of the city are going to. So there's also social difference. in the attention that we provide. Definitely, but to answer for my project, it's quite simple. There are some clubs that don't want prevention at their clubs, so there's nothing we can do. So we can reach these people, unfortunately. We tried, but if they don't want us to be there, then it's done. That's where politics get in. It's unfortunately, but there still are maybe even these spaces that you mentioned, maybe these are the spaces who would need our help the most, but they're less active to talk about it more openly. So I don't know the reasons. But there are some places where we try to offer our work and prevention. It's always for free for the clubs. But if they don't want it, then they have their reasons. I just remembered. the story about the colleague you were telling. And that reminds me of something that I saw on a platform. Do you know Psychonaut Wiki? That's one of the information platforms. And one of our colleagues is the guy who creates Psychonaut Wiki. And we were just writing a text about that. And I found that over the last year, there were many months where not like those fancy drugs like DMT and psilocybin and new psychoactive substances that mimic those drugs were on top of the drugs that were searched for. But for many months, those almost one million people who are looking for information on the platform, we're looking for benzodiazepines, we're looking for prescription drugs, we're looking for novel psychoactive substances that mimic those prescription drugs. So I think we need to be aware of the fact that... but a lot of people are treating themselves with those drugs, treating their depression. And that comes with every party. So it's not only about having fun, ecstasy, and sex. It's also about turning away from basic life issues. It's both. We need to keep that alive, that awareness alive. I think sort of the combination of those things are touching on something really interesting. Like you mentioned the fancy clubs that might have prevention and the maybe less fancy ones that don't. And also this kind of discussion of people self-medicating maybe because life is hard. Something I was conscious of when I was doing my own research was how... A lot of these interventions end up, rightly or wrongly, getting to people who are better off in society. Like, festivals are expensive. Like, it's very expensive to go to Burning Man, for instance, especially. Very hot. Yeah. It's expensive to make sure you can stay cool at Burning Man. Just go naked. Yeah. Well, even so, you still need a shade structure, unless you want to be bright pink. Yeah, anyway, there's a social stratification thing going on there, and I was wondering about the people in the less. fancy clubs or who aren't going to festivals or who are trying to self-medicate because they're struggling in life in some way and I wonder how we could extend these interventions to other sectors of society. What I always tell myself is that prevention and harm reduction never can reach everyone. And it's always important to, it's not about how many people you reach, it's about the people that you reach that they take it in and try to maybe learn the tools that we try to give them. So you can never reach everyone. quite a huge challenge that will always fail, in my personal belief. Well, I guess if information was spread on a more mainstream level, it could reach more people. Like if we would provide... Maybe not provide so much tobacco ads, but some safer drug use. promotion or something, it would reach more people. So there are ways, but they're restricted by laws and stuff. I know that in other places of Europe, for example, there are organizations which also do harm reduction work in the free party scene, for example. where I think they reach a lot more people that might be shorter in money as well, for example. And of course, we haven't mentioned what needs to be said, always needs to be said, that drug education starts in school and starts in the media. And we need funding for that. And there are a number of projects that work. on a European level, but they are not rolled out. So every school starts to educate again with every generation of teachers. So it's not professionalized. It's not very well structured. But that's... Because we're in a phase, in a period in drug education that is still very much influenced by the prohibitionist paradigm, which is changing.
