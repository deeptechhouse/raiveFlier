Thank you. Thank you. Welcome to the Resident Advisor Critics Roundtable. Today we're going to be talking about some of our favorite tracks, albums, live shows, and dance floor moments of the past few months. My name is Aaron Coulthate. I'm RA's Editor-in-Chief, and I'm here with an all-star cast. We have Andrew Rice, our North American editor, visiting us from LA. Hi, Andrew. Hello. I have a list here titled things Andrew has been doing in London drinking natural wine at Brilliant Corners tick school night partying at Dawson's Superstore tick and complaining bitterly about weak IPAs Also tick. Care to expand on that last one? Was that a pun? IPAs should be 5% or more. And these pubs have IPAs that are like 3.5%. It's not a real beer. That for you is a session ale, I guess. Yes. It's not a true IPA. Have you found one that sort of slakes your thirst? No, not yet. No, okay. Well, we'll keep trying. I'm also delighted to be joined by Kiana Mickles. Hey. Our New York staff writer for her first ever Critics Roundtable. Hi, Kiana. Hey, what's up? How are you finding London so far? It's been cool, yeah. I went to Unit B1 this past weekend and just been hanging out pretty much since. Excellent. Last but by no means least, I have Marissa Seaton here, our esteemed news editor, taking some time out of the frying pan that is the RA News desk to jump into the Critics' Roundtable fire. Hi, Marissa. Am I like an egg in this scenario? Absolutely. On the frying pan? That's cool. I'm okay with that. Hello. Hello. Let's start by talking about some of our favourite tracks from the summer. Marissa, when I asked you to consider some things you'd like to talk about today, you said India Jordan, India Jordan and more India Jordan. So let's start by asking you about India Jordan. selected the Don't Stop My Love EP. This was such a feel-good record, wasn't it? Oh, yeah. There's a bit of MK in those chopped-up vocals, a bit of Todd Edwards in there. I guess, what were your highlights from this record, and how did you first come across it? I came across it on Twitter where like a really short clip was floating around and then I just DM'd India who I had not really been in contact with before being like can you please send me the full song I need to hear it right now that was the Don't Stop My Love vocal action first put out and then fell in love ever since. Yeah, I think that for me is definitely the standout tune from the EP. I read an interview with her where she said she hadn't worked with vocals, made an edit or chopped... before, which is pretty remarkable. Wild. I love Chopped vocals. And I think Local Action, the label this came out on, it's one of those consistent outlets that maybe doesn't get enough credit it deserves. Andrew, I know you're a fan. I am. I may be a bit biased because Tom Lee is the first person who ever gave me a professional writing job. I'm very close with him. But yeah, it's a great label. It feels very London specific. So a lot of the stuff that seems like big in the UK, like Finn or even Andy Jordan, wasn't necessarily. as big elsewhere, but I think the label is more understood now and they've been getting more worldwide hits in terms of small dance music hits. Yeah, that... Sorry, that Finn EP that came out, I guess, a month after India, the two of them, I've just had back-to-back pretty much all summer. Yeah, the Finn stuff has really been amazing and I feel like it's connecting with people more in the US now. Do you feel that the Dawn Richard records have... helped sort of expand. Yeah, definitely. They kind of gave the label a remit outside of dance music, you know. Yeah, all of the songs sort of have their own space that they just build. But the last two, definitely, you can hear her ambient beginnings. She used to run ambient rooms and I think released a compilation within the last year on that label. So it's just really nice to hear. after you have two really party-starting tracks to kick off the EP. So it's just a really strong, all-around, first-ever EP under India Jordan. And which track would you like to listen to today? I'd like to hear Through Lacuna. It's nice and floaty and good times all around. Thank you. Thank you. Nice. Well, Andrew, you've gone for Gabba Modus Operandi, their record, Hoxia, don't know if I'm actually pronouncing that right, which came out on the Shanghai label Subcult. This duo seems to be doing something that, if not fully unique, is very damn close. Could you tell us who they are and what kind of music they make? They're a duo from Indonesia and they make up-tempo club music that is influenced by Gabber and there are some like Gabber moments but it's more of just like a catch-all term for like fast drums. They make really intense kick drum heavy music with Indonesian instruments and specifically like a type of Indonesian folk and a type of Indonesian ritualistic like trance music which involves a lot of like droning notes and screaming so it's kind of this weird mix of like this indonesian traditional music gabber influenced dance music and like really abrasive instrumentation The track that I picked, which is called Semiton, Ten Ton, it features these rolling drums that come in in short blasts and then these crazy horns that sound kind of like they're decaying and detuned but really explosive. And my friend said that it sounded like an anxiety attack to her. It's kind of like my shit. Yeah, and I just like, you know, Gabber is kind of a big buzzword right now. Everyone's playing high-energy techno. A lot of techno producers are ending their sets with Gabber. But here's an act that's taking the idea of Gabber and doing something completely unique. Because it doesn't sound like other club music. It takes from their musical culture and background in a way that feels special and genuine. And there's just no music that sounds like it. So I'd like to ask you about what this duo is like live. You saw them at CTM in Berlin at the start of this year. I noticed they were on the bill at Berghain just before the Singelialis, MC Zoe and Duque. I remember looking back at that programming and thinking it was really cool. cool. What was that show like? I wasn't too familiar with them back then in February, actually, to be honest. And it was just really hectic. Like I went down there and it didn't sound like what I expected from Gabber, but it was really fast and super like. like hectic and I just felt really overwhelmed I remember looking like getting my phone looking at the schedule and seeing this name with Gabbard and I was like oh like um but it was memorable like it stuck with me and so when I got their records after I was like oh this is a really cool act and then I realized they're from Indonesia and everything that goes into their music and I was just like blown away I think that that EP that came out on Subcult is like one of the best records Subcult also just released a nice collab record featuring the Kenyan artist Slipback. It feels like it's definitely a label to watch. Yeah, Subcult started out mostly releasing club music from Asia, like the grime-influenced experimental club music scene, but the last year, everything has been essential. And it's still Asia-focused, but yeah, having Slipback collab with them is a good example of... The A&R, it's just an amazing label right now. Kiana, you've picked Layla Samir's No Music. Thanks for turning me on to this record. It's really excellent. How did Layla's music come onto your radar? Yeah, just like typical SoundCloud digging. I initially found it on DJ Mag's page. They shared her song Anxiety. And yeah, I think I was just like instantly drawn to like how dark it was. But with all of the drum patterns, it just was also very dense but danceable. The percussion's, yeah, really excellent. I really like the track 'Beginnings'. I saw Andrew Weatherall play that on his NTS show a little while back. So she's got some approval from the old guard. I'm going to talk about Shaka's 'Kizlotti Forever' and specifically the track 'Kizlotti People' which is my summer anthem. This will be my favourite techno tune of 2019. For those who haven't heard it, the track features sampled Russian pop lyrics over a 1:45+ kick. It was recorded by Shaka during a residency at the Guzloty Complex in St. Petersburg. Guzloty was a very well-respected club that closed early this year. So this record is kind of a tribute. And what I like about it is it's a meeting of two of Europe's most vibrant techno communities, namely Copenhagen and... St Petersburg. And it got me thinking about a very old Code 9 tweet along the lines of "why are there not more vocals in techno?" And that tweet is many years old but it still pops back into my head every now and then when I hear a track like this. Andrew you reviewed this one And we gave it an RA Recommend stamp. What did you find most appealing about it? I think in a world where, sorry, in a scene where techno is getting harder and harder and harder and more brutal, here's like a lighthearted version of it. It's still fast, it's heavy, but it has a fun vocal. It's a fun track. It has a positive mood. instead of just being bleak and dark. And I think it's really interesting too because even though it might seem silly to sample a Russian pop song, it's kind of an interesting interaction during a residency in Russia because Russia and the Russian-speaking world has such a crazy level of dance music pop that's different from EDM. It's more like what we would consider dance music with really bad vocals on top. And so for him to interact with... that is like really cool I think it's like making good use of a residency at somewhere because there is this tradition of super dancey housey Russian pop and he found a way to incorporate that in a way that really connected with everyone apparently. So now it's time to talk about some of our favorite albums of the summer Andrew you picked the Coyle reissued Gay Man's Guide to Safer Sex which is an extraordinary record. For people that are maybe new to Coil, haven't heard of them before, could you describe their legacy in three words? Well, we can just... I have it on the tip of my tongue. OK, I got it. I got it. Fucked gay electronics. Ah, that is... So someone on YouTube... Said the title track to this record sounds a bit like Enigma. And I was really confused because the commenter seemed to be suggesting that was a bad thing. You reviewed this record on RA. Tell us a bit why you've selected it. I've been a Coyle fan for a long time, since I was a teenager. And it was a track that I forgot about because Coyle's discography is very messy. They did all sorts of film soundtracks and really limited releases, and there's all these compilations. theme from the game man's guide to safer sex has kind of always been under the radar And so when I saw the reissue, I got excited. And then I heard it, and I was like, holy shit, I've got to put up with this track. And it just sounds really fresh. Coil has three phases. They have their first phase, which is kind of like dark synth pop and industrial. Their second phase, which is around this time, which is more like UK-style acid house, really psychedelic dance music. And then their third phase, which is new agey drone with Drew McDow And so this is kind of perfectly in the middle between number two and number three, where it's kind of like chugging house with like really new agey synths and nice vocals. And, you know, it's interesting because I thought this track just sounds like porn music, but acid house style. And it's soundtracks, an educational film. That was actually very important, especially in the UK, because it was one of the first films to educate gay men on how to have sex and presenting gay sex as normal. Like, the film is, I feel like if you're a gay man who knows the history, it's quite emotional because of how normalized everything is. But it talks about fetish sex and, like, you know, all the things you can do with a condom still. And it's not demonizing sex or even promiscuity. And it's just, And the fact that they had Coyle, who were some of the most active musicians in gay subculture, to soundtrack it, it's perfect. And Coyle's relationship with, I guess, nightclub culture is an interesting one. My favorite moment hearing Coyle on the dance floor was when Vladimir Ivkovic played Going Up as the last track of the night. Have you heard Coyle in the club? I've only heard the reissue track this summer, sadly. I've never seen it. about a mirror in person, so I've been deprived of dense look. Bye. Marisa, you've also gone for a reissue, Earth's Plantasia by Mort Garson. The premise of this record is a pretty fascinating one. Can you explain it to us? Yeah, I'd love to. Underneath the title on the cover, it says, Warm Earth Music for Plants and the People Who Love Them. And I was like, great, that's me. sold. And I had heard of this before it was reissued by Sacred Bones this year, but I kind of stayed away from it because I don't like when records are really expensive on Discogs or whatever. So it was really nice to finally listen to it this summer. So Mother Earth was this plant boutique in LA in the 70s and they had this promotion like buy a plant go home with a free record and this was that record and the shop owners wrote in this book called Mother Earth's Hassle-Free Indoor Plant Book which I would really like to get my hands on They wrote, it has been written, music soothes the savage breast. It also helps gentle little plants grow. So of course I'm going to love this. I guess my question is for you. Does it help gentle little plants grow? Have you tried it out? Well, I've been playing it a lot at home and I've been taking a lot of cuttings from my various walks around London. And some of them have sprouted roots and I have planted them and it's very satisfying. I really like how silly this record is because a lot of music, ambient music, can be like really serious and like sad and it just, it's very long. Whereas here you have songs that have track titles called Symphony for Spider Plants and You Don't Have to Walk a Begonia, which is probably the cutest song on the record. The download card that came with the vinyl has some wildflower seeds, is that right? Yeah, I thought that was a really nice touch. A really great job by Sacred Bones on that one and I can't wait to plant them next spring. Well, the question I'd like to ask everyone here is what other records would you recommend to make your plants grow? I would have to recommend the album 1000 Gex by 100 Gex. It fills me with life, so surely it would fill plants with life. What about you, Kiana? I really liked Vernian and Stryk. Hairline Fracture EP. I really enjoyed Smoking Guns specifically, which is just like, has like super buoyant drums and like acid-like synths that sound like they're just like shooting at you. And I don't know, I just like have been listening to it pretty much like for the past. couple of weeks just feeling like I'm walking through a metallic jungle it's great and here's me thinking that plants only liked ambient music it's very that's very narrow-minded of me, I think. How about some Ambient House? Yeah, Ambient House, totally. Yeah, I've been listening a lot to this Prism record, which is like one of those Japanese reissues from the past few years. Metronome Melody, which was originally out on 1995, and Sublime Records, which originally released it, repressed it again. and it's just really lovely, and my dog also likes it too. Shouts to Norm. Yes. I guess Briney knows another green world. It's an obvious one. I'd also say Hiroshi Yoshimura's Erin Resort, the A-side. I think the bird noises and running water would trick my plants into thinking they're in a lush forest and not a poorly ventilated flat in East London. And there's also a hieroglyphic being record from a few years back. of forking paths Belgian label called Audiomur and it's this really gnarly psychedelic synth record and it has very trippy artwork that kind of evokes the sun shining on some plants so Those are my selections. Kiana, your album pick is very much repping your hometown. It's Moment Ready, the NYC dance project. It's a very fun album. Those first choice samples somehow still feel fresh. Yeah, tell me a bit about how you came about that record and what your favorite tracks are. So yeah, I originally found... the album on SoundCloud. I saw two songs from the album and I was like, I have to look through the whole thing when I'm band camp. And it's really cool. It's basically an homage to House. It isn't super different. from his previous works, but it's still very nostalgic because it incorporates a lot of old school house classics and also some R&B edits from the early 2000s. So you have like Amarion on there and also Mary J. Blige, which is really cool. There are three songs, like this version may save lives, this version may heal, this version may go off, that are all sampling the all-time classic house track, Let No Man Put Us Under. Andrew, I know you're a fan of this record as well. Yes, indeed. I mean, it wears its influences very proudly on its sleeve. And I guess there's MoMA Ready and there's also the Ace MoMA collaboration. So it feels like it's quite an exciting little... Yeah, there's a good crop of younger producers in New York who are doing things that feel very much in line with classic house music, but it feels very energetic and fresh. And Ace MoMA, for example, has some old jungle throwback tracks as well, but everything just sounds so... Coming back to the word fresh, even when writing about Moment Ready, which I've done a few times now, I keep going back to the word fresh because everything is crisp and young and energetic. Yeah, he samples First Choice, which is for most producers at this point would be like a joke because it's so overused but somehow he makes it sound convincing like and he really taps into the the joyous like frenzy of original house music and also like early gospel house music i think there's a really infectious energy to his music so there's also ace mo and there's a track where they at which um in your review said if you what if you haven't heard it out have you really been out this summer i mean it's everywhere i heard that at panorama bar I've heard it at warehouse parties in LA, I've heard it in New York. I've heard it at a house party where my partner said to me, can you put that song on where they name all the girls? And I knew exactly what he was talking about. That's a very good sign. And what track would you like us to play, Kiana? This version may go off. It does go off. It does. We're going to talk about the Barker album, Utility, which came out in August. Sam Barker's current wave of releases sort of began with last year's Debiasing EP, a techno record with no kick drums. And on Utility, he kind of continues to pursue that concept. It's a really varied album. also aesthetically very crisp and tight, and Barker's fact mix was a very nice companion piece. I guess if there's another artist I was thinking about when I was listening to this album, it was actually Terence Dixon, a techno artist who's never really been overly reliant on kick drums. And there's one track of his called Fountain of Life, which was on a Tresor album from a few years back. that I absolutely adore and I found myself thinking about it when I was listening to the opening track on Utility which is called Paradise Engineering. So let's have a quick listen to Paradise Engineering. So now we're going to talk about some of our favorite live shows, dance floor moments etc of the summer and Kiana I want to start with you. You want to talk about the Melting Point Party in New York. It's a party I've been hearing a lot of good things about. So what is this party and what makes it special? We're in Melting Point NYC is a punk-leaning, party-organising and activist collective. And they've enlisted some of New York's most influential underground... DJs and artists in order to combat ICE. And so, yeah, all proceeds from their tickets are used to fundraise for the nonprofit organization, Old Relato. And the org provides direct legal services for deportees and migrants in Tijuana. And so, yeah, I went to their one year anniversary like a week or two ago. And it was really cool. It was done in the Market Hotel. So that's like a really cool multi room venue. So you would have like really like. acoustic noise in one room and then like techno slash reggaeton in another room and yeah so I listened to a set by Rue Bamba and I like ended up having to leave midway because I was like cramping dancing so much and I was like oh wait I haven't eaten So you mentioned before that you can't think of a single party that you went to this summer that wasn't oriented around a specific cause or platform or marginalized group. And it feels like that is definitely a global trend now. But New York especially has, I guess, a really healthy infrastructure of collectives and venues that are really pushing this forward. Yeah, I think we did a recent exchange that was talking a lot about this. Like here you have Pussy Palace, and that's all about supporting black and brown DJs and artists. In New York, we have parties like... Half Moon, which is really just about getting black and brown folks on radio and out in the clubs. And then you have Disc Cakes, which is like a queer-oriented, trans POC-oriented party. happens and yeah I think it's just like part of a mission to recenter voices that have previously been I guess like silenced or neglected in the scene yeah and then like with Melting Point about like We can party and, like, also do it ethically and, you know, think about the world and some of the social imbalances impacting our communities. I mean, just a couple of weeks ago, we ran a really great podcast from Cashew, who runs the Mamba Negra Night in Sao Paulo, which I think is another great example. Andrew, I guess your choice of event that you'd like to talk about also fits into this, you know, quite broadly. And that's Honcho Campout. Yeah, the Honcho Campout, it's a... a gay camping festival centered around dance music. But this year, there was a huge increase in queer people, so not just gay men, but trans people, non-binary people, lots of women. So it felt a lot different, a lot more inclusive this year. And one of the after-hours stages, which ran from midnight to 9 a.m., was curated by InTraining, which is a queer crew originally from Ohio. Now they're spread across Ohio and Pennsylvania. The main DJs are Kiernan Laveau, Father of Two, A. Dab, and Emick Silkman. And they had DJ'd previously, so they had DJ'd the year before, so they just curated the stage. But they had people like CCL, Davis Galvin, Farplane from Chicago, and Physical Therapy. And the atmosphere at the stage was like nothing I've ever experienced before. It was maybe like 50 people. The music tended to be very non-linear. Like, Physical Therapy was playing breakbeat tracks into pop tracks and lots of crazy blends and acapellas. CCL played like a Kate Bush extended... They're running up that hill at 7:00 AM and everyone's hugging each other and crying. And it's like every time there was a new track, people would be cheering and screaming. And it was like being in someone's living room, basically. It was really loose, fun atmosphere. And almost everyone playing was non-binary, which I thought was interesting. And it really did have an unusual energy. And most of the crowd was non-binary. And this was the stage for the queer kids. And the energy was unbelievable. I tend to roll my eyes when people talk about this kind of thing, like, oh my god, the dance floor was amazing, but this felt like something very special and unusual, and I just think it's proof of this newer wave, even, like, there's honcho, but there's in-training, and then all the kids they're bringing up, and it's this newer wave of people who are focused more on queer identity than gay identity, and the music that goes with it is unbelievable. very open-minded. Do you think that evolution or progression is kind of like part of a wider trend? Yeah, I think so. I think a lot of, you know, there's an older generation of gay men who only want to be around other gays. gay men, but I think people, especially in the music scene, are realizing that all the issues that gay men face are faced worse by people who are more marginalized, and it's worth including them. Everyone's happier if everyone's part of the same struggle and the same collective experience. So it feels much more, I don't want to say wholesome, but maybe much more whole. My selection is Hate Rock's live show at... Fold, which took place on September 6. Fold is a nightclub in East London, and the event was hosted by NTS Radio. So Hate Rock's a band that I've been captivated by for some time now, and it was great to see them perform live. They're from Australia, and they make music that's kind of informed by... things like post-punk and dub but it's not really any of those things it's very spacious and elegant and I was unsure how they would sound in a nightclub context they've played in clubs before including in London where they played in Corsica Studios many moons ago and that recording was published to vinyl a couple of years back but yeah they sounded great and It's a duo, Janine and Nigel, and they were kind of silhouetted against the shutters that let some light in at Fold. So with that and sort of smoke machine, like smoke curling through the air, set a really great atmosphere. And they played mostly tracks from their new album, Venus and Leo, as well as a couple of old classics, which was really nice. Andrew, you're a fan of hate rock. Am I right in saying that? Yes. Have you seen them perform live before? I haven't. But they're kind of like the platonic ideal of this dark, post-punky band. The best time to listen to them for me is walking on the street at night time with the headphones because the atmosphere is just amazing. I feel like it's weird to listen to them in daylight. Yeah, I think that's correct. Yeah, they definitely are. They have cultivated very much to dark kind of aesthetic very yeah very moody and i love uh cs and cream for the same reason which is a related group right yeah absolutely um this very nocturnal like slow drip kind of feeling with like it's atmospheric and reverby but like Yeah, and Conrad from CS, yeah, definitely makes really great music. And that record that came out on Trilogy Tapes not too long ago was definitely super nice. Which you played at Brilliant Corners. I did indeed. While I drank natural wine. Exactly. It's all coming full circle, isn't it? Nice. Marissa, you went to Nuit Sonore back in June. I did. Feels like a long time ago now. Yeah, it really does. Nuit Sonore takes place in Lyon in France. It's a beautiful city. Tell us a bit about your experience there. It's the culinary capital of France. What did you eat? Oh, boy. Well, when I wasn't at the festival. I went to a meal one night that was sort of like a Japanese-French fusion, but not in a cringey way. Like, it was a really delicious meal. And you can tell it was delicious because I didn't even, like, take a photo of it to, like, send out to be like, look at this incredible meal I'm eating. And then on the weekend, I, like, had the classic French bistro thing that was also super delicious. So it was nice to get the, like... Two sides of what Leon has to offer. Fantastic. Talking about two sides, you've got two selections. Peggy Goose and the Willikens Ivkovic back-to-back. So let's start with Peggy. I'm guessing that was a pretty hyped crowd. Oh, yeah. It was so contagious is the word. The main hall of... New Easton was a daytime venue. It's just probably one of the most well-done big spaces you could probably go to for a big festival like that. And the booth's in the middle of the floor. Around the side is a balcony, so sometimes you'll see other artists poking their heads out, seeing what's going on, which was really cool. I saw Marie Davidson. earlier that day, which was nice. She was very chic. And they also have lights going around that are just kind of like straight lines. It's very chic. I know it's kind of tired to tie French aesthetics to chicness, but I mean, they're doing it. So, yeah, I was just really blown away by that main room and she had it buzzing. My friend had left that day a little bit early because we had a long week ahead and I was like, cool, I'll hang around, I'll see how much of this set before I head out too and I just ended up getting stuck in for like the full hour and a half, two hours. And it was just so fun. She kind of journeyed through acid and threw in some hip-hop, and then she played a track from her newest EP, Starry Night. I think it was Handpan. And then, yeah, she ended on an Aphex track, and people were just kind of like, whoa, what did we just do? So she's like, you could feel the star power. in that room and it's like if you weren't convinced before like it's completely obvious why she's one of like the most sought-after names on the festival circuit. Did you see many people wearing Have a Goo Time shirts? Oh yeah, I was pretty jealous. They look really nice because you know they're made by Nike and I was sort of in the back on the fringes and then as people were moving out from the center like totally sweaty they were still had the just goo it or whatever shirt she was handing out during her set so I wish I had worn my way up a little bit for one. Nice and the other selection was Vladimir Ivkovic and Lena Willikens back to back so paint us a picture when did this set happen? context of the festival and what was it like? Right, so like Peggy, Lena is one of the daytime curators that they have for their four days at the La Sucre, which is along the river in the, I think they call it like the fake peninsula in the center of the city. And so Peggy happened at the end of the day, whereas Vlad and Lena sort of started early on. in the main room, it wasn't that full yet because you know, like not everyone's there when doors open and they kind of really took advantage of that and it worked like it didn't feel misplaced or like they were playing at the wrong time. They sort of just like took their time as they do and they built up the energy and then sure enough like the room had filled out by the time the set was over. And I was really sad to see it end because I felt like I really got into it. Everyone was sort of dancing at a respectable distance from each other. Everyone really had a lot of time. Everyone had a lot of space to move while they're playing their classic slow chuggers. It was really banging, but it was also kind of like... spacey and it felt like you're kind of moving walking through a pool almost which was a funny sensation well they posted this mix on soundcloud not that long ago so i've had the chance to listen back to it and it's yeah it's fantastic like yeah i keep going back to it and it's still I can feel myself in the room, but also then it suits the context of whatever I'm doing too, which is kind of, how does that happen? Yeah, I mean, it's really textbook Vladimir and Lena, very slow and atmospheric. And I think you can see when they DJ together what an amazing rapport they have as friends. You really get a sense of that when they're playing. you know, smiling, chain smoking together, working through this like, yeah, these crates of amazing records. I mean, yeah, I feel like a typical Vlad and Elena set will have, you know, obviously a fair share of tracks that are maybe played at the wrong speed. I remember when I interviewed Vladimir for an Art of DJing feature, he referred to the galaxies that open up when you play something from 40. at 33 and I just love the way he described that and I feel like they draw on a lot of classic UK stuff Warp and Reflex sort of IDM records and I think there's also a wave of newer of contemporary artists who are making music that is really slow and fits into their kind of sets Lurker is one example. I think the stuff that he's making is really prime for these kind of slow, chuggy sets that still have an energy to them. Yeah, it wasn't... When I had heard about their standard feel for their sets, I was kind of sceptical. I'm like, I don't know how this will work in the daytime, but yeah, I was totally on board. I have a friend who's obsessed with Vladimir Ilyich. Yeah, that's totally their vibe. Like, behind the decks, they're kind of just, like, swaying, and they're smoking, and then they're just kind of, like, smirking to themselves. And then the... Oh, wow, yeah. He really fits the bill. There was one point at the end of the set where they were about to hand over to Donato Dazi, but something wasn't quite right, I think, with Dazi's decks. And so the only time when you could see them maybe slightly, I wouldn't even call it losing their cool, but close, was when I think they probably had to play another track or what I assumed. was happening and Lena kind of once they she had mixed in she looked at Vlad and kind of like wiped like pretended to wipe her eyebrow and then they hugged and it was really sweet it was nice to catch that Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
