You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour. This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. The Hour is RA's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. Coming up on this month's show, Steffi is about to release her next album and she'll be talking to us about her creative process. We also have a piece we've been calling Worst DJ Sets. We have a string of DJs, including Tiga, Lena Willikens, and Jamie326, talking about nightmare experiences behind the decks. I was about to play at Panorama Bar playing after Mike Dunn. There was four USBs in the four CDJs and of course I pulled out the one that was playing on his very last track and he was like, oh, and you know, I was mortified. But we're going to open on a breezier note by asking a bunch of RA staff members what their thoughts are. favorite festival was from this past summer. Marika May over in our LA office is going to get the ball rolling. Nakdigi Tal exceeded my expectations and was my favorite one of the summer. I think the reason why it was so special was because the festival emphasized the hangout aspect of the weekend and everyone gets to the grounds around 3 p.m. on Friday, but the music doesn't start till about 8 p.m., which allows you to settle in, meet your neighbors, grab some drinks, and truly arrive at the festival. All my memories of the weekend are vignettes or hangout moments with my family. friends which I thought was very special and unique to Nocti. I'm Stephen Sitmus and I'm a staff writer at Resident Advisor and my pick for the year is Howlton Festival. So Howlton Festival was good for a number of reasons. Number one it had a 24-hour license so the music didn't stop, it was amazing weather, the sound systems were excellent and perhaps most importantly It was one of those events where everything seemed to come together at the right moment. It was just a perfect storm. One of the most unique things about it was the fact that people were playing extremely long sets. Craig Richards himself played for 20 hours in total. and DJs were often playing five-hour sets, often playing two or three sets amongst the weekend. So it was a really unique way to see a lot of DJs doing their thing in the perfect surroundings. For a first event, it was really remarkable how well it went. Hello, my name's Georgina. I work in the ticketing team here at RA. I get to go to a lot of festivals each summer, and so it's probably easy to get quite jaded with a few, but Love International... Croatia holds a special kind of magic for me. It has the three Bs, the beach, boat parties and Barbarellas, which I think is one of the best clubs in the world. Watching the sunrise while you're at Barbarellas every morning is incredible. Also some amazing sunrise sets this year. Gideon and Craig Richards playing reggae on the beach between like six and midday in the morning was amazing. And Tisno is such a beautiful location that you end up coming back feeling like you've had a holiday as well as an amazing festival, which is quite a luxury compared to coming back from most of the festivals. Hi, my name is Connor and I work on the marketing team here at RA. Yeah, I went out to Atlas Electronic Festival in Morocco at the tail end of August. I guess there's a bit of a spotlight on Morocco as a new festival destination in recent years. So Atlas takes place at a place called Villa Yana, an eco-villa which is located about 20 minutes outside Marrakech in the desert. I guess what sets Atlas apart from the others is its holistic approach to production. It's got a really small crowd and preserving this communal atmosphere is really important to them. There's a whole cast of popular international DJs like Venue Afo, Shanty Celeste and Midland. But Atlas is really about providing African artists with a platform and showcasing their music. Take Adekak. the popular Ghanaian artist. He performed his debut live show with his band on African soil. So other groups like Group Bana, Amazon Blues and a whole cast of local DJs from Casablanca all showcasing this Gnawa sound which is like a popular strain of North African music which is almost trans-like in its qualities. It was like a window into a whole new world. I'm Ray Philp and I'm a reviews editor at Resident Advisor. Earlier this year I went to LEV Festival. which is in Gion in Spain. It's basically an audiovisual festival that I found really impressive and I came away from it thinking of it as a good example of a local festival that instead of booking a lot of hot headliners simply tries to offer a distinctive experience. I'm Amy, I work on the festival partnerships team here at RA and my favourite festival... year was Nyenge Nenge in Uganda. It takes place at the Nile Discovery Beach at a little resort called Jinja which is actually the source of the Nile. So just imagine like Jurassic Park vibes and like an open air. Festival's set with four stages across the entire thing. Musically, it's a broad range of talent from across East Africa. Also a sprinkling of European artists as well, just to keep the mixture nice and interesting. One particular highlight was an electro-okoli artist from Uganda called Otim. He's also on the Nyenge Nyenge label and he's playing at Unsound, I think, in October. So yeah, keep an eye out for him. And then a local Kampala artist. DJ Campire, she was amazing. I loved Nyanga Nyanga because it was just really powerful to see people put on festivals in countries and places that simply don't have the infrastructure to do it. I think we just take it for granted in Europe that it's a lot easier to put festivals on when you've got the resources and the infrastructure all set up. So yeah, big ups Nyanga Nyanga crew. I'm Nick Baird, head of Festival Partnership. at RA and I just got back from Labyrinth Festival in Japan which I absolutely loved. You've got this beautiful setting up in the mountains. This incredible sound system, wonderfully understated production and set design. Stage is like really minimally lit. There's no flashing lights. The dance floor is completely pitch black, so it creates this really focused, almost like menacing dance floor experience if you want it. The crowd were all absolutely amazing. There's this real like rave atmosphere going through it the whole time. All the artists absolutely brought their A game and it's kind of curated so it all builds up towards this final set which Peter van Hoosen played. And I have to say, I think that was, in 20 years of going to festivals, the best techno set I've ever seen. It capped off a really, really special weekend. Okay, I'm now going to hand over to Matt McDermott, RA's LA-based staff writer, to introduce our next feature. How about when you don't kill it? That's the question Tiga asked in a Facebook post a few months ago after a DJ gig in Rome went badly. Right now, that post has about 30,000 likes and 3,500 shares, so it's safe to say it struck a chord. So Tiga, you've obviously thought a lot about DJing. Yeah. And from a philosophy standpoint, it kind of goes along with the note that you posted on social media after the Rome gig. It seems like DJing to you is about being selfless. And part of that is recognizing when you just didn't connect with the crowd. Do you agree with that? Yeah, well, I mean, I think I think a lot, you know, I'm a I think about things a lot and well with DJing I guess it's like a lot of things it's like when it when it all connects and everything works out well and you kind of get all the answers you know and there's not that much to think about in this and for whatever reason and there's a lot of reasons when things don't quite connect then there's a lot of questions you know and your mind's kind of racing and I think anybody who were kind of working works on a craft. It could also be like an athlete. I think anybody who does something a lot, you know thousands and thousands of times You know you hopefully you learn to see the patterns you learn to to fine-tune What makes things work and what doesn't and you learn also to you kind of analyze what happened you and hopefully you start to learn why things happen I think the selfless thing. I don't know I can only speak for myself. I just I know simply put like the less I think while I'm DJing, the better it is. The less I'm thinking about it and talking about it generally, that's the better the performance was. You know, if I'm actually thinking when I'm up there, if I have any time to analyze it, there's probably something going wrong. And what led you to write the note after the Rome gig? That was the night where you were thinking a lot. The funny thing with the Rome party is, I mean, the party was fine. From the outside looking in, it was like a 7.5. It wasn't really... disaster. It was actually funny because my friend who was with me, like who took the picture and stuff, you know, everyone was asking him after. Because the reaction of the post was so massive, it was so funny, man. I had people coming up to me as if, you know, like hugging me as if I had just survived a war or something. But my friend, everyone was asking him like privately, like, was it really so bad? Is Tigo okay? And he was like, it was fine. Like, I didn't even notice anything, you know, which was kind of, which was a little bit the point was. It wasn't about, sometimes there are no fireworks to announce that it didn't work. It was more about that internal feeling of when you're a little bit the weak link. And what led me to post on that night, I don't know. I'm not really a consistent social media guy. I don't really... I've wrestled with it in the past with, I guess, how much to reveal, you know, how much to share. I'm not quite private by nature. And that particular case, I was just like, I don't know, I was kind of upset. I've been DJing for 25 years and... Thousands and thousands of shows, I know the pattern. And sometimes you're upset, you're a bit disappointed about your performance. And that particular night, I don't know why, I just, I don't know, I wanted to express it. Showing a bit of brutal honesty in this case seemed to resonate. Can you talk a little bit about the response you received after the note? The level of support from, not just from kind of fans or the public, but for DJs was, that I was pretty, I couldn't believe it. I mean, it was like a who's who. I was getting letters from like Derek May, you know, like. And I mean, it was just DJs of every strata and scene and whatever were really, I think essentially almost every DJ was like, yes, you know, like they all knew the feeling. So I think everyone felt quite unified. I loved it. I mean, I was, I was quite touched actually. Like I was quite overwhelmed by how. behind the reaction was, like how supportive it was. It was really, it really turned into a little bit of like a kind of a happy story you know like it was quite it seemed to only bring out nice feelings you know they're like both in the comments and the feeling when when you're 100% honest and then it's when it's also then received really well and it was just probably more than anything what it touched on is that everyone kind of wants that you know That feeling is more scarce right now than the feeling of the fisheye lens with 100,000 people screaming your name and the fireworks. You know, we're all being bombarded constantly by what appears to be these perfect lives where everything is impossibly amazing all the time. And we all, everybody probably feels a bit, you know, we all. probably think, well, how much of that is bullshit? How much of that is real? And also the pressure you're under, whether it's implied or whatever, you know, the pressure you're under as a public person to not reveal weakness, you know, to not show the cracks. And that's insane. I mean, it's like I, you know, you actually get managers and PR people and teams, you know, telling you not to show weakness, you know, not to say a party wasn't good or not. You know, it's all in the camera work and the angles and the smoke and mirrors. It's a numbers game now. People are scared of anything that might, let's say, influence the stock price. Well, Tiga's note had a lot to do with the ideal portrayal of life and art that's required by social media, as well as the DJ's responsibility to connect with the crowd. It also made me remember that one of the best things about going out is that you never know what's going to happen. Sometimes things go wrong. Sometimes it's your fault. Sometimes it's someone else's. And sometimes it's pretty damn funny. We thought we'd open up the floor to some of our favorite DJs, asking them about a memorably bad night behind the decks. The answers range from the comic to the poignant. I'm laughing because while I was waiting for you, I started telling the story a little bit to my girlfriend. And it was like just the opening line just had me fucking laughing. I called up veteran Chicago DJ and disco edit master Jamie 326 to talk about his experiences. Basically, it started off like this. I'm 21. I met this couple. Me and my cousin met these girls at this club we used to go party at. They asked me to DJ their New Year's Eve party in their loft. So I was like, OK, cool, no problem. And I do the party, you know, it really starts rocking. And then some of my other friends come through. So, of course, now, you know, it's New Year's Eve. You know, they can't really leave because in Chicago, to strike at midnight, people shoot their guns in the air. You want to be indoors somewhere by midnight. So they ended up being stuck with me. My friend got mad because... Because of the party situation, he wouldn't let me use his records. I had just made a mix. So at home, like the night before, before. So I basically had to play a mix and I was pretending like I was spinning and it went good for a while. They didn't know what was going on until one of the girls came over there. She was like, are you playing a tape? And I was like, it's just, you know, I was like, it's just an edit. You know, it's... It's just an edit I'm playing. So I went back and I kept on, you know, playing this mix. So then what I had to do, because I had to flip the tape over, I would play a record, you know, and I would blend the tape, you know, back in, you know, and play it off that way. So after The night was supposed to go well into the morning. I had to play this tape a few times. So then they really noticing what's going on because they're in the same fucking mix. Trying to get paid from these chicks who don't want to pay me because I had to skirt and dodge around paying. Then my friend pulls the power on the equipment because... They're not paying so we ended up in there till about 7:00 in the morning trying to get paid Then we had to carry all this equipment down, you know and break everything down You know the full sound system down and all of that and of course, you know You got people who didn't get paid or know they're not getting paid and then they spent New Year's Eve with me So, you know, they were happy with me quiet ride home. Now this is where part two comes in. I'm like man you know I gotta make some money you know I gotta take care of my gas regardless I gotta take care. So there were these girls I knew that would always throw like parties in the house you know with the with the gangs. I did this party for them before so I was like hey happy new year you know y'all wanna have a party. And they were down. So we ended up doing this party in the basement of like this interesting house. I got the party and I came over there and we set the equipment up and it was like our house. And we brought like a mobile sound system with bass bottoms and all of that. When I would play there, it's like dust from the... the ceiling from the floorboards would fall. One of the hottest tracks that kids, you know, the younger crowds really liked was Cashmere, the percolator. And this is like before when it was still underground. They kept requesting it. I played the percolator 25 times and they went every time I played it. I'm mixing, I'm spinning. Said stuff is falling out the ceiling. But while I'm queuing up a record, a roach falls out the ceiling and falls right on the fucking record. You know, it scared the hell out of me. I'm like, ah! You know, on the fucking turntable. It still was fun, man. I done up. Little interesting events and gigs, but the new year, you know, from 1992 to '93 most definitely started off very interesting and, you know, I took some, took some risks to take care of my boys. It's time for the percolator. It's time for the percolator. It's time for the percolator. It's time for the percolator. It's time for the percolator. It's time for the percolator. It's time for the percolator. It's time for the percolator. It's time for the percolator. It's time for the percolator. She's since built an international reputation for her fearless style. She shared with us a story about the worst 10 minutes of her DJ career. So you asked me to tell you the story of my worst gig ever. And it was while I was playing at Villers-Souigniques in Paris. And I had like a really bad cold. So while the plane was going down, I felt really terrible pain in my right ear. When we landed in Paris, I couldn't hear. My right ear was dead. I couldn't hear anything. anymore. Bought the most strongest ear drops from the pharmacy. I had to go directly to the stage. Five minutes before I had to play suddenly a huge crowd appeared full of expectations. Suddenly I had I would say thousands of people. I felt so nervous that I just took the USB from the DJ before. me. I just took it out and the CDJ has an emergency mode so it produces an emergency loop which is four beats long which is quite boring. And so I started my set basically with an emergency loop of the last track from the DJ before me. It had nothing to do with the music I planned to play and it was totally the wrong BPM. So I was super struggling with like what playing next and the first 10 minutes were like a catastrophe for me. I felt super insecure just right before I the 10 minutes just like short before I felt like okay now I'm getting more and more into it the electricity broke down totally silent and I thought okay they might fix it soon so I was on stage waiting and was silent, silent for almost five minutes, which is a really long time when like people watching you and people are full of expectations and you just stand there and you have no tools to make them move. But within these five minutes I was able to completely reset my brain to calm down, getting more confident in a way. So after five minutes silence and the crowd was still there, I could just start from zero. This is a story with a happy end. These were like the, I would say, the most terrible 10 minutes of my DJ life. Lena's story starts to pick out some of the issues that can contribute to a bad DJ set, whether that's technical problems, health issues, or just plain nerves. Here's New York City veteran Kim Ann Foxman. Well, I have to be honest, since I started DJing, I've had so many DJ sets that have felt like they went really bad or, you know, that I just suck. A lot of times it's simply just because, you know, I felt really uncomfortable. And most of these times it's due to technical difficulties. Like, you know, the turntables keep skipping and everyone's staring at you like, what the hell? Or it's just really hard to hear. And I've had that so many times, like when your monitors go out or when there's this really big delay between what you're hearing in the booth and what's actually going on on the floor. This one time I was like, oh, I'm going to go to my storage and like pull out a whole bunch of old records to find new stuff that I can put. into a live set on the radio. But I didn't get to practice. I didn't get to know the songs well enough. My mixing was like really sloppy and it was recorded and I was like no! Some gigs I just felt like that was off to a rough start. Like for example at Fabric once I was coming on and this track Break Night was playing. And that's a track that really gets people in the zone. And I was wearing a long sleeve sweater that night and my sleeve got stuck on the needle of the turntable and it dragged it along the record. It was like... It was like so slow. And yeah, what a grand entrance. But I just laughed it off. I was like, oops. And I didn't take it seriously. And I just, you know, I just kept going. I didn't let it knock me down. By this time I was, you know, much more well-seasoned with so many horrible experiences and good experiences in the past that I knew just to shake it off and like not let it ruin the rest of my time. Here's Chris Cruz. He's the founder of LA's most infamous gay party, Spotlight, and he's a rising DJ himself. One of the stranger DJ gigs that I've had was, I was pretty much first starting out, this was quite a few years ago, and I just happened to be in New York City at the time, and my friend was there, and he said, you should play this party tonight. It's really fun. It's a bunch of hip, young, queer, fashionable kids and a cool art party. And it would be really good for you. And I'm going to get you a slot. I said, cool, great. That sounds wonderful. So I spent that evening going through my laptop. Looking for songs that would be really cool to play for this audience. Maybe some gay cruising anthems from the 70s. Stuff that made me think of New York. Pet Shop Boys. High Energy stuff. Sylvester. stuff that I thought people would get, you know, and be really into. And I was burning these to CDs because this was for USB sticks and we went to the club. We get there and we open the door and it is blasting Black Eyed Peas, My Humps, and the dance floor is going off. And I like, my heart sank because I knew I brought all the wrong stuff. The resident DJ said, okay, jump on one song. So I put my CD and I knew I had burned one pop song. It was Justin Timberlake. I think it was the DFA remix of Justin Timberlake. And I pressed play on that. And then I mixed in two more songs. And by then the entire dance floor. had completely left and they were all at the bar. So I was pretty much all by myself trying to like look cool, dancing to some gay 70s disco, scanning the room looking for anybody else who might be into it. And I did, I caught somebody's eye. And they walked over and they said, hey, do you have any black eyed peas? I was like, I think I've already played black eyed peas tonight. And they said, yeah, but like, it's my birthday. Like, can you just play some more black eyed peas? So I went over to the resident DJ who was at the bar drinking and I said, I think you probably have a better handle on this dance floor than I do. Maybe you want to get back on. and he looked at me and he kind of rolled his eyes and he took a long swig of like the rest of his drink and went back over to the booth. He put in his CD and he hit play and it was these familiar bells. It was Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas is You. And the entire bar, everybody stormed the dance floor and just started going off. I stood there watching this New York City, downtown, hip, young, queer, fashionable crowd going completely nuts. for this Christmas song in August. I was just asking myself like these deep questions about myself and about DJing and what's the point of me. But you know, then I don't know. I looked over and I saw some cute kids and they're having fun and I thought, you know, if I can't beat them, I might as well join them. So I went over. And I danced, and I had a pretty decent time. You know, looking back, I'm still, like, proud of what I brought. I thought it was, like, good. But I'm also glad there was somebody else who was there who was able to give those kids what they wanted that night. Danny Wang founded Ballyhoo Records in 1993 and continues to play DJ sets that are brimming with disco exuberance and musicality. He told us about a case of DJ déjà vu he experienced at a gig in Mexico. This is DJ Daniel Wang. Some of you know me. I'm originally from California. Lived in New York for about 10 years, now in Berlin for about 15 years. I made some records from the 90s into the 2000s. 2000s, sort of retro house disco with some electronic elements. So I've been asked to talk about my DJ gigs that failed, which is, of course, a funny topic. And I definitely have my share of those. I think that's okay. It's part of the territory. We all like a challenge to convince people that maybe they're hearing something in your set that they didn't hear before or didn't know, and they learn to like it or enjoy it. But definitely, I find myself in that situation sometimes. And then there are definitely those gigs that don't work out for mostly technical reasons. And that means the club hasn't set up the monitors in the booth correctly, so you can't hear yourself mix. Or maybe the acoustics in that particular space are just really bad, and the sound is bouncing around against a tile wall behind your DJ booth, for example. If those things don't go well, it's not a surprise. There's not much you can do about it. But of all the gigs of mine which didn't work so well, one of them definitely stands out in my memory. It was maybe about six or seven or eight years ago now, and that was in Guadalajara, Mexico. I was invited by Red Bull Music Academy to do a little talk there. And then, to make it worth my while, they connected me to a gig in a nearby sort of underground club bar, not very big. So the talk went pretty well. I was just talking about the history of house music, and the crowd is kind of, you know, intellectual, student, sort of culturally interested, so I could talk about... like Paradise Garage and, you know, The Saint and how New York disco and Chicago house evolved into electronic music as we knew it after the mid-90s to the 2000s. But then afterwards, I always think I want to play my little unique mix of New York disco and house and, you know, retro sound with the violins. wah-wah guitars, but also with synth arpeggios and interesting elements. So we went to the bar and as soon as I started playing, literally, I started having the funny feeling that something was wrong. You know, like if somebody has farted in the club and nobody knows who farted but everybody is giggling? You know, that kind of weird feeling. But it was my music. And the more I played about half an hour, an hour into it, the more I was thinking, there's something really wrong here. I'm playing all the wrong music. People are not really reacting. In fact, they're kind of sneering and kind of laughing at me. So after about an hour, an hour and a half, I told the club owner, I think I'm playing the wrong music. I think people are not into this at all. And he said, yeah, something, you know, they're expecting that you're from Berlin and you're going to play electronic music. And the next DJ went on and just played straight up typical kind of commercial. slightly monotonous club electronic music and the whole crowd just went off and had a great time. I did feel like, oh, what have I done? You know, how could things have gone so wrong? And then I... thought about it afterwards and I had this realization. I suddenly flashed back to my 21-year-old self in San Francisco and this is the kind of profound part. I had this roommate from Nicaragua who had a lot of friends from Central America, Mexico, and they used to go out to this gay bar called Esta Noche, Tonight. where the few times I went, they were playing super classic 70s disco. It was like Alec Constantino's and Michael Zeger band Let's All Chant and, you know, Catmandu, The Break and all these records on TK and Casablanca. And I remember being 21 at the time and being really into that New York electronic kind of deep sound like. Burrell Brothers, New Groove, Strictly Rhythm, Nervous Records. And I remember going to that club and listening to all those violins and guitars and everything, thinking, this is kind of groovy, but it's kind of cheesy. And all these old Mexican queens are going off on it, and they're laughing and cackling, having a good time. And I just want to hear some Deep House. And I suddenly realized that... at age, what, 42 or 43, I had become that old DJ in that old Mexican gay bar in the Mission District in San Francisco. And I was looking at versions of myself at age 20 or 21, all these young Mexican, mostly male audience members who were expecting German, modern European electronic music. And they were hearing me play Wabba guitars and they just found it pretty ridiculous. For me, it was a lesson and I felt just as ridiculous and I still kind of laugh at myself about it. Another funny thing that happened pretty recently was I was about to play at Panorama Bar. And I was playing after Mike Dunn. I was so excited to hear him play and he like totally killed it. I'm a big fan of his and, you know, I collect his records. I love his productions. So I was really excited to play after him. And, you know, he's on his last track and there's four USBs in the four CDJs. And of course I pulled out the one that was playing on his very last track. And so that was a very awkward silence. And he was like, Oh, and like, I was like, was like oh my god I am so sorry you know I was mortified um but you know I've learned in these kinds of situations to just sort of cheer so I was like yay and like everyone kind of like cheered and I do find that like cheering is infectious so like if you cheer everyone cheers so if something goes wrong um just have a good attitude and like Try that. But you know, I think these experiences, they make you a better DJ because you have to learn how to deal with these kinds of situations and not get totally bent out of shape. Don't let that DJ mixer intimidate you that you haven't played on before. Think of it as exciting or You know, if the power goes out all of a sudden, don't get all salty. It's not your fault. Like, you know, whatever. The best advice I could give to anyone who might be in one of these situations, feeling, you know, bent out of shape or uncomfortable or something goes wrong. is don't let that moment throw you off because you have the rest of the set ahead of you. You know, we're all human. We all make mistakes. Brush it off. Like, don't get stuck on it. Move on because the faster you move on from it, so will everyone else, you know? And just stay present and stay positive. Listening to all these stories, you get a greater sense of each DJ's personality than you would from, say, a thank you note posted after an amazing gig. Perfection is pretty boring if you think about it. When the power goes out, people cheer. And if the DJ brings it back with a perfect song, it's an ecstatic moment. We can all relate to these stories, whether we DJ or not. What really matters is how you react when things don't go your way. And if you can't laugh at yourself... probably taking it too seriously. Here's Tika with some last words. Don't forget, you know, this is showbiz and it's entertainment and everyone wants some of that illusion. But I think most people understand and most people know that. When you get down to a truth, when you find something and you articulate it properly, it almost always really does connect with people for the simple reason that it's true. Thank you. Thank you. Steffi is returning this month with her third album for Oscar Ton, which is called World of the Waking State. The album finds her in a moment of musical transition as she moves from the straighter house beats and vocals of her previous records towards instrumental tracks with broken beats. and melancholic moods. We've always found Steffi to be a direct and honest interview subject, so we invited her over to our Berlin studio to tell Matt Unicombe about her current creative headspace. Steffi, this album has a pretty hypnotic sound, especially compared to your previous work. Did you start meditating? No, no, it was not the case. Did you start meditating? Well, it's a pretty meditative album. Oh, okay. Yeah, I think it's subjective, you know, it's like it can be interpreted by different people with different mindsets. So I guess everybody has a different feeling when they listen to it. What kind of feelings did you have? you have while making the tracks? I was very excited, very excited to see what came out. Like my goal was to just lock myself into the studio for six weeks to do all the drafts basically and not to have any connection with previous works or a specific goal, just like free falling and not restrict. to tempo, dance floor, all that kind of stuff that you can have in mind. I've had things in mind before, like when I did Yours and Mine, it was definitely a vision that I had for that album. And also Power of Anonymity was something that I wrote to have in my own DJ bag. Although it was very diverse and some of the stuff wasn't really something that would people would play, I would actually want it to be in my DJ sets. So that was my thing for those two albums. And the third one, I was like, I just want to go headfirst, dive into the vibe and see what happens, you know? What kind of headspace do you need to be in to make these kind of tunes? Sobriety. Yeah, no sobriety, not in a sense of not like drinking coffee or God knows what stimulates you to work, but like just not having to worry about anything, not having to worry about traveling, not having to worry about going to meetings, you know, maintain your labels, just lock the door and just... dive into it without being distracted, you know, a pure, clean headspace in that sense. But just also not having to worry what the outcome is, you know, just like doing jams and jams and jams. And for me, that's only, you know, doable when I'm not traveling and I'm not really occupied with my labels or stuff like this, you know, just lock myself in. Boom. So you took time off DJing to make the album? Yeah. I do that a lot actually, like when I feel that I want to be in writing mode, I just stop traveling and do my regular gig here in Berlin because you can go on a bike basically. It's a bit heavy with all the records, but you know, as a matter of speaking, but like not going abroad to do loads of gigs, just stay here and concentrate on writing music. And I have to say, like, if you're in a constant process of, this was like a six week period of time where I was just drafting everything. And then afterwards I did like editing and a bit of post-production. You notice after... After a couple of days this machine starts to kind of... and stuff starts to roll out naturally because you're only focused on this and the routine gets really... you get really productive. It's a routine kind of a... like a cycle that keeps repeating itself and that's how you get warm, you know? It's like warming up. Why do you think you ended up with this sound? First of all, it's always a challenge for me to take my stuff to new places. I don't necessarily need to repeat myself. Sometimes it's nice just to make something in a certain vein that you've already produced. But sometimes you just want to... If you're concentrating on an album, which is a story that you want to tell, you want to feel, okay, what's my next level? Where's my journey? go into. And I think after a long period of a lot of house and some techno, I was really ready to move away from the floor to the floor, straight kick structure. Of course, it also has to do with my background. I think a lot of people know me from my house and techno DJ sets, but like my background in more abstract. and electro music so yeah I don't know like it felt good to be stepping away from the obvious. For me that's really important like my favorite music doesn't have an obvious mood and I think because of that the tracks feel especially powerful. first two albums there's a very clear love for the Roland series when it comes to drum computers. It's not a secret, it's very out there, you know, you can hear it that I'm using that type of drum machines. And for this album for example, I'm really stepping away from sticking to the more classic machines that I've used for writing more dance music and this is all drumming that I've done myself basically, the sounds that I've created myself with synthesizers, which makes the horizon much bigger than sticking to certain kind of methods that work for house and techno. And I don't know, maybe as surprised as you are, the outcome is... is next level and what you can say is like certain things come in cycles there's like years where you play a lot of fort to the floor and you're really into housey stuff and and then after a while new stuff comes into the scene. You remember when dubstep became really popular and then it drifted away, but it's always something new that comes along. You need a challenge as a curious music lover. I can't stick to the same thing over and over again. Yeah, there was a natural feel for me to get a little bit more into the broken stuff, whether it's electro or more like abstract electronic music or something like this, you know. A lot of the songs on this album are pretty melancholic. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you feel that way while making them? Well, it's interesting that you're actually saying this because somebody was asking me before, like, oh my God, they became really melodic. And actually what I've done this time, which is not very visible. I've actually cut down on the amount of melodies and strings. The melodies here are way more subtle. Yeah, they're really tiny. I kept it really tiny. Some of it are almost like maybe like an experimental lullaby or something. Whereas when I produce more like house and techno, I... I tend to put so much melody and strings and another layer and another layer. I mean, I'm trying to sometimes, just for the sake of it, write something really stripped down. And then I've got a great groove and I'm like, oh, something's missing. I don't know what it is. Oh, yeah, of course, I've got no melody, no strings. And here I was really kind of... Concentrating on the rhythm was a really big aspect for me. Loads of fun also to write like this. And then I kept the melodies really tiny. But because they're so tiny, they're probably very present. And it feels like, oh wow, there's loads of stuff happening at the same time. But there's actually less this time. It's a really interesting process to keep it really... stripped down to the essence of one melody and a little communication between a couple of sounds on top of all the rhythm because there's a lot of heavy rhythm going on. When did you make the decision to take this less is more approach? I wouldn't categorize it as a minimalistic kind of. I don't think it's a bad thing to call it minimalist though. No, no, not at all. Not at all. I mean, if a track survives with very few elements, you know, then you've done a great job. I mean, it's not always the more the merrier. I mean, you can overkill quite heavily, but just like stuffing it and stuffing it. I leave it up to the listener to decide whether that's too much or not. How's the feedback been? I'm really happy because as you're saying as well, like when you got to listen to it, like it caught your attention that it was different to the stuff that I've been doing before. And of course you're... obviously losing people that are more used to the previous work and new. And some people are disappointed because they go like, oh, but most, like almost everybody that I've talked to recently doing, you know, lots of press and... and gaining interest and stuff like that. They're really supportive and they're really pleasantly surprised. So I'm really happy with the outcome. But I was already really happy when it was done, regardless what people were going to say, you know. It's like delivering a baby. It would be weird not to be happy with your own child, you know. Do you feel like there's more in this sound that you want to explore? As you might have noticed, like Virginia, for example, is not on the album. And she's basically, almost every record, she's my main voice. She has listened to the album and we set... down and had a listen and we were like okay are you gonna sing on this and she was like no it's so you without vocals it's it's very you and I think I should not touch it because it's it speaks for itself and I don't need to I didn't I don't need to add anything so in terms of project is this is a separation from what we've been doing on all my albums but at the same time it creates a massive opportunity just to go into this deeper direction with my solo stuff and also at the same time of course write like dancefloor bangers with her which is definitely on my list to do but I think because I'm so passionate about making music it doesn't have to be like now I'm doing this so I can't do that I've got so much other work that I've been doing meanwhile, you know, so it's never stopping. It's always going on. It's like an ongoing train. When you listen back to the tracks, do you get the same feeling that you had while making them? That's interesting that you're asking this, because most of the time when I make the album, I need a certain period of time to distance myself from the whole project and leave it and not listen to it. and then come back to it, you know. And when I did that, I was just like pleasantly surprised. I was already pleasantly surprised after the six weeks of doing all the sketches and then shutting down my studio and then a couple of months later opening it up. It's like, oh, goddamned, interesting stuff. And some of it I couldn't even remember when I did it. I was like, oh, this is, I like this. 145 BPM. Well done. You know, and that's like the excitement about like making music, coming back to it and just really feeling like, yeah, that's basically where I was. What is your process when you're making a track? Well, my flow is like I go into the studio and I do most of the time I do two jams a day if I'm in really work in work mode, so to speak. So I'll just do a couple of hours with one jam and multi track it into the computer. So every layer, even the effects layers. seven minutes long tweaking, you know, just basically do a jam, but record everything separately so I can just pack it away, start up something new because my studio is very hardware based. Just to make a statement, it's not necessarily analog because I love digital as well. Basically, I like to work with hardware. So you can't save everything because some machines won't allow it. So I'll just... multi-track it pack it away leave it for a while do a second jam and the next day I would either come back to what I've done or start again and then maybe the third day I would go through everything that I've done and then you know with fresh ears and that gives you the best view on what you've done rather than sticking with one loop for like three days that doesn't work for me I do an intense jam and when I've got that feeling like, ooh, yeah, there's something happening, that's where I start recording, do loads of tweaking and then packing. So you capture the moment of bliss, euphoria. Tell me about the title, World of the Waking State. To me, it sounds like it could be a dark title. Your mind surprises me, really. Jesus. World of the Waking State means basically the state you're in when you're awake. So basically, you've got sleep, you've got dream, and you've got your subconscious, but you've also got your waking state when you're right now. It's a very wide kind of field, the world of the waking state. Like you might look at the world in a completely different way. It could be really simple, you know, like you're looking at a flower and you go like, yeah, whatever. And I will go like, oh my God, did that just pop out of the ground? That wasn't there yesterday. So it's very, it's very subjective, you know, like everybody goes through their daily life in a different way. kind of way but at the same time and if you look at the artwork world of the waking state could also be like where are we now like what's happening in the world like so many new topics new issues new things we're dealing with Every album that I've done so far, there's reflection of what I appreciate. I stated this before, like, I don't have to invent the wheel of electronic music because it's been done. You know, it's just like how... how much fun do you have with writing your music and how, yeah, how, how can you reach people with, with your music? And, and also like, has it got the right quality to be out on the record, you know, and hopefully I, I can nail that, you know, that's also up to the listener, of course, but you know, some people appreciate this or that, you know, but by my, my taste is so wide that, um, Many things influence me. It's not just to be nailed down to early electronics. When I first started DJing, that was my genre. So that's maybe why my affection is really strong with it. Like one of your guys wrote about the Fabric City. oh, like, but this was the person who mixed, what did he say? Like a Joy-O and a Shet mix. Oh, it's you. Well, it's good to have you on the table. And I was like, how can you be, with all due respect, because I think you're a good guy, but listen, how can you write this? It's so narrow-minded. You know, when you get a chance to do a mix CD, It's so much more fun to make something out of it than just lice and ordinary 15, 16 tracks fall to the floor. And I was like, really? Seriously? I was like, okay. The problem that appeared like the last 10 years, if not the last 20 years, but say the last 10 years, because of loads of internet appearances through, you know. YouTube, Boiler Room, SoundCloud, whatever. People are so pre-programmed of how somebody plays or what somebody's mindset would be that it's almost like not legit to have hidden secrets. Do you know what I mean? Like, so you're a disco DJ. Oh my God, and he dropped two house records. That confused me because he was supposed to play disco. But you know what I mean? So I think what I'm... And that's what I said about the title. People like, use your ears. Stop using your fucking camera or whatever. Use your ears and don't pre-program yourself of what a mix CD should sound or what a record should sound. So give the artist some space to maybe surprise you with something fresh. Why did you choose to end the album with Cease to Exist? Yeah, that's a good question. It's like, it's... Yeah, it's an exit track in many ways. And I don't know, it's a difficult track. I don't know. It was just to nail it down was a bit of hard work. There's loads of things that I like about that track. And sometimes producing a certain track, you go through a struggle like I can't really nail it. I have to redo it. I have to remix it. It needs to be remastered. And it becomes a bit of a heavy track. You know, you're like, oh, well, okay, could have been done better. Like, I'm still not 100% sure about the mix or whatever. All these thoughts can pop in your head and for some reason, there's all this attention drawn to this track. Whereas other tracks are like, oh, that was such an easy flow and so sometimes I need to have a heavy title. This is maybe the bouncer. The bouncer of the album throws everybody out like we're done. Boom. You know, that's actually the answer to your question. It's the bouncer. Do you feel like you reached a higher level with this album? Yeah, definitely. So far, the first album came out in 2011, so that was done up until 2010. It had also some old work on it, and it was very, very naive in many ways. And then the second album, I've changed my work methods. I jumped from... from computer sequencing to hardware sequencing and step sequencing. And now I've thrown all the drum computers, the standard drum computers overboard and started to use drum synthesizers. And that's next level to find the right sounds. with the right melodies. For me that was a extremely fun learning process and I think for me personally, you know, I'm going more into detail of how tracks can be produced and at the same time also letting go of things not having to be perfect like it can be very static if you okay now this needs to happen because we're at one minute 20 or you can just say like oh this tweak is completely in the wrong position but that's kind of funky or cool and then just let spontaneous stuff exist instead of just you know iron everything flat and just making a very predictable kind of song it took me quite a while to get there though it's a lot about letting go and things not having to sound certain ways and just like boom done this is the end you know don't have to end out with a and the track would fade out or a certain edit like oh that's done boom the raw and rough vibe can be perceived by not just making the perfect ending or so like this. I'll tell you something and I'm really sincere about it like this feels like yes now I'm on a decent level because there's so much to do and there's so much to learn and there's so much to discover because music never stops it's so open for interpretation.
