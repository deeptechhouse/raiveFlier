Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Thomas Koch has seen a lot of dance floors over the last 25 years, and he's taken them in from a number of vantage points. After falling hard for disco and hip-hop as a young man in Frankfurt, he went wild for house music in the late 80s, due in no small part to Sven Veith, whose Omen Club quickly became a home away from home. Koch would go on to found a handful of dance music institutions, the seminal German magazine Groove, which he edited and published for the better part of 15 years, plus the Get Physical label and the Frankfurt nightclub Monza. But the ritual of the dance was both his first and greatest love. When I caught up with the man known to most as DJ T, I found him embracing it with newfound vigor. He's in the midst of compiling seminal tracks from his first two and a half decades as a professional DJ, but he's also devoting himself to his records and his studio in a way he hasn't yet. been able to before. So though you'll hear plenty of discussion of DJ T's past here, you'll sense he isn't hanging up his headphones anytime soon. So I wanted to start out by talking a little bit about your early musical education. You got started earlier than probably a lot of people who are in the game right now. What was some of the first music that really captivated you? That passion to also collect music was actually starting very early. That was starting at the age of 7, 8, 9, when I was attracted by the first songs on the radio and I was starting to ask my parents, what is this, what is that? And that was actually the... the prime time of disco when it became really commercial and when it was every day in the German radio and it was of course rather the cheesy stuff that first came through to me and I can remember that one of the first songs or bands that got my attention was ABBA, Bonnie M. And I forced my parents to start buying me all the long players and singles and also the first disco compilations. I can remember that I was listening on the compact thing that was in the living room, something that included radio, a record player and a tape deck. So I was spending hours and hours and complete days to listen to these first vinyls I got. So first it was the whole universe of pop I could get through the radio and disco stuff. And then pretty quickly, actually, it was going to black music, the first hip hop stuff, the really early stuff that started in 80, 81 with Grandmaster Flash and stuff. This was in a way the first music I got specialized in because from 82, 83 on, I was really interested in all this soundtrack of the breakdance movement. Yeah, I read that you were a breakdancer. Yes, yes. Yeah, that started 83 when I saw... break dancing for the first time and the German TV. Maybe you know a guy called Thomas Gottschalk. He's one of the most famous German showmasters. And he was very famous to be the presenter of... Yeah, probably the most successful TV show in all Europe. It was going over decades. It was called Wetten, dass. In 83, he was presenting another show that was called Nasowas. And he presented the first time breakdancing in that show. I saw that. And directly after the show, I was standing in front of the mirror and trying the moves. The next day, I told my mother, you have to get me the gloves. And then, yeah. And you were in Frankfurt at this time, correct? Was there much of a culture for this in Frankfurt? Yeah, actually, especially for that culture. I mean, I was too young to go to clubs and stuff. I was 13, 14, 15 in my main time of dancing. Culture-wise, it was one of the best places to be because in and all around Frankfurt, there were these big stations for the GIs, you know, where they were stationed. And there were a lot of clubs for the GIs. And I also started to go to these clubs as soon as I was... I was old enough. Was that your way into DJing? No, the DJing was a natural consequence of my passion for dancing and for music and for collecting vinyl. So one day when I, it was in the year 85, when I... had the first pitchable record players in my hand. I had two records of Kool and the Gang on both players and I directly, instinctively started to playing around with them and to bring it this far that I beatmatched them or like synchronized them. And that moment. having the first two records in my life synchronized and listening to the synchronized beats for like a few minutes because it was perfectly synchronized. I was like, wow, that's a moment, you know. I was probably leaning more far than I could know at that time. Your early experiments in DJing. were sort of in a hip-hop style then? Yes, exactly. When I was throwing my first parties, which was also very early when I was around 17, and also the first club where I threw parties in Frankfurt. I mainly played danceable black music and a bit of early dance stuff and a bit of pop, but mainly black stuff. And that was soul, funk, hip-hop. And the initiation for straight beats and for house music, and that came actually in the summer of 88 when the Omen Club opened, where Sven Feth opened his first club. And I was first managing to get entry to these clubs. And then there was a big change because that was the summer of Asset House and that vibe directly got me. And then I changed actually within a year from black music to European, yeah, to straight beats and house music. And then it needed... two or three more years till the techno explosion started. But yeah, that was a really, really exciting time. Speaking about Asset House, my understanding is that Sven Veth and the Omen Club really had just a massive effect on the scene in Frankfurt, that that music was just huge there. Yeah, it was by that time, it was mainly two cities in Germany where it was happening. I mean... It was already Berlin and it's still Berlin. But at that time it was Frankfurt was somehow. Yeah, through the international airport also and and big train station and through. through so many early activists that were pushing the thing. There were also the guys called Münzing Ancelotti, the producer team that produced Snap. They got involved with Sven already and they were also involved in the Omen Club. Sven was a key figure in that time in Frankfurt. And he stayed for a long time and everybody was looking up to him. And so he was very, very inspiring with his work. And also for me, because probably I could say if he wouldn't been there opening that club where I was going from the first weekend, like every weekend for years. Probably I wouldn't have started the Groove magazine because he was my main, the club, he and he as a DJ was mainly influencing me in my own DJ style and bringing the sound to me, which became the main topic for the magazine. I'm curious about Omen. I mean, what was the scene like in that club in the early days? Frankfurt was... You had guys like Schüler and Prisinger. They were the two guys. They were inspired by the Studio 54 and having... having this experience in New York in mind, they were opening this very famous club at the Frankfurt Airport. And also in the city of Frankfurt, it was, compared to Berlin, for example, it was a much more posh scene. And it was... was a slightly different music approach because it was, for example, new romantic stuff was very, very popular in the clubs in Frankfurt in the middle of the 80s and to the late 80s. And also Sven Fede was coming from that. culture in his early ages. So it was that city in Frankfurt was so small and in the same time trying to be a metropole. Like the city of the center is just two square kilometers. Maybe in that area in that coordinate system you had so many people who were trying to come into the clubs and and like yeah also people yeah with a lot of money because Frankfurt at that time was already a place where also in the suburbs of Frankfurt there were a lot of people with higher income. So we had this kind of clientele that was a bit more... looking and behaving like the old jet set disco clientele, you know, what was still around in the late 80s and which you don't see anymore besides maybe um on ibiza or maybe in some in some big big discos in north italy uh in rimini or in somewhere there you know or maybe in greece also in some greek islands that's maybe the last spots on earth where you can still catch this vibe that actually is still there from the late 70s when the jet set disco was in you know sure and it sounds like The bottom line is it couldn't have been any different than the scene in Berlin at that time. Yeah, it was so different. It was the people here were more coming from punk and stuff. Now that you're also a DJ of a certain stature, do you know Sven very well? Yeah, I mean, the scene in Frankfurt was so small, you know, and I was always in that circle of people. In Frankfurt that started everything. They were all really close together through the whole 90s. We were traveling together to love parades, to street parades in Zurich. A lot of times we were just traveling with Sven to his first gigs abroad or in Germany. And I was a, how do you say, like a regular guest at the Omen between 88 and 95, I guess I was there. every weekend and um still till it's closing and and yeah i got i i saw all the transformations that swan we're going through over the years you know You went through a sort of transformation of your own. How did you take your interest in music and convert it into sort of being a music journalist? That was kind of a coincidence. When I look back in my life, I had a few moments when there was a big change. introducing itself just in a few seconds. Do you know what I mean? It was that moment when my father bought a computer for his work for the first time. And he was telling me about that. In a moment he was asking me, by the way, if you want to use the computer for something, you could archive your vinyl on that or you could list... your music if you want and in that moment when he was saying that it sounds very strange but in the next second i knew i have to do a magazine because um i was already there was already a magazine i was really into that was the network press maybe you heard of that one and that that was um That was the first magazine in Germany that was specialized on dance music. It had also a focus on Afro-American black stuff, but the early house stuff was also happening there. And that was the first magazine that I saw in my life that was featuring DJ charts. charts from clubs. And it was just a few ones, just between three and five ones in every magazine. But somehow I realized which importance and which impact charts would have be in the future. So the basic thought that I directly had for the magazine was to make a pure chart magazine. That was the basic thought. But then, of course, let it grow in my mind. And then before... I really released the first issue of course there was I had found one or two guys who were writing some some stuff that was happening in and around Frankfurt so it wasn't a first first period first phase it was just distributed in in the bigger area of Frankfurt and like the service sections of the magazine were mainly presenting stuff that was happening in and around Frankfurt like the dates in the clubs and the programmation of the clubs and the programmation of the radio stations in Frankfurt. But the first issues like 80 percent or something like that was just charts from djs and um And record shops. When did it start to kind of take a turn and become sort of more of the magazine that it is now with lots of articles and features, regular columns, stuff like that? The first important move was to... when I realized electronic music is the thing in the moment and there's so much happening in that field that it needs the whole capacity of the magazine to reflect that. And of course, that was also my own development where I was going to... leaving the field of African American music and going to house and the first techno stuff. So that was between 92 and 93 when we dropped the rest of the dance world completely just to focus on electronic music. And that was the first transformation. And then over the next two or three years, between 93 and 96, it became, we expanded the territories of the distribution. I started to print more pieces until I finally ended up. having 100,000 printed, distributing in all German-speaking areas, including Switzerland, Austria, and a bit of Holland. You said that at some point you realized that electronic music was the thing. This was the big thing of the moment. Was there an artist or a DJ or even a record? that kind of made that crystallize in your mind? It was more my own experiences on the dance floor. At that time, I was the most passionate dancer. I still am, but I don't... get to dance so often nowadays and so intensively but at that time you could found me every week and night for at least six, seven hours on the dance floor and these experiences of that energy that was just what completely caught me. So groove was really kind of your main thing, I guess, during a lot of that time. You were also still DJing, though. Yes. I mean, in a way, it was growing over my head. And that... Do you have this expression, positive stress and negative stress? That was always a positive stress because I was, somehow there was this, I always had this impulse in me to just give this music the best and biggest possible platform because I was so much believing in it. And then later, much later, when there was the first down in the German economy, which was, that's a jump now, like 10, 12 years later, which was... between 2000 and 2001. Then the last three years were really difficult because it was not possible anymore to finance a magazine that was just financed by the advertisement. Until that time, I never took something. for the magazine itself, it wasn't sold. So, and then all the companies were cutting the budgets for advertisement, like within just six, nine months. there was a decrease of like 30-40% it was impossible to react fast enough so in the final fight battle period of keeping the magazine alive there were Over one and a half years, we were throwing a lot of benefit parties to keep the magazine alive. That was actually, for me, that was the most beautiful thing I could get back from the scene because there was so much love and so much support. of all the people who knew that, that, um, how important that magazine was for the, the infrastructure of the whole scene and how much it had done for, for the German, uh, scene especially. And, but still, um, yeah, finally, uh, in 2004, I had to sell it then because it was just impossible to, to, to, To finance it. And then there was in the end, there was just a choice between getting completely ruined. And that all the editors and the rest of the staff would lose their jobs and the baby would die or sell it and give it to somebody who can hopefully keep it alive. And it's still there. I'm really happy about that, even with almost exactly the same. the same stuff that I handed it over with. Do you miss not having that involvement in the magazine anymore? No. When I was actually seen from now, that was the best thing that could happen. So in that time I was doing too many projects, too much multitasking at the same time and it made me sick in a way because I was working day and night. I was doing the magazine, I was doing a club in Frankfurt called Monza, I was doing a weekly techno. event in Frankfurt besides the club I was doing a weekly radio show with the Groove magazine on the biggest radio station in Frankfurt I was doing a lot of merchandise I even was daring to go in that field of publishing a comic book with Hotzer, this guy from these famous painters, you know, that they were releasing some more of these books meanwhile. And so I was doing all that at the same time and still DJing and throwing parties. And so for three years in a row, I was definitely going over my... over my substance like yeah well i i know earlier when i when i mentioned that the magazine was sort of your main gig i i was speaking pretty loosely i mean you were doing so much during that time but it sounds like it all stemmed from sort of the same impulse which is to support this music exactly yeah and by the way um i sold it in 2004 and in 2002, we had already founded the label. So that was additionally, so in these two years, it was just killing me, the amount of projects, you know. So it was just, in a way, it saved my life because... if if if um there wouldn't have been a higher power which was the situation in the german economy which had forced me to sell the magazine i would probably still do it and would never have got the chance to um give everything into the label and into my dj career and my productions and stuff During the years when you were at Groove, though, I mean, you mentioned the benefit shows kind of to keep this thing going. But were there some highlights from that time? Was there something, a project that you worked on with Groove that really sticks with you? I mean, we did, for example... also club tours through Europe not only through the I mean mainly through the countries where where the magazine was distributed to but also sometimes in some other countries and these club tours were were amazingly successful and I can remember we booked Daft Punk for the first time to Germany during one of these club tours and I mean I have always done parties with the Groove Magazine since the first anniversary party where I can remember I invited WestBam Frankfurt And I've probably, if I count everything together, all bigger and smaller events I did with Groove Magazine, all the parties of the club tours, all the weekly technical events and all the nights we had in Monza and the two Monza clubs during three, four years, I have probably promoted four or five hundred party nights in my life. It's incredible. That's probably not something that a lot of magazine editors and publishers could say. Let's jump ahead then. Let's talk about Get Physical. It started in 2002. What were the beginnings of the label like? How did you guys get started? There was this dinner when the Mandy guys had just become friends and they had just actually started their DJ activities. They were throwing little parties in Frankfurt. They haven't to this time. They haven't produced anything and they were Yeah, we were sitting together at a dinner and they were already five people like the two guys from book a shade one other guy that Used to work with the booker shade guys Since a long time they were like running studios together And yeah, the two Mandy guys, so these five already had the plan to start the label because they kind of, everybody coming from different angles and feels of the music biz, everybody of them had the feeling they wanted to reset in a way and start. more more more in a more self-controlled way to release music and not to depend on people they would work for or the bookish guys were were for many years before they were working more in the commercial field of electronic music and were like kind of producing on request from the majors and stuff and they had the feeling that they have to get out of that and They want to just have the full control through doing an own label. And I also wanted to reset in a way. But in the moment when we had that dinner and the Mandy guys were telling me about their plans and they were asking me, hey, could you imagine? Because we have the feeling there's a gap still in this group of people. There could be somebody to fill the gap, a six. person that could maybe bring in a certain kind of network and knowledge. that they would never have expected that I could be the person because in that moment they knew that my headline was reducing work, reducing projects, getting away from the madness. And so they were just asking for my advice. Do you know somebody? And in that second, talking about the big moments in the life, that was another of these moments because in a few seconds I realized this is... The circle is closing from like 15 years before because in the end of the 80s, I was already trying to produce music and to make a label. But I failed for many reasons and also because I had to focus on the magazine. And then in that moment, I realized that's wow. this chance is coming back 15 years later and um i have to grab that that thing you know and then i said yes i'm the one and they were like what you and they were probably thrilled yeah they were totally happy and thrilled but at the same time they didn't want to believe because they knew my situation but i was like I have to do that. I have to be part of it. What musically were you guys looking to achieve? with the label or was that not even kind of was that not even coming into play at that moment there wasn't a master plan it was more the opposite it was was was uh for me for example when i was going in the studio for the almost the first time in my life because there was only one experience before when i did one release with steve buck in the very early period of poker flat which was a 10-inch, it was called Monster Bass, and it was a really weird, whack electro track, but it's still played and loved by so many DJs. It's funny that you can still hear this track from them. time to time the clubs but then um by that time when i did that with uh steve i thought that would remain my only experience and the only vinyl with my name on it but then get physical started and then i could could start producing with walter and he was from And at that time he was completely out of that underground scene. And the Mandy guys and me, we were kind of... teaching him that that that that uh yeah what has happened in the underground of electronic music the years before i mean he was already more connected to it in the early 90s but then he somehow lost it and then yeah we had all these sessions where we were playing music for him for hours to to bring it closer to him and he was really fast learning um what it was about. And then when I had the first chance to really extensively work in the studio with him, there was naturally coming the wish to work on my early musical socialization, which was disco and... funk and soul and hip-hop and especially electro-funk and I don't know if you know my early productions Among Get Physical they all had this vibe and some people still still tell me it's still the red line of my productions that there's this certain feelings of groove well and this sort of has been the the kind of the sound signature of get physical all along i mean it's it's very contemporary music but at the same time there there is a little bit of a nod to kind of an earlier time on the dance floor yeah Was that a history that you shared with the other guys? Yeah, I mean, when there was a label sound and that was why we were, probably why it was striking so quickly for us then. exploding for us and in 2005 we were elected everywhere as the label of the year and stuff because in the early years there was a compact label sound that was received from the outside as a statement like you would find these statements the last two years done by labels like Hot Creations or so but that vanished later and we consciously decided to not stay a label that's focusing on one style. Also because, for example, Philip from Mandy had this background. He had worked as an A&R of major labels for many years before. And we all had so many different roots and the range of music we liked. was simply so wide that and also at the same time the vision for the business side of the label you could say was yeah, let's try to become something like a small indie for electronic dance music that's just releasing everything what we like and what's edgy in a way. So probably of all labels in that field, the last five, six, eight, seven years, the range of music was probably wider than at every other. a comparable label and that was of course naturally the reason why people couldn't identify anymore in the same way with the label like before because it's understandable that many people always need brands or DJs that always stay doing the same sound or music like a very limited thing they are specialized and so the people can always know what to expect somehow can irritate people when And you get unpredictable, you know, and it's true. I get the sense, though, that you feel like there maybe is something that ties it all together as as kind of far and wide as the label sound might be. I mean, what is that sort of center of gravity would get physical? No, it was really just what I already said, a mutual vision to release everything what is edgy in a way in dance music and electronic music. But as you know, it doesn't have the same structure anymore. The label was going through a lot of transitions, smaller and bigger ones, the last three, four years. I left the label as a co-owner. Also the two bookish shades. guys left the label um so the first three years were magical because it was all um magically coming together and somehow um the visions of all six were were fitting together and then it was was um um after 2006-7 it started to to go in totally different directions like the musical tastes the belief how to run such a company and it was exploding the structure has exploded you know we were sitting there with with with 10 people suddenly and um Suddenly we had this, we felt this pressure to generate income all the time because there were these high fixed costs, you know. It's interesting. It seems like kind of your first big project, Groove Magazine. Yeah. And Get Physical. They both. Both kind of became unwieldy in a way. It became difficult to sort of keep both of them going. Has this been the sort of the most difficult thing that you've continued to run up against? it's very fun and easy to kind of start a project that's all about the music. But then they get very big and it becomes hard to keep it all about the music. Yeah, that's a really strong experience in my life. I mean, there were... parallels and there were um also like like significant differences in these two projects i mean i mean the first project in the groove magazine i was in full control and In the second project, I was a bit suffering because I wasn't. And I had a bit naive hope in the beginning that I could focus on the creative part. And I saw myself more and more drawn into the business part again. So in a way, I was putting my hands again on the hot plate. It's the same hot plate because I was... I let it happen that I was drawn into the business part more and more because I'm a really responsible person. I can't see something, how do you say, like driving against the wall. Right, right. And that was reaching a high level of suffering again, finding myself caught in this work for the label. And at the same time, I was losing a bit my artist career. And then there was a final moment when I decided I have to make this cut. I have to get out of it. And... That was in the end of 2010. At the same time, the Boucairche guys decided that because they simply couldn't spend any of their capacity in the company anymore and were focusing totally on their exploding life act. thing in musical career and and and philip decided and to stay the main guy to be the main person in the business and yeah meanwhile there's completely new stuff and new partners and new men kind of managing director and the last two three years was the try and it was pretty successful and have respect for that to shrink the structures down to survive like everybody was trying to survive in that business just with releasing music, you know? And, um, so now it's kind of reset and, um, yeah. Do you still have any involvement with get physical? Yes. I, I, um, in the first moment, um, I have to admit, I was like, um, yes, let me close this door completely. And, um, make a radical cut but then I really quickly realized Philip and me we have this friendship and what surprised me myself in a way was the passion that had grown for the A&R work. because I was AR and ARing for many years already till that moment, more on the side of the 12 inches, and Philipp was always a bit more into the long player and compilation field. I was also... for example the one who got the idea that we need a second imprint to focus a bit more on my vision of minimal house music that was kindisch then. So I was completely in charge of that label for the first years too. And I also had the idea to find GetDigital as the digital sister platform of the label. And I was also managing that mainly with the release in the first years. Yeah, and then I handed all this over to new guys. Actually, after a while, where I just needed a bit more distance to the whole thing, emotionally and geographically, then I discovered that I still love the A&R thing and all these hundreds of people worldwide. still continuing to send me their music and I simply couldn't resist to feedback it it's that's just me you know somebody because I knew how it was for me in the early days when I produced my first stuff and it was having the first demos in my hand and didn't know where to send that, where to go with that stuff and had a lack of... network and and and of contacts and um and then i sent the first demos to some to some um to some companies and i never got a feedback and that was an uh an experience that still stays in my mind how how how hard it is for somebody who puts who's starting to produce music and to DJ and to put all his passion and love and heart into this stuff and then he sends it away and I know that It's understandable. The most, like 90% of the labels can't feedback any demos since years. There's just too much music coming in. It's simply, you need to pay somebody to do the job, you know, and there's no money to pay this job and there's no time to listen to hundreds and thousands of demos per week or month. And so the most releases on all the labels... that field are generated through personal contacts so you meet somebody of the label you meet one of the key persons and then you maybe you are a dj at the night and he listens to you and he you get his attention and then you can can personally hand over a cd or get get the email of the person and send the music and then then you have a chance but if you send it to to office to demos at blah blah blah, you will never get an answer. It's sad. And at my time, when I was still ANRing, I really tried for a while to feedback everybody. What's that process like? I mean, I was trying to find a concept that was the least time-consuming, so of course I had some standard. um verbalizations to send it to the people i could it was not possible to to write a new a complete individual email for everybody so i had the standard verbalizations i dropped it in and but still i was like trying to write one individual sentence to everybody like to to um give him the feeling that i really um yeah checked it out and and and can maybe say say some like give one essential advice what could do better or something, you know. Was there a demo that ever did come through just kind of in your time in A&R, not necessarily from a personal connection, but something that you just heard during this process of listening to all these demos? At that time when I was still listening to everything that there were, I mean, the extract, like the... The percentage what made it was probably around 0.0, yeah, whatever. But I can remember once Thomas Schumacher had secretly founded the project, an electrochemie. And the very first single, he sent it without just electrochimic and he didn't write who he is. And he consciously made that decision not to tell the people where it's coming from. And I heard that and directly heard the quality. And I was, after the first minute listening to it, I was sure we have to release it. And then I found out it's somebody well-known, you know. yeah it was with jonah the guy from belgium it was the same we listened to his first demos and we took him for the label i can't remember but at that time there were a lot of people achieving releases through that process although i just told the story that it was hard but um i mean nowadays Nobody can listen to everything anymore. So I was trying that for a while, but it was just crazy. We've spoken a lot about kind of what you've done more on the organizational end, on the business end, but you're also an artist. You've put out three albums since 2005. The first one you co-produced with Book of Shade. The second one was with Thomas Schumacher. And the third most recent one in 2011, Pleasure Principle, you co-produced with Lopez. Tell me about that co-production process. Walter was a full-blooded producer. he at that time i was i was i was in a really early state state state stage of producing and i had to learn a lot and i was learning a lot um through sitting next to him for the first years and um it directly came came out that I love to use, I love to sample and I love to use samples. And I love to give my productions a strong fingerprint through my samples. And I was doing that from the first session. I was doing with what I... always prepared myself with a lot of samples then I went into the studio with the engineer and so you could say in the average my productions were always between 60 and 80 percent sample based and that's for example why I think I can say that because so many people gave me that feedback Through the years that I managed to keep the fingerprint, although all these different engineers had very different ways of sounding and working. Like Walter and Schumacher, for example, were completely digital guys and Lopez is the opposite. He's the most analog guy you can imagine. But I never learned to produce myself. I simply, I always thought I would like to take that step too, but it was always a lack of time and probably even a lack of... passion for the technical side like i'm i have a lot of passion when it comes to creating a certain sound and style and fingerprint and music but when it's coming to the pure technical side there's not enough fascination. And still, I can do my own edits and stuff in Ableton, but that's all. When you're working with these other producers, who obviously have a lot of their own sound signature that they're bringing into play as well, I mean, the record still has your name on it. How do you sort of bring it, bring things over onto your side? Are you like the boss of the session? I mean, there's always a new chemistry. Some of these guys are so used to work on their own. for some of them it was also partly the first experiences to engineer somebody else that it can of course come come to early in the early stages can come to conflicts about uh first you have to define the chemistry of your work like where where does my um how much influence can somebody have? And I can remember some really, really difficult moments with some of them, but yeah, in the end I managed. to come to a clear, reliable chemistry with all of them. I want to talk about your most recent project, which I think is really cool. Having the 25 years of DJing this year, I realized that a bit too late. I was like, oops, this year is 25, actually, when I started. counting from the first paid gigs which were in 88 I started earlier and I asked myself the question when do I start counting actually to to know when is my 25th and I decided to to start counting in the year where I had my first paid gigs and where everything was was was uh progressing really quickly then and so so i decided to to to do two things at the same time to follow the series of the compilation and to um reflect the 25 years of DJing with that and then I was thinking what's the best way to doing that with the compilation and then I had the idea to take one track per year 1988 till 2013 the 25 years that's actually a concept that's so so obvious if a DJ celebrates an anniversary but as far as I can remember no it was never done compilation was never done with that concept so I really liked that idea and so I picked one track per year and did a lot of edits again and remasterings and yeah. What was the process of choosing one track from each year? Was it just a matter of choosing a favorite or was there a subtler criteria? No there were there were a few criterias. So first, of course, it must have been an important track for me in this year. Second, I would like to present tracks to the people that still can be played in contemporary sets, still can work in terms of the functionality also. Then I was trying to get tracks that were never digitally available before. I didn't achieve that it was the case with all of them, but with most of them. So these were the main criterias. When you got all of these tracks together and you took a look at all of them, I mean, I'm sure that you saw quite a progression in music over this period of time. I mean, it's probably quite a broad thing to actually speak about. But, I mean, over the 25 years of DJing, can you sort of describe generally what you saw happening? I mean, what were some of the big trends that came up over those 25 years that really surprised you maybe? Sometimes it's when you look back, then you see that... You can actually separate club music mainly in two different draws. The timeless stuff and the stuff that's really bound to a certain era. And that was maybe fashion, like a common thing that many, many people could agree on for a certain time, but it only belongs in that time. listen to it a few years later and you think it really only belonged in that time and it's it's a thing that that will never probably be revived again because it, so this is, this is two main drawers that I always can, can music put into looking back, you know, and it's fascinating to, to, to, to have this view, of course, through working on such a project. I mean, and that's why I love, for example, the Burkina and the Panorama so much, because the culture that it holds. in the air um and they're mainly through the choice of the resident djs and and the djs who are booked there it's about timeless music it's about timeless house music disco music techno music it's about the heritage of detroit about the heritage of of early deep house and vocal house and and um I so much appreciate that they are supporting that culture over and over and not going after trends and stuff. And we had a... moment the last two years where we we had another um music that become kind of fashion like a kind of formula i'm always say you always um see when there's coming up a new style and certain and and and then there is maybe a certain amount of people that can agree on that sound and then there is maybe one producer or DJ taking it to another level and for example with all this new kind of disco-ish R&B-ish deep house that was so popular the last two years, you know, that was first coming up with the people around Wolf and Lamp and Soul Clap. And then there was Seth Troxler, too. to work on the more dark side of that and then there were art department and their label coming up and and so suddenly there were so many people after the the domination of minimal that was happening for years before and much longer than i expected and i could i could with my experience i could already see like 100 i could have given you a contract to that it would go into the other extreme after that because that domination of minimal and and having no melodies and and no organic approach more more this sterile kind of sounds and from my point of view not sexiness anymore and like when you come from afro and american music then you have a different approach to grooves and stuff so I was clearly expecting a new wave, a new renaissance of deep house and vocals and disco. disco elements and it happened then like started like four years before three years before and then then you could could follow all these stages of that of that um process and then finally there were um There were new key figures jumping into that process, like Masseo Plex, for example, bringing that music to a maximum formula. And suddenly there was this formula and everybody, like thousands of young producers, were trying to reproduce that sound. then there's always the same thing happening. It reaches this critical mass. It's like the pendulum swings to this point where there's a formula, and then it starts to swing in the other direction again. And then I already knew that from a certain moment that... this sound would suffer the same destiny, like some other waves before. get an overkill through so many copycats jumping on the wagon. And then something happens also that is actually sad for the whole field of music, because suddenly... especially as a DJ also, when you listen to thousands of promos and demos and your own sets and stuff, and then you get bored by everything in that field suddenly, because this music has certain elements in common, and suddenly you feel that... even the good stuff starts to bore me because it sounds the same you know and so what happened um that's now the pendulum like i just said is going in another direction i'm again since the last six nine months into harder more techno-ish faster styles again so we are right in a transition phase again of club music and it's again exciting where which would be the new main that it's going to in the next months, you know? I know it. This is all. You know this. I know it. This is all. You know this. I know it. This is all. You know this. I know it. This is so it. I call it. You know this. I know it. This is so it. I call it. You know this. I know it. This is so it. I know it. I know it.
