Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is Claude Von Stroh. the man behind the American label Dirty Bird. They're celebrating their 10th anniversary this year, and Von Stroke, real name Barkley Crenshaw, has a whole lot to be happy about. He's had hits like Who's Afraid of Detroit. He's helped launch the careers of stars like Julio Bashmore in Eats Everything. And he's found a following both in Europe and the United States. In the latter, he's become a point of entry to the underground. a role he says he relishes. On a recent swing through Europe, he sat down with our staff writer, Carlos Hawthorne, to look back on a decade of Dirty Bird and much more. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. Claude von Stroke, next up on The Exchange. Yeah, I just wanted to start by asking you about a couple of weekends ago you had a couple of big parties, the opening of the Schweyer and Ibiza and then We Are Festival in London. Yeah. How did it go? Both of those parties were really cool. One of them I had... We had to do back to back and then there was like a list of people. So I did it with Miss Kitten at the Ushuaia opening and we had never played together before, but it was it was good. Like she played some cool records and then she does like some singing and stuff. It was it was different for me, but I thought it was really fun and it went over well. And then We Are Festival was really good. Like I think that the tent that we were in was. like by far the best area. It seemed like that was where it was going on. It was really Richie Ahmad played before me and then I think it's Steve Lawler was after. It was cool. It was a good tent. Everybody was really excited. I didn't see Jamie, but he probably closed it, I'm assuming. I mean, did it start, did it feel like the start of summer for you? Yeah, kind of. I mean, we did, actually, I feel like the start of summer is always Detroit, the movement weekend. That was the weekend before, and we did kind of a different thing this year there. We play every year, whether we either get booked there or we do our own party. They don't book the same. It's kind of like an on-year, off-year thing, unless you have two names, like Richie Houghton figures out a way to play every year. So this is our off year. So we did this huge party, but we also set up a shop in the middle of downtown. We just partnered with this guy who owns a coffee shop called Urban Bean, and we literally had like a Dirty Bird headquarters for four days. It was so fun. And we got all this alcohol sent in. Like, we were serving drinks. I don't know if we were supposed to be doing any of that, but I was just hanging out there for days. It was really cool. So I felt like that was the start of the summer. Like, we did a huge party. It was super fun. All our fans were there. We had the shop. Like, we were just hanging with everybody for days. a little after party. It was kind of the kickoff. I always prepare a lot for Detroit as well. I feel like the Detroit weekend is like the weekend that I prep for to get into the summer. So it's like I kind of get a feeling of what I'm going to be into that summer. And then I just go from there. That's always like the starting point. How does the summer compare to the winter for you kind of more generally? Well, the summer is always insane. So I plan usually on not finishing anything. That's basically how I do summer. I'm like, I'm not going to finish anything from June 30th to August 30th. Just write it off because I'm going to play like a thousand shows. That's how summer goes. That's the difference. In the winter, I try to finish tons of music. But in where I live. The difference between winter and summer is like four degrees. It's like always warm. You're living in Elena? Yeah, I live in Venice, which is kind of, if you don't know where that is, it's like... It's kind of like the Haight-Ashbury of L.A., where I used to live in Haight and Lower Haight in San Francisco for a long time. And this is the closest that you can get, I think, to that vibe. But it's on the beach, and it's warmer. But there's just as many freaks and weirdos. Which is why I like it. Nice. So yeah, 10 years of Dirty Bird. I mean, how does it feel to have reached that milestone? It's really cool because I always think about the beginning when I think about now. It's just kind of like I take a moment and say, dude, we did like the whole thing. Like it happened. It actually did something. It worked. It's cool. I like it to think of how I was really scroungy and raw in the beginning, and I feel like we're a little bit more polished now, but we're still pretty raw. But it's a little more professional now. A little bit more. But you know, I don't know. It doesn't even answer the question. How would you describe the difference between the label now and say five years ago? Well, five years ago specifically, I feel like we go in waves. So we kind of stay consistent, and then the people go through waves of whether they like us or not. And it's by territory, too. It's really erratic. It's insane. So right now we're on like a huge. US wave and maybe on like a little bit of a Europe dip but it just shifts like every two three years like when year five we were kind of in a slump I felt like and we and I've had to like really focus on it but that's just the way the label goes like shooting up in the beginning, then like slow dip, then a shoot up, then a dip, then a thing. Like it's all about just like weathering the, just staying with your thing is staying with the belief that it'll just always keep coming back around. If you, if you keep doing good work. How do you measure those peaks and troughs? Is it gigs? I'm just like, I don't know. It's just a sense that I get. I guess you can kind of see it in the gigs, but not really. I feel like I get booked enough either way. I think that I'm a sensitive person and I can feel it when it's really going well somewhere and when it's kind of like, okay, maybe we're not in like the coolest label right now somewhere. When you go through those kind of dips, are you searching for a hit record to bring you back out or something like that? No. That's one thing I never did. I'd never search for, I mean, I'm searching for a hit record, but it's not, it's almost never the record that I think is going to be the hit. The hit records just come out. I really just sign the records that I like and then some of them just become hit records. I never want to do a label where, for example, like a lot of major labels have come up to us over whatever, all 10 years. But I never do it because I never want to be in that position where we're like, we got to sign the next hit record. I just want to release the little guy and the big guy and the guy in the middle just because I like the record. And then I don't want to be having to have a huge selling record to stay in business because it's just not, it ruins everything. Sure. Let's take it back. I mean, your first contact with electronic music, was that via the radio? Yeah. I would say the first time I heard techno would have been on probably like WDET or WGPR in Detroit by Electrifying Mojo. It would have played like some Juan Akin stuff. and I thought it was just super weird. I wasn't into it at all, but at least I heard it. There was that track that was like, Technica. I don't know if you know. It was so weird. That guy, the Electrifying Mojo, played like everything. It was amazing. Like Prince, Beastie Boys, Parliament, Techno. he would have played drum and bass if it was around. Like he would have played every... So I heard everything. And I don't think a lot of American kids heard techno when they were like 14 years old. So in that way, I was exposed to it, but I didn't like it. But I did try to get a job at Juan Atkins Studio without even realizing who he was. I rode my bike over there because they had the biggest ad in the Yellow Pages for Metroplex. And it was a recording studio. It was advertised as a recording studio. Yellow Pages for every internet kid is a gigantic phone book. If you're under 25 years old, you don't even know what the Yellow Pages is. It was a gigantic phone book where every company advertised and you would get it delivered to your house every year. And that's how you used to find stuff before the internet. So I rode my bike over there and tried to get a job as a studio engineer, but I was like 16 years old. And they're like, basically, I played them this rap tape that I made and they liked it, but they were like, who would get out of here? Have you since told one that story? I did tell him that. Yeah. He thought it was funny and he pretended that he remembered me. He was, he was nice about it. I feel like a pivotal moment was the first time you heard drum and bass. Yeah. Was that also on the radio? No. Right. So I didn't get into techno when I first heard it, but I did get into drum and bass when I first heard it. So I just got given a mixtape by one of my friends, a guy named Mike Hainer. He's just like a guy from Detroit that I'm friends with. He's a graphic designer. And he just gave me this mixtape. And I was living in a loft above Mickey's Pizza in downtown Detroit, which is kind of like right in the center of downtown. I had, it was like amazing. Like if just picture, I get this mixtape. I have a flat that's like $500 a month, but it's like huge. in a kind of abandoned factory-looking joint, and I have the whole cityscape, and I just put this on, and I'm looking at the city, and it's like Pansea at Russian Optical, and I'd never heard any of that sound before, ever. And I was like, who are these people? What is this sound? This is like from outer space. And I was just like, this is insane. And I started doing drum and bass immediately after I heard that. So DJing, buying the records? No, I made a live rig with a headlight on my head, Chemical Brothers style, our orbital or whatever. I had a huge mixing board and a Nord modular and a sampler and some pedals. and an emu emulator 4 or whatever and i like did a whole thing and i went and did it in raves in detroit and no one liked drum and bass i did it a couple times these parties called poor boy that were like the cool warehouse parties at the time and it would be like the main room would be like mike cervito and all these and whoever godfather then my room would have like four people. But it would take me like three hours to set up. It's totally depressing. But at least I got into music, right? I mean, it was cool in that way. So, I mean, drum and bass wasn't something that anyone was listening to? In Michigan? No. In like 1990-something? No way. Everyone in my building complained about my bass. In my building was like DJ Bone. I think Derek Puzzleko. There's some people in my building that did house and stuff and they hated me. But I became friends with them later. So how long did that kind of, how long did the drum bass take? Okay, so I did that and then I had a bunch of spurts in my career. So where I would just do music like a psychopath. And then I would just say, fuck it, I can't make it. It's not going to happen. And then I would stop. And that's why I hadn't heard drum and bass. Because I did music, and then I did hip hop. And then I went to college, and everyone branded me a novelty act, like the white rapper. And I was like, this is not going to fly. I can't deal with this. I do not want to be like the quote white rapper, like novelty act at frat parties. And it was really bugging me. So I just stopped doing music. And then that was why I didn't hear drum and bass because that was like right when drum and bass became big. I didn't listen to electronic music for like four years. Then I graduated, and then I eventually heard it. But there was all these spurts of, like, I do tons of music, and then I stop, and then I do tons of music. But when I did the drum and bass, I stopped because I literally had a hard drive crash. And I lost everything that I had worked on for a year and a half. And it was so depressing that I just stopped making music again for another two years. It was so ridiculous. Don't stop! So was the mix by your friend? Yeah. Right. So he liked it. Yeah. Then I started going over to their house, and it was super ridiculous. Smoke a joint, sit on the couch, just guys listen to Ed Rushen optical wormholes, just sitting there. Like, totally ridiculous. Like, you could have had, that sounds crazy to me now, just like sitting and listening to music like that. But it was like, at that time, the sound design in drum and bass has always been the, they've always had the best sound design of any genre. But I think that's also kind of why it really dips, ebbs and flows so hard as well. because it's so based on sound design and not sometimes that cuts into like the song aspect. In the period before you launched Dirty Bird, you were working in film. Were you DJing at the time or making music in your bedroom? Yeah, so I started making music when I was... I played the cello from like age nine to like for 14 years. And then when I was 12, I saved up and bought a four-track recorder. A four-track recorder for all those people who are young is like a cassette tape where you can record on both sides of the cassette at the same time and you get four tracks. This is like... It's just amazing what you can do now. It's totally amazing. Like, that would probably cost like 1500 bucks to just that stupid four track recorder. And I made only rap music. And I would beatbox like in the bathtub. And, like, Overdub, and then, like, we made all these, like, I was really young. I made hip-hop tracks about, like, the pizza delivery place. Like, Nero's Pizza was my local pizza, and my first track was called Nero's Pizza. I can't believe I even remember that. So, yeah, I was always into it. I was always into beats. And after that, I saved up. I had like a lawn mowing job. Like I had made a little company and I saved up $2,000, which was like a lot of money then. And I bought an Emu Emacs, which was a sampler with 11 seconds of mono sampling. But you could do a lot of stuff with 11 seconds with all the looping tricks and stuff. And you could make an entire song with that, which is hard to even imagine now, 11 seconds of sampling total for your whole song. Just everyone realized that all songs before a certain time were made on these kind of gear. Like the limitations, it doesn't matter, right? Like you could still make good songs. Like it doesn't mean they're going to be better songs just because you can sample like 45 hours now on your laptop or on your iPad or your phone. But in the period just before you kind of started throwing the parties and launching the label, you were, I mean, were you kind of like, was there a scene where you're like a little name on the scene? No. So I decided to leave Detroit and move to San Francisco. And I actually lived in Oakland, which is across the bridge. And I was a video editor. I wasn't even like a video editor. I was like the assistant editor. And we edited men's warehouse commercials. So if you know what that is, if you live in America, but if you don't, it's like the shop where you can get like three suits for $400 or whatever. It's really, the commercials were terrible, but I was able to use the equipment in the shop. And so I had an idea to start filming all the DJs that would come to town. And this is just like, okay, I'm old. So this is like right when email is starting to become big. And so I just started saying email is like really powerful. I can just start emailing all these DJs. So when they come to town, I'll just film them. And I was able to get a bunch of the Detroit guys first to do it. So immediately, everyone wanted to do it because I'd be like, oh, you know, I have Derek May on this. And they'd be like, oh, we have to do it. And so for like a year, I was able to film every single prominent DJ that came into San Francisco. And then I would go down to Miami and try to get like six or seven all at once. And I was asking them questions about... how did you become popular? Like, what did you have to do? How do you DJ? Like the actual technical questions about how they mix. And I was literally just going to graduate school for how to get into electronic music because I had done a ton of electronic music up to then, but I couldn't figure out how to crack the nut. So this was almost like I'm making this for me. I'm making a thing that I want to see because I don't know how to do it. Were you DJing at this point? Yeah. But I even DJed in high school. I had a radio show in high school. I had a radio show in college. But it wasn't mixing. It was just like play a song, talk, play a song, talk. When I moved to San Francisco, I started like a DJ drum and bass, but I switched to house for the worst reason. Literally just because there were less than three girls at every drum and bass party. And all of the girls were at the house parties, but we hated the house music that was popular. So me and Justin Martin and Christian Martin, who I just kind of all met via the video shop because Christian Martin was working at a video company. We kind of all agreed that if we could play a house music that was more like drum and bass vibe or hip hop vibe and get the girls to come. That was like the good compromise between really hard music and really like vocally house that was super popular in San Francisco at that time. San Francisco was like dominated by naked music. At that point, that was like the biggest label in America. So that was what happened. Like, I just didn't like it. And I mean, when you're sitting down with these DJs and conducting these interviews, what were the key lessons that you took from it? There was a lot of just good information about how to get going, but really, at the end of it, it was all just like, believe in yourself and work your ass off. That was the theme that came out of it. Everyone said the same thing. Don't copy. Just do your own thing. and believe it in 100% and work as hard as you possibly can and maybe you'll get lucky. But I did learn a lot of things that, so a lot of people were starting record labels in San Francisco at that time. And they're all kind of not getting over the hump, if you know what I mean. That was the one thing that that video helped me with. I learned kind of how much money I needed to save up and how to get past. that thing that was kind of holding back the other american label start startup labels which is basically only just make sure you have a european distributor and make sure that you have enough money to survive four vinyls before you get paid and that was it that was like the only thing i needed to know As long as I could front the money and not, because everyone just thinks, oh, we're going to put out a record and then we're going to get paid for it. But that's not how it worked. You got paid way late every time. So if you could go six months, you could get over that thing that crushes people, which is the initial layout of money to start a real label. And Doughbird had such a strong sound, but also had such a strong aesthetic in the barbecues and the whole bird thing. I mean, were you conscious of presenting something that was more than just music? Well, the barbecues were really Christian's baby. And it was before the label. So, yeah, I mean, it did kind of all just package itself up into a pretty thing, but it wasn't really planned, if that makes any sense. So we just started doing the barbecues because there was no parties that we wanted to go to, and no one came. To the barbecues, except for the guy that is our grill chef now was the grill chef at the first time. He just showed up and said, I'm the grill chef. And he still is. I mean. 14 years later. Now we fly him to the barbecues and pay him to do it. Nice. It's crazy. I mean, the whole like fun spirit of the label, was that a reaction against what was happening in San Francisco? No, I think San Francisco has always been fun. That's never... It was more of a reaction to minimal techno than it was to... San Francisco is really fun. So I would never say that it wasn't fun enough. But dance music, what was considered serious dance music, was not fun at all at that point. So the guy that I'm working with now, Green Velvet, I was like, okay, here's a guy that said, I'm going to be cool. My songs are also going to be kind of ridiculous at the same time, but they're still going to be cool. And I was like, that is exactly, that's like the sweet spot for me because I want to be like a happy person. but I also want to be a serious music producer. So there's always that line between the jokey, like we're a fully joke thing, and we know how to make music that we're always trying to play with. And the label hit the ground at a real pace. I mean, with Whistler's song Deep Throat, Who's Afraid of Detroit, did you have those tracks stored up, ready to go? It was actually going to be all Justin Martin label. Literally, I was going to be the manager and I was going to just put out Justin's music because at that point in San Francisco, there was a really hot little like illegal party scene. And there was a guy named Carlos who had a thing called Deep House Project. And it looked like the when you get a parking ticket. In San Francisco, it's like Department DMV or whatever. And his logo was exactly the same, but it was DHP. And Justin had done some bootleg vinyls, and we were all kind of getting into this record shop, which has changed names like five times. I don't even know. It was tweaking, I guess, at that point. And so Justin was like blowing up in the... small local scene and I had been doing music forever but I was not I was just like I'm just gonna manage Justin because I think that he can make it you know what I mean so the first two records were Justin Martin records and then I just decided I was gonna remix the records and then all of a sudden I just made Deep Throat and then I'm like well that should just be the third record And then that record became a big record. So I didn't actually think I was going to be an artist on the label on the first record. It's kind of weird. Is Who's Afraid of Detroit the biggest record? Of our label? You know what's crazy? The Whistler was a way bigger record at the time, and that was the B-side. But that was more of a fad record. So the other record is the one that lasted. But I think the Whistler sold more records. But yes, for like, do you remember? And can you like, do you remember the old days kind of thing? Who's Afraid of Detroit is definitely the biggest record. I mean, you've had, that's one of many hits you've had over the years. Is there one that you're particularly proud of that you still love playing? That one, I really do think it's like a good record, but. I am at the point where I, it's like, I can play it every once in a while, but like every show is like, can you play this record? And I'm like, no, I'm not playing it. No, I don't want to be what Debbie Downer about that record, but I'm not going to play it every show. Come on. I mean, it's like 10 year old record or something, but. I don't know. There's certain records that I like that nobody liked that I thought were really cool records. Like, I really like that track Monster Island. I don't know. There's, like, lots of... The most conceptual record ever. was the record vocal chords. It was the most, it was like I had a really out there concept and I brought a barbershop quartet singer into the studio and went through every single vowel formant and every pitch. It was like, you know, like that record took like brainwaves for me. So that was technically the hardest record, even though it sounds like a super easy record to make. It's just like ding, ding, ding. It's just like a whatever. When you hear the at the end result, it seems like a very simple record. But it was technically the hardest record. So I like that record. I mean, you guys did blow up pretty quickly. I mean, how do you reflect back on that initial period? I think we were lucky, but we were also really different. I mean, I will say that if there was a guy, Edgar Dirksen, at Noitone Distribution, who Noitone was like... Frankfurt, it's out of business now, but they weren't like the biggest vinyl distributor, but they were the weird guys. Like they had Playhouse and the weirder side, you know, like they had the stuff that I liked that I would buy. If Edgar Dirksen doesn't pick up our label. I don't know if we would have had a label. Like they just said, okay, these are super weird records and we like them. And we're just going to, we're going to do it. And that was huge because nobody else said yes in the beginning. None of the American distributors said yes. None of the other, nobody from England, nobody else. Like they were the one, they were like, okay. The first record that we released. was like a guy with a southern accent rapping and a bunch of fart noises over a house beat. It was a really weird record. And cows mooing. It was a strange house record. So they were sending that record out across Europe? Yeah. Well, that was one of the things I learned from making the film is at that time... like 2004, 2005, don't spend any resources in America. Just put everything you can into Europe because Europe is the market. So I was like, I don't know. I say that the American distributors didn't take it, but I don't even know if I asked them because I only wanted a European distributor. So we actually looked like we were coming from Europe, which really helped it because we didn't look like we were coming from San Francisco. We were getting re-exported back from Germany into America. So I don't know. For the buyers, it just looked more interesting, I think, because we were a weird San Francisco label, but we were coming from Frankfurt. You mentioned earlier that you're enjoying a particular purple patch in America at the moment. I mean, what was the specific moment when you realized that, yes, this is working in the US? You mean recently? Because it was kind of always working. This is something that happened. Do you want me to give you a long answer again? I'm sorry. But I mean, you're saying that, so when it got big in Europe and then it did travel over to America. Right, so when it trickles back, it takes longer, but it goes really big when it finally catches. I have this thing, so we're going to get into a little bit of weird politics here. When George Bush was the President of the United States, like, Ritchie Houghton moved to Berlin, and then, like, a lot of people started moving out of America, who were, like, key people in house music and stuff. It's not Richie Houghton's fault or anything. I'm just saying that was like the one that I noticed where I was like, oh, he's leaving. Basically, the infrastructure of house music in America kind of disappeared. So then like three or four years ago, we have this gigantic EDM boom, but all the people have left. And so it's like Dirty Bird, Ovum, Planet E. There's no one ghostly. There's like nothing left. So we just get like a gigantic present handed to us because we're the only house DJs left. It's crazy how it happened. So we actually were the only ones that were ready for it. So we just said, thank you. We will take this. And that's what happened. I was going to ask you because you, yeah, Dirty Bird and yourself, you do play a lot of these really big festivals in the US and you've got that role as repping for the underground. I mean, how do you feel about that? I like that role. I think that... The whole point, I've been really conscious of trying to always be right in the middle of, like, we never want to go really commercial, and we never want to be like, I'm not dancing because I'm so cool. we're always trying to be like in the middle area there, like a gray area where you don't really know if it's underground or not, but we just want to have fun. But I feel like that's the place that we fit. And that's a really hard place to fit. Like, cause. people always change their perceptions and then they're like no you're you suck or oh that record was too deep or whatever i mean this whole notion of the kind of edm trickle down that people are going to see the hard worlds today but then tomorrow they might be getting into club on stroke is that something that you're witnessing when you're there absolutely that is that's what's happening it's already happened It's like I talked to Kashmir on the phone just because we're doing this back-to-back project called Get Real, and we are just like, what is going on? This is so awesome. because that's exactly what's happened. Like kids are like, oh, we used to like this, but now we like Deep House or whatever. Like I don't even know if they know what they're listening to, but they know we're like the gateway drug into the really deep grasshopper on aluminum. like pots and pans clinging clacking house okay so you're like the second tier we're like right we're we're how you get into that you you listen to us and then you're like oh yeah i used to listen to them but now i only listen to like birds chirping in berlin I feel like you're quite open-minded when it comes to the whole kind of commercial dance thing. I know you've played with Skrillex. Yeah. I mean, Edge and Dance. Skrillex is a cool guy. I don't get super hung up about it. I mean, there are things that I wouldn't do just because I feel like it wouldn't really represent me. Here's the thing. I don't see any problem with if I'm playing exactly the same music, does it really matter if I'm playing before Skrillex or if I'm playing before Damian Lazarus? What's the difference? If I'm playing the same set... It's like, yeah, so one of them is a different audience, but I'm playing the same music. So it's like, okay, it could be perceived in a way, but I haven't changed what I'm doing. So I think it's a plus always to just wherever I can get it. I'm like the guy that wants to try it out. So that's what I tell my booking agent. I'm like. I want you to put me on the main stage and have me eat shit instead of headlining the deep house stage. Because I want to show people the sound. You know what I mean? Like, I'd rather... go on after a huge trap set and just like fail because somebody will like it and it'll be 10,000 more people than the other stage it's interesting because i've i've read that back when you were starting you kind of regretted making those a couple of more kind of commercial things remixing certain tracks or playing certain parties maybe now you're kind of you're in a position where you can yeah take those risks and be more well i think that the remixes that i was talking about were bad remixes that i shouldn't have done does that make sense like now i feel more comfortable in what i'm gonna deliver And maybe like there was a year where I did 28 remixes and that's not advisable because some of them were cool and some of them were like really. I didn't think they were the best remix that I could have done. Like I remixed like a big tune that was already commercial and then I fucked it up even more. That's what I was thinking. And they'll never let you forget it. It'll come out again in like two years. Compilations. I'm not going to talk about which tracks, but once you do, this is the good advice for up and coming producers. Whatever the worst song that you're going to make, whatever the worst song you make is, is the one that someone is going to license for the next 25 years. And you're going to have to look at it on the front page of Beatport for the rest So beware. I mean, because you're talking about that gray area between the underground and the commercial. And I imagine when you're coming up, when you first exploded, negotiating that must have been hard. You're getting all these offers. You want to do these things. It was actually not that hard because I really had a good sense of what. The underground was from going to raves in Detroit and abandoned warehouses that I don't think that other people really... know about when they start. So I kind of knew what it actually meant to be really underground and I knew kind of what it meant because I worked on a lot of movies so I knew what it meant to be like the guy in the studio where you work on a song. for four days and the director comes and he's like dude I just want all these sounds changed into banjos and I'd seen that side as well and so I'd seen like super like big budget movie music producing and abandoned car factory raves and that was like my experience was on both sides because I worked in film for a long time and so I was aware of what it meant to be on both sides and I think that that is why I did what I like why Dirty Bird is the way it is is because I never ever want to be the guy that has to put the banjos in after working on the track for four days, like that is never going to happen. I'm never going to be like the producer for Katy Perry or something. For a while, you were running Mothership alongside Dirty Bird, which is an outlet for more kind of European house and techno. Has that stopped? Is it on hiatus? That's a good question. because I just had two conversations this morning about it. And what happened was I had, like, right when the records came out, I had two children, and I went to Europe every other weekend. And it was, like, a real, I'm not going to say it was a grind because it was amazing, but it was not the easiest to travel with. small children at home and like everything. And my wife just like, what, this is what I got into. Like you weren't even doing this when we met. And so there came a point when I was running Dirty Bird and Mothership where I just had to say, they're both going to be average. If I continue, this is like year five when I was saying that we were kind of like, what are we doing? They're both going to end up being average. but if I drop one, one of them could be like make something like a statement in the universe. So that's why we stopped releasing Mothership Records, but I loved that label because it gave me an outlet to do the more deep stuff that I like to play, but it's not going to come out on Dirty Bird. But I think it's going to come back. It was only, what has it been, two years since it mothership? I think we can still bring it back. I think it's coming back. Dirty Bird has famously had a hand in launching the careers, or helping hand in launching the careers of Julio Bashmore, Cats and Dogs, Eats Everything, Tim Green. That must be something that you're pretty proud of. Yeah, I just had breakfast with Stefano Rivastar. When he came to me, he was going to be called ghetto junk. And I convinced him to be called something else. We did his first record too, I think. That's one thing that's really satisfying. But most guys that get really big, they leave us. But in a way... I think that I have an ear for some, at least a little bit of an ear. Like I can find, there's always tons of new people. And I think that we are really good dirty bird advertisement right here. We are like a really great place to do your first two records. But in a way, like once you get big, it's almost. People kind of tend to go off and do their own thing, but it's almost a good thing for us because I actually like, I don't want to ever have to be like, we have to release this record because this guy is big and he's associated with us. I always just want to release the best records. So I like that we just kind of like keep cycling it through. Yeah, you see the label now more as a kind of place to nurture and break talent rather than just... That's the best quality of this label. Like it's the best place to have your, to like start your career. I mean, it's more of a risk, but it's more fresh. It's not even that risky. It's like... If the songs are really good, then it's not that risky, I don't think. You know, I listen to every demo. Right. And I listen to as many promos as I can, but that's almost impossible. But I still listen to every demo. Maybe not for more than 10 seconds, but I listen to them all. And it's not that hard for me to find like every, sometimes I get super depressed going through the demos because I'm like, oh my God, everyone's trying to be on Dirty Burn and it sucks. But sometimes there's just like, oh my God, this guy, it's so good. And then it's great when that happens. I love when this happens. How many demos? do you get a week do you think um 500 wow something like i don't know that's serious it's a lot it's intimidating when i go to the demo folder and i haven't looked at it in a month let's just put it that way all my days i'm just like oh my god but that nugget of gold might be in there. It usually is. It's gotten to the point where I can count on, we've set up such a network so that either Justin Martin or Cats and Dogs or somebody is going to turn in an amazing record or Justin J or somebody new or there's going to be an amazing demo. And it's crazy because... That's it. Like, I'm relying completely on just getting lucky forever. Like, because if it's not in the demo folder and it doesn't come from someone, we don't do a record. But somehow it just keeps coming in. They keep actually just coming in right at the right time. and we're like, oh, that's great, we'll do it. Nice. I mean, do you envision another 10 years with Dirty Bird? I think so, yeah. I don't know about another 20 years, but I think maybe 10 is reasonable. I'm going to be old. But yeah, I don't see why we would stop it unless it just tanks, which you never know. It's like it's not unheard of. I wanted to ask you about Ibiza. Yeah. You run a party there in 2013. Yeah. At Sankeys. How did that come about? I don't know how the initial conversation came, but it just materialized, and then I tried to make it happen. And it was kind of a stretch to make it happen. for me to try to bring that many Americans over week by week. Like, I think that, I don't know, it's hard to explain. So if you, let's say if you live in Berlin and you do a party in Ibiza, it's like, whatever, three hours. But I flew, we did like 18 weeks and I went home in the middle. It was kind of hard. I will not say that was easy party. It was difficult. Hence why we don't have, it didn't continue. I couldn't do it. That's basically, it just came down to like, I can't do it. It was too hard. I don't live here. Ibiza in general has been a big place for you. You play there a lot in the summer and you play many different parties. I kind of see you as bringing that kind of fun alternative to what is quite kind of narrow-minded. I mean, very groove-centric. My history there has been kind of interesting. I really aligned myself with We Love. the party on Sundays at Space because I pretty much became friends with Mark and Sarah Broadbent and they were like my contacts. Like that was, I only played for them. It was limiting also, but like I really liked that I was like one of their guys, you know? But then they left that party. And I just said, you know what, it's time for me to, like, they left. They were my homies. And so I'm just going to see if I can do something. Like, because I'd only played that party, and I was always like, well, I can't play anything else because of, it's just like Ibiza's crazy politics. You just kind of choose your lane, and then you are in that lane. So then I played Enter the year after that, which kind of different audience, which was really cool. And then I got on Paradise and like different things started to happen. And now I'm just kind of bouncing around, which is also really fun because I get to play in front of a lot of different crowds. And some years I go a million times and some like this year I'm going like four times. It's just like what's it's kind of like what's happening in America. How many is dependent on how many times I'm going to show up in Ibiza. We love us at Sankey's now. Yeah. I can't say that party did a lot for me. So, yeah, I good luck. God bless that party. I hope it's successful. Let's talk about your music. You've put out three albums now. And I read that you said you don't want to do any more. I don't want to do any more. Why not? Because I don't think it's that kind of world anymore. So an album for me, some people are able to just do an album in three months. But for me, it's like minimum 10 months to do an album. People like me and Justin Martin were like painstakingly going through the tracks. It takes me a long time to feel good about a track. And I just feel like putting almost a year into something that's going to disappear in three weeks or less is no longer. good formula you can probably see that I've just shifted to just like we're gonna I'm gonna release something interesting like every three months forever that that's it's also making me happier because I don't want to do the tortured artist thing but when you're doing an album it's fucking miserable because there's always a date where it has to be in And you're just like, once you get the pressure thing, it's counterproductive. So if you just say, I'm doing singles, all of a sudden your life is like a thousand times better. But I might do something else. I'm going to start something under Barclay Crenshaw, my real name, in October. But we'll talk about that another time. Yeah, I was just going to ask you what your plans were for future musically. Yeah, I did some. I did a couple of tracks with EEPROM. And I've done some kind of like 90s inspired hip hop beats, but with like more modern production value. And I honestly don't want to like talk too much about it because I'm literally just doing it for fun. I'm doing it because I want to do it. And that's it. Like I was like scheming and thinking of like all these ways to do it. And then I'm like, I'm just going to use my real name and I'm going to do it for fun. And just see what happens. And that's what's the next thing. But I'm still going to do House, of course. Cloud One Stroke. What is this thing you're doing with Green Velvet? Okay, so the Green Velvet thing is called Get Real. And it's basically a back-to-back. where we just play a track a piece and it's really fun. Like we have like ESP, like it's really good. It was good. It just happened accidentally in Miami a couple of years ago. And then we were like, man, that was good. And so it's really just for festivals, but. It's got a lot of, like, it just came out of the gate really easily. And, like, we didn't even say anything. It was already getting booked. Like, so I think it's going to work. So you're doing that this summer, look. Yeah. Mostly in America, Canada. I'm sure it will come over here. It just takes... I don't know if it's like blipped on the radar yet. We're just rolling it out like with no pressure. You know what I mean? Just see what happens. Bye. Bye. Bye.
