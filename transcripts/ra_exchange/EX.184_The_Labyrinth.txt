you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling, and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. Few events loom as large over underground... electronic music as the labyrinth. The Japanese festival began more than a decade ago as an outdoor trance weekender, but by the mid-2000s it was incorporating the sort of deep techno and house acts you normally wouldn't hear outside of a nightclub. You'd be hard-pressed to find a more meticulously curated festival. Its founder, Russ Mensch, thinks about coordinating the timetable by playing a DJ set, but its bookings, which range from resident deniers to more experimental acts like Bee Mask are only part of what makes it special. On a swing through Japan late last year, Jordan Rothwein stopped by Russ's home in Tokyo to discuss his vision and to hear more about the act of God that cut last year's labyrinth short. ♪ ♪ When people talk about Labyrinth, they often say that kind of the star of the show is sound. And I think the festival really seems... to be a showcase not just for music but for really good sound. When did you first get interested in sound? I don't know if I can answer that question. I can answer when I got first interested in the sound system that we use for Labyrinth. I heard functional one speakers and you recognize immediately that's something that you could, it's just a way of reproducing sound that I hadn't heard on that scale before. I've heard really cool audiophile systems, but nothing that could cover a soccer field. So almost right from the beginning, we said it has to be that system. And over the past 10 plus years, it's been a game of trying to fine tune and refine that sound. To be honest, we've never really got it to exactly where we want it to be, which keeps things interesting. Every year there's areas where we thought, ah, we should have done something a bit differently with the sound. different amps, try different settings. But yeah, I mean, I agree that for me, the headliner of the festival every year is the sound system. I'd love to bring out the guy who built them, Tony Andrews. It's kind of a little dream of mine to bring him out and have him do the sound one year, but we haven't had a chance to make that happen yet. Well, sound is sort of a notoriously tricky thing. There's always something more that you could do to get sound better in almost any case. Well, you have the environment, everything around it. Outdoors, you're not in control. In a club, you totally have control of the situation. When you're outside... the weather, fog, rain, the ground gets wet, that actually has often like a very beneficial impact to the sound. There's so many things that are just outside of your control. Did you have much experience like, you know, earlier in life going to festivals, hearing what they sounded like and saying, man, there's an opportunity here? Um, yeah, I mean, I don't come from any kind of background where I could, you know, say like I went to a festival and thought, ah, you know, this should be done better. Um, I thought it was more, I thought there was opportunities there, not around sound, but more around just the psychology of events. seeing situations where you're in a beautiful area, very cool people, cool music, but the components not coming together in the way that I would have liked to see them come together. So I thought there was a lot of potential there, but in terms of sound, it was only when I started doing my own events that I really got into it. Did you have experience doing events before Labyrinth? Was that kind of the first thing? That was the first one. Yeah, yeah. I had no idea what I was doing. The first one was kind of a logistics disaster. I had no background in any of the areas, didn't have people in charge of all the proper situation from parking to gate to sound. I just tried to kind of do it all. So that was an interesting experience. I would imagine that when you're doing a festival for the first time, things come up that you would have never imagined would even be an issue. There are just so many details. Yeah, like the sound system not working. The sound system didn't work the first time. Actually, the very first event was not with the Function One system. After that, it was always with Function One or TurboSound. but we used an old Japanese dub system. When it worked, it sounded really good, but it was kind of patched together, and we barely got it even working. on time for the event to start. After that, we said, "Okay, we're going professional next year. We're going to using serious speakers." The other sort of starring role of Labyrinth, everybody says goes to the setting. And I know that from reading, listening to other interviews with you, that it's not just great sound, but it's a great place to experience sound. And being outdoors is a big part of that as well. How does that factor into Labyrinth? Well, I mean, obviously it's an outdoor event, so it couldn't exist otherwise. We do club events, not under the Labyrinth name, but under Mind Games. We do the occasional event in unit, maybe once or twice a year. I do like clubs and it gives a, I mean, clubs provide the venue for this music to, you know, to essentially to exist. But it's not what I'm into. What you can do outdoors is just completely different. You can build. timetables and a whole sequence, a whole musical sequence, which matches the flow of the night and day and weather and just being outside. Were you always a fan of the outdoors? I mean, before you got into throwing festivals? Yeah, I'm not a real granola type. I do a bit of hiking. My wife and I went on a two-week trek after we got married in New Zealand. So yeah, I do like to go outdoors, but I'm not particularly adventurous. Sure. I wonder though, if there was, you know, like sort of an epiphany moment, you know, something where you were like, okay, great sound experienced in the outdoors. This is the way it should be done. Yeah. There's no one moment. I mean, The event grew out of the Japanese outdoor trance scene. There was tons of parties in Japan in beautiful venues from small beach parties to mountain parties. Not in techno, but everything was in the psytrance. kind of psychedelic ambient scene. So those were the first outdoor parties I went to, and they were very cool. But like I mentioned before, when I went to the parties, I saw there was some, there's a lot of potential there that people are missing. You had this amazing crowd, beautiful venues, very cool. Everything was cool, except you had some really dodgy characters in the middle. You're trying to see lots of mafia. Israeli mafia, Japanese mafia, Turkish mafia, those three crews were pretty much at the center of all the outdoor parties. And artistic sensitivities are usually not what the mafia is known for. So there was a lot of inspiration, but seeing... seeing the people were very inspiring. Then I guess another moment was going to Hungary, so also a trance party. That was very cool. Hungary was an eclipse party and it was run by... Probably another dodgy character, but it was done very well. It was really stripped down. There was no structures on the dance floor, which I liked. A lot of the trance scene in Japan was kind of breeding its own culture where you build these giant string things and these giant lasers and all sorts of junk on the dance floor. Seeing a party in a beautiful spot would just... Two big stacks of speakers, a bunch of freaks on the floor. That's all you needed. So that was something of a moment. Yeah. Yeah. We had Eric Cloutier on the podcast and he was sort of describing Labyrinth. He said, yeah, it kind of, there is a trance element to it, but the music isn't trance in the traditional sense at all. So it's kind of like you took this. trance concept and applied it to techno. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think a lot of trance organizers like from that time, um, we're onto something that, uh, techno organizers weren't, which essentially, you know, taking the music and creating a ritual experience out of it, outsource outdoors where you have the, you know, from, from sunset to sunrise, you go all night. you can just create a much more fundamental experience in that context than you can inside an artificial context, i.e. a club. So yeah, it definitely grew out of the trance scene. the initial lineups were also somewhat connected to that scene. And then it slowly kind of grew into its own thing. I'd say the sound is still quite, at least for me, it's still very trancy. however you define that. But for me, it's just hypnotic. Yeah, maybe lowercase t trance, not uppercase t trance. Right. I mean, I'm not, in terms of genres, it's not something which I'm particularly concerned with or interested by. I mean, the party at this point is sort of predominantly techno and house with some kind of more experimental flavors thrown in as well. And this is music that has a real background in nightclubs, but maybe not at this sort of outdoor festival. Why bring that to an outdoor festival? One thing that's challenging is always finding... DJs from essentially a club scene who can respond well to playing outdoors. So it doesn't quite answer your question, but it's always, it's interesting challenges is trying to listen to someone, especially if you never bought them before and think, are they going to actually get the outdoor context? There's tracks you can play in a club. which would make sense, which just wouldn't make sense in the outdoor. We don't want to, you know, we're not trying to turn the thing into an outdoor nightclub. It's something, trying to create something a bit more fundamental. I guess kind of the obvious question to ask next is kind of like how you choose artists for the festival. It's such a highly curated lineup. It's such a high quality of artists, but in a way it's kind of hard to put your finger on exactly what brings all of these artists together. How do you, I mean. What makes like a labyrinth artist? Okay. Hmm. Um, I mean, I go through tons of mixes and I ask artists and friends and, you know, if they have anything that they recommend to me and just listening to stuff throughout the year. And I make a big long list in a spreadsheet and just kind of go through, go through material. But most of it, like the decision to book someone is usually very, I agonize for a long time. But then usually when the decision is made, it's very easy. And it's usually to do with hearing a track or usually hearing a mix and seeing it at a certain time of day. Like literally visualizing it. You can say, ah, this is happening the first night at 10 o'clock and this is the moment. And that's usually how the decision's made. In terms of what's the thread that strings all the acts together, yeah, it's just my personal taste in music. I like very organic sounding, very hypnotic, trippy, psychedelic music. And I find that thread between house and techno and experimental music. So for me, there's a very clear thread that connects all of the acts. But yeah, and I guess that thread is just my own taste. And then sort of the sequencing of an individual, like an individual edition of the festival sounds like it kind of is happening at the same time. You're kind of plugging these artists into a greater flow. Right. I mean, the whole thing is, it's like... programming a dj set it's it's we see it as as one thing so you have three nights and each have a certain goal or you have three days and you're trying to achieve something and those three pieces um also as a whole are designed to come together uh in a certain way yeah the the transition from um One thing that's been interesting is when we've gone from an all-night format to a morning to evening format, what that's allowed is it creates cool spots at the beginning and the end of the days where it's natural to go to more, just not dance music, on-beat music, experimental music. So that, but it's finding people from that scene who naturally blend into, say, like that environment and the techno scene, which is also a lot of fun. You know, finding people like, you know, like B-Mask or like John Elliott. Finding artists like that who don't come from, you know, the context of a techno event or a dance event. but who fit in perfectly. I'd imagine that doing this sort of format too, I mean, it just completely warps the whole notion of peak time. You're not building up all day to some massive climax or something. Is it more spread out over time? Is there even a peak time at a festival like this? Yeah, there is. The final set of the final day, that is something that you go out on a high. So we don't bring the sound back down on the final afternoon. We don't do like a two hour ambient outro. But apart from that, yeah, there is no one slot. There's no one peak time slot on the first day or the second day. The whole thing is designed as a whole. It sounds like you have a very clear idea of... kind of where these artists will slot in. How much do you communicate with the artists beforehand about, you know, this is what I see you doing at the festival? Yeah, there's a lot of that. I mean, I'm a real control freak. And so you want to be careful and not dictating how someone plays. But on the other hand, you want to give them as much context as possible so they can prepare and... and be aware of the position they're playing in. Especially if you've never played, it's difficult to imagine that sound system, that crowd, that context. So I really try to give all the artists as much background, both in terms of the sequencing the event and what I'm trying to achieve. So there's a lot of that. When that's not done... you can tell. Like if I go through a booking agent for whatever reason, there's not that personal communication that takes place. Yeah, that usually doesn't work so well. You have a lot of artists that come back year after year, people like Donato Dazi, Peter Van Heusen. You do get the sense that you forge personal relationships with these artists and that they feel very passionately about their place at the festival. With artists like those, do they ever come to you and say, hey, I'm kind of curious about playing this time slot. I think I've got something for that. Yeah. Not so much asking me, hey, if I played this slot, could I do this? It's more experimenting with a different time slot. So for example, this year, Dozie played an interesting slot opening the event, playing a kind of a hybrid DJ live set. And so that was something he was excited about trying and he talked to me about. But with those guys, they're such masters that, of course, I don't have to tell them anything at the stage. And the event is built around. of artists like Donato, like Peter. For me, the idea of a resident is critical. The event is very ritualized in nature, and for a ritual to make any sense, it has to have consistency. You have to feel like you're part of the same experience each year. And having resident DJs like a Donat or like a Peter, they bring that consistency. They kind of create that ritual aspect where people, they plan all year for their sets. And I've been lucky in the past couple of years to find a number of other artists who get the event. um like at that same level um that donato and peter have for example um atom uh had some tm and and petra dindoff and um and john elliott we have people like that who just as soon as they land bang they they just get it right off the bat um so the challenges i've got so many people who i respect and i want to bring back every year The challenge is how do you find space for everyone? For people who haven't been to the festival, I think we kind of have this idea of it. It's out in nature. There's this great sound system. But maybe the way that the festival actually plays out over the course of the run is a little bit more of a mystery. Maybe you could kind of chart... What happens there? You know, what's the format? Format? Well, I mean, the first night we start around sunset and go until maybe 1.30. Next day we start in the morning around 9, go until around maybe 1.30 again. And then the final day, the same sort of thing, morning till sunset. So there's your basic format. terms of what happens you know it's kind of up to you yeah um I know you had said, I think in a previous interview, that at some point the format kind of switched. It used to be all night, kind of running into the next day. And then you kind of ended up switching to more of like a day-long festival. Yeah, that was when we went to the current venue, Naiba. When we first found the venue... They didn't tell us about any sound restrictions. And then after we decided to do the event there, they let us know, oh, by the way, you can't go all night. There's some local regulations. You'd have to have a covered dance floor. So at first, it was a bit of a shock because doing the whole all-night format was just such a part of the event. you kind of go through the night you have this kind of breakthrough moment in the morning and the sun sunrise and then we'd finish up with ambient in the afternoon um but after thinking about it this is kind of a cool restriction a cool limitation that this will allow us to do something different The problem when you go all night is that you really push people hard, and then they push themselves to stay up, and the crowd kind of splits into two. You have the younger crowd, which is more into staying up all night, and then some of the older crowd wakes up in the morning when the sound gets a bit groovier. So you had kind of a split. Except for me and the staff, we can't split. We have to do the whole thing. So it really puts a lot of pressure. It's very difficult to do that several nights, two nights in a row. Especially the first night when you build the event, you set up the teepees, the speakers, all the technical stuff. Then you're forced to stay up all night and then all the way to the next day. Every time, for me, it was always, okay, this is the last time. The first night, I can't do this again. You're totally broken. Doing the day format is much more natural. You have crowd comes. They arrive in the early evening. They listen to music. they go to bed maybe two or there, or they sit out camping and cooking and barbecue and what have you, but you know, everyone just goes to bed a normal time. wake up in the morning if ambient music kind of drifts through the campground. So you'd be woken up by that. Or when the dance music slowly comes in, maybe that will wake you up out of your tent. You know, you have a beer, have a breakfast and you come out to the floor. Everyone's there together. And then you push people hard. By the time it gets one o'clock, you know, everyone's dead. You want to sleep. So you fall into much more natural patterns. It sounds like this restriction was in a way one of the cool things that's happened to the festival. Festivals in sort of, I don't know, the European mold, like a summer festival, they do tend to take on this. kind of marathon vibe. And while Labyrinth is almost certainly a very intense musical experience, it sounds like it's not really supposed to be that kind of, you know, pushing your body to the limit, you know? I mean, you... Some outdoor parties when the sun comes up and it's supposed to be a beautiful moment and you look around the dance floor. Yeah, and there's some scary looking faces out there. So when you push people so hard that they become zombies, that's not so cool. Having said that, after three days of being outdoors in this format, yeah, I mean, we do push you. I mean, the second day in particular is a long one. You wake up in the morning, you go and dance music all day until whatever, 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock at night. And then you have the weather, which pushes you. You're in Japan, you're outdoors, you're going to get rain. So it's a pretty intense experience. You know, I get the sense that sort of the X factors with doing an outdoor festival, weather, you know, whether that's rain, sunshine, temperature, all of this, like these are sometimes the things that would terrify a promoter. Like, are we going to have good weather? But I get the sense that with you, like within reason, those X factors are part of what makes doing an outdoor festival so exciting. Right. I mean, it's all. It's all part of the game if you're doing an outdoor party. You can't do an outdoor event and cry when it rains. I mean, you have to. And the crowd knows it. They come well prepared. Everyone knows how to deal with the elements. People come to outdoor parties in Japan. There's a big outdoor party scene now, which has gone well. I mean, the train scene died off, I don't know, a decade ago. But you have a vibrant outdoor scene. in techno, you've got organizations like Tyco Club, Metamorphose, and a number of smaller groups. So there's lots of outdoor parties. People know how to handle themselves. And the weather helps make a completely different atmosphere every year. Sometimes you'll have, like this year, a typhoon. That tends to change things a little bit. Other times you've had bright blue skies. But it really creates a... it seems to create like a denser experience when you have a wide variety of weather conditions over the course of three days. It doesn't feel like three days. It feels like you've been out there for a long time. So nobody hopefully comes to Labyrinth and it rains and they say, oh man, I wish it had just been sunny this year or something. Well, I'm sure there are fools. You mentioned these trans parties and your format or the sort of the idea for doing an outdoor festival of this sort in Japan kind of comes out of that. in a way that's sort of a trance kind of casting a shadow over the festival in a good way. You kind of were able to borrow the best parts of that. My understanding though is these parties in other ways had kind of a bad reputation and I wonder if that reputation cast a shadow over Labyrinth as well. I think at this stage, no. Right in the very early years when there was when the trance scene was much bigger and we're more closely connected to it, there was a little bit of that, of people questioning. When you try to find a venue, it became a little tricky. If they'd heard about other parties that maybe like a trance organization had done an event there and they'd done screwy things. that could have made life more difficult. But at this stage, no, that's kind of long, long past. It's great running a party, running a festival, you know, where you feel like there are lots of things that you need, you know, that you can leave to chance and that that makes the festival a richer experience. But I would imagine there are also like a lot of challenges with running an event of this size. I mean, what are some of the challenges doing Labyrinth? Maybe some of the things that are less fun than choosing an incredible lineup for the festival. Yeah, I mean, the weather makes the event, but of course it makes creating the event also that much more difficult. The biggest challenge is if you get hit with storms when you're trying to build. Once you have all the structures in place, you have the stage, the speakers, electricity is all. I mean, once everything's in place, then the storm can hit and you're fine. If you're out there and you don't have a stage built and you get typhoon winds come, then yeah, then there's nothing you can do. You're totally screwed. So we've come very close to being totally screwed in the past, but we've never had a time where we weren't able to actually put the thing together in time. But that's always been my biggest concern, much more. so than having a storm hit and even canceling an event or canceling a day of the event, which happened for the first time this year. The biggest nightmare is not being able to build it. Yeah, this year that was. So this was the first time that you had had to cut the event short due to unforeseen circumstances, something with the weather. That must have been a really heart-wrenching decision. Yeah, well, the decision was made for us, so you didn't really have to make a decision. You wake up in the morning, you look outside, you see rain going horizontally, and you say, okay, that's that. like going in or waking up and you had an interview with Eric, Eric Cloutier a few weeks ago, I think, and going in and kind of knocking on his door and delivering the bad news to him. You could see in his face he'd already had, the news was delivered. He had a bottle of whiskey and a beer already open. There was no question of trying to do an event. that day. It was, you know, it was decided for us. I remember talking to him in a more casual setting when, when he got back and yeah, you could tell how, how bummed out he was. I mean, all the rest, they were. And I'm sure that they still are disappointed. And it's kind of a heartbreaking moment for the crowd and for the guys who prepared. Donato and Neil, they put together just an enormous amount of material for the Voices from the Lake live set. And Boom just weren't able to play any of it. Svrek, he was going to be closing the event for the first time. That was difficult for him, I'm sure. Eric was coming back again. But everyone was also very understanding. They see the situation. They're happy that there were just no injuries and that people got out safely and that everything was cool. Yeah, that's really good news. I would imagine for an event like Labyrinth, coming up with some sort of an alternative venue in this case, or, you know, just putting everybody into a nightclub and doing the night or something that wouldn't be the same. That was never an option. That did metamorphose did that too. I think it was two years ago. They got hit by typhoon winds. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the party, but it's a huge techno party, over 10,000 people. They couldn't... couldn't even start the party. The winds were too strong. They couldn't put the speakers up and they realized, okay, they had to cancel before anyone even arrived. What they did is they quickly called up some connections in Tokyo and set up a number of events. I believe that night or maybe that weekend and also throughout the week, I think some artists stayed. So for them, that made sense and it was cool. Because you've got artists in town, you've got people like Underground Resistance and Minilogue and characters like that. Hey, they're in Tokyo, let's do something. But something like that never occurred to, never crossed my mind. Labyrinth is outdoors and it is what it is. For a lot of these artists who didn't get to play, I mean, this isn't just another gig for them. I'm sure a lot of them were probably as disappointed that they didn't get to play as the crowd is that they don't get to see them. Do you have any plans or hopes to bring them back, give another chance to a lot of these artists? Yeah, who's more disappointed? I'm not sure. I think the artists are probably... it probably hit the artists a lot harder than it hit the crowd. Because for the crowd, the typhoon became almost a part of the event. It's, you know, you're packing up your tent that final morning as things are blowing away would have been part of those memories. For the artists, I think that, you know, the memories are probably a little bit more bitter. In terms of bringing guys back, you know, we're close friends with all the guys. who didn't play. So whether they're going to play next year or another year, or we're going to do a Tokyo event, I'm sure we'll see all of them. Your sort of main event throwing experience kind of all comes out of Labyrinth. You weren't doing events before. You're an American guy living in Japan. Maybe you won't feel entirely qualified to answer this question, but I wonder if there are some peculiarities, some special challenges. that come from doing an event like Labyrinth in Japan. Special challenges? I'd say, well, I'd kind of flip the question on its head and say, could you do Labyrinth anywhere else? Could you do something Labyrinth outside of Japan? And the answer to that would be no. People have asked me, hey, don't you want to try to do something and do a Labyrinth in Europe? And some promoters have said, do you want to try to do... work together on a labyrinth in Germany. But the idea of doing labyrinth outside of Japan is just totally absurd. The culture I don't think exists anywhere else in the world where you could pull off that kind of event. And by culture, I mean respect for nature, respect for other people, respect for the event itself. I just don't think you could do something as intimate as Labyrinth is outside of Japan. And you make an effort, I mean, kind of flipping what we're talking about on its head again, you make an effort, like, I mean, it's not just about hosting the event here, but it's about keeping it sort of rooted in Japan, keeping it sort of as Japanese a festival as possible. you limit the number of tickets that can be sold outside of Japan, right? Yeah, we set aside 100 tickets that Club Area will mail. Actually this year it's not even mailing it, you have a number and you show that number at the gate so you don't have to mail the tickets overseas. So we do have some international tickets, but yeah, that number's limited. It's not like we're trying to keep people away by the number of tickets, it's just... It's more of a gesture to, oh, we're going to real set aside a few to make life easier for that small crew that's willing to fly from Europe or Australia to come out to the event. But I wouldn't want it to be bombarded by 1,000 or 2,000 characters from Europe. That would change the nature of the event completely. With people coming in from outside of Japan, do you have a sense of how they find the culture of the event? If it is something very different from what they're used to, is there a kind of festival culture shock? I don't know. I think you'd have to ask them. I mean, we always get... very uh well people write to us after the event people experience for the first time um and get very sincere uh you know expressions of gratitude and that they the event made a deep impression one way or another so something that we're doing is having an impact. You've been doing the festival now for 13 years. And, you know, you've sort of hinted at some kind of micro evolutions along the way. There was the way the music had sort of changed with the festival. There was sort of a format. changing with the festival. I mean, do you see this thing as sort of, do you think you've basically got it down or is it still morphing? It's always changing. It changes as my record collection changes and my tastes change. And also the sequencing and the planning is always a reflection. of the previous year. Like in a what works, what doesn't work kind of way? It could be that or well this year I saw this year's event as kind of a part two of last year's. And by that, I mean there were a number of artists who played for the first time last year who I knew they had something else to say by putting them in a different position and having seen the event and reacting or having a chance to react to the event in a different way. So there was a lot of repeats from last year to this year. And that's because I saw them. I saw those two years as kind of two halves. This next year is going to then again be a reaction to that and pushing things in slightly different directions. Having done the festival over this period of time as well, I'm sure you've also witnessed, you know, changes in music more generally, sort of different trends, kind of with the sort of music. that you're interested in? I mean, how have you seen this music changing as you've been doing the festival? Well, fortunately for me, I don't really have to worry too much about these trends in music because my tastes are so specific. I'm so kind of stubborn in what I like. And the event is so removed from the club scene or the techno scene or the house scene that there's no pressure on me to ever book a certain kind of music. People are expecting the event to be a personal statement from us. That's the only pressure there is. There is no pressure of... there has to be this name or that name or the music is going in this direction. So their expectations are that. I think people want to be surprised. So that makes a lot more fun for me. The event has a reputation now that the lineup doesn't matter. We don't have to announce it. People coming to the event is not dependent upon who we book. So that just gives me lots of freedom. It must be pretty cool to have the festival be so kind of caught up in your own personal taste, what you really believe in, what you feel is good, and then to see it be such a success, kind of a validation. Yeah, I've never really thought of it in terms of validation. These tastes are tastes. Sure. They're not to be validated. But I do love bringing out artists that maybe people wouldn't expect us to bring or artists who people wouldn't ever piece together. Most people wouldn't see Outer Space, Petr Dundov, Atom TM, Dozy in any sort of line. Whereas for me, the line is natural. So that's, for me, that's... that's the the most fun part of the game if if you kept doing if it happened to be the case that you you kept doing this year after year and it was like you just weren't getting through to people i mean would you ever consider making a concession making a concession no no no it's not the kind of festival you run no yeah i mean if if the event wasn't able to support the current scale, well, then you'd have to figure out a way to change the scale. But we wouldn't, I've got no interest in conceding anything musically. After sort of the big tragedy that happened here a few years ago, the earthquake and the tsunami, I mean, the sense that I've gotten is that that was a really pivotal moment, I mean, in Japan as a whole, but also in the music scene. There were a lot of artists who were afraid to come afterward. For other artists, it was a source of pride to come back. Right. You know, this is one of the biggest things that has happened in Japan in ages. And I wonder if that had any effect on what you do as a promoter. No, I mean, it didn't change any of my planning in any ways. We did have an event with Peter Van Heusen, which was one of the first events that kind of took place after the earthquake. It was certainly the first event that we did. It was one of the first events, one of the first big ones at UNIT. So I think it impacted. people's perception of the music and what it meant to them. So that event was a particularly important one. It felt like people coming together again and people had been somewhat isolated after the earthquake and it was difficult to go out. Did you want to be in a club? There was a lot of trepidation there. So in terms of emotional resonance, major disasters like that will always have a role. But in terms of changing my thinking, no. Have you already started thinking about next year's event? Of course, yeah. The day we're cleaning up, I'm more thinking of timetables and who we're going to book and asking artists. Have you seen anyone in the past year who would really work here? Yeah, so we're always thinking. It's just an obsession. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you
