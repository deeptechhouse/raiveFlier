Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Greek-born and bred, Argy escaped his homeland at the tail end of his teenage years, and he hasn't looked back. Ever since he's forged a unique career that balances on the edge of mainstream and underground, with seemingly just as many releases on labels like Defected as Versatile. In this free-flowing exchange, we talk about his friendship with Jerome's synonym, his Kashmash-inspired LP as Zodiac Free Arts Club, and the problems associated with his work. with editing tracks by manual gutching. *outro music* ♪ ♪ You want to serve the... Greeks are the best fans. Yeah, they're the best fans. We're the best collectors, the best fans. We know everything. We know all the gossip, you know. But we have a hard time to produce our own things, you know, and be pioneers, become pioneers, and have other people follow us. I think what happened is we lost... We don't believe in ourselves that much. we have this sort of it's called xenomania in greek so it's like this infatuation with foreign countries especially western countries you know so anything that comes from those countries is good but everything comes from our country is not so good this is a very simple i've simplified it a lot but of course of course there's exceptions rule, but stereotypes are there for a reason. Sure. Generally. Apart from financial stereotypes, which are actually manufactured and not real. Well, okay. Go into that. What do you mean by that? Well, you were going to ask me about the financial crisis, I guess. It's a topic. It's a topic. Yeah. Sure. Well, we don't know if it's... natural suicide or if it's a manufacturer sorted by somebody else for us you know sure and I'm not here to talk about this because I'm not so I'm not a specialist and I don't want to talk about things that I don't know that much of but you know people do ask you about it though A lot. And there's a lot of bad humor, especially coming from here, where I live in Germany. Whenever I say I'm Greek, there's always somebody saying, you owe me money. As a joke, which is not very funny. Well, I think this is the first time the Germans, in a long time, can feel like they are like, oh, finally, we have some upper hand here. Yeah, upper hand. And the thing is, you know, for Germany or France to just borrow like 80 billion is nothing really compared to the money they're making out of this business, you know? compared to the weapons they sell every year, or compared to, like, let's say, you know, all this instability, let's say, in Italy or Greece or Spain or Portugal, you know, it's actually good for Germany fast because their bonds are more secure and they're a more secure economy, so the money goes to them, you know. Did it immediately occur to you when you were like 18 or whenever it is that you moved? I mean, did it immediately occur to you as you were growing up? I got to get out of here just to do something. Yes. Figure things out. It was more the everyday life. It wasn't about just the music, you know, it was just the everyday life. I had a lot of. It's not that people didn't get me. It's just I didn't feel free to express myself, you know. And I always looked down and, you know, I wasn't really supported by. I mean, there's no infrastructure for this kind of music there because, I mean, folk music is very strong still up until today, you know, so it's not, if you want to do this seriously, there's no background for this. It's an international artist they bring in. people into parties and that's yeah there's no local infrastructure to build up yeah but even the i mean for this music i mean there's no international artist to bring for techno house i mean the folk music is very prominent still in greece you know so the the you know um traditional music and greek songs What are the clubs there? I mean, is there one that you can even name that was special to you growing up or that you even went to? Actually, in the 90s, there were plenty because we had a lot of tourists coming up. Then when tourism went down a little bit in the last decade, the clubs went down too. But we had the English invasion and the Italian invasion and all that. it was great because we had massive clubs. We had English promoters doing, you know, nights in Rhodes. We had, you know, Italian promoters doing nights in Mykonos, you know, so you had a lot of that and that brought a lot of, you know, great and very bad music too, you know, it's natural. And then we had this decline of tourism in a way, a little bit, and attracted different kinds of tourists, which are more interested in different kinds of dance music. For instance, now in Mykonos, you have those very big trance names. You don't have those more underground names that used to fill... a 5,000 capacity club. Yeah. So the, it's, it's a shift in the focus. The focus has shift, has shifted, you know? Um, so were you going out? I mean, how did you get in contact with electronic music? You keep saying folk music is so big there. But there had to have been like an in. Yes. I mean, there are at the time in the 90s when I started getting into electronic music, there was a lot of that like sort of chill out music coming out and a little trip hop, like a little G-Stone, a little Jazzanova, Grundorfmeister, all that stuff. Ninja tune. So that was my first, uh, like guidance records, let's say Glenn underground. So that was my first contact with, um, let's say more underground electronic music. And that's because we have a lot of bars there and a lot of restaurants. okay that play that type of track yeah it's the soundtrack music so that was my first but that was in a way that's great soundtrack music though you know you know it's the best sound crowd yeah it's the best soundtrack music you can have in a way that and brand you know i don't know like yeah of course so um yeah that was my first contact and then i you know uh i started getting into more house stuff, more up-tempo stuff. And you had a lot of those New York guys coming to Rhodes to play or to Athens. And I would fly to Athens and check somebody out. Then I would fly to Berwick Street in London suddenly and buy those records from Vinyl Junkies where they used to buy them. So I started macking out a little bit. Do you remember a particular DJ that came to Greece? change things for you? When I was a teenager, I just wanted to go out and listen to those like three or five songs that this guy has made or, you know, the hits of the season. So that was me when I was 15, 16, you know, years old. So, which is what teenagers do today. You know, I wasn't looking for a new experience in music. This, this I developed much later. And now I'm, yes, now I'm looking for that journey and I can appreciate a six hour set. But back then I was. You know, I was just typical, you know, boy. You went to see Jerome Synonym and you wanted to hear Sandcastles. Exactly. Something like that, you know. I mean, Jerome never made it to Rhodes. I think he made it to Athens. But yeah. Basically, yeah. When did, I mean, but you were still going deeper at the same time. At the same time, yes, because, you know, that's what separated me. And that was the itch. And that was the need for art in a way, you know. The need for art. Yeah. That's the interesting way of putting it. I can't explain it. It's just the need for breaking it down and doing it your own way and producing something and leaving your own mark in the history of what you are really in love with. You're in dance music and you want to leave your own mark within that path of dance music. Would you say you have a signature? Well, my signature would be that I have no real signature, I think, you know. Yeah. It's a very difficult and brave thing to do, I think, in our times when, you know, it takes years to develop. It took me years to sort of train my audience and the audience in general through my choices that they are not now surprised in a bad way for all these weird and different records that I do. I do number one tracks on Defected, but I also do very weird, obscure techno and versatile. Some of my records sell... 300 vinyl copies and some sell a lot. And I don't plan for this to happen. It's very natural. And I simply express myself and sometimes they become big records. Sometimes they fly under the radar of the more mainstream audience or nobody even hears the tracks. You mentioned you were flying to London. Seems like pretty serious. Yeah, I was. You were just flying to visit. I would fly to go and check the universities because I went to a music university there. So I was trying to enroll. So I had to deal with that stuff. Did your parents want you to be an architect? Yeah, I mean, they didn't want me to be an architect, but that's the background, right? So my father's an architect, my mother's an architect. It was there for me to take it. But as with everything, I just don't like things when they're ready for me to take. So, you know, I had to create something new. But they were super cool about it. And I was fortunate to have, you know, such open-minded parents, you know. Actually, my father told me that he couldn't bear the thought of me coming back to him when I was 30 and being depressed and saying that it's his fault that, you know, I ruined my life. That kind of thing. A sad architect. Yeah. The worst architect. So maybe he did it for himself at the end of the day. What kind of buildings do they make? My father is more active these days, architect. My mother is more into the furniture business. Okay. But my father is a very big Mies van der Rohe fan. Mm-hmm. Tadao Ando, this kind of more monumentalist. architects. Louis Kahn. Yeah. This kind of people. Interesting. He doesn't make those buildings, but that is definitely... Because, I mean, there's no... It's an inspiration. It's a guiding point. I mean, you can't really make those monuments nowadays if you're not, you know, somebody massive. Yeah. Sorry to go back to London. That's okay. It must have been quite a culture shock. It was a slap in the face, yeah, because I went there with my Bossa Nova records and everybody was listening to Elektra. It was insane. I went there with my Nicola Conte records thinking I was the greatest and I was 18 years old and I used to listen to that stuff and I went there and... all those dark bass lines suddenly. Well, you must have been, you know, and then, but I got it very fast. I'm very perceptive. So I just got into it. You just started buying electro records. Yeah. I just went out, partied a little bit, got in touch with the scene and, uh, Phonic was a very important record store at the, at the time. So they brought all the more like contemporary things and, you know, I remember we were also going to the Forward Nights even. They started back then. In 2000, when was that? 2005? Maybe. There were still, yeah, there were there. So there were many, many things. There were small stuff in London, but very influential, you know. And I started, you know, going to those nights and buying those records. And within a year, I had a record on, at the time, most relevant. What's that? It was Parker Flat in 2000 and end of 2004, 2005. Yeah. You had created, you'd started producing when you got to London. No, no, I was, I've been producing since I was like 15. Okay. With very basic stuff in Rhodes, but making that abstract, down-tempo, trip-hop music. Yeah. When you got to London, you changed the way that you were producing what you were producing. In the beginning, I was in denial. I didn't want to admit that I was left behind a little bit. But very fast, I got over it and I was like, okay. But it wasn't necessarily expression, musical expression. It's not what I do now. The way you talk about it, it seems like you were kind of caught up in being like, I was putting sounds together in order to make an example of music. That's not expression. Even if some tracks were okay or people liked them, I don't necessarily relate to them today. When did that change? That changed... That changed, I think, well, it slowly changed. I can't say it changed on the 31st of January 2009, but, you know. But didn't she, like, there must have been a track where when you finished it, you were like, you know what? That's satisfying. Well, it was satisfying. My first track was also satisfying. It's a different satisfaction. It's more like it's the intention. So it's not the end of the procedure. It's the beginning. When you sit on the chair and you're like, okay, I'm going to make a track for me. I'm going to express this certain feeling. So it's the intention rather than, you know, what it gives you afterwards. Do you think you needed those other tracks to get you to a point you needed to get that kind of experience? Well, that was an amazing training. No school can give you that. I was very fortunate to be able to train while releasing records. And that's something people actually... Some people are scared to do today. They, you know, they're caught up with Hollywood and they don't release records and they don't have friends to tell them that the records are bad or, you know, you know, but failure, being vulnerable to failure is very charming. You know, I'd rather be, you know, Damien Hirst, who everybody hates and everybody loves at the same time, rather than being Jeff Koons and just making big inflated dogs all the time. You know what I mean? Sort of. Poker Flat seemed like, was it the only place that you sent tracks to? You knew that that's the place. At the time, it was also Morris Audio. I really liked the label. It was a few labels that I really liked at the time. Back in 2005, it was Morris Audio. It was Poker Flat. Actually, I didn't send them the tracks to Poker Flat. I sent them for Dissu for Steve Buggs of the label at the time. Sure. And I really liked, at the time, Troum and all that stuff, you know, Raum, Raum Musik, and all that stuff. So, and I released some records on those labels too, at the time, after Love Doze. But Steve Buck was the first who took the risk. I mean, it wasn't such a big risk back then to bring out a newcomer, you know, but it was still a risk. Were you shocked at the reception? I didn't get it. Really? I didn't get it. I thought this was normal. I didn't get it. I didn't get it. I didn't get it and I didn't know how to behave. And I... Were there some... I didn't behave correctly all the time. I made mistakes. Name one. Well, I didn't appreciate the fact that everybody's different and everybody should have the right to be different. Sure. And I was... I was very critical about things. Too critical. Critical for this world. Too critical for this world as it is today, yes. It's a very interesting scene in that there's not a lot of room. Well, the thing is, because the focus is not talent at the moment. The focus is public relations at the moment, you know. Well, there is music too. The focus is always going to be music. But there's, you know, there's... Public relations is very important. And that's why labels have turned to PR agencies, most of them, if you want to do good business. Well, you say it's hard to bring out new artists. You're selling more than just music. You're selling lifestyle. I found it very interesting that you're doing booking with Cadenza. Yes. Which it seems like a very good fit for you. as you were saying about the can do a record on defective exactly record on versatile like that's the exact sort of this i love this balance the best thing about cadenza it's that it's such a at the moment it's such a popular brand but it's associated with the underground it hasn't lost its touch with the underground and in a way that's what i do too you know as i told you before I have some commercial records and I have some very underground releases too. So that sort of personality, that sort of character fits perfectly within this brand. And I think Luciano is the most underground commercial DJ in the world right now. And he's very brave for that. He's playing in main stages for 10,000 people. And he's playing electronica almost sometimes. Even if he uses sometimes some help tracks in order to get detention. the next five ones will be very obscure. There's nobody who takes this kind of chance. It's just him and Villa-Lobos at the moment who created that sort of, you know, festival audience and at the same time playing very obscure records. There's nobody else in Pasha, in Ibiza, who does what, you know, what Vagabundo is doing at the moment. This is a place that you usually hear, you know, other stuff. It's a very tough and interesting place to be, I think. Which one? Where he is. Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, doing this and you're getting it from both sides. Like, yeah, the underground is like, oh, what is he doing? And the overground is like. can't you play those five or six songs that I want you to play by the end of the night? I think his charisma carries out. Of course. That's the other thing that can't be denied with him. Yeah, no, you can't deny that. And when I hear him... playing last week at some point I was listening to what he said it was like 6 in the morning and I was it was out in the jungle and I was just hearing the songs and it was like hearing the nature you know it was that close and at the same time he had like 10-15 thousand people who were used to listening to David Guetta in a way you know because that space is used for many types of music not just our music do you think you could get there? I don't know if that's my intention. I don't know if that's my intention. And I think for these things to happen, you can't plan them really, you know. And I don't think Luciano ever planned really for this to happen. Sometimes you have to be there because if you try to understand this scene or plan this something with logic and rationally, you will fail. Sometimes you have to be there in the right time, the right moment, and something happens to you, you know, and sometimes not. I feel like Love Dose could have been. you know, you going down a certain path and then it seemed like you. I don't know. It seemed like you decided not to. I wouldn't expect someone to put out that record six years later doing Zodiac Free Arts Club. Yeah, you're right. Well, you have two choices, two paths. You can either take the safe side, which will get you probably... you know, some immediate returns, you know, but not maybe the long run. And then you can take, you know, the other path, which is you trying to do something that your heart tells you. You know, and you're driven by your instinct. And that maybe doesn't give you immediate return, but in the long run, you're more at peace with yourself. You know, and I chose path number two. But thankfully, I didn't... completely isolate myself and I'm really happy where I'm now because in a way I'm sort of in peace with myself but I still have a very dedicated audience that follows me and tell me about that record the Zodiac Free Arts Club thing Zodiac Free Arts Club it's named after this West German club? Yeah, the West German club. Well, it came at a time where I was not really having any focus anywhere. I was a bit... lost but in a good way I guess I already started my own label these days and I had a few releases there and that took a lot of energy and I was just trying to find something else that interested me you know and it was a very difficult year for me as a person with my friendships and music and everything. Everything was just not there. So I was looking for answers in general. So I was like, I spent a lot of time on myself. Listening to Manuel Gatching, Sun Rain. Yes. Listening to a lot of that. Hanging out in flea markets. You know, buying all those weird German 60s. crowd rock records and appreciating stuff that I've never appreciated before in music. I appreciated time differently. So I got into it, like very much into it. Like whenever I discover something new, I get lost into it and I can't think about anything else. And that for me becomes the world. And that will last for a certain period and then I'm going to get out of it. But not hate it afterwards. It's just going to take a place in my life and put it in a drawer and just leave it there for a little bit. But yeah, I discovered that and I went absolutely crazy. I was like, what is this? I'm very nostalgic about things that happened in the past. That's another thing. And I love... the way there was the naivety of this post-war Germany, you know, and even the graphics and the amazing covers and everything. It was mind-blowing, you know? So... Yeah, I very fast tried to get into it and understand how these people made this music. Of course, I didn't take tons of LSD to make that music, you know, and you can't copy an era because you can't be that person. You can't be Amundul in a commune and pretend to be them. You can't do that. So I tried to do it my own way. That's why the record sounds more pop in a way. The arrangements are not like 50 minutes. There are three minutes, four minutes, five minutes. So in a way, it's that music, but made for today's patients and lifestyles. Because you don't have time to listen to 50-minute tracks. That's what struck me about the record was that it felt like sketches. because of the weight of the past of these 15 minute tracks. I was kind of like, Oh, I wish that could go on. Yeah, exactly. But you know, people just, um, used to like put on their machines and just trip. You don't do that. You do that and then you edit it down. Well, I don't know. I was never that kind of person who just improvised for like six hours and then cut down. I just don't have that background. I don't know why. I just never worked like that. I'll do the arrangement like I think it is. It's usually like seven, eight minutes, and then I'll bring it down to six, seven, that's it. Cut three minutes, and that's it. I never go on for hours. That's why I think I never played live, you know? I was always touring as a DJ. Do you think you could do Zodiac live? Would you want to? I wouldn't be able to. do it properly so I wouldn't want to do it. I don't think I can go out there and really do it. I don't want to do... Is that another reason why you wouldn't play live? A lot of people say to do it properly or to make it look like you're doing something takes a lot. I don't think I have the talent for that to be honest. I'm not a natural. for it. I'm a natural DJ. I've been doing it all my life. I know exactly what to do. I walk in the club. In two minutes, I scan the whole place. I know exactly who's there. I know exactly where they want to listen. I know exactly what to play. And I do my job and my art. I do my best and that's why I'm a natural DJ. I could never walk into a club and I think and try to make dance music out of my machines and, you know, loop stuff together and play. I don't know. It just doesn't feel... It seems like you're also in a lot of ways locked into... I mean, there is a lot of possibility with a live set. but at the same time you got the songs and you say scan the crowd and know what they need and it's like yeah Yeah, and I'm not my favorite producer. I'm not so much into myself, really, to be honest. Like, I'm not, I don't, you know, I barely, I play my tracks, but not so much, actually. You will never hear me play, like, more than three of my own tracks, or more than two. Maybe sometimes I don't play any of my tracks. There's so much amazing music out there. I can't, like, you know, and I like to jump from 92 to 2012. How are you going to do that with, you know, if you're a very talented live musician, yes, you can do it. But as I said before, I don't think that's not the case with myself. Who is your favorite producer these days? I don't know my favorite producer, but as I said to somebody else in another interview, I'm not so much impressed by sound as I am with attitude. So I love people that have been here for ages. People that started in 1990 and they're still relevant today. Carl Craig is one. You can't deny that. It's unquestionable. I like people who are unquestionable. you know, in a way like people that, that release records, you know, that it's not because they're releasing on that label that's hyped. Now it got success. People can listen to it with their, with their eyes closed and they love it. And you know, it's, it's something, it's a product that's honest and unquestionable. You remind me quite a bit of Joe Clausell. Hardliners? I don't know. It's just like a very... It's an outlook, I guess. You have a very similar mentality, I think, when it comes to music and how you approach things. Do you feel an affinity for... I mean, you've obviously worked with Jerome and other... sort of New York deep house? Do you feel like an affinity? And Joe is a massive inspiration for me, as you mentioned. Yeah. Do you feel like an affinity towards that? I mean, do you look back to that era and think that they kind of had it right? They did have it right, but I'm not trying to recreate that. Of course. I'm not a purist at all, and I don't like people that are purists. And I'm not trying to relive that era. I'm not under any illusions. It's just that, you know... I think they did have something very special going on because I can relate to that mentality of Body and Soul when they just played songs, you know? It wasn't so focused on club music. Is that how you DJ? Yes, in a way, yes. But in a 2012 way, you know, not in that amazing Harvey way, you know. Sure. In another way, as a 27, almost 27-year-old would do today. How do you update that? How do you make that? New. How do you make that new? I think it's all about context these days. I don't think, like... I don't think futurism is when you're always trying to do something very new or very futuristic. For me, when you're trying to do... For instance, my take on futuristic music last year was revival. Because I wasn't necessarily in agreement with the kind of music that was coming out today. So that was kind of... My art was kind of like... I was rebelling against that. So for me, that... that is futurism art so you're a bellingus and that's your product right it's not necessarily this typical 80s sci-fi movie futurism which everything is spaceships like that kind of more jeff mills style which is also amazing but it's not what i do well it's funny because all of that futuristic stuff now obviously is the past So it's catching up. Exactly. It's very confusing. And I love products that you can't really tell when they're made. I think they're very... I'm into timelessness. Okay. You know, like, you, in a way, you look at an Andy Warhol piece and you're like, okay, that's done then and then. But you look at a Kelly Ellsworth piece and you don't really know when it was made. It could be made yesterday or it could have been like, you know, 50 years ago. And I'm into that kind of. I don't mind if something is very simple because usually the things that last are very simple. But if you get it right, you know, it's a very, I think it's great. Like timeless, creating timeless products, something great. I imagine it's quite tough though. Because the impulse would be to put things on it and add things and have adornments. Yeah. And only time can tell it. actually. So yeah, we just have to wait. Even if I tell you today that my, yeah, my last album was timeless and I did this and that, we have to wait. We have to wait 20, 30 years and then we can see. Do you think there's something that's defined your career thus far that is going to stand the test of time? Or is there something you'd like? To stand the test of time and for you to be known for. That's why I'm here. That's why I was here six years ago and I'm still here today. And it's not a long time, but in dance years, it is a long time, I think. Seven years. And, you know, not lose focus. There'll be, you know, and have a, how do you call that? A trajectory. Yeah. Wish people could see my hands, you know. It's something going up. That could be many things, though. How did you meet Jerome? He seems... I keep bringing him up. And I do because, to me at least, it seems like he's been an influence on you. Not just musically, but a massive influence as a friend. You know, he... and as a colleague too. I mean, the moment, you know, he walks in my door, he will say something to me, which will be like two words. My record will become, you know. 30% better immediately. His own point, you know, you need people to tell you exactly what's up, you know? You don't need people to tell you how great you are all the time, right? So you need real friends to tell you, you know, like, I'll be like, okay, what do you think of that track? It's like, bro, you can't put that out. Are you serious? It's actually a pretty good impression. And I'll be like, what? You don't like this track? Bro, you can't put that out. I was like, what? This is the best track I've ever made. He's like, you're joking. Have a glass of wine. Go have a welcome back and listen to it again. I'll be like, okay. So I do it and I realize he was actually right. You know, so that's Jerome Sydenham. Is he ever specific or is it ever, is it always just this general, bro, you just can't do that? He has a very unique relationship to music. You know, he, I don't know exactly how to put it, but he's very... He's ambiguous when he talks about it and when he talks about your track. But in a way, we understand each other now perfectly. So even if it's very abstract, he's never going to say, oh, that minor chord is out of tune with that vocal, so you have to take that off and just put it higher. He's going to be like, I don't get it. Sure, sure. I just don't get it. And then you'll be like, okay. That was the one thing that struck me when I talked to him a couple of years ago, I guess now. He also mentioned that having that support system of people saying, no, don't do that. It's so important. People in Hollywood right now, they're missing those kind of friends, I think. You need people there to tell you how bad your records are. Who else tells you how bad your records are? People that have nothing to gain out of me. Real friends, basically, who our ties, our relationships are not. business relationships and it's just very natural and they have nothing to lose nothing to win and it is what it is you know unconditional relationships with people and yeah these people are super important super important do you tell Jerome when his work stinks yeah I tell him all the time Why did you move to Berlin? Is it the same reason that everyone moved to Berlin? No, I did not come here to party. Because at the time I was not partying at all. I came here because I didn't have enough space in London. In London I was living in a 20 square meter flat. And I did everything in one room. I slept there, I worked there, I had my kitchen there. you know, went to the toilet in the same place. It was just like crazy. And then I was also over of London a little bit like that, you know, it was, I was a 22 year old kid. Just, you know. thought he's seen everything that London had to offer and, you know, wanting to go to Berlin to, to, to, you know, get a bigger space, room, make music and, and meet people that he thought then that they would be really interesting. You know? And is that, been the case uh no that's not really the case but berlin yeah but berlin has been a great uh mirror you know i i had the time and the space and the absence of people and and the absence of distractions to take a look at myself and become a much better person and, yeah, and, you know, grow up basically, become a man. You feel like you're there yet? I think I'm much closer. Yeah? Yeah. Let us talk about these days. These days records? or these days as seen this week? Records. My record label. I've read enough interviews with you to say, to know that it's your playground. You love to be able to do anything. I actually copy and paste that. Factory Records is an inspiration. Factory Records, yeah. you had started with a very day one, day two, day three. Why, why did you end that? Or was that always like a planned trilogy? Was it true? It's a trilogy. Okay. Everything comes in three in life, right? Sure. So I thought I was like, that's it. Day one, day two, day three. Okay. What has the plan been? There's been no plan. There's been no plan. You just get to send records and they're great and you have to put them out. Yes, basically. It's not a record company. It's a record label. You know, there's no structure behind it. It's just me running around like crazy trying to save my label from all these taxes, German letters that I get from the government. This and that, you know, it's a very unorganized, expensive playground because all these things cost money. And I don't make any money out of it, you know. I just do it for just pleasure, to pleasure myself. It's an artistic masturbation of sorts. You felt like you needed to have it, though. You felt like you needed to have a place. It was impossible to live without it. That seems very... Absolutely. Definitive. Yeah. Because I've been working with many, you know, popular mainstream labels. Mainstream in our world. I don't mean, you know, Cocoon, Objectivity, ProcreFlat. cadenza you know so i needed that other side of me that i could just take all the responsibility on me and you know either sell nothing or sell a lot or whatever or make that um cover that cost more than the mastering cost you know yeah and i had to have that because that's how i express myself of and I couldn't you know I need that for my you know that's what I do basically what has been the guiding sort of aesthetic design principle finally I know the first three like they yeah yeah connect right the rest simply don't connect because I just started doing more abstract things by myself. In the beginning, I had a designer who used to help me, and then I got all into it myself. And then it got very spiritual with all that cosmic stuff. Before, it got all crazy. Everybody was whacking out, blasting skies, and it got very boring. You know, I was doing that stuff at the time that Mountain of One were doing it too. Like kind of that kind of covers, you know? Sure. And then now it's become more of a, I found a cheaper way of doing stuff because, you know, it works better like that. And I just do it myself and each record has its own little story on it. And I just, it's... Really not planned. It's spontaneous. I just sit there. Weekend and I'm free. I don't have to tour. And I just sit there and just collect images, put them together. Yes, it's not exactly a factory records, which is my inspiration. I'm not Peter Saville, but the attitude is very similar. What is the... guiding principal Biden, the sub label. Is that all edits? You mean white days? Yeah. Um, yeah, it's all edits. Uh, my favorite, uh, artists either done by me or by other people. We had, um, Brian Ferry, we had Ortega, we had Manuel Göttingen, we had The Veils, we had... Tell me about the Göttingen. Because I listened to the original. It sounded complicated. To do it? Yes, it was quite complicated. It comes from the New Age of Earth. Asher, New Age of Earth, is an amazing, tremendous record by... Manuel Gautien. And yeah, track is called Sun Rain. And I played it. I was playing, I was like, oh, I could play this. So I wanted to play it for Parma. So I just made an edit and put a kick behind a 909 kick. It sounded like a very beautiful thing that Vince Watson would do, you know? So I was like, okay. And something that Joe Colosal would play, you know, in a weird moment. So I was like, caught up with this my enthusiasm and then i spent two days warping that thing because this was all you know weird weird machines going you know up and down you know it was a complete pain in the ass you know and i finally got it there and i was super happy with it and everybody was excited and then i would just cut the record and the next thing i hear is Warden Sound calling me and telling me Manuel's wife is going to be really upset about this. Because they just sit there, they spend all their days trying to find bootlegs. on the internet. So I was like, wow. And what do we do now? I pressed a big amount at the time because the records were doing very well. The edits were doing very well. And I had to contact the guy. So I did the artwork with a quote that he used 40 years back for his wife then, a different one, girlfriend. Maybe not the best. And I sent him some copies and I wrote him a very nice letter. And they were like, okay, sounds great. You can post it. You can release it. We just want a cut of the sales. Not a cut of the percentage that we are owed, like owed from the four tracks. We need 50% from basically, I think, you know. It wasn't a very fair deal, but it wasn't very fair for me to do it either. So, you know, we just did it. And everybody was happy at the end. The D-Edge comp. D-Edge comp. How did you approach? Yes, because DJ mix these days, it's got to be something special. Yeah. But I mean, I guess at the very least, everyone has something to say behind it because of where we're at. Yeah. To be honest, I just want to do a mix, a good one. Nobody gave me the opportunity to do one. So I created my own mix and I picked my favorite club at the time, which was The Edge and a great experience and memories that from from Sao Paulo, from Brazil. And I put them I put that all this energy into a project, which, you know, did you do all the licensing? Yeah. That must have been a headache. Yeah. Yeah. I'm never doing that again. Somebody else is going to take care of that. Actually, I'm never going to release another CD compilation on my label either. But the artwork doing the artwork was really good. This playground seems like it's littered with broken toys and sort of sad children. It's exactly how it is. It's exactly how it is. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You got that right. So yeah, it's not a mix. It's not a new school sort of this type of mix that people put like. 3,589 tracks all in one hour. It's more of an old school mix. It has, I think, close to 15 tracks. It's like the way I DJ, basically. Super energetic and goes all over the place. like aimed for the dancer for dancing, you know, and, uh, with the moments, you know, and, um, the outros and, and that's it. It's nothing, um, groundbreaking in terms of technology or, you know, you seem very, um, devoted to the old school. You said you like nostalgia. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But at the same time, you always make a strong point to say it's updated for now. Yes. And as I said before, it's all about context, you know, for instance, with my label, with these days, we do put out. old school records, old school sounding records. But at the same time, we put out on the same EP or on the same compilation something completely new. So for me, like being new is not just, you know, putting a series of new things, but the context, the way this indie-looking artwork, factory-looking, you know, indie-looking artwork, how it's... comes together with house music, how that, how like a Martinez Brothers records comes together with a Stephen Brown English techno record, how that comes together with a Beat Pharmacy remix, DJ Duke, myself, Radio Slave, and Marlon D, that's new. That's something futuristic. You know, to have all these people with that artwork, that connection, that's future. I think that's my future. At least, you know, it's not about, as I told you before, it's not about spaceships and equations and how to go to the moon. That was for me, that for me is very 80s. You know, are you into sci-fi? No. I think of those old Detroit guys, they're into sci-fi a lot. Because in the 80s, they were at the age where that was new and that was groundbreaking at the time, like Space Invaders, you know, or some New Yorker. I still care he's crazy about video games you know and these people but it's because they're older and they were they got in touch with it when it came out and that was the future when yeah they were at that impressionable age where all of these things aesthetics are coming exactly exactly your vision of the future is very hermaphrodite I wouldn't have picked that word out of the blue to use. It's very clean lines. Very minimalist. Very classic. I like explosions too, but they don't last very long. Like fireworks. Fireworks, they go off. They're impressive. For a few seconds and then they die. They're ashes. Would you say that defines you as a DJ as well? Like you don't go for the fireworks, the explosions. It's, it's, um. Or you'll throw a grenade every once in a while. I'll throw a grenade in somebody's mouth. Yeah. Sometimes. very classy but it will be in a very classy way in a very classy way yeah exactly A piece of me. My community.
