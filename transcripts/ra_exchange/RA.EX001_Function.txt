Hello and welcome to the first edition of Resident Advisor's Exchange, a new series of podcasts that we'll be doing on a weekly basis, where we talk to the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. I'm pleased to bring you this first RA Exchange with a New York techno veteran, Dave Sumner, a.k.a. Function. Over the past few years, Sumner has found fame in underground techno circles as part of the San Juan District Collective alongside Regis and Silent Servant. But as our lengthy chat reveals, his roots go far deeper than the recent exploits of the shadowy collective. He's been around since the early 90s, promoting DJing and... producing techno and even a little bit of house on occasion. I caught up with Dave at his Berlin apartment in September to talk about the New York scene, playing at Sonar's massive main stage as part of Sanwell District, and much more. Did you grow up in New York? Yes. You were born there? I was born in Brooklyn and raised in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and New Jersey. I always kind of wished I grew up my whole life in New York, but... So there was a stigma when you went to New Jersey? Yeah, I mean that is the ultimate stigma in the New York area. There's this... When did you move to New Jersey? Was it like as a teenager? Seventh grade, yeah, when I was 13. Very impressionable time, of course. Yeah, well, it was a weird one because at that point... there were a lot of families moving out to the suburbs for a lot of the same reasons my parents moved us out there. My dad grew up on the streets of Brooklyn and, you know, it was tough. You had to be tough. He had three brothers and, you know, they grew up on the streets of New York. So it was kind of almost a status thing to move to New Jersey in a way. It was like we're moving on up. Yeah, exactly. Exactly, yeah. Of course, from your perspective, in a way, it was like moving to Jersey. Yeah, and, you know, it's like one of these things where... You know, everybody in New York, especially Brooklyn, like, I think of all the boroughs, I think people from Brooklyn. are the most proud. Growing up, you'd always see an Italian-American guy with a tattoo on his shoulder that just said Brooklyn. You never saw that for Queens or Manhattan or Staten Island or the Bronx. And they're so proud that then they would always make fun of suburban. You know, you're from Jersey, you're from Jersey. You always hear about me saying that I'm from New York and born and broken. You never really hear me talk about it. from New Jersey, you know, because it's like, and, you know, I went to, I finished middle school, went to high school and college out there in New Jersey, and as soon as I was able to, I moved right back to Manhattan because it's Jersey. It's the suburbs, you know. When you moved back to Manhattan, did you have a job or anything? Was it simply, I have to get back to Manhattan, I don't care how? No, no, I found a job first and it's still one of the most memorable times of my life. And a lot of the things that I'm doing now stemmed from that situation. I used to work at a music store named Rogue Music. It was on 30th Street between 7th and 8th Avenues. And it wasn't a storefront. It was kind of like a vintage analog synthesizer shop that was almost by appointment only, but not appointment only, but it was on the 10th floor. It was the type of thing that you had to know about you know and it had a cult following and It was also right around the corner from Madison Square Garden so our clients were always just like I was selling the studio to like old dirty bastard and the Beastie Boys and like you know it's constantly You know and at that shop. I worked with Dennis Ferrer who basically got me my first record deal because he had started Sinewave with Damon Wilde and I knew Damon from the early days at Limelight, from DJing and stuff like that. I was always playing stuff on Experimental and early Sinewave stuff. Dennis was really good friends with Damon, so Damon would come in to hang out with Dennis or buy stuff. And then I became better friends with him. And the thing was that I wound up getting an apartment. on the 15th floor above Rogue Music. So I had this, I mean, this was 96, so rent was a lot cheaper. You got a lot more space in Manhattan. So my old roommate and I had half a floor on the 15th floor overlooking Madison Square Garden and the Empire State Building, and the whole front of the apartment was just windows and it was just magic. It basically, it's... the thing that happens in my life that helped set everything else up. It put my mind in that state. Before you got the job in road music, you said you were DJing at Limelight and already into electronic music. I mean, do you remember the moment or the track or the DJ or the party that you went to that sort of was the jumping off point, the first? Yeah, I mean, 1991 at Limelight is still the... What happened there is the high that I will forever chase. Clash of Clans. Clash of Clans. What happened during that era I've yet to come across anything that can hold a candle to it. And one of the reasons why I'm living in Berlin is because I came over... I had been to Berlin before, played in Berlin before, but before I decided to move here I came over for two weeks and just to see if it was right. And in that two week period I was staying with Carl Regis and we had a couple of studio sessions. that wound up becoming some of the strongest Sanwell District releases and helped bring Sanwell District to the point where it is now. And then while I was over during that period, I went to Berghain for the first time. And walking into Berghain for the first time is the only situation since walking into Limelight. the first time that gave me that feeling again. What was the music that was being played there in 1991? In 91... It was, you know, there was the whole Disco 2000 thing on Wednesdays, and that was Michael Ellig and the Club Kids, and that whole scene. That's the movie and book Party Monster. Yeah, Party Monster and that whole thing, which I'm very happy to say. I had front row seats to that whole situation. I was friends with all those people, and it's kind of funny to... see movies be made about something that you experienced firsthand, like kids and Party Monster. You know, I remember when I'd go to NASA, another party that was more of like a teen kind of rave party that was at Shelter that was by DB and Scotto. I remember the first time I ever saw Chloe Sevignyay, she was working the coat check there. And I just remember looking across the room and being like, who is that girl? She's so beautiful. And then she was in Kids, you know? And then Boys Don't Cry won an Oscar, you know? So there's a lot of cool things that happened during that period, which... inspired me to make a life out of it, you know? - Was it the parties? Was it the music? Was it something else? - It was definitely the music, but also, you know, that was the end of an era of New York that... that doesn't exist anymore. And even though it seemed fresh and new to me, it was actually the tail end of, it was the very tail end of the death of Downtown. If Andy Warhol would have still been alive, he would have been there as well, you know? And that whole cast of characters from the factory and the whole Warhol scene was part of that. And, you know, later on, I started promoting events in New York based on trying to recreate what I experienced when I was a kid. Because, you know, after a while, when the shit hit the fan, it was the kind of thing that... What was going on there? I was 17, 18 years old and I'd look around and be like, how is this happening? This is not going to end easily. This is going to end in tears. Did it feel like a losing battle when you were sort of... trying to recreate. Absolutely, because at the time that I was starting to do that, everything was moving out of clubs. And, you know, in the 80s, in late 70s, throughout the 80s, and into the early mid 90s, everything happened in really big clubs in New York. It was not out of the ordinary to go to a club and see Madonna dancing on the dance floor. When I was 17 or 18 years old, I was friends with this Hispanic kid. And it was during the time that Madonna had done that video with... I forget the name of the video. And she was always in the press like... She was really into Latin American guys. She was known for, she even said in books, how her background singers would drive around in a limousine and pick up Hispanic men. you know and so like I was friends with this one kid who's Hispanic and You know we want to dance wearing Madonna just started making out. You know it's like It's priceless. You can't so obviously I wanted to Once that got lost I wanted to see that side of New York again and I don't know. It's never going to happen again because that was an original time that you can never try to recreate something. When did you first DJ though? Like when did you make the jump from crowd audience member to... I mean, like I was saying before, the first time I walked into that club, I was sold. I was like, I'm going to work here, I'm going to play here, and my life is going to be based around this. I'm in it for life. Bice must flow. Bice must flow. Bice must flow. What they did with that club at that time was... incredible. It was every week you'd go there and the decor would be different. There was, you know, there was the main dance floor and the main area and then in the back there were this kind of like labyrinth of rooms. The one main room was called the shampoo room and then in back of that there was like a stairwell that went upstairs and then they basically moved the walls around so every week you'd go there would be it felt like a new club new art direction and the art director that they had there at the time was absolutely brilliant and what he would do it was mind blowing and you know as a kid Coming from New Jersey, I had been DJing at clubs in New Jersey during college and stuff like that. And even after I started playing at Limelight, I would still play in New Jersey, but it was just cheesy in comparison. But Limelight was... the thing that made me realize that I wanted to live in Manhattan and I wanted to play in clubs in Manhattan. And I became friends with some promoters there and they checked me out as a DJ and they decided that they wanted me to be their DJ. So when they would... start promoting they started out promoting for the club but then they started getting their own nights and I was their resident DJ and so I was 18 years old when I first started playing there I had a residency there but it was only on it was on the main floor but it was on Thursday nights and Thursday nights were the slower night Wednesdays was Disco 2000, Thursdays the party was always changing because it was never really super busy, and then Fridays was Future Shock with Jeff Mills and Repeat as the residents. And that is... my connection to limelight i i thought disco 2000 was cool because there were freaks it was really colorful it's a scene that has i have yet to see anything that could come close to that because it was out there you know i was like michael alec was at the helm and kyoki was the the resident but It was magic. But what I was really into was Future Shock Fridays. The promoter there was this guy, Lord Michael, and he was really ahead of the curve on a lot of things. He, in the nightclubs, broke techno. At that time, you know, Adam X and Frankie Bones and Heather Hart and Jimmy Crash and all of them, they had... Groove records in Brooklyn and they were doing they started doing storm rave and that they started the whole rave thing but in the clubs it was the the best party in in clubs was Future Shaw Fridays. You say that there was a big difference back then between raves and clubs. Were there completely different audiences going to these things? Would no one who went to a Storm Rave go to Limelight? No, there was definitely a lot of bleed. But, yeah, I'd say the Stormrave parties were more kids from Brooklyn that were huge fans of Frankie Bones. Bones had his own thing, you know, he... was sort of like a cult figure, you know? And even more so than Lord Michael with Future Shop at Limelight, Bones was responsible for... guerrilla marketing techno um in in brooklyn in bensonhurst which is like where saturday night fever was set you know like this very italian american macho area and um they In Bensonhurst, there's this strip called 86th Street, which you can see in Saturday Night Fever. It's like an elevated train track with a street underneath it that it was just a strip. And on the weekends, you know, there was just like these typical Italian Americans like in Cadillacs that are all, you know. like really extravagant you know wheels and decorations in the car like stuff like that and Frankie Bones and his friends and followers would like Frankie Bones was really big about doing mixtapes and at this time I guess probably 90 he had come over from playing a lot in the UK and he was like Carl Regis and Pete Female, they always knew about Frankie Bones when they were younger because they'd go out to see the Stone Roses and Frankie Bones was opening and he's playing for like 80,000 people. And at that time in 87, 88, 89, Bones was really prolific and really massive. and really big in the UK and was getting received really well in the UK and remixing 808 State. Were you immediately aware of, I mean, you were plugged into the scene in a certain sense, but were you immediately aware when he came back from the UK and he was this enormous thing, did it seem like... it was almost immediate back in the states that he was a big deal not that big of a deal but at least a big deal well i mean i i started djing when i was 15 i think it was 88 or 89 and some of the first records that i bought were bones break bones breaks you know so i was familiar with And he was even doing big stuff with Tommy Musto, like Musto and Bones, like Dangerous on the Dance Floor. These were like radio hits. At that time, you could turn on the radio any point in the day and hear Dangerous on the Dance Floor. It was getting major, major airplay. So I was already familiar with what he was doing. And then, yeah, when he started doing the whole rape thing, it was like... So I was already familiar with his name, so it wasn't surprising. Were you more drawn to Mills and the club thing, or were you more drawn to the rave thing, or was it just you were drawn to both? I was more of a limelight kid than a storm rave kid. I loved storm rave. I loved the whole concept of, you know, a dirty warehouse that smells like gasoline. That could blow up in any moment. You know, and yeah, during that time, some of the scale of their parties at that time, it was really mind-blowing, really impressive. And, you know, it was the first time I ever saw a stack of speakers that high and that long. What was it about Jeff Mills that... I mean, I will always say Jeff Mills is my teacher. The thing is that I remember specifically there was a time, and it was before I knew who Jeff Mills and Underground Resistance were. I had gone to Groove Records in Brooklyn and I got a copy of the double pack, the Riot EP. The logo was just like a white label with, looked like a stamp but it may have been manufactured, but it looked like a stamp and it just had the UR logo on it. And then about a week later I went to Limelight. And this is before I had started playing there and at first I went on a Thursday night and Then I went again on a Friday, but I went on the Thursday night and I walked in with my friend and the club was completely empty. We got there early, but the club never really got full. I mean, this is a club that held 3,000 people. That night, maybe there was 150 people in the whole club. So it was completely dead, which is why it was so special to me because I felt like I got a... private performance but I walked in the club and all over the club on the walls are like photocopies of that logo that I had on that saw on the record I was like you are I have a record but you are and it still wasn't completely clear on what Underground Resistance was. Is it an artist? Is it a label? Is it... You know, I wasn't sure. And then, as we're standing there, then all of a sudden, you know, we see them setting up a stage and then all of a sudden a performance comes on and it's Underground Resistance live. And it was set up like there was a stage and then behind it there was a drum riser. So it was leveled a bit. So on the drum riser in the back was Mad Mike with a lot of gear surrounding him. Just a huge setup of analog synths. and mixers and stuff. And then below that, there was a setup with turntables and there was Jeff Mills on turntables. And then the MC was Robert Hood. At that time, his name was Rob Noise. So, you know, I think they came out and did Punisher as their first track. He basically said, like, for those of you who know, you know. For those of you who don't know, This is your punishment. you Afterwards, I was 17 or 18 years old. I was just a punter. And because the club was so empty, afterwards I was standing on the stage and Jeff Mills is packing up his stuff and I'm asking him questions like, do you make all this stuff yourself? And he was really polite and totally nice. It's a good thing you didn't go up to Mike and ask him these questions. Yeah, actually... My one friend, like a few, like, I don't know, within a year, there was another friend of mine, we were at Limelight, and he had an Underground Resistance jacket on, and Mad Mike walks up behind him, and he's like, what you know about Underground Resistance? He's like, I don't know, I have every record, and he was like, mm-hmm. But it was cool because that was the first show and then they did the same performance the following night at Future Shock, except Future Shock on Fridays, there was a line down the block and 3,000 people inside, two and a half, 3,000 people. The walls were sweating, it was ram-packed, so it was kind of cool. to get to experience the same performance one night at an empty club and then see it. And these were the types of things that I imagine, aside from just DJing, made you want to work in this... Just an incredible high. Just an incredible... impact that just made me realize that nothing else got me that excited, you know, and that I was destined to be a part of it, you know. When did you start making music yourself? This was before you started working at Rope? Well, the thing was is that You know, when I was finishing college and I was in New Jersey, I had... From the time at Limelight, I started to get these incredible urges to create my own stuff. And, you know, it was the type of thing where there was no internet back then. And I didn't... Because I was out in New Jersey and there were... I wasn't surrounded by people that were in the industry or making music. So I had, and you didn't have the internet, so I had to set out on my own. The thing was, when I was a kid and I first started DJing in my parents' basement, and even before that, The one thing that always struck me about electronic music was that it sounded completely alien to me. I had some musical training when I was a kid, piano lessons and stuff like that, but I always knew what the sound of a piano sounded like, and a drum set, and a saxophone, or a violin. any of those sounds and when I heard electronic music you know even as far back as like the Human League or Soft Cell but then even later on with like Chicago Acid House the first time I ever heard the sound of the 303 I was like what is that? I can't place that sound I don't know what that is and I Then, while I was in college and I'd be working on papers in the library, I'd go and find books. And I was really into, obviously, Kraftwerk when I was a kid. Kraftwerk is the band that changed everything because they were so focused on... cleanest production possible. It was like perfection. It's funny to me that all this is all, everything that's happened with electronic music for the last 30 years, it still amazes me that no one... sounds better than Kraftwerk. Production-wise, what they've done, they're scientists, basically. They've built a lot of their own gear and stuff like that. But it is amazing to me that no one has really stepped above them in terms of quality and production and stuff like that. How long were you messing around in the basement? or whatever with machines before you started to feel like you had something that you could even present people? I think in 92 or 93 I brought my first analog synth from Repeat who is also he was a resident with Jeff Mills at Future Shock Fridays and So that was '92, '93 that I bought my first synthesizer, then I bought my first music computer, which was an Atari 1040ST. And then my first record came out in '96, so it was probably three or four years of messing around and developing the skills. Did you immediately, I mean, even when you were DJing, did you take the name function? Was that immediate? No, it's actually, it's funny that you ask me that because it's kind of a funny story. I don't know, I used to use... another name which I'm kind of embarrassed about. It was very, very early 90s rave. You don't need to be revealing anything. You had another name. That's all we need to know. I had another name. It was just very, very rave. Speedy J, for example. No, it was Overlord. And it was like, there was, I think this, there was a record out of, I think it was one of the guys from Hard Floors. This is not your ordinary drug dealer. He is your drug overlord. But what had happened was I was always friends with kids that wrote graffiti, but I could not write graffiti for my life. And I was always in awe of the whole. tagging concept and, you know, writing graffiti, but I wasn't any good at it and I never tried to be. One of the things that we did when I basically ransacked my parents' basement and covered it and had my friends that wrote graffiti come in. And cover the it was an unfinished basement with cement wall So, you know, we just had all this graffiti up and then I set up my turntables and it was like it was like a rave, you know But my one friend Chris Santiago He his tag was functional And he used to write function. And there was a big function piece on my wall in my basement. So you stole his name? Well, he got in a really bad car accident. And he was sitting in the back of a car. and a dump truck had run a stop sign. They were at the stop sign, and the truck didn't see the stop sign. It drove through the back of the car, and he was hospitalized for a year and a half. He had to relearn everything. When it first happened, we thought he was going to die. It's still a miracle that he lived. when he was in the hospital and I was really close with his sister and his whole family. He was like one of my closest friends. and I had always loved the name and I know it's kind of wrong to take somebody's name before they die and assume that they're going to die but he lived but out of respect for him I thought he wasn't going to be around and I was like out of respect for him and I even told his sister at the hospital I'm going to use the name function And then he survived and then, you know, a year and a half later, it took him, he had to relearn how to talk, relearn how to walk, everything. And then... Then he realized that I was using the name function and he kind of wanted it back. But I explained it to him and he understood. But I thought it was funny because he later on, he kind of resented it for a little while. He was a truck driver and he wound up buying his own truck. He got so upset that he wound up calling his trucking company Function Trucking just to like, because I wouldn't give him his name back. But he was cool with it. I had his blessing. It's interesting. I mean, obviously Function clearly has techno function. Yeah, I mean, at the time, the reason why I was so drawn to it was, one, it looked really good written down. you know, everything, like when I started collecting gear, everything had a function button on it, you know? And I remember specifically like a TB-303, like the start-stop button, I think is called the function button. And I would just always look at it and it just looked right to me written down. So, yeah, so, but yeah. And also, you know, techno and electronic music is very mathematical. and mathematical functions and stuff like that. It just all seemed to work. Were you good at math in school? No, not at all. But my early records were, the titles were based around function type mathematical equations and stuff like that. But no, terrible at math. Absolutely terrible. When did you meet, when did you hook up with Regis and Femal and all of them? I mean obviously, sorry, I assume that you were listening to Downwards Records at some point and that this Birmingham techno caught your ear. Were you even friends with them before that, that they had started that stuff? No, I mean, it's just one of these situations, one of these stories where it just all fell into place. And it was very natural. I mean, Carl, Pete, and I, from the moment that we met, we were good friends. I was living in this apartment on 30th Street above Rogue Music and I had extra space. So a friend of our, our mutual friend, the way Carl and I met was through this kid, Dan DC, Danny Clifton. who he's the guy that was wearing the underground resistance jacket that Matt and I said something to. And he used to work at a record shop called Planet X in New Jersey. And that's where locally in New Jersey, I would do a lot of my record shopping more so than Groove. I never really used to go into Brooklyn to go to Groove Records because of Planet X. And Planet X was owned by this guy named Spike and then his two main employees were brothers, Larry Clifton and Danny Clifton. And Danny Clifton, his DJ name was Dan DC and he was really young but an excellent DJ. They used to do sort of these outlaw parties in New Jersey. And it was like almost, you know, like this kind of territorial thing. It was like, you know, there was the Brooklyn crew and then like... these guys doing their thing in New Jersey and it was a bit separate but there was one time where Frankie Bones came out to one of their parties and they discovered he was blown away by this 16 year old kid that was just killing it and wound up booking him at Storm Raves and then Dan had a bit of success as a DJ he wound up getting involved in politics and stuff like that so he By the time he was 22 or 23, he got out of techno. But he was a huge Downwards fan. He's the one that put me on. When I'd go record shopping, he'd be like, you need to hear these records. What was it about those records that I mean, were you immediately drawn to them? And it wasn't really the surgeon stuff that struck either of us. It was Regis. It was Speak To Me. It was Regis, Montreal, and the track Speak To Me. It was... It was... It was sort of the same way I feel about like Giorgio Moroder, The Chase. Just like this loop that it doesn't change that much from start to finish, but somehow that loop reinvents itself. gains more and more strength every time it loops around. And, you know, at that time, that was when, that was the kind of sound that was breaking. Obviously, like, you know, Rob Hood, Minimal Nation, and stuff like that. Prior to that, a lot of dance music was very song-oriented, had changes, especially a lot of the Belgian rave stuff, which is kind of derived from new beat and industrial. You know, it's stuff that... music prior to that was similar to that but had vocals and then this was becoming more instrumental but still had very strong song structure and yeah the fact that it didn't change was appealing to you yeah it was really appealing because it was good for DJing because you could use two copies of a record and like two copies of the same record and set them off like a beat or two behind and like do tricks with it and not have to worry about a change coming up and you can just do that for a while. But it's just like cool for layering. But... it was also how sparse it was, you know, and that it didn't need all of the trickery and technical flashiness, you know, it didn't need, it wasn't flashy, it was just, it was what it was, and it worked, so. Was that something you were already aiming for with your own work? Did you feel? Or did it change the work that you were doing? It did. Yeah, I mean... I think the stuff that I was doing before that and it was a bit more house oriented, but not house. And, you know, from that era, especially from Rob Hood and Jeff Mills, and then also later downwards, but actually not downwards. Robert and Jeff Mills, they were this gray area between Teflon and House. Some of the early M-Plant releases, like the first memory foundation on M-Plant in like 93 or 94, I forget the title of the record, but... it struck me as a house record, but it was very techno. The problem I always had with house was that, like Carl always says, it's music your mom can listen to. It doesn't challenge the listener that much, especially with the whole... House has always reached a lot further than Techno because of the whole vocal thing and it has radio appeal and stuff like that. Did you even feel that way back then? Yeah, yeah. I always felt like House... New York is a house town. And it was always hard for Techno to break through and it was always on a much smaller scale. I liked techno because it was out there, you know? It wasn't generic sounding and you could take a lot more chances in the techno realm. And if there were house records that I really liked... They did tend to fall into the more techno class, like Acid House. I was really into the 303 and DJ Pierre and the whole Chicago Acid House movement and stuff like that. It was house music, but it was very electronic sounding. House music was always a bit more organic to me and I like I said before I like New York house music is a lot different than yeah yeah growing up like the house music that I was familiar with always had you know it wasn't out of the ordinary for for there to be a flute solo on a record or like Some sort of a solo with somebody jamming like this is very organic, you know Latin percussion and stuff like that. I was always you know, you don't have any flute solos They'll actually call this a... We'll have to search for the long and deep for the Discogs entry on that one. By the time the limelight had sort of died down a little bit, you were promoting your own lights. No, that didn't come until... much later. Well Limelight had closed for a while and it got locked up from like 95 to 97 and then I'd say about 98 in 1998. Well actually no, my first My first party was at the... It was a rave. It was at the New York Film Academy. And Carl played at it, and so did Pete Fumal, and Joey Beltram, and Neil Landstrom. It was a great lineup. And it was a really successful party. That was, I think, 97. And was one of the reasons you even just wanted to put on a rave was to bring over Carl and bring over these people to New York? I'm a really social person and I just, because it was such a challenge, this probably isn't going to sound right because... you don't want to admit that you're basically putting on parties so that you can play. But it wasn't just about me. It was about pushing the music. And I noticed that after the whole phase of... limelight and all that stuff. Techno exploded in New York in 91, 92 and then by 94, 95 so many things happened that there was like a negative stigma attached to it all so it kind of died down and I never wanted to be a promoter. I wanted to push the music and also, you know, have a place for myself to play. But it wasn't just about me. It was about pushing techno. And I felt like... Everything took such a dip. I mean, even to the point where older friends of mine would be like, oh, you're still playing techno? That still exists? You know, like, it almost became a bit forgotten about. And then, you know, Limelight reopened again, and they were just booking, like, terrible music and terrible acts. And a friend of mine, Alan Sachs, who was a big rave promoter in New York in the early mid-90s, he basically showed me the ropes. He taught me how to promote events. I had done my first event. before I knew him, but in the next couple of years, him and I became really good friends. And then, then he got a job working at Limelight. for Peter Gation and putting nights on. He was more of a trance guy. He started booking gate-crasher nights. I think it was the first time Tiesto ever played in New York and stuff like that. So he brought me in and introduced me to Peter Gation as the person that would book Techno. One of the first projects we did was to bring back Jeff Millis. And it was the first time he played for us, it was the first time he had played in New York, or no, the first time he played Limelight in seven years. He went for a stint of five years, at least five years, where he wouldn't come back to New York because I think he left with a bit of a bad taste in his mouth because of the way everything kind of crashed and burned, you know? So... Yeah, it was really special to, you know, from that Underground Resistance story to, you know, bringing him back. How was it when he came back? It was incredible. And he did a section of his set that it just brought you right back to the moment. He did a section of his set that was 1991 Future Shock, like what he would play. You know, like... In hindsight, some of these records are so cheesy, like Apotheosis of Fortuna. But he knew that's what he had to deliver because it was his first time and he knew that there were people in the crowd that wanted that and it was epic. It was incredible. So when you booked female Regis and Will Armstrong, that was outside of the limelight. That was outside. Was that the first time you'd met those guys in person? Oh, actually, I didn't finish the story before. So I was working at Road Music. I was living on the 15th floor. Dan Deasy was a good friend of mine. He's the one that turned me on to Regis and Downwards and all that stuff. And I very quickly became a fan and owned all the records. And then Dan had, and Dan didn't do this with anyone else that he was a fan. But for some reason he felt so connected to the music and knew that there was something so special about Downwards that he faxed the number on the record. He got in touch with Carl and then very quickly started having phone conversations with Carl and becoming... They became very connected just on the phone very quickly and started speaking on a regular basis. And then what had happened was there was a guy named Mace. I forget his DJ name. I think his DJ name is Mace. He was a promoter in Philadelphia. When they came over for the first time, they didn't even play in New York. They played in Philly, but Pete Female and Carl Regis wanted to visit New York because... they love New York and they grew up on New York culture and a lot of the music they were listening to as kids was, you know, rooted... Post-punk, I assume. Yeah, post-punk and like... It took me a long time to figure out why he was so passionate about certain things and it may not even be the case, but I remember a few years ago I saw the... The movie that Soft Soul did, what is it, Non-Stop Ecstatic Dancing, I think? The Erotic Cabaret? The Erotic Cabaret, yeah, yeah. And I was watching it, and then it kind of clicked with me that that's why Carl was so inspired by the area that I was living in in New York. And it was very similar to what the soft sell had experienced in the video and the landscape of that part of Midtown. So I think when Carl arrived, he got it. I'm here. I'm in it. So what had happened was they were playing down in Philadelphia. They wanted to stay in New York for a week and they needed a place to stay and I had a big place. So Dan asked me if they could stay and we were instantly, you know, they stayed with me for like a week and I showed them around and it was a riot. And yeah, we've been friends ever since. So the thing I love about Carl, I don't really speak to Pete as much because Pete's in the UK, but the thing I love about Carl is that above and beyond music, I became friends with him as a fan, but we really connected, not through music, but through friendship and instantly became friends. And I think at this point, And 15 years later, I think that's one of the strengths of San Juan District. I think people can tell that we are really good friends, you know. And, you know, now that I live here and we tour, I mean, it's just... It's not even like work. It's like a laugh the whole time. You know, just being on the road with him, he's the funniest person I've ever met. And, you know, it's just... It's... I think... Sure. It's necessary for any type of band or music group to have this strong friendship bond. I think it strengthens the whole thing. Where does Juan come in though? Juan Mendez. I think a similar type of situation except in LA. You know... Carl was always meeting people that were, you know, they were giving him music. Everyone was always trying to put a record out on Downwards, you know, and Downwards was a very exclusive thing. But, you know... He started getting music. He went out to L.A. to play a gig. I think he kind of got stranded. I don't know the whole story, but I think he kind of got stranded by the promoters. And John really looked after him. And then John did sidetracks back then and was giving him... a lot of the music and really liked what he was doing musically and with the label and then the fact that John looked after him the way that he did, you know, just took him around LA and showed him all the sites and stuff like that. I think it's a similar type of situation. They instantly became really good friends and were always in touch. Carl would always go out there, go out to his girlfriend or whatever, go on vacation and see John and stuff. And I know, I think I heard... And I met John through Carl. But also a huge fan of sidetracks. What John was doing in LA with all those guys, you know, for the West Coast, one of the few conglomerates that really made proper techno. You know, the Kit Clayton, John Tejada, Juan Mendes kind of crew. Sure. With... Obviously this is about you, this function of you. But I think at the same time, San Juan District has become in some ways a large part of who you are and what you're about. I wonder, going back to the UR thing, when you first saw them and you were talking about how you didn't know whether it was a label, whether it was a group, what these photocopies on the wall were. I mean, is that something that sticks with you in a way? It's funny, but as I was saying it, no, it actually hasn't. And as I was saying it, I was thinking to myself, well, yeah, that kind of... is the same type of thing that Samwell District... To be honest with you, us touring as Samwell District, like using the name, it just kind of happened. We didn't want to bill ourselves as Regis and Function, and we didn't know how to bill ourselves, and then we just were like, you know what, fuck it, let's call it Samwell District. You know, I guess it does have something to do with the whole basic channel and underground resistance aesthetic. It's like a shield, you know? It's like we stand behind that, but that's first, you know? It's like... Well, for someone who doesn't... We're not anonymous. We're not faceless. Exactly, no. Yeah. But it is... And when it comes to techno and independent music on this level, we're not talking about huge record sales. And what is a label? The question is, how did you start the label? Is it a label? Is it really a label? A label is Arista or a major record. This is just selling a few thousand copies of a record. When you say the word label, you think of this major operation. You don't have an office, you have a building. But at the same time, over the past couple of years, you guys have had to have some of these... I don't know if you have talks about it, but in the backs of your minds, you have to have the idea that it's been getting bigger. That it's been something, and how do we negotiate? where we are. Yeah, I think housing it all under the name Sanwell District, it's worked out to just make the most sense to us. We don't refer to it as a label because it's just a place for us to, we don't want to sell our stuff to other people and then have them not pay us. and there's not enough revenue in it to really split it with someone, and it's easy to do on your own, so, you know, and it doesn't... It's not classified as a label. It's not, you know, it just has become an act, an artist, a label. It's just all housed under that name. And I don't know if there was a point where there was a conscious decision. It just happened. But that's, I think... The great thing about San Juan District in general is everything has just happened. Nothing has been planned. And anytime we try to plan something, it just doesn't feel natural. We just have to... You know, because as things are growing, you know, we start getting people to try to give us deadlines. We don't adhere to deadlines, you know. So it's tough. we're situationists and we drift you know and we do have to keep it that way and we've tried to change that and just keep finding out that we just need to just I think situations has to be the best way to put it because while you talk about all of this drift and misinformation and all of these things, you also headline Sonar this year. It's like you have these moments where you come into whatever the mainstream is, so to speak. and then you just sort of do these things. Well, I mean, we're not going to say no to it. Of course. We didn't set out to play at Sonar. Sonar asked us. So, you know, it's an honor to do that. Did you approach that set in a different way than most sets? It was a difficult one because usually we like to play long sets. How long was it, an hour? An hour and 15 minutes. It was originally supposed to be an hour and a half, but as these things go, people play over their set times. And it's a major production, so they're constantly moving the stage around, so the scheduling got cut a little bit short, so we lost 15 minutes. But I mean, you know, you know the the excitement of playing for a room indoors that has 30,000 people in one room, 90,000 people in the whole festival. It's so exciting that it's over and done with before you even get started. I'm not dissing Sonar in any way because it's incredible. But I expected to walk away with more. I expected it to feel like more because I played at the Labyrinth Festival last year and that set changed my life. And I put a... I'd put as much into the sonar set like preparing and just organizing and stuff like that than I did with Labyrinth and I think it had a lot to do with you know like when I played at the Labyrinth Festival I played on my own for three hours with a lot of beer drum machines and stuff so you know it's two people sharing an hour and 15 minutes it's like Yeah, it's just, it's very, I think the only reason why I walked away not feeling what I felt from Labyrinth was because it was so short. You know, it's just like, you bring quite a bit of gear with you to almost everything. What is your live setup usually? a normal gig? I mean, I know Labyrinth is quite special because the organizers were able to get you things in advance. Actually, most sets I play with Carl and the setup with that is very basic. It's just a DJ mixer and each of us have a laptop and controller. We also have in our rider that If they can get us a 909, they'll get us one. So a lot of gigs are Carl and I playing, DJ Mixer, laptop and controller for each of us, and a 909. on special occasions like Labyrinth, I'll ask for it. And I don't require it because I know how expensive it is for promoters, especially hiring. At this point, analog gear becomes more and more rare and more and more expensive, so I can't demand. that I want an 808, a 909, an SH-101, a Space Echo, 24 channel mixing. I can't demand that on every gig. special things and when a promoter like Russ from Labyrinth is so enthusiastic about what he does and cares so much about the level of production, you know, Russ has always, I tell him all the time, he is the only promoter I've ever worked with that has pushed my limits to the point where I want to improve. impress him more than any other promoter I've ever played for because you know he when he first booked me for Labyrinth last year he sent me like a two-page email just like highlighting things that he had heard from me and what he liked and what he was going for. And as soon as I heard, as soon as I read that, I knew the type of person that I was dealing with and I knew it was going to be special. Aside from everybody else telling me how special it was. But, yeah, I mean, and then he said to me, He was like, "Do you need any gear?" And I was like, "Listen, I don't want to ask for too much, but could you get this?" And he was like, "It doesn't matter. I'll get you whatever you want." So I was like, "Are you sure? Because I'll send you a list of a lot of gear." He's like, "Whatever you want." And he got it all. And it was worth it because, yeah, it was... It was an incredible setup, a lot of gear, and it worked. And that was the first time I did something like that live with that much gear. The thing is I did it without a sound check because the stage area was kind of small and I had to set up while Dan Bell was playing and kind of duck down and stay out of his way so I wasn't in his way or anything. I just did a line check on headphones and I don't know, it all worked. And when I say worked, I don't mean like the gear worked, I mean like it worked. And you're going back this year again. Yeah. Same setup? Yeah, I mean, I've thought about it a lot, and in the last year, I did a similar set at the Bunker in New York, because Brian really wanted me to recreate a Labyrinth-type set and setup. But I've... doing gigs with Carl and then also gigs on my own because a lot of times I'll just play with a laptop and controller on my own. But yeah, I'm going to do it with all the gear. But I've found that I can also accomplish the same thing I'm looking for with just the laptop controller. Just because last year was such a special moment, I'm just going to go with the same type of setup because it did work. But I don't really require that in every game. It can become a bit complicated sometimes, you know, because you have so much gear, so many options. It can get a bit messy. But that sloppiness also can work in the moment. I don't like listening back to recordings of it because if I do, you know, if I do a podcast, I'll... sit there and run through it with a fine-tooth comb over and over because I don't want to release something that people are going to listen to over and over. A live performance is about the moment. And the second that moment happens, they're on to the next moment. They can't hit rewind. They can't listen to it ever again. So, you know... This, of course, makes the RA podcast, which I guess we can talk about. all the more special in a way because you did it in six days or something like that. I mean, I'm a procrastinator as it is. I mean, I did it really in two days. I mean, I spent four days procrastinating. Six days total, but I spent four days putting, no, I was working on it, but like. I'm the kind of person that I get my best results when I back myself into a corner with very little time to spare. I'll remember to back you into a corner more often, and I want something from you. Well, with the RA podcast, you did? I called you at the beginning of the week, and you were like... next week oh okay yeah sure i think it was you called me on tuesday morning and you asked if you could have it by friday afternoon yeah of course we always want that weekend buffer yeah and i was like i remember i was like well you know what's the difference between friday at five o'clock and sunday at 11 o'clock my sanity yeah yeah exactly no that's what i figured out That's what I figured out on Sunday night when three people from Resident Evil 5 Server were serial calling me, asking me where the hell it was. Well, we like to be thorough. No, I can't blame you. I was nervous too. Because at the time, I didn't have an internet connection at home. I was trying to upload it. I went to a restaurant that wasn't getting connected to the internet. All's well that ends well, I suppose. Kind of the story of my life, actually.
