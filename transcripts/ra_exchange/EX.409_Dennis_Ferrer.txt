*music* Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with a key, long-serving figure in New York dance music history. Dennis Ferrer is probably best known for his 2009 vocal house hit Hey Hey, but there is much more to his story than hooky big room productions. Growing up in the South Bronx in the early 80s, he had a front row seat for an especially vibrant period in New York music. After working in the burgeoning hip-hop scene, he turned his sights to techno, launching sine wave records with a 12-inch under the Morph alias with Damon Wilde in 1994. Years later, he found a mentor on Kerry Chandler, who coaxed him back into the game as a house artist. Since then, he's become a coach and mentor in his own right. He gave the Martinez brothers their first gig when they were still in high school. and now they're among house music's biggest celebrities. Along the way he's accumulated all kinds of crazy stories and quite a bit of wisdom too, which he imparts during this interview with R.A. staff writer Max Pearl. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Dennis Ferrer is up next. you I'm here with Dennis Ferrer. This is Max Pearl for the Resident Advisor Exchange Podcast. Hey. We're here in Queens, New York City. What's up, everybody? You just had a bit of a nightmare ride out here from Jersey. Yeah, it's the New York traffic. I know I should be accustomed to it since I am from New York, but who likes to sit in traffic? Nobody. So, the good thing was that it was nice weather. It is nice weather. It's sunny outside. And it's in, what, high 70s? It's amazing right now. Got the sunroof down. Sunroof down, windows open, rockin' Biggie Smalls. Oh, yeah. So, I want to start at the beginning. And I want to ask you, so you grew up in the shadow of Yankee Stadium. Yes, sir. In South Bronx. Yes, sir. Can you set the scene? What was your neighborhood like growing up? 1980 was the start, basically. I remember that the most, 1980. Yankee Stadium, the old Yankee Stadium, off of Jerome Avenue in Shakespeare. Block parties in the summer, and by block parties, I'm talking about people just bringing their equipment out in the street and plugging it up to light poles. So we'd have the Serwin Vega bass bins. and a huge PV amps. I think they were the P800s. I'm not sure what they were. I remember they were P, I thought they were P800s hooked into the light pole. And us acting like, hey, we don't have anything going on. Yeah, we got big gem sound speakers and hip hop blaring through these speakers and four turntables. But I guess the cops had decided, hey, better that they're having fun and DJing. all the kids are in one spot why create a big you know mess um and stop it you know and have them doing other criminal activities so they would let these parties just go on and be block parties man be like five six hundred kids and everybody you know dancing to hip hop you know at the start of hip hop uh I mean at that point It was like Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Fat Boys. Wow, it was just a really tough time. And it was, you know, just before, you know, crack, just before that. Lawlessness. You know, 42nd was still all porn theaters and kung fu theaters. Best part about 40 Deuce was that you got to see kung fu movies for $3, $4, $5 in a row. So you would cut school, cut class at 12 o'clock, and you wouldn't come out until like 5. five o'clock you saw three kung fu movies problem was the cops were waiting for you of course yeah the school cops um what do they get you on what do they call it when they get you for skipping school i forgot what there's a term for it it was p with a p truancy that's right truancy patrol thank you for that it's the truancy patrol uh and they would they would they would hem you up in the vans you know like 20 other kids At that time, it was an amazing musical landscape. Hip-hop was just really gathering momentum and stabilizing, becoming a big money thing. It wasn't so much big money in it, but now it's starting to become an enterprise, you know, big, big money-making thing. And we loved it. You know, graffiti was big. Everybody's tagging up everybody, you know, fights over crossing out names. Were you, like, rapping or b-boying or anything at that time? I always wanted to make music, my thing. I started DJing a bit when I was, like, 11, and we would have battles because my friend's older brother had the equipment. Peter's brother, Kenny, had the equipment. Belt drive. turntable. Yeah, man, it was belt. It wasn't even belt. It was like a rubber band. It was like SOB1s, I think they were. I think they were the SOB1s, if I remember correctly. It was rubber bands, man, and you had to slide that thing. And if you messed up a mix, it was unforgiving. Yeah, man, those were fun days, really, really fun days, but also scary days because... I remember being like 14 and 15 and growing up in those circumstances. And every year would be like, hey, man, you know, am I going to make it to 16? Am I going to make it to 17? And I remember my friend Kenny getting a Mirage, an Ensoniq Mirage sampler, and him making like these beats with it. And that was like magic for me, man. It was a magic. New York had character. I mean, it still does, but it ain't the character from when I was young. Right. It was like, you didn't know if you were living the next day. And that went for everybody. It didn't matter what class you were from, what ethnicity. It was like, if you walked across the street, you thought. is today going to be that day? Absolutely. So my understanding of the way the musical landscape was at the time was if you were a DJ, it wasn't like you only played hip hop or you only played electro. No, man. I got the sense that everyone was sort of playing everything. Dude, it was crazy. I remember going to the Palladium and seeing David Morales play, right? And from one record, it'd be like, you know, Far Side, She Keeps Passing Me By, to like, you know, The Jungle Brothers, I House You. It was crazy because it was never, and to tell you the truth, records weren't really, you know, the whole night mixed until like maybe in the late 80s, early 90s is when that kind of phenomenon started. But sometimes they'd just be like, and a hip hop record. came on you were like what or like a quick mix where you use the drum roll yeah yeah boom and back in a disco record and you just never and the whole night the whole night you heard all different types of dance music it just wasn't it wasn't house it just wasn't hip-hop. It was all sorts. I mean, reggae was big in New York, you know, so you hear broader than Broadway, you know, all of a sudden pop out and everybody would lose their damn natural minds. So that's what I really appreciate and I miss about the musical landscape in New York because the music was so diverse and everybody, it didn't matter where you came from or who you were, it was on when a good record came on, a good song that you can sing and you remember to. Yeah, I kind of miss that. Was there any radio that played a role? Like, do you remember, were there any particular programs or stations? I mean, there was tons. You had WBLS, you had Kiss FM. You know, Hot 97 didn't come into play until a long time later. It was WKTU, Wapako. And there were a lot of... class, you know, classic good music stations, man. Like where, you know, and then you had Red Alert come on at night, you know, and Mr. Magic and, you know, and then you had, you know, the video music box, you know, and Uncle Ralph, you know, and. Bless his heart. I mean, we used to race home from school to watch that, you know, just to watch Nucleus, you know, the Nucleus video with Jam on it or something like that, you know. That was like the public access channel, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. The free cable. It was free, man. There was no MTV back then, you know. So those videos that popped on there was like, woo, you know. we were on were you like a club kid like were you going out hanging out like in I was too poor to um 167th and Jerome and Morningside and and more Sonia section in the Bronx man I mean if you lived there You didn't really have that kind of money to go out. You just didn't. You hustled. Everybody did what they could, you know, to make ends meet. And me going out was Friday night when my friend's looking for a party to crash. You have to understand that in the Bronx at this time, there was house parties happening on Friday and Saturday nights everywhere. And it was no big deal to walk up into a front of an apartment and just be like knocking on the door where you hear the music. And everybody says, oh, hey, what's up, man? Oh, do you mind? And they'd be like, yeah, come on in, man. Enjoy yourself. As long as you don't create no trouble. Or if you knew somebody at the party, you know, a friend was at this house party and you stride in, all the furniture from the living room was gone. It was in somebody's bedroom. So it was like a big dance on, everybody's dancing. One strobe light. The kitchen was sectioned off because the turntables were in the archway between the kitchen and the living room. And in the bathroom, the bathtub was full of ice Budweiser beer. And in the kitchen, you know, in the kitchen was food. So you go get yourself some food and everybody be up against the wall, B-boy style, you know, like hands across their chest. And then, you know, looking who. Whose chick we going to hit on to dance with and not get killed that night? So it was a really crazy atmosphere. And we didn't really start going clubbing until, you know, we were a little bit older, 16, 17. You know, and they had the 18 and over clubs, you know. And, you know, we'd always kind of try to get into Palladium or, you know, or the Tunnel or, you know. Danceteria, the usual spots, the usual spots that more people have talked about forever. But if you came from the Bronx, it wasn't that easy for you. That's how it happened. A lot of the early 90s records you did, or some of the early 90s records you did were very techno, like the Sinewave records for Damien Wilde. were you hanging with the techno crowd? Like, were you out there with Adam X and Frankie Bones at the Storm Rave? Yeah, I would go to see Frankie Bones at Storm Rave and when he did the big one at Caesars Bay Bazaar, I think it was in Brooklyn, yeah. And when they had the record shop, downtown. What the hell was it called? Not Sonic. Was it Sonic Groove? Sonic Groove. It was Sonic Groove, right? Wow. My memory. It's coming back a little bit. Well, the way I got into that was I had moved to another part of the Bronx when I was a bit of a teenager and I was making music. I was making hip hop. And I got really tired of keeping a handgun, believe it or not, underneath my mixing console because, you know, just things got kind of crazy, you know, in hip hop, you know. And I just really didn't want to live that life. I'm not like that. I didn't want to live that life. I just didn't want to, man. And so I remember hearing some techie stuff and saying, yo, you know, this is kind of cool. We can use some hip hop elements. Because at that point, it was like, it was breakbeat techno, you know, with the surgeon, right? The surgeon, and he was a master. I remember the song, this one thing he did. It was like, I like to smoke marijuana, some kind of crazy shit with a Jamaican breakbeat in it. And it was techno. It was by The Surgeon, I think. It was amazing. And then I heard, I got there the very first day they got the Apex Twin Didgeridoo come in. And it was like, oh, this just came in today. I was like, Apex Twin Didgeridoo? I heard that. I was like, what the fuck is this? Excuse my language, but I was like, what is this? I said, oh, this is so hot, you know? And coming from techno, I mean, coming from hip hop, hearing breakbeat in another form kind of blew my mind. I was like, so wait a minute. I can still do what I love to do technically, but without the risk associated, and yet do something different and cool. I'm with that. Screw this. So I started playing around and I had some stuff signed to Big Beat Atlantic when I was very young, you know, kind of. Fibbed my way into getting a label deer there. And I met Damon Wilde. Oh, no, wait. Damon Wilde came later. I think it was Tetsu Inoue. Tetsu Inoue, who did a lot of stuff with Phil Namlock and Adam Hart. He's like an ambient god, this dude. This dude, he was off his rocker when it came to making ambient records. And he's the one who kind of showed me techno. And that's how I got involved. And so now here goes this kid from the projects who's living in Soundview section in Bronxdale, you know, off Rosedale Avenue. And all you hear is bleepity bleeps bleeps bleeps coming out the projects. And all my friends downstairs are like, yo, when you going to play some hip hop? Yo, what's with this bleepity bleepy shit? Right? And this is like 1992, right? It was freaking insane. 132 BPMs. Yo, those poor guys downstairs, man. And my neighbors, my neighbors hated my, they hated life when I was there. Well, techno at that time was also really. fast and really rugged and raw right like it was rough 140 sometimes you know i mean if you did if you did gaba you know like lenny d you were you were way you were way up there you know it's just like snare roll that's the whole record thank you very much and he left um so yeah and then Richie and and Carl and those were all you know they were very young when I was doing it too Did you have early encounters with Richie or Carl? Not so much Richie. I remember Carl from way back, but he didn't remember me till later. And then when I saw Carl in Japan, he was like, who the hell is this kid up here messing with knobs? It was hilarious. And Rolando, I remember Rolando from way back. You know, The Advent, you know, Damon Wilde. Damon, I basically, we had started Sinewave together, basically. That's the real story. The real story was he wanted to start a label, and he started, and he came up with Sinewave, and we did it together for a time. And unfortunately, I didn't have the funds or the money to kind of put in what everyone kind of says should have been my weight. But I was young, man. I was 19, 20 years old. I don't have that kind of money. So I got angry and I said to hell with everybody and I pulled out. And that's why I... I abruptly left the sine wave thing. I did an album with him as Morph on Beachwood Music, EMI, which a lot of people don't know I did that album with him. I did Stormwatch, a record called Stormwatch. I did several things, several techno things, but I just don't say anything about it. Because that's kind of a part of life that I kind of want to forget because it's kind of very traumatic. to me. You know, because you worked so hard to get good at what you do. You worked so hard to build something and then someone kind of like pulls the rug out from under you. I mean, I get where he was coming from. I don't blame Damon for anything. You know, I love him to death still for the opportunity he gave me. But still, it's a kid's dream. I don't think he really knows what happened. I don't think he believes he knows what really happened, how that affected me. He just knows I got mad and I left and I went to work at Rogue Music. And everybody knows me from Rogue Music, from selling analog gear from when I was a kid. I was there for years. I met everybody there. So Rogue is the instrument shop in downtown Manhattan? Yeah, it was in Manhattan. And we sold all analog gear. I was there for years. I mean years. I was the kid who sold you everything. I sold everybody. Most of everybody who's done music in New York City. I've sold you stuff. And so I stood there because I was done. Mentally, I was fried. My dream got crushed of owning a label and working on music. So I took a little time off. I went back to school while I was working at Rogue, and I became a software applications programmer. C++, Visual Basic, VB, SQLs, Access, SQL Server, all that good fun logic. So you had some coding jobs for a while? Yep. I was a coder at American International Group in their internal audit division for a while. Nobody knows that, so now you got the real scoop. And so music and logic are basically, they go hand in hand. So if you're good at logic, you can pretty much almost, I mean, you can't buy creativity, that's for sure, but you can put one plus one together and create something. It's logic, basically. So I think I remember reading that you linked up with Kerry Chandler via Rogue. Is that true? Yeah, so he would come in. Everybody, I mean, I remember selling Kenny Dope, Gonzalez, his gear. That's how me and Kenny became friends. I don't talk to Kenny about business at all. I don't talk to him. I talk to Kenny as a friend. It's not even about making music. Let's make records together. No, I don't know him like that. Even though we are in the same business, I never wanted it to be that. I always wanted it to be my friend, the dude I knew from when I was nobody, you know? And so Carrie was the same way. I had no idea Carrie lived down the block from me. I didn't really care. I didn't. You got to remember, I mean, dude, we had everybody walking in. We had Prince calling. We had, we sold gear to everybody. Every huge name you can think of, I dealt with them on a daily basis. I really didn't care. To me, I was already making records. I already had like two albums underneath my belt. I didn't care who you were. So you came in and you wanted to buy gear from me. I told you the truth. I said, don't get that piece of shit. Get this. Why? Because this does this. And what are you looking to do? You're looking for bass? Okay, don't worry about that. Stop spending your money, get a Minimoog and get it all over with. You'll be spending your money for years and only to buy the damn thing 10 years later. And it would be true. So everybody would come to me for an honest opinion and I would sell them this gear. So Kerry, I would do the same thing with Kerry. And Kerry told me, yeah, I live in Union City. I'm like, what? You live where? It's like, dude, you live like two blocks away from me. Because I basically, I wanted to make music again, but I didn't know how to get back into it. Because again, you know, once your soul is kind of crushed, you just don't know how to find yourself again sometimes. And that takes a while. So he would say, yo, D, come with me to some gigs. And we would go up to Boston. And one day we were in Boston and he played this record and the crowd went nuts, you know. And it was Kenny Bowlby and Why I Sing. It was a remake of Kirk Franklin, Reason Why We Sing. And it's a gospel record. And I heard it and I got tears in my eyes, man. I literally, I literally, even now I get, I get misty eyed from it because I remember that feeling. I stood there and everybody was singing and everybody was chanting, Carrie, Carrie, Carrie. And he played this record and everybody went freaking nuts. And I heard the vocals, Kenny Bobian vocals. And I says, you know what? I said, this is why I want to do music. To see this. Not so everybody's chanting my name. That wasn't the reason why. It was because he was able to elicit an emotion. You get it? It was like. And he touched you with a record, man. And the record touched people. And so for me, the way I interpreted this whole meeting was like, I want to make records that touch you. That when you hear my record come on, you go, oh my God, that's my shit. And so from that day forward, I swear this is the truth. From that day forward, whenever I made a record, I remember that night and I said, yo, when you make records, that's what you want to do. You want to associate feelings with records. You want people to remember where they were, who they were with, what happened to them. You want to associate feelings with the records you make. If you don't do that, then why are you making a record? Why are you putting whatever you felt that day into something? It makes no sense. Then don't fucking make records. Don't. It's pointless. Because if you're going to give up something, out of you when you make a record, then make it count. I came home that morning with him and I said, I want to get back into doing it. And he says, OK, well, I have the living room upstairs next to the studio. You can set up your keyboard there. And I go, all right. Three weeks later, he gives me the keys to his house. And every day I'm in his house, dude, every day without fail. Listening to what he's making. Listening to when he did Atmosphere EP. When he did Ionosphere. When he did all those records that Kerry's really known for. I was there for those. I was basically there for those. I watched that shit happen. I saw it with my very own eyes and it fed me. And so he used to come into the living room and go, you know, he would hear something I'm working on. And I swear, this is how he would say, if he says, you sure you want to do that? And I'd be like, oh, fuck, erase, delete. Delete the record. That's all he needed to tell me. All he had to do was like this. Shit, he does, even Nas does that to me. And I know that look. He goes like this. That's the Kerry look. Means I've done something wrong. You see? And so I remember this. And so Kerry just, that poor man, bro. I had the alarm codes. I had the keys to his house. I basically lived in his house. until the point where the cops almost shot me one day. Because they thought you were breaking in? Yeah, man. Because this is a true story. I did an EP for Large, and the song was called Call. And I'm playing Jeff, who owns Large Music, I'm playing him the record as I just finished it. I said, I got a dope record for you. It's a dope, it's a super hot vocal, it's gospel-y, you're going to love it. Now, I had just ran upstairs to play it for him. I totally forgot I hadn't hit the alarm code. So my friend Rob Wunderman, who was Kerry's management at the time, said he was coming over to visit. And I go, OK, no problem. Come over. I'm playing the record full blast. And I hear somebody go. Put your hands up. Put your hands up where I can see them. Now, I think it's Rob fucking around. I'm like, yo, Rob, stop playing, man. Shut the hell up. And I go back to putting up the music. Dude, put your fucking hands up where I can see them. I'm like, Jeff, you want to hold on for a minute? I'm going to put you on speakerphone. This sounds kind of weird. I put him on speakerphone. Lower down the music. Next like nine millimeters in my mouth. And all you hear is Jeff going, hello, hello, is everything okay? Are you okay? It was crazy, man. Yeah, so that's the story to that Soul Collectives EP with a gun in my mouth. He's like, dude, we almost shot you. We didn't know it was a studio up here. I was like, oh, I'm sorry, man. So yeah, you know, and I had to explain to Kerry now why the cops were at the house. So that's basically how this happened. And then I never looked back. And I promised myself with every vocal record I did, as I mentioned before, that I made sure it count. I want to see you sing. If you ain't singing, I ain't do my job. Totally. So tell me about Hey Hey. What happened when that came out? I mean, that was a bomb that hit the dance charts in multiple countries. Was that, what was that like for you? That wasn't intended that way. It was, at that point, we were still doing, we were on the edge of Sofa House and Techie. We were on that edge. We hadn't fully, nobody in the Sofa scene had switched over yet. But I saw a change coming. And the reason I saw change coming because I already had lived the techie part. You know, I already knew about techno. I knew where we were going. I didn't like it at first because I put all this work into learning, you know, chord structures and keyboard playing. You know, so now I'm like, what, I got to go backwards to go forwards again? Oh, this is going to suck. So I sat down and I said, what if I can meld the two together? And since objectivity was basically a label that I, another label that I, I owned Sphere before with Kerry. And I decided objectivity would be something different where I'd have a no holds barred approach where I said, you know, I put out what I like. If it's edgy, the edgier, the better for me. I don't care. It's an outlet. I'm not trying to make a statement. I just want to make cool things. Again, things that make you sing. So I wrote the lyrics to this record. And I sat there and I was like, you know what? This is catchy as all hell. I'm like, and I was thinking about, you know, when girls walk by and, you know, the construction workers would whistle, be like, yo, hey, baby, hey, hey, you know, things like that. I said, what if I did a record like that, but I made it sad? Everybody thinks Hey Hey is a happy record. Hey Hey is not a happy record. It's a sad record. It's actually, if you listen to the lyrics, it's sad, you know? And that's how I was feeling at the time in the middle of a relationship. You know, you can always tell where I am in a relationship by hearing my songs, but I think that's everybody, you know? whatever we write. And that's, I just wrote that record. And Shingi, Shaniba, who was with the Noisettes, was in town for some photo shoots while she was signed to Mercury. And I said, well, could you sing on this record? And we won't say it was you. Maybe we can do a play on words and say, you know, Miss Noise. So Mercury wasn't none too happy about that. They were like, no, if she does it, no affiliation. Just, you know, no credit, nothing. Because I wrote the song. anyway. I wrote all the lyrics. I did all the production work. So she was more like a work for hire. And I love her. I love her to death. She's amazing. She's an amazing singer. She came in, she knocked it out, got paid, dipped out, and we thought nothing of it. We said, that's a house record. What's it going to do? If we sell 5,000 copies, we'd be, we were lucky. And all of a sudden, like three weeks later, the record's just insanely blowing up. We can't stop it. Can't stop it. And it just went like viral. I don't know. And it was actually underground, believe it or not. When it first came out the first two, three weeks, it was actually underground. It was nothing like it. There was nothing out like it. And then it just went nuts and I couldn't stop it. So then, which was really funny, was a reviewer for RA, for your guys, reviewed it and then said, I wouldn't be surprised if he disappears for a minute. He nailed it. Your reviewer nailed it. Because you're like, the block is too hot. I got to get out of here. And he nailed it. Everybody knew, everybody around me knew what I was. going to do, but not anybody outside of my inner circle, except for the reviewer for RA. And I always looked at that and I went, yo, he knew what I was going to do. I popped my head out and then I chilled out for a while. If you notice, I chilled out for a while and cooled it off. I had to. Because everybody was going to expect me to do hey-hays. And I was never hey-hays. I was just good songs. If they happen to be hits, it's just luck. But you could have chosen another path where you indulge that even more. You know what I mean? Because some people would be like, ooh, this is a great formula. I'm going to keep going. I wouldn't be around today. Exactly. I wouldn't be around today. And that's the truth. I wouldn't have been around today. I would have ballooned my load. It would have just been like, there you go. Okay, take the money and run. It took a lot, even now, to back You know, it took a lot. And I still work at it today. You know, because once you get, once you stigmatize with that perception, it's like. dude but that's not what defined me that record didn't define me I mean you fuckers forgot about Sandcastles you know Timbuktu you know Deep Penetration the back door I mean Son of Raw Everybody forgot about those records. Underground is my home. I mean, I was never hey, hey. I could do hey, hey till I'm blue in the face. I can do those with my eyes closed. Dime a dozen. Everybody wishes I could do that so they can get paid. But I realized early that I wouldn't be around too long. And I didn't do this to make, I didn't get in this business to make money and leave. This for me was a lifestyle. I don't know nothing else. This is me waking up in the morning. If I can't do what I love, then what am I going to do? So am I going to jeopardize what I love to do just for the sake of a few dollars? Nah, man. The dollars is in the longevity. Well, it seems like you've chosen a pretty sustainable path. You didn't blow out. Actually, one of the things I want to ask you about is the balance between staying hip with the new sounds while also remaining genuine to yourself. You know what I mean? Well, that's a musician just being a musician. Every musician wants to learn. He wants to learn new chord progressions. He wants to learn new fingerings. He wants to play with the newest drum machine that may sound different than the 20 other ones he has. You know, when you see a kid come up and he does an amazing record. You know, OK, here goes the thing. When I was 18 and I was making records. Right. And I heard an amazing record by someone else. I wanted to kick that record's ass. All right. I wasn't trying to be your friend. Now, we can be friends after after the studio session. But while I'm making my record, I would A and B it. And I'd have. to say, yo, my record's got to be, my worst record's got to be better than your good record. If my worst record ain't better than your good record, I'm still not done with this record. Back to the drawing board. And so I kept that up. That's never left me. That bit of competitive fire has never left me. And some people say, oh, D, but it's art. To a point, it's art. Yes, to a point. But you've got to have inner desire, that inner fire to want to learn, to want to be better, to want. to make better records. So if a new style comes out, look, like I tell everybody, I make dance music. Is it house? It might be house today. Is it techno? It might be techno tomorrow. It might be a different genre in 10 years. But what I do is dance music. And if somebody's 18 to 35 dancing in the club and they're calling that dance music, then that's what I want to make. Just because I'm an old ass man at that point doesn't mean I don't want to be cool. Everybody wants to remain and be cool. But there's also a certain type of thirsty, inauthentic, contrived way of doing that. And I feel like you as someone who's been able to really balance that in a way where you're... You're staying up with what's new, but you're being you, you know? Because if you can't, the rule was, and this was the rule that was instituted by Kerry, Jerome, and everybody around me at that time when I was growing, when I was learning music. Look, you can do Afro House, right? But make sure it's authentic Afro house, that it doesn't sound cheesy. You get it? So if you had Tony Allen on the drums and it just happened to be house, it's Tony Allen on the drums. It's authentic. Now you get horn players, you get horn section, you play that. You get the cheesy Casio keyboard from the 1970s to do those chord progressions and those chord steps, just like Fela. You made sure. that it sounded authentic. So the same thing applies. If you're going to do techno today, well, you need to know what techno is. That's just it. You do it authentic. You know, Carl Craig, you know, Richie, early Richie, all of that stuff. Those dudes were techno, you know? So that has remained my rule. Whatever the music goes, wherever I go. If I'm going to do it, if I can't do it, then I need to learn how to do it until it sounds authentic. And only when it sounds authentic and I think I've got something good, I'll let somebody else hear it. And if like 10 people tell me it's an incredible record, then I'll let it go. Dude, I've got a hard drive for like 100 records that nobody, only NASA's heard it, you know, and you're like, yeah, they're not coming out. the garbage, you know, but then they're great ideas in 10 years and you go, oh, wait, you know, maybe this will work. I want to change the subject a little bit. And so a lot of people who were around and playing out. in the 90s get pretty nostalgic about all the places we've talked about like limelight and um the sort of like great clubs of yesteryear and i i wanted to ask you do you do you find that people are kind of wearing like rose tinted glasses like do you think that it's like looking backwards it's like a little nostalgic or You know what I mean? Like the way it's been historically sort of canonized. It's been canonized because people always like what they grew up with. It's a memory. They have memories associated. Dude, you can't be 40 years old now and get a memory like that. You know, you got the kids, you got the job in the morning. Dude, when you were 18, you didn't give a shit about that. Let's be honest. So yeah, you got ripped off your brain. You lost like 20 million brain cells that night. Yeah, you did something you weren't supposed to be doing. Yeah, that's a fond memory. So everything's going to be rose-tinted glasses after that. But to tell you the truth, man, I've been to some of the most... incredible venues lately. And to me, it's the same. Dude, I've seen incredulous things that I'd be ashamed to say I visualized and I saw. And I'm like, dude, that would have never happened at Limelight. And I've seen a lot of shit at Limelight. Yes, the freaks are alive and well in 2018. I'm telling you, man, I've seen it with my very own eyes. And I'm like... Wow. That's even extreme for limelight. Okay. So it's, it's, everybody likes to look fondly back on memories. At this point in time, let's just keep it moving. There's tons of amazing places that you should have fun and visit and enjoy the experience. And I'm sure if you let go a little bit, let go of that history, I'm sure you make and create new memories for yourself. And on the same subject, this is like a slightly darker point, but it's something I've been talking about with a few different New York artists who have been in the game for a while. Something that some people often talk about is what happened with 9-11 in 2001 and how that changed the culture of the city and how you could feel that its impact in music and nightlife and arts. And it was sort of this like fucked up psychic energy. Is that something that resonates with you? That didn't change shit here. Changed it for about six months when nobody could go out gigging. It's bull crap, man. All right. That didn't change the scene. People felt bad. We all felt bad. We felt horrible. It's an absolutely horrible thing that happened. Did it change the musical landscape? Clubbing? No, it didn't. It didn't. It really didn't. What changed clubbing was the Giuliani laws, the Giuliani era with the cabaret laws and, you know, the quality of life. That had more to do with changing New York's nightlife than anything anybody can make up, anything. I mean, they locked it down. They locked New York down. down. And also we slept. We slipped up. There was no musical innovation coming out. Let's be honest. It wasn't like we were being innovative musically. I mean, that was all happening in Europe. You know, the Germans took that over, you know. That was like a dead patch for New York. Dude, nobody, nobody, nope. We were still trying to do the same old, same old. Holding on to, you know, to our old rose-tinted glasses. Oh, still trying to do gospel records when, you know, if you played that overseas, the floor would walk off. But no, we still wanted to play it here. No, man, times change. Kids, they dipped out from that. I told everybody. I was like, yo, man, nah. And everybody got mad at me. They thought I was crazy. I want to play, like I said, I wanted to play to a club full of 3,000 screaming, you know, young adults, not to people who need babysitters. I'm sorry. That's just the truth, you know, and New York was slow to it. The laws changed. The clubs failed. You know, Brooklyn was just developing. And then Brooklyn ran the gauntlet. They got hip and they got Europeans. And, you know, Europeans basically took over the house market. It's not a bad thing. It's an excellent thing. It had to grow. Well, a lot of... a lot of DJs who are successful in the United States end up moving to Europe because that's where the market is and that's where the crowd is. Like, is that something you ever considered? It was always there. There's nothing been different. We always gigged over there more than we gigged over here. That's just bull. If you hear, if somebody told you that's bull crap, we've always gigged more in Europe. We've all. The United States has always been a hip hop nation. It will always be a hip hop nation. Always. Because of the influence minorities have on music culture here. That's it. When, you know, house music in a minority, in an ethnic neighborhood where I came from was considered. not cool. It just wasn't at that time. You know, it was all about drugs, guns, beats, rhymes, bitches, hoes. You know, house music was like, oh, so you're going to play that gay shit tomorrow night, right, D? You see? And that's why it never took hold here really hard. You know, EDM was different. EDM was like a phenomenon, you know, and that took hold in suburbia. That's a suburbia thing that somehow magically transformed itself into the city. You know, but otherwise, no, man, we've always, it's always been overseas for us. Always. So it's been tough. Look, you don't do dance music because you're going to get rich. Not real dance music. Not underground shit. No, I'm sorry. It's like Phil Damien, who used to come into Rogue. A friend of mine called Phil Damien, he used to come into Rogue. He called it sneaker money. I used to laugh. I'd be like, what are you talking about, sneaker money? Yeah, I get it. It's sneaker money. You know the reason why they call it house music, right? I'm like, why? Because you can only afford to make it in your house. This is the art of love. Let's talk about how you linked up with the Martinez brothers. Okay. So, you know, like the way you talk about Kerry Chandler was that he was kind of a mentor to you and then you were kind of a mentor to them. So how did you guys get linked up? Well, at that time when MySpace was popular, I had a page up. And young Chris had hit me up. I think he was like 13 or 14 at the time. And he said he was a DJ. And I always admired that. You know, I always admired people, especially young kids, who were ballsy enough to be like, look, listen to my CD. He was 14, man. Who the hell does that? Like, that's ballsy. Okay, that was ballsy. And I'm like, and he was a fan. And I was like, yo, send me the CD. And I heard the CD. It's like, yo, this kid is good. And then he tells me, but can I bring my brother with me? My brother's a little older. And, you know. He plays too. And I'm like, oh, well, I don't know. I don't know. I just heard you really. And so I had a night at the shelter with Jerome Sendem one night. And I was about to play. And I wanted to make something fun that night. I said, you know what? Let's do something different. I'm bored. I need to do something crazy for some inspiration. So I asked my management, I says, how could we get two young kids under the legal age of entering any establishment, drinking laws that is, how do we get them into a club so they can play? Well, they told us they can only come after the bar is closed, which is 4 a.m. So me and Jerome would have to play at 4 a.m. I mean, we'd have to play from our slots to 4 a.m. Then the boys could come in and play as artists. So that's what we did. From 4 a.m. to 6 a.m. That's right. So we waited till 4 a.m. and we brought the two boys with us. And Jerome was like, what the fuck are you doing, basically, D? I was like, don't worry, man. This is going to be cool. This is going to be really cool. taking pictures and stuff. I wish they were here right now so I could ask them about that night. Yeah, that was so cute. That was a cute night. That was sweet. It was so young, man. Did their dad drive them to the club? Yeah, yeah. Their dad was with them too, yeah. Senior was there with them. And it was great, you know, and that's how it started. It was really sweet. It was a really sweet relationship with them. So what were some of the things that you tried to impart on them? Like what were some of the lessons that you tried to transmit? The same thing I've always told everybody. You know, I'm really, I'm sorry because I'm very opinionated, you know, and I feel bad. Sometimes I say things that I shouldn't say, but I just kind of feel they need to be said. It's the same things I tell Nas. I tell him, make sure your worst record is better than somebody's good record. Be straight up with everybody. Don't suck your own Johnson and believe your own hype. It was just basic things. I taught them about production. Being there, you know what I mean? Just being a good overall person to try to teach somebody. Because I think that's what, if you're in this music business, I think that's what you should do. You need to share this. You don't own this. Nobody owns this. owns this. This was a gift that was given to me. And I feel that I haven't done my part in life if I don't give that gift back. If I don't give you the ability, the skill to make a record, you still have to have that creative energy, that creative skill. You still have to be an artist. But if I can teach you how to bring that out, if I can give you the skill set to bring that out, then I think, to me, that's a beautiful thing. That's a gift. So that gift was given to me, and I have to share that gift. And I think anybody who doesn't do that, who doesn't share that gift with somebody they believe deserves it, I think you're fucked up. Straight up. I think you're greedy. I think you don't deserve the gift that's been given to you. You share. I don't give a shit. You share. EQ. You know. Why hide the way you EQ a kick? Why hide the kick you use? Nobody's going to use the same drums the same exact way you use them. A bass sound, really? You're going to hide a bass sound from somebody because you're afraid they can't make it? Dude, I can recreate any bass sound you do in two seconds. That's how long I've been doing this. Really? I wouldn't use it the same way you use it anyway. So what's the point in holding on to things, holding on to sound libraries like Gollum, like the Precious. What are you, crazy, dude? Share. That's what this art is for, is for sharing, sharing your feelings and sharing what you've learned over the years, what you've accumulated, so that you can pass this on. And that person can pass on that knowledge. This sounds like a very like open source software kind of mindset. It is. It has to be. It has to be because that's what it was done. That's what was done to me. Nobody, nobody hogged up anything with me. That's how I learned. Listen, I learned. from basically an ambient god from tetsu inui i went to damon wilde who was like mr acid king i went to carrie chandler who was mr house went to jerome syndham i've learned i can't count the number of people that i've learned from and nobody told me no there was one thing you said in another interview that i read of yours that sort of has to do with this don't believe your own hype thing that you were talking about where you were saying that at a certain level of being a professional touring DJ, life sort of becomes a fantasy land. Yeah, it does. I found that to be really interesting. Can you talk about... what it's like when you're all of a sudden being on the beach in Ibiza is just like a boring... That's not life. That's not your life. Your life is when you get home and the rent is due. And you're two months behind because you've been on tour. Or the light bill is due also. And the car note. And if you got divorced, the alimony and child support. And the cat is dead because nobody let the cat in. The cat's been gone for two weeks. He never comes home. While you were sipping margaritas on the beach. That's real life. Real life isn't Ibiza and tequila shots for five straight nights and a three-day bender afterwards. That's not life. That's what happened in the interim of life. You know? I mean, that's just the truth. That's a true story. I mean, I remember coming home. one time thinking I was the man. I come through the kitchen, say hello everybody. You know, I got my chin up high and all I get is like, yeah, hey, hi, your cat took a shit on the floor. You mind picking it up? I'm like, excuse me, what? Like, wait, hold up. Let's do the remark. Hi, I'm home. Hi, everybody. Yeah, yeah, we heard that already. The cat took a shit on the floor. You mind picking it up? That's life. That's life. And whatever you do in between that, you try to enjoy. But you don't make it your life. You know, life to me is me buying a kayak and going fishing and enjoying nature. Why? Because it's free. It's free. I ain't got to pay for that. I just get in a yacht. Yeah, I had to make the investment, but I get in a yacht, get to the middle of the lake, and all I hear is birds, fish, frogs, and it's me and the world, the real world, nature. That's it. Then I got to get back to life, get back in the car, go to the studio, and start all over again. Partying is not life. You lose your family, it's a very difficult life. I mean, I was the man who slept on the couch. That's how the kids knew me. Who's the stranger who sleeps on the couch, you know, basically? I mean, my kids are full grown. You know, God bless them. But they grew up without a father, basically. And that's the real truth. That's the honest truth. The truth hurts. But that's what it is. And that's the price. That's my cross to bear. Now, ask me if I would do it again. Would you do it again? Fuck yes. In a fucking heartbeat. Without a fucking second doubt. do it again and have no regret. Hell no. Now call me fucked up, but that's me. That's what I was, I was made to do this. And I'm going to die doing this. That's it. Now whether I ride off into the sunset or I pull a Gil Scott Heron, where I'm broken of freaking projects and they find me, you know, stiff as a doornail on a reclining chair watching the Yankees. Or a sliding stone in the trailer park outside of his mom's house. It's going to be what it's going to be. Yeah. It's going to be what it's going to be. But you know what? I did it out of love. And that's all you can hope for in life. That's it. Can't take it with you, bro. But there's one thing they can't take from me, my music, or my ability to make my music. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
