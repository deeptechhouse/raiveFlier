Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Guy Gerber is an intense individual. In one of our most revealing exchanges yet, he talks about the psychic that changed his musical career, his collaborative project with P. Diddy that has still not seen the light of day, and the voices inside his head that refuse to stop chattering away. It's an exchange that I can honestly say gets more fascinating as it goes along. In other words, you're going to want to stay all the way until the end for this one. You're moving back to Berlin. Berlin has got its clutches in you. Yes, you know, it took me so many years to get out of Tel Aviv because I had like a really, really, really, really nice place over there. And it took me so many years. But after I... When is Madrid good? Madrid hmm Madrid is good when you want to fly to South America through through a Spanish airport, then you should go through Madrid. That seems like a very specific... No, I had a good time there, but unfortunately, you know, food is very important for me. And I kind of like got to know the good places only before I was leaving. And just before I was leaving, I got to know like the best places and I was very comfortable, but I was already leaving. What are the best places to eat in Madrid? You have the market, San Miguel. I mean, that would be, I don't know, for tourists, that would be the best tourist experience, but still also very food, like culinary experience. You have like a lot of stands of food, and it's open until 2 a.m. Are you a cook? I started recently. What's your dish? My dish, I would say I take chicken, I soak it in beer for three hours. It's already kind of like gets you. And then I put some mustard on it, take some garlic, stuff it under the skin. some rosemary and all this process takes besides soaking the the chicken that takes like five minutes but you have to wait it's like a 15 minutes process but it feels like i am yeah i've done a lot of work on it And my speciality in general is, I mean, in the music, I spend a lot of time. I spend a lot of time. But in general, the rest, I like to do stuff that looks like it took a long time, but it actually was very easy to do. I like this thing that I don't, let's say, I don't know, let's say in Italian, I don't know how to speak Italian, even though I was living in Rome, but I know one word that in any conversation, if you speak with Italian people, like any conversation, you just come up with this word, everybody like stands in awe. They're like, it's called sorvaliamo. I'm already in awe. Yeah. It means let's fly over it. Like let's fly. So you can say it also in many situations. So let's fly over it. But it's in a very, I don't know, very... high literature language. So, you know, you don't know what to say of anything and they kind of like ask you. So you just find the right moment. You just like say, sorraliamo. And everybody, ooh, he knows. Wow. So they're like, that's good. Is this just the Italian version of the Lion King where they say hakuna matata, no worries. Yeah, no worries. But in a... Lini would talk like that. Like somebody, it's a very high language. I mean, it's not common. Most of the people, you never hear this word until somebody mention it and it's you. So they think, ah, he must know. So your philosophy on life is to fake it, to make things look like they've gone. No, I'm just a little bit retarded, and I want people to think that I'm smart, but I don't have time to be smart. Yeah, so I had this thing. Also, my friend bought me a book. I mean, you know, of course, you know, I'm half joking, but we had this book and it's five sentences on each subject in the world. like economy, philosophy, history, and just like the five sentences that if you go into a conversation and you can just like join, blend in with the five important things to say about the conversation. And if like something you don't know, you just like blend into another conversation that you hear about. No, it's not about fake it. I just... I like... What's been the one phrase that you've used the most out of that book? I didn't really read it. I just liked the idea of it. I just liked the idea of it. I didn't trust it. If it was written by me, I wouldn't know which five sentences would fit in the conversation. It just didn't feel like sentences that you can... I think in general for me, because I have all these thoughts in my mind and people who know me that I have like... very preoccupied and sometimes you know I'm very not present so when people talk around me I'm not always like listening so I have to react really fast even I didn't hear part of the conversation so I have to come up with some tricks how do I always look like I was actually listening What are you thinking about? There's music all the time. You're hearing stuff. All the stuff together. I'm thinking a lot of things, unfortunately. I'm overthinking. I'm overthinking about all the things all together and at the same time, why do I have to think about all of them together and how come I can't stop thinking and then somebody says something, I react and then... I'm thinking how did you fake it again and look that you actually believed that you were actually listening. So then I have this extra thought going and it's all going like that. Like, you know, there is like a roller coaster of thoughts. Must be strange to be living in your head. You have no idea. I have no idea. Since I'm three, I'm like that. I remember this kind of like conscience since I'm three. What was it like growing up in Tel Aviv? I'm from a city near Tel Aviv. Very different from Tel Aviv. It's not a small city, but it's not... It's very rough. My neighborhood wasn't that rough, but it's a rough city. It's not cosmopolitan like Tel Aviv. There is not so much culture. There's some poverty in some areas. But for me, it was great. you know, it's kind of like a neighborhood thing, so all the children play together, and let's say the person from first grade playing with the person from eighth grade, and you just build a house on the trees, and you play Monopoly, you know, in the basement, like all the kids together, very kind of like a together feeling, and... In a way, it leaves you a lot of place for imagination. Rather than Tel Aviv, they're much more, I don't know, they know already the good music, they know already the good movies to watch, and they're more educated, not educated, but more culturally advanced. But it's kind of like being fed to you by your older brother or by people in your class. And for me, I really have to discover it by myself because it wasn't so common. So anyway, it was difficult, but it kind of leaves you more, I don't know, more place to be yourself. I've always heard the Tel Aviv is quite cosmopolitan. in terms of culture. I mean, everyone is sort of on it. They know what's going on. Yeah, they know what's going on. And I think for me, it's one of the most, you know, for me, it's the best city in the world, but also because it's kind of like home to me because I was living very close to it. But at the same time... it's a very small place, like very small place. So they have the knowledge, but it's still very small and it's not in the center because a lot of times small places think that this is the center of the, not the center of the universe, but it's kind of like central. And the same, it's also very problematic. For me, it was too small. I don't like, I don't like to go the same place. Some people go to the same place every day of the week. And some people, I mean, a lot of people, most of the people there feel very comfortable with it. And for me, I always felt that I need a little bit more than that. So this lifestyle is perfect for you, right? Traveling all the time, basically. I like to be in the studio, but to be honest, I like this fact that I don't have to stay in the same place and kind of like have like a routine. I mean, I like chill, I mean, home routine. I wouldn't mind if it would be like, I mean, almost like the same all the time. But going to the same bar, seeing the same people every single day. Besides it's like your best friends, it's not something that, yeah, I like it like that, that I travel. When did you get into electronic music? Was it pretty early on or did you come to it late? First I was like, I had a rock band, I was into rock. kind of like almost hated electronic music because like for me that beat, you know, if you come from like in drums and guitars and, you know, like a CC part of a track and this monotonous thing, I didn't understand in the beginning. I mean, I did like Depeche Mode or Soft Cell or I don't know, like... human league but just electronic music the first time i listened to richie houghton before i was into it it sounded boring to me before i just before i did before i understood it have you told richie houghton what have you told richie houghton this that you saw him and you you didn't get it I didn't tell him yet. I didn't tell him. I should tell him. But later, when I did understand it, I found it amazing, the thing that he was doing. Let's say this Dex and FX thing that he did. Because a lot of this music is based on nuance. so you have to be into the music and just to get the nuance and me in general my music when I started to do it I was doing it in a way that people that like don't like electronic music will listen to it and still will enjoy it but I think let's say minimal music or that kind of music is mainly for people who loves electronic music as a thing electronic it's very electronic and it's very for people who educate it into having the history and so i i think it's amazing but it's not it wasn't my thing my best especially at that time I imagine that's why your early stuff at that time touched a lot of people because it was coming from a place that other people hadn't really heard in a little bit. Yeah, and it was also coming from Tel Aviv. When I was doing what I was doing, there was no scene at all. So I was just getting influenced. from everywhere and kind of like I mean, I wasn't even traveling at this time, so I would imagine how Deep House that is made in Paris would sound like. But I haven't been in these parties, and I would imagine how Detroit would sound. But at the same time, because I didn't have so much knowledge and not so many people to share information with, my production skills weren't that good, and in the end I ended up making music. touch a lot of people but I wasn't so proud of it I wasn't so and it's also sometimes being appreciated at people that I didn't appreciate it much I mean so I get like you're very hard on yourself how much I'm paying you in the end Yeah, you know there is this book called "The Steppenwolf"? I don't know if you know it, like by Hermann Hesse. So I read it very early and it's very similar to me. I have like this wolf all the time that is like, yeah, observing and checking. But unfortunately, it makes me also very critical with others because if you're critical with yourself, so you're like, how come the others are not like that? And then I'm a little bit cut, but I do make some discounts for myself and not so often I give it to others. I should work on it because I think others accept me. much more than I accept some other people. But... Have you ever been happy when you finish stuff? When I finish a track? Usually, actually this story, yeah, this story, I think it's a very interesting story. So, been working on some stuff, not happy, and also not, until... When was this? This one, I was, I think just before I did Stoppage Time, I think it's around 2005, 2004. I wasn't, like, I was just making music. I wasn't sending stuff to labels. I wasn't thinking I should know this, I should release on this particular label. Because all my knowledge was, like, mainly from rock music or indie. So I wasn't so involved in the scene. And I didn't think about this, like, as a career move, I should do this in order to get there. I was just, like, making music and, you know, whatever happened with it. But I was broke. Most of my life I was broke, so at one point I was like, okay, what am I going to do? Something needs to happen. And some situation here, situation there, I find myself going to a psychic. And when you go to a psychic... you're not there by mistake. So it's not like by mistake you're passing by a house. I mean, it's not that I believe. But anyway, you try this, you try this. I went to her and she didn't know anything about it. music just like this common person it's not even like in the city when it was actually it's like very hard a hard place so i'm just i'm going to a house the first thing she tell me i mean it's also maybe easy to say or whatever but she tells me um that i have to still you know i'm saying this now to people it's kind of it's funny but they have these two people inside me that you know they are making all the music but I'm like their enemy and everything they're trying to help me I destroy it by overthinking and overdoing things. This is like the first thing she tells me. I just like entered it. I'm overthinking and I'm overdoing things and I'm destroying everything. She specifically said music. Specifically said music and the way I make the music. Like the first thing she tells me, like exactly the way I work. And she told me, go home today. You're going to go home. And you promised me, you promised me, you're going to press record. You're going to play. and you're not going to touch it after. Whatever is going to happen today, this track or whatever you're going to do tonight, you're going to do one and you're not going to change it. So I'm going back home. I had my girlfriend there, one of my girlfriends, and her friends were there. They were sitting on the sofa. So I took a, I took, I opened a track that I had and I erased everything beside the beat, but I just left the most common beat, just a kick and a snare. So later I will work on the drums. So I just have a beat so I can play with. And I'm opening the synth, connecting to the compressor and somehow the sound is very intense. It's like very, like as if there was like presence in the room. So I'm just like putting this chord. Listen to this. Yeah, here, live on the exchange. And I'm playing. And usually I play, I don't use MIDI that much. So I try to play and later edit it. So I'm just like playing. And I have this melody that I keep on playing and just playing with a filter. And it sounds pretty cool. And I'm just like feeling, I'm getting into it and getting into it. And at one point, I'm just like opening slowly the filter, opening slowly the filter. And at the peak moment, on the most intense part. When everything is open, all of a sudden comes the drum beat, like this high-hat that I just forgot to erase, because basically I just erased everything, but I didn't go to the end of the window. So the peak moment comes with drums, and it just fits amazing with what I was doing, but I'm just like with myself, and I'm like, wow, that's like... I left the hit. It's in my album. It's called Planetarium. So I said, yes, I will try not to overthink. And I think my biggest track, Stoppage Time, it was in my live act. And a lot of people asked me, you know, you should make a track out of it. You should make a track out of it. But it was already kind of like a big hit while I was playing. So I was like... I was too lazy to start editing it and make a big track out of it. But one day a friend is like sitting in my house and he said, okay, you have to do it right now. So I just like press record. I record exactly what I was doing when I was playing live. And then there was some parts was a bit too long. I opened the synth. I connected it to the delay pedal. I played a solo, one take. and I gave it to him as a demo. A demo. And later, you know, people will listen to it and later, you know, I will edit it. He went to London. Next day, I started to get all these phone calls from record companies. And in the end, I started with Bedrock. But I told him it's just a demo, so I need to work on the track. So I need to work on it. By that time, by the end of the week, it was already in two or three compilations, and it was already out. I said, it's not ready. And it went out like that. And the best part about this track... that it took me, I don't know, like four or five hours to do, is that because I was jamming, so there is like this long break, and when the drums comes in, it's not like the usually like eight bars. It's like, I don't know, like 17 or like 19. So even myself, when I used to play it, like when I would play this version. you know, there is like this sequence and the synth comes with a sound effect and I always stand in front of other people and I'm like, you know, the drums come now and now. It always confuses you. It always comes like a bar earlier and you cannot get used to it. Like it's impossible to figure out when exactly it comes. unfortunately, this, before you get success, so you're kind of like doing your own stuff, and you do whatever you want, and you're on your own time, but when you release stuff, then people kind of like start expecting, something from you so what do people expect from you what do you expect my problem is because i have this agenda that i'm trying to be not trying because the way i do it is a little bit more unique so people expect it for me to be special like they have to be special and what does it mean special It has to be melodic, but I hate repeating myself. So later I kind of got like this a lot of... It became a bit more difficult for me. Natitude wasn't difficult before because also as... myself when i do stuff i hate repeating myself i mean i hate also you know i like to change softwares i like to buy new synthesizers so i don't have like the same the same thing but the same time as an artist i like when artist has a language you know he has like his own language so as so i'm not going to change I mean, trends change. I don't like to go with a trend. I want to do something new, but I also want to do something that is me and kind of like has some kind of like resemblance to what I did in the past. So when I go to do something, I have all these thoughts. It has to be futuristic, classic, interesting, but still simple, not over the top, but still intense. So this is when I go to the studio, this is what I have usually in mind. And it's hard. It's hard. For me, like, music... is a struggle that I enjoy. That's the thing that I like the most. I used to tell my mom, before I was like, I was like broke, I didn't have any success, and she was like, what will happen with you? She was worried. And I told her, I mean, this moment you're at night, even in the next day, it sounds like shit. time it's like that but that moment when you think you created this world that is like out there and it gives you i mean you i mean you when you reach this height even it's for like a minute for me it's like the feeling that i like the most in this world to have this feeling that's like wow it's like it's over there i'm like i'm there Even later, I'm disappointed, but it's still... That's what I'm trying to achieve, to achieve this moment when the music is over there. This is what you said to your mom. I told her that she wouldn't worry, because for me, I'm happy. I'm happy with what I do. I think when things start to work well for you, I mean, the best thing about it, more not that you have like money or like you have this or you have like the girls or whatever, it's the feeling I was right. Because until you get this moment, everybody around you will tell you. what are you doing? There is no future in this. Especially in Tel Aviv when there is not so much music. There is music culture but it is not a real industry. There is very bad pop music. So there's not so many things to... I mean, if you're in Manchester and you play guitar, there's so many bands that maybe one day you will be this band. But over there, there's not so many things to look at, okay, well, I can be this person. But there was quite a scene there, right? There was quite a scene. There was quite a scene, but either trance that I hate, especially people in Tel Aviv. I mean, this is like more from... is outside Tel Aviv. And there was a big scene, but not a scene of producers. There was like, you know, biggest parties were, like part of the biggest parties were in Tel Aviv. Deep Dish would come, Tenaglia, Derrick May, Richie would come. But there wasn't so many producers doing this kind of music. And I'm surprised that... you know you would have these enormous parties but there would be no momentum or like inspiration for people to go oh I want to do that there have to be five people in that audience right so they were they just wasn't they weren't so good enough So, besides, there was the first guy that got success was Moshik. There was a guy called Moshik. And he was the first one that wasn't doing trance. He was doing, like, deep, dark, progressive. And he was the first one that kind of, like, started to do this stuff, that, you know, started to be, you know, travel around the world. And then it would be me. But then I wasn't so happy with the progressive scene. I didn't feel so connected to it. And then it started to be very dark. And I think the story, the most, I mean, it kind of got me strong. I was doing rock and then came all these big parties were amazing all the girls were there I mean it was much more rock and roll than the rock scene in Israel and you know came this you know the parties itself they had we had amazing parties I got into that and the more I become better at it because it took me some time you know until I kind of like start to produce the way I wanted to produce, the scene started to go down. So the better I got, and it's like, okay, before they wouldn't let me play anywhere, but when they actually finally let me play in this club, already nobody wanted to go there. Because, you know, we had some bombing, the scene was over-flooded. Also with so many DJs, Tel Aviv was very small. So the scene started to be very, I mean, became uncool when I kind of like became better. And a lot of the DJs were like superstars, like local DJs. They were superstars. They used to be superstars. They all kind of like freaked out and everybody wanted to... to retire because they could see the difference was very, the change was very fast. And then I realized, no, I actually just like this music. I just love this music. And whatever happened, this club is shit. Like, it's weird. It's like freaks. But I just like making this music. So I'm going to do it anyway. And only when I started traveling. I remember when I played Time Warp the first time, I was shocked how amazing this music can also appeal to really nice people and also can have thousands of people with no violence and the people who so many people support. this music that was like i couldn't believe that it's like that so i was like well if i knew it was like that i would i would be much more ambitious before i would just like send the i don't know the tracks to all the labels in the world i just never sent anything um so how did your tracks get how did i check so you know you get you said you got this call so that's why i said all All the calls came from a friend, usually coming from the UK, passing through my house, they tell him there is this producer doing some stuff, you know, the DJ would come, listen to some stuff, I would give him some tracks, he would give it to labels. I never actually sent something to anybody. That's why I was more related to the progressive labels because it's the only people who come to Israel, come to my house. I didn't know what's cool or not cool. I didn't know if this label is the cool one or this one is not cool. When Bidrock called you up, did you know all about them? I knew the D-Grid. is huge. I knew that this label is great and I knew that if Pitong, something that I wouldn't listen to so much, but I knew that if, you know, I put it essential tune of the week, then your career is booming. But either I wasn't ready, but as I said, I didn't like most of the music that was put out. And I would say my actual breakthrough was after a few years like that, that I see still nothing is happening, and I don't feel so comfortable within the world that I am. So I decided I'm going to open my own label, which will be... I identified with something in particular and people will just listen to the music. Also I can be in charge of the artistic design. So I opened the label and then I just also started to hang out. Actually I should mention him because I think he was very influential on me. One of my best friends. is actually the editor, used to be the editor of the culture portal in Israel, but then it was like an intellectual person. I tell you, after like... weeks that I'm going to these places and only like pimps, hookers, junkies, sluts, like really hard places. Then I see this like really intellectual guy, love this music. And he also introduced me to more interesting stuff. And, you know, also to see the artistic part of it, because for me, I was an artist, but like the music that was involved, it was more like... People like the music, but the art, let's say part of it wasn't really vivid within it. And yeah, then I started to do more stuff like this and like that, and I think I started to be better. And just, it took me, you know, because I'm also not so organized, it took me a long time to get the first release ready. But just before releasing it, you know, the music was already, I thought it can fit maybe in any label. Maybe I should send, for the first time in my life, maybe I should send it to a label. that maybe we can do a better promotion and that's what i can do by myself and everybody told me send it to cocoon that at that point was like the biggest label and at that point you know they were doing a lot of stuff and um He told me that Sven, Sven, but like your staff, you should send something to him. And, you know, Ibiza just started, you know, just started like being so strong and all the parties over there. James Alden was at this time at the label and in the agency. So I sent it to them, like literally, like, you know, just through the website. I got the email. I sent it through the website, just the most, you know, the most common way. They come back to me immediately. They remember my name because he was playing my track. And they told me, yeah, we like the track. Can you send us more tracks? Can I send us more tracks? And I said, like particularly, I send you this track, but you have to know this one and this one are already printed on vinyl. So this one is just for him to play. You know, not, I got an email back, Sven wants this track. But it took me almost a year to get it on a vinyl. Okay, what should I do? And luckily, you know, it's funny because I was with the manager at this time. a very kind of a commercial manager. And we just, I didn't, you know, he was trying to push me to direction that I didn't like. And just two weeks before that moment, we stopped working together because I just didn't feel right with the direction. And I was thinking, okay, great. Now come the situation, I don't have a manager. But in the end... Any manager would say, don't give it to them, let's release it ourselves. But I was like, you know what, I don't mind, I'm just going to give it to them, and let's see what's going to happen. And they were actually very nice with me. They said, you can keep all the vinyls that you printed with your label. There was like, I think like... like 800 copies, put them out, just put a label that is like licensed to us, and they bought it. But I think it's already kind of like created a very nice relationship between me and them. I would also say, you know, Jewish, I'm working with the Germans, and I have to say that they changed my life, like basically. You know, it was like something actually very... Like the relationship between us was so good immediately. And it's funny, you know. Let's go back to the Jewish Germans thing. No, you know, we have some history and I think it's kind of like interesting. It's kind of like interesting. Yeah, you know, my grandparents were like this. You know, we have some history. But I would say that for me, the people that helped the most my career. or the Germans, and, you know, I came to Germany, I came to Frankfurt, I felt, you know, it was very nice over here. And it's kind of like, I think it's funny, I find it pretty interesting that, like, for a Jewish guy, that he's got his biggest success immediately in Germany, that was something interesting in it. I find it, you know, I would go here, I would go there. And for me, being Israeli, being from such a controversial country, yeah, I found it, you know, I found it interesting to be Israeli because I was the first Israeli in that scene. So there would be like nobody even, you know, there was like, you know, there was the French scene. There were like freaking chic. There was like people from Berlin. There were people from the States. There were people. And for me, After me came Chaim and Shlomi Aber, but when I just started it was basically only me. And I think, you know, everybody really embraced me. At least at this time. After, you know, maybe they stopped liking me, but this is the beginning. Yeah, I find that everybody really embraces me. And yeah, you know, it's like I think... Israel is a political country. I mean, this area, it's all very political. And this music is very, you know, it's about escapism. People, you know, just... Have you run into problems in the business in your mind because of this? No, I didn't run into problems, but what I felt, it's interesting because when I arrive, people have some questions. You know, there's some questions, not like... not to bother you because they're interested how it is over there because they don't know so many people from there I mean maybe now it's more common but it's like do you feel responsibility sometimes I feel responsibility because because you're one of the few and when I'm one of the few and in general In general, I know that we have sometimes not so good ambassadors. Maybe some people go to India and they don't respect, like, you know, like, they don't respect, I mean, they go to these places and they don't respect, like, the environment. Or, in general, I felt some kind of responsibility. You know, to show, you know, at first there's music over there. There is, because as I said, there is a big trance band. They're very successful. But I don't want to speak like this about myself, but I'm one of the first, you know, for me to play at Fabric or to play at Panorama Bar. Coming from an area that nobody sees, like such a cultural place, it was like, you know, I feel like it's pride not only for me, also for my country. You know, it's like we can actually, yeah, we have some culture over there, and I can play in the best places in the world for this kind of music. Do you remember the first time you played at Fabric? I played, yeah. Actually, it was with Digweed. I think I played DJ set and it was one of the best gigs. You know, I still, maybe of course less, but I would be so nervous before I started playing because I used to play in Tel Aviv and... wasn't that hard to be very good. And then in a second, I'm playing with Lauren Garnier, with Richie, with Matt Deer, with all these people in a second. So I was terrified at the beginning. How can I play? after Richie, because the promoter put me. I mean, like, music for a strong sense, it's him, what I'm going to do. So I would get very nervous. But then after you start playing, then you're not nervous anymore. But I was extremely nervous at the beginning. I remember the Judy from Fabric, which is funny, she told me, that Digwit said just before the set, he was like, hey, actually a guy played before me because he wanted me to open and then his guy played after me and then he would play. And then Judith said, no, it's like, you know, it's like one of the headliners so he should play second. So when she told me, I said, okay, so he's also a bit nervous. So it's fine. He's also, you know, I'm sure. Even they get nervous sometimes So it's okay. I mean, if you're not nervous at all, I don't think you play that good. Because you get to, you know, you go to the basics. If you're nervous, then you do your best not to make mistakes and you more focus on what you do. Also, this kind of intensity that goes through the crowd. If you're kind of like intense, of course, there are people, you know, maybe I'm not the best frontman in the world, but these people... feel that I'm like going through something. They feel that I'm in it. It was many years later, but when you first got the call or the email or whatever from Fabric to do the mix CD, did you immediately think, I want to do all my own tracks, 70 minutes? Um... I wanted to do this thing for a long time and I already started an album like that that I just didn't finish. But for me... I get bored in making tracks because I like to do the essence of the track, I like to do the emotion, but club tracks are also, this music is also very functional. It means people have to dance, it has to fit in the mix. It means that there's an art form. I like that you have some limits, but as a producer it's also a bit boring, you know, if the track can start in, I have to put like 32 bars of just the beat. So these parts, in order to make them interesting, as I try to do, this part usually takes me more time than to make the track. Just how to make the intro functional, but still interesting. So I always wanted to do this 70 minutes, that, you know, just the tracks are connected and I don't have to do the intro and the outro. I just like go to the end of the track. and I just, you know, go to the next track and I can just like enjoy it. And like this I can do, because it's just, I see. So this whole thing was to get out of writing intros and outros. Yes. The only problem is, the only problem is, was that later you get stuck with a hundred channels and because I'm not so organized, so each channel has sometimes hi-hats, sometimes vocal, and now to mix it and just to... I mean, to go through the whole thing in your, all these metrics in your head because I was traveling. And I secured some time to work on it. But then not all my equipment arrived. And then I was moving an apartment. And in the end, I got stuck with only very little time. So the whole thing, to do something that is easy, started to be something, why the hell did I come up with this idea? I could just connect a few tracks and just finish with it. But I said, anyway, I already started. I have to do it. I have to do it. Like, I have to do it. And the way I did it is that if you have so little time, You don't have time. It's kind of like in order to make it on time, I couldn't lose time. It means that if I'm working now on the intro and I get stuck, I can't find chords, I have to go directly to the second track. So leave this part. Later I'll feel more inspired. So I'm going directly to the second part and I'm working on the drums. I get stuck, I go directly to another part. So there is no stops. Now I can stay on a track play with it and you said you in another interview you created like 40 minutes of music in three days in three days and it's funny because yeah the end of it because no but what this is like how I started it how I started but it means that within this one month that I had also I need to find the theme the language the vibe what should be the story, because I have to tell the story, because it's like, why don't just like creating a track, now I have to create a whole story, and I need to figure out what's the story, but I also need to create music all the time, and also at one point, I realized, one channel, one file is impossible. I would just be left with too many, I couldn't understand, so I had to separate it to four different files that only in the end, let's say in three weeks, when I have to connect it, I will know if they actually fit. And I worked really hard, and when I arrived at this moment, it was like... was already the end and I realized that all my capacity of let's say brain cell passion emotion I spent on creating but now in connecting everything which is like in a mix cd it's much more important than actual music I don't have any more RAM left so I get to the final point but I was exhausted so I kind of like connected it and this was the moment when I actually sent it to Fabric And basically, I didn't send them anything till now. Maybe the music is bad, because maybe the sound is bad. Maybe they don't, because it's not the most common Fabric CD. It doesn't have like this dark... You know, I said, I'm just going to put everything from my heart at this point. So I'm going to send them right now, just to get to see... if they like it or not. And if yes, I'm just going to go. I have a few more days to go over it and to finish it. So I sent it to them. They like it, but of course it's very raw. And as much as you can explain to people this is raw, they don't know. They just listen. They don't know exactly what it means. It was very, very raw and basic. I said we like it. And then it was already Miami came, like the WMC. I had like nine shows in six days. So my brain was like even more destroyed. But that was the first time when I heard the music outside of the studio. I listened to it one time in a laptop. And I realized this is not good. Like that's a product that I cannot stand. And when I go back after like this, I have, I don't know, something like four or five days. I was like, whoa. Okay, went back first two days. I was just like staring at the wall. getting my brain cells, I don't know, start to breathe again. And then I go into a process of like, like three minutes, oh sorry, three days, but now I know what I want, because going out, I realized the pictures, and now I know what I need, and how it's supposed to sound, and that was easier, because before, I was just trying to explore, what will be the story, now I knew already, what is the story. And then it was, I don't know, it was hard, but that was the fun part because now I knew already, okay, I have some structure. I just can just like be kind of like creative. And also when you have a time limit like that, I already as an artistic, either decision, but also like time decision means. I'm not going into details. Sometimes the bass won't be strong enough. Sometimes there will be some mistakes. But I'm trying to tell a story that is like an album that is made in a month. This is like the album. It means that you're not going to have moments, like reverbs that put this synthesizer in the back. and this clap in the left it's just gonna be very raw just the emotions and with some something going on so like I mean fuck the production. This is like, usually I do stuff, you know, I'm working with this, I'm working with this producer, but here it's not about the production, it's just about the story. And I started, and, you know, I had some friends, because I was like very, I mean, very like, you know, also there all the time by myself in the base, I mean, in the garage. which is also pretty cool because at the beginning I was supposed to be in this really good studio, but because of the time I just set up everything in my garage in LA. I was living in LA this time. So I would just go to the garage and open the garage door. So I just have an open space and you have the laundry there, bicycle, the car. So it was very... You know, like, you know, these bands that's playing in the garage. And also the vibe was very raw. So I'm just like jamming with myself. So it's kind of like a one-man band. But I have some friends on Skype and friends coming to visit. And I just finished. I just started one part. And then I had the flow that I was expecting to have in the beginning, but, you know, I didn't. But then I just, like, in three days, I did, like, 40 minutes. And if I had more days, I would just, like, continue and continue. I could just, you know, because then when you're in it... But was it still four files when you... What? Was it still four files when you... So the 40 minutes was, like, one file. That is usually what So one file was already like, you know, because then it was very easy. I was coming from here to there and everything. You know, I always say it. When you work for a long time and also you're very, very tired and maybe not sleeping for a few days. So everything in you is tired. So it means also your senses are tired. Also, your fears are tired, your personality is tired. Basically, everything is tired. So in a way, you're much more clear than when you're just awake. Because when you're awake, your personality takes over. But when you're just very clear, so maybe your body is tired, but your conscience sees everything in a much clearer way. And then you just manage somehow. Stay awake. Then it's like very easy. I mean, what you achieve after maybe the third day of no sleep, not third day, but let's say the second day of no sleep. In three hours, it's like it takes you maybe a week or two when you... And then it was just like very easy. This is what Apex Twin always said that he did. He would stay up for days. Who did it? Apex Twin. But of course, hard to believe him, his interviews. No, but it just, you know, I think also, you know, I mean, these interviews, this is also an interview, but also on the road, like Jack Kerouac, he says that he wore it like in three weeks of no sleep. But I think sometimes bursts. of creativity. For me, the way I do it, I mean, I try not to think. I just work and work and work and work and I kind of like exhaust myself, which is also exhausting. But I'm looking for the point. At least, I know, at least I'm trying. Maybe other people doesn't feel it like that. But it has to be amazing. And sometimes it's already good. Good, good, good, good. Okay, I'm destroying it, starting again. Good, good, good. But there is one moment when I'm just on myself and I'm coming. Like, wow, okay, now, but I don't know. It's still just good. It's just good. And I just keep on. The way you describe your creative process, I mean, it seems like it's very similar. You had to go to a psychic. You were desperate, you know, and you just had to let things go. You had to get in a situation where you had this terrible deadline from fabric. You just had to do it. Are you trying, do you have to get into these situations to be creative? At your best creative. I mean, creative, it's very easy for me to get creative. But in order to finish things, I need to have this, I don't know, this despair or like something that kind of like... go back to, I mean, it has to be challenged, like a game or something, okay, I have to finish it, and let's see, you know what, are you going to finish it or not, because if I don't have this feeling, I can just like jam with the music forever, and... I need to kind of convince myself that, hey, you need to, I mean, you, I mean, me, I know what I'm doing, but it's, hey, other people should hear it as well or should judge it as well or should, you know, what are you going to do about it? Okay, you have this deadline. You have this situation. But of course, when you have some kind, I don't know, emotional, either stress or just stress or whatever. I mean, I did some big tracks when I was feeling happy. I did some big tracks. But when I was feeling, I don't know, a bit sad or moody, it was very easy for me. It's very, I mean, it's easier to go to the studio when you're feeling this, when you're feeling like this. Because when you're feeling pretty good... I mean, why should I go down to the basement? I can go to the pool. I can go with my friend. I should just go like this. But when you have this thing, when you kind of like, it was perfect for me to hide from the world and just be there all by myself. And I like these situations. You know, it's kind of like, it's like some people... I mean, for me, when you're down, in a way, you feel yourself more. I mean, if you're happy, you don't feel it physically. But if you're kind of sad, sometimes you just feel it. You feel your inner, you feel yourself. And also the reason I chose music as my main thing, because I was trying a few things. I was playing soccer, I was in this art school. And I remember when you, because I was doing some graphic design and some photography, and I remember this moment because I was looking at this picture. and I don't know the most beautiful painting I mean the beautiful picture I'm not talking about a movie because it's moving and you have like more more things but if you just the most beautiful picture when you look at it biggest, I don't know, feeling or expression you can say, you can say, hey, it's beautiful. Hey, it's beautiful. But when you make music, it just touches you physically everywhere. It touches your head, it touches your stomach, it touches your heart, it can move your feet, it can give you goosebumps. So it's like really... surrounds you and if you like a message you can just like touch people physically and I think for whatever you do if you want to be good you have to be a freak I mean you have to fucking do it for a long time and sacrifice and just be into it What have you sacrificed for music? What have I sacrificed? My friends are going out. I stay in the studio. My girlfriend is in bed. I love these beds. Go sleep with her. I stay in the studio. let's say DJ in a way, you know, you have some bumps, you can go to play. Before the gig, I'm a little bit nervous. You know, I can actually be just a DJ right now and it would be easier. But I have to think, okay, but how do I do this thing and how can I do this track and actually this club is a bit small and my set is from a big place or vice versa. And I think also I sacrifice my peace of mind also in general. Because sometimes it's funny, you know, it's funny because I used to smoke. I used to smoke weed, but it would get me extremely paranoid. And at one point I stopped. I just stopped smoking. But for my first album, when I was supposed to finish it, I remember I got some music, but I was also, I didn't have so much time, but I was lacking the craziness. I felt that, you know, if I want to go deep, I can't. You know, I was also kind of like exhausted. And I remember... I'm going to start smoking again. And I know, and all my friends know what it does to me. But I have to finish the album and I think I'm missing some magical moments. So I'm going down. And you all know, I'm going to be back. And I was like, I was smoking. I went crazy again. I was pretty fucking crazy. But I finished the album, also this other album. And I remember it was like, yeah, I sacrificed my sanity. at that point. I was like, if I want to finish it, I have to go back. Now, this album, I did it pretty sober. But I had a lot of emotions. I didn't need this extra thing. But I did it pretty sober. Tell me about 11-11. I've heard this name a lot, but I don't think I've ever heard the music somehow. This first... What is it? First, if you ask me before if I could, that's for me the best because for me, I would love to, if we started the conversation, to come up with a name and there is no music and just like to talk about it, that would be amazing for me. Because also, you know, I'm very, in one way, if you see, I put a lot of time on stuff, but at the same time, I like when I... pretend that I'm putting it just like to you know to play with people's mind but at the same time I am this person that's working a lot 11.11 is yeah me and Puff Daddy that called me one day and he sampled one of my tracks for his album and he said yeah I like your music Love you. Come to New York. Let's make some music together. And, you know, this is like moments in your life. Now looking back, I still don't know if it was the right thing to do or not. But some people would say, yeah, he's like this, he's like that, he's like this, he's like that. For me, anyway, I was in New York. I didn't like to go directly for that. I said, you know, I'm going to try. Let's see what's going to happen. Went to the studio, you know, I just kind of said, "Okay, come to my studio." So I come to the studio, you know, SSL studio that used to belong to Whitney Houston. All the plugins that I had, you know, like Wheel Outboard, this amazing studio, Biggie was working there, Michael Jackson was working there. Everybody, you know, from, it was around this time when it was the... get in he wasn't there and they got me into this room i had like npc synthesizer what do you want to use and so i said yeah i would like this this this this and this and this anyway it's in the room so they built me like this huge wall of synthesizers in the room but to do what what i'm supposed to do like basically what it was like kind of like very kafka situation. I'm kind of like in a place where they have all the things but I don't know what I'm supposed to do and them also don't know what I'm supposed to do. So why am I here? So, you know, I'm just going to jam. I'm going to do some stuff. And I started playing with the staff but I still didn't know what I'm supposed to do. Like, I don't know, what do you want? A hip-hop track? A dance track? what does he want and then he called he called the studio and finally finally he called the studio and he told him give yeah let him listen to the cd that he's been giving to all the producers that are working on his album on his pop album last train to paris so that's the inspiration for the album. So, you know, okay, okay, so I have some reference. They put a CD and it's the intro track of my album from 2007. So basically that's the inspiration for the gift to all the producers, you know, some of them are pretty, pretty cool, you know, had some actually nice producers working on it. So that's the inspiration. And I was like, yeah, I know this track. It's actually, I can do this. And you know, I'm surrounded by this black guy with hoodies. And they're all like, this is the shit. This is the shit. And I'm like, I remember how it was made in my shitty apartment in Tel Aviv. And they're all like, so now I'm starting working and I have all these people. time comes like somebody from another room to see what I'm doing as if I'm just like big producers but you know I'm working you know how I'm working I'm just like not thinking and they're all staring at me so you know it was pretty pretty interesting the next day I felt that the atmosphere in the studio is a little bit weird. So anyway, nothing is scheduled, so I should just work at home, work on a loop. And at one point, I come to the studio, so they ask me, what time are you coming? So I said, yeah, I'll be there at four. So at four, are you coming? I'm just chilling here with my friends. I'm in New York. I haven't been here, so I'll be at 4.30. 5, 5.30, 6.30, 8.15, are you coming? Because Puffy's about to leave. I'm like, fuck, he's there? You didn't tell me that he's there. I'm like, fuck, he's actually waiting for me all this time. So I'm like, going on a taxi. I'm reviving, pretty hectic with my hair, really going to the studio, like that. And I mean, this part is pretty, it's hilarious, this part. I think this is like, for me, that's the best moment of the whole project. I'm coming in and he see me, you know, he hugs me but he's on the phone with the network and all these things because he has like this reality show on him so everything is filmed so you know he has these cameras. And I'm not even from Tel Aviv. I'm from the city near Tel Aviv. So now I'm in the studio with these cameras and they're all kind of like filming me. So I'm going to the artist's studio and I'm telling him, okay, I'm going to play you what I did yesterday. So, you know, and this is... very very me unfortunately so i'm going opening the computer i'm connecting it file open what i just work in the house because i was working until then in the house file open file is corrupted file is corrupted so i'm like okay still a lot of there is a lot of in that in that situation and still my hair is like going in all the directions So I'm coming back to him and I'm like tapping on his shoulder and I'm like... the file, the file is corrupted. He's like, what, what, what happened? I heard it was really good. The guys told me it was really good. Fix it, fix it. I told him, yeah, I'm going to go. Give me like 20 minutes and I'm going to fix everything. I'm going to fix everything because I remember how I did it and everything is mostly recorded like in audio so I can just like rebuild it. So I'm going, I'm rebuilding it, listening to the, I had a render of what I did last night. I'm fixing it. And just before it gets into the room, I think that's the best part of the project. of what's happening right now. You know, Ableton, I'm working with Ableton, and Ableton does beatmap to everything. So if you put a beat, it beatmaps. But I took one of his vocals and I threw it in, but because the vocal doesn't have a beat and it's kind of like very abstract, so I just put it randomly on the track. So I just put it in, I didn't touch it, it just beat my pitch randomly. And I just changed the pitch so it would fit what I was doing. So I was just changing the pitch, he's getting into the room, and he's like... Let me listen. What is that? He's turning off the volume. Sorry, turning up the volume. And then he's like, I can't believe it. You're a genius. I can't fucking believe it. A genius. He's going out of the room. He's coming back with two singers. And I'm like, listen to this. This is how the song should have been. And they're all freaking out. And me, I'm like, of course. I mean, that's why you called me here. And since this moment, he thought that I'm like this. Later, you know, that's why I said, you don't do anything. People think that you are, but... You have to be consistent. You know, you have to be consistent. You know, you have to be consistent. Consistently a genius. Consistently doing some stuff that you don't really mean and you didn't really plan, but it somehow works like that. But for me, it was like so funny because then, you know, and for me... Unfortunately, I always have this... It's not that good, but for me, especially when I'm by myself, I need to have this sense of humor that it's more... the rebel that I'm now in the heart of this like big machine, but I'm doing this bullshit and they all think I enjoy it more than if I was like working for a long time, come up with this thing and they think, oh, it's great. I didn't do anything and they think that it's great. At least I can laugh. So, you know, at least I can, you know, I have some, you know, I can have like a joke to tell my friends. And then I started to do, a lot of people will choose to take his voice, do a house track, get some money, or get some, like, you know, I don't know, go in the career in some direction. But I felt, anyway, I don't want my career to go in that direction, to do remixes to, I don't know, to commercial artists. I would like to do what I do, but I appreciate that he likes my music. The stamps are really amazing. He gave me really amazing stamps. So let's do something that is more interesting, that if in the end nothing will come out of it, I can still use it for myself, or at least get my production skills better. I'm still working here in the studio. And this moment, they didn't promise me anything. So I started to do this experimental stuff. Not like really experimental, but like still something that he can understand. But it's not the common thing. You know, it's not just like a house track with his voice. That would sound a little bit corny, you know, just to have him singing on a floor to the floor. And... He loved what I was doing. He loved this direction. And he told me, I remember he told me, the radio I have already. I want you to do something for me that should be heard in rooms that I'm not supposed to be in. So let's do something. And the first thing was... Why don't you just remix my old album and do like a more ketamine version of my album? I can, yeah. He didn't know what ketamine was, neither do I. But just like, let's say, let's do this version of the album. And so I reconstruct. You know, some of the lyrics were pretty awkward. So I have to take like, let's say, from the whole track, I would just like take my heart, my heart. I'm scared from another song. And then it's like, actually, my heart, I'm scared. It's fine. Rather than like, my heart belongs to this girl. And like, so I put a lot of work. reconstructing the stuff and after a while we listened to it and it was like a whole new album so he said you know just like do a whole project together just me and you and I'm gonna support this But, you know, I'll be honest, that was some time ago. That was some time ago. And at one point, I mean, and then, you know, I had like the time of my life. You know, I rented a studio in Tel Aviv. I bought some equipment just to enjoy working on it. He didn't pay me at this point. Nothing was like, you know, I was just like, I'm just enjoying making music right now. My career is already in a point where a lot of people You know, I was like enjoying as if I just started making music. And that was for me the biggest gift I could get from this project. This, you know, just like really enjoying making music. But he himself didn't know what we were supposed to do. I didn't know. So I was just like experimenting. But at one point, I kind of understood. But then reached the point when, okay, when it's supposed to be finished. And then he said, but I want some normal club track. Like something, give me at least one. Give me a radio single. A radio, but not a radio single, a club single. that people that I don't like should be playing. And this point, you know, maybe I regret it one day and people can think about me, many things, you know, because people, you know, in general, there is some, you know, some thoughts about me. said you know what i don't do it i mean all the project i did everything i'm not going to destroy it with divan track i'm not going to do i can't do it i just can't do it and it said that's what we have and if not I mean nothing will happen it will be very disappointing but I'm not I tried I tried to do something that stay with everything I did before but I'm not going to destroy it with one bad track I'm not going to do it So what's the status of all this? The status of all of this, I would just say that at the moment, he agreed to do what we had before, but how are we going to market it? Because an artist in his scale, commercial success, it's not going to have. doesn't appeal to his peer group I mean they're all jealous you know people like even like I don't know Jay-Z a lot of people heard it and like the music and but how do you present it especially from him. And at this point also, we didn't have the name. So then we came up with the name that the name came after, which is 11-11. You know, it's like two words collide and opens the door to another dimension on this date. Then we had like a more clear marketing idea how it's going to be. And now we're just waiting. So there needs to be 1212 now. Yes, but it's the month. It's the month. But I was thinking. 11-11 by the way for me um i mean it was such an important i was supposed to get married on 11 11 11 i was supposed to release the track the first single and i had a show also in mexico and then everything was kind of like supposed to be connected show The promoter ran away without the money. I didn't release this track because we didn't have a proof yet from his publisher. And I didn't get married. All these things were pretty intense, but everything is for the best. Because I would think of some stuff, if it would have been done on this day, I would be in a much harder situation right now. So... It was very frustrating. But I read this sentence. Life is not about waiting for the storm to end. It's just like learning to walk through the rain. like with the rain or something like that. And that moment, for sure, it was raining pretty hard, it was pouring, and yeah, it just continued. And that point which leads us to... fabric I was still pretty much involved with this project but then I changed management which also I didn't you know I didn't talk so much about this but all these things and all these matters going in my head and you know this also the business sides big part of it is also management I changed many managements because I wasn't so sure which direction I want to go and it confused me and this album confused me and 2011 in general was pretty hard for me because what I do is I make music but in 2011 I was like trying to figure out some things and at one point you know came a new management and we decided also like I told him I'm quitting this project I'm quitting even though I fucking work hard on it I'm quitting I'm gonna do some Guy Gerber stuff and you know, I'm just quitting it and at one point after I Had such a hard time in 2011. I mean I was I'm always creative, but I couldn't finish anything I just couldn't finish to a point when I was like almost like impotent. I just was like very can't finish And when I put this aside, you know, I finish, you know, one month and album. I finish a release for Vision Quest. I finish a release for Supplement Facts that will be released in July. I finished two remixes and I started already my next album and all this like, I don't know, in three months. And like 2011, I did like maybe two remixes and like in three months I achieved something. It would take me two years. So there was a lot of, you know, a lot of things, you know, came out. So 2012 is the year of Guy. I mean, I think, I think that's a year. I mean, I would see this as a year when I'm back to be myself. I've been through a lot of stuff that's happened to me in the past two years. them looked pretty good but I didn't feel comfortable inside and because you know I would say I have all these storms and I was more calm I was much more calm So it was good, but I felt that I'm not myself. So it was like, and then I would ask myself all the time, what's better? I mean, to be more like, I would say, society would see as a good thing, but to... When I see a picture of mine, you know, people take a picture, I see something, there is like no spark in my eyes. So I'm like calmer, and I like it, I'm chilled. Of course, you know, chilled for me, it's like not chilled for other people, but not myself. And I think, yeah, this past six months, You know, I'm being myself. Your eyes look a bit more wild. More wild. More wild. Yeah, and you know, I'm here to make music. You know, I'm here to make music. Yeah, I'm just making music. And I just love it. I'm still, you know, I'm like... Still didn't lose the passion. I still didn't lose the passion. I'm still always trying to do something new. And still really enjoying it. And still trying to get better. And like... Not... I do think about the business, I do think about my career, I think about money, I think about all these things, but still music is the first thing for me. Everybody knows it, that's what I do. So yeah, I think this year I'm very... proud. It's not with the music that I do that I actually finish it and I can share it with the people. That it's like, reached a point when actually, because I do it all the time, but I'm just keeping it with me. So, you know, I give it to everybody, so it's nice. you
