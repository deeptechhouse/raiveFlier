Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Benji Lehman and I am a freelancer at Resident Advisor. Neville Watson has grown up with house music. As a teenager living in Buckinghamshire, UK, during the 80s, he witnessed the Summer of Love. He owned a record shop in the wake of the acid house boom where he imported early relief and casual releases and Throughout the 90s. He released music on the shop's eponymous label mighty atom by 2006 both label and shop were gone but a chance meeting over the internet with Bulgarian producer kink saw his profile suddenly rise The rest as they say is history With solo albums from himself and from his partnership with Kink planned to drop this year, the future looks brighter than ever for the former actor and removals man. You witnessed the whole evolution of Acid House in the 80s, but you grew up in the 70s, so what was growing up like for you? Well, growing up in the 70s and 80s, I was born in 69 in Buckinghamshire, so I grew up in a town called High Wycombe. just halfway between London and Oxford. And music was a big part of my life ever since I can remember. I can't remember a time when there wasn't music. You know, you often hear people say they get to a certain age and then they discovered music, but it was kind of always around. You know, my dad played the clarinet and my mum sang. family get-togethers involved music so music was always very very very much a part of that family of our family and family life So I can remember getting into kind of rock and roll, becoming obsessed by it. You know, people like Eddie Cochran and Chuck Berry and Little Richard at six, seven years of age after seeing some program on the television. I would, I was obsessed with it. And, you know, I wanted to be a little teddy boy. So I wanted to kind of like put cream on my hair and stuff like that at seven, eight years of age. And my mum and dad, bless them, would, they indulged this sort of behaviour to a certain extent. And I was allowed to do it. Once a week at school, I was allowed to go to school with a braille cream on my hair until after a couple of weeks, a load of kids in my class copied me, a load of boys in my class copied me, and they went into the toilets and put soap in their hair, and they didn't quite get the quiff right, and they looked stupid, and I got sent home from school. After that, I was, you know, my mum and dad were, you know, they weren't keen for me to stop doing it. They took it as a sign of individuality, basically, and thought it was ridiculous that the teachers had sent me home from school. I got quite into music and the look that goes with music and things like that quite early on in life. And that was a big thing in the 70s and 80s. That was the music and that was the style that went with it. Like all youth cultures, basically, they have their style that goes with them. So growing up for me was all about music, really, even more so than, you know, I didn't have any, it's not like when you're a teenager. and your friends and you are all into the same sorts of music and then you grow up as an adult and then you all share this same sort of music. You know, at seven years of age, my friends were playing with Tonka toys and toy cars and... and I was doing that as well I was really into music and my dad would take me once a week to this pub called the Nag's Head it's quite a famous pub in Highrocom actually the Sex Pistols played there and it's on the main A14 on the main drag and they would have a thing there once a week called the Rocking Loft and they would have rock and roll bands playing there and He would take me there once a week. And I mean, I don't know, they'd let me into this pub. It was a big deal in those days. You know, kids weren't allowed in pubs and they'd let me into this upstairs room in this pub and I'd watch all these kind of people jiving and jumping around. And I mean, they were seen as dinosaurs at that point as well because, you know, punk had come along basically. you know, rock and roll was to be just, you know, ridiculed, basically. But I loved the music because it made me want to dance, really. It wasn't about, as I got older and you get into being a train spotter and cataloguing music. Just at that age, it affected me in a very... visceral way but it just made me want to dance so I've always found that the music that I tend to gravitate toward most will be dance music so and I think that that's where I can see that starting basically at a young age So that was kind of 70s and towards the end of the 70s, the whole two-tone explosion happened and the skinhead thing became quite big and I got very into that and stayed very into that through right up until I got into house music, basically. And, you know, that came along, you know. the acid house culture came along and just blew that out of the water for me but all through the 80s I was just then started getting more into starting off being in to madness and the specials and things like that as a little kid and then you then wanting to find out where that came from like pretty much what people are doing now with house music really you know getting into maybe some form of house music and then going back and finding out there's been the big revival with Chicago and all those kind of things because younger people want to find out where that's coming from and it was similar for me you know when I was a teenager looking to see where this where Scar and Reggae had come from and going back and then buying records 7 inch singles spending my weekends going to record fairs and buying these 7 inch singles for £10 £15 which in the 80s seemed like a lot of money but now a lot of these records are worth like £150 £200 just for a 7 inch single in quite bad condition as well so And most of my time, a friend of mine and myself, we would just go to record fairs, go to Camden Market. And my dad had a stall on Camden Market selling belts. So I'd go down and work with him at the weekends and just trawl the markets for reggae, basically. So that was a big, big part of my life for a long, long time. And that's how I started DJing. I started playing reggae. initially for a friend of mine that had a band, had a ska band. And me and my mate called ourselves Cleanhead Sound System. And we would, and we didn't have a sound system. We just, you know, two crappy, you know, decks and, you know, very speed turntables and a plastic thing with a, you know, lid on it. And we'd hire it out and we'd take it with us and we'd plug it into the sound system. we would warm up for the band and then play afterwards as well. So that was my introduction to DJing, which obviously didn't involve beat matching. But luckily enough, it also didn't involve talking on the microphone, which is what people used to do then. So when did you first get an inkling the house was going to happen in the UK? Well, he started making an appearance kind of mid-80s. But for me, because I was... you know, just heavily into reggae and other sorts of music and punk and stuff like that. It, it, it, it bled through from that, from the boogie kind of thing, you know, and there wasn't much, you can listen back to that now. And there's, there's a, there's that period where it kind of, it, it crosses over that kind of thing. So. it started filtering through in the latter half of the 80s over here, particularly down in London. Yeah, and I saw that people were getting into that kind of music, going to those sorts of clubs. But for myself... we weren't we weren't allowed and you know nightclub that music nightclub music meant nightclubs nightclubs meant soul boys soul boys meant there was going to be trouble because you know when you were when you were dressed in stay press and brogues and you had a short haircut you were a target basically you know people want to have a pop at you so you were a target so you kind of stayed Like I was saying, you stayed within your own groups, really, and you'd know other people and your mates in the town that embraced different styles, and you weren't sworn enemies with them. But if you went to other towns and stuff like that, you went to gigs that were the sort of things that you went to. And that was the same for everybody. That was the same for the Soul Boys. They wouldn't come down and come to a reggae gig because they knew that they would be a target there. Even if you weren't, not for me, I wasn't into that kind of thing, but that was England in the 70s and 80s. Even if you weren't a violent person, you would witness it. You'd witness it on your way back from Nepal, but on the way to the taxi, waiting for a taxi in a taxi rank, that was what people did. They went out, they got out of their mind on alcohol. and it was like an episode of Booze Britain. It was just like a computer game, just dodging the fights that were going on along the high street. I think particularly in provincial towns as well. Definitely. So... house music basically started filtering through then. And I had a girlfriend who was going to quite rubbish clubs, actually like the kind of Cinderella Rockefeller places, but they were obviously playing. She was obviously hearing house music there. So she started buying it and I started hearing it there. A lot of the kind of more vocal stuff I wasn't so into. Um, But the Acid house that she started buying, so this would have been 88, and she started buying that. I quite liked that. And my brother was into it as well. He was living up in London. He was a photographer for Limelight Club. And he was exposed to those sorts of things. He then, through people he knew there, would start going to things at Heaven in midweek. So he would be telling us about it. So it started filtering through. It was a gradual thing, really. Until I actually went to a party and experienced it myself. Then it didn't feel gradual at all. Then it felt like a bomb going off in my head. But yeah, probably mid-80s, something like that, I was aware of it really. And so when did you have your first experience of Acid House? In a club environment, well, or in a field environment, out in the environment. was it actually wasn't too far away from my house. I split up with this girl and I was, you know, I was nursing a broken heart and my friend said to me, you know, come to this party. And I've been very resistant to it up until that point because of the things I was saying to you about because it represented nightclubs. But they looked like they were having a pretty good time, actually. And I was pretty jealous, if I was honest. I was just being staunch about it. I'm not going to that sort of thing. That's rubbish. And they looked like they were having a good time. So we got these tickets for... a sunrise party. It was a big do out in a place called Longwick. And it made it into all the papers and all that kind of thing, you know, because by this point it started making it onto the front page of the Sun. So anything that you thought might be, you know, might upset the older generation, you were up for doing. So we got some tickets to this party and I went. And, yeah, it changed my life overnight. Literally in an instant, basically. I went and I just saw that for what it would be. be and i just thought this amount of people here surely there's going to be trouble and i remember a friend of mine going to me just relax it's not going to be any trouble so i went along i did what you know everybody else was doing when you go to those parties and you partake of the things that are going on there and that was it it just changed my life like that i just thought that's it i'm growing my hair so i then became a hippie basically more or less uh I grew my hair down to my shoulders and spent the next four years basically just going to as many parties as I could do. So what kind of music were they playing at that time? What were the tracks? Where were they coming from? That would have been... So you were talking kind of US house. You know, hip house basically was quite big then. So you're talking people like Fast Eddie. you'd still be hearing acid tracks you'd be talking to people like Fast Eddie you'd be talking about Doug Lazy, Let It Roll things like that these were the big tracks there was also a lot of things coming out of Italy and coming from Europe and the UK thing had started to hit pretty big then LFO, Nightmares on Wax, you know, the early Warp tracks, those bleep things that started coming in towards the end of 89. So it wasn't, by the time I started going to parties, it wasn't being, it wasn't purely dominated by the US. Although, you know, 50% of it. would be American music and then the other 50% would be made up of European and British stuff. And you yourself, you've obviously been DJing reggae that you'd been buying in the 80s. Did you carry on DJing all the way through Acid House? No, no. Once I got into going to parties, I just gave up everything. People were giving up. they were like they were shedding their former lives not just myself everybody was doing that you know people people that I'd gone to school with who had left school and were very serious and you know kind of like had kids at 19 a lot of these people and then set up their own plumbing business and things like that they were just they were just letting it all go don't we And these were people that, you know, I remember reading in a magazine article years ago, in a face magazine, you know, ecstasy was a drug. for people who didn't take drugs. So all these super straight people all of a sudden were just leaving their jobs and leaving their relationships and just, you know, just casting everything aside. And that was pretty much the same for me. I just, you know, from being staunchly into what I was into, it just, it wasn't like I gave it up flippantly. It was like it was washed away from you. I mean, it almost sounds like kind of... religious but it did feel like that to a certain extent it felt quite religious uh you know it it felt like you were letting go of things so i let go of that and that included the djing as well so i didn't play out for about four years and I you know but I was buying still buying music I was still buying music still buying records so I started buying the music that I was hearing at these parties and I'd started to get quite a big collection until the point that I thought well maybe I should just get some turntables and and start and start playing start learning how to mix basically So you've been buying a lot of this music. Where have you been buying it from? You know, I've come up to London. I'd buy stuff when I was up here and then a guy I knew who was a local DJ, the parties in and around High Wycombe, the warehouse parties there and the outside parties, he opened up a record shop. So we'd shop there and I eventually ended up opening a shop myself in Windsor in Berkshire in 94, just after I started DJing. so there's probably a pretty good way to get hold of records more easily is to open your own shop so yeah but I would come up to London and buy stuff and what were the record shops in London that you were visiting? Well, Black Market, for a start, you know, that's been there since whenever I can remember. There's a place on, is it Big Street? Is it Red Records? It used to be, no, it's not Red Records. Or maybe it was Red Records and then it was called something else. Unity. Unity. There was a discussion about that on Facebook the other day. All these record shops seem to have massively high counters, so you always felt like you always were made to feel like you were basically a very tiny little piece of vermin who'd come into this shop undead to ask them for a record. Always high counters. and it's always ended up being looked down upon. And when I opened my own shop, when we opened our own shop, we decided that wasn't going to be the case. Our account was at floor level. So you would come up and you'd go in there and you'd have your list that you maybe got off. the radio or the pirates or you know you buy a magazine and see if you can find it there or your mate would have something on a tape and you would say do you know what this track is they would tell you what the track was so yeah you'd picked up information from your friends basically and off of the radio you know you didn't there was no internet then to just go on to and and and and go id please on a SoundCloud mix. So at that stage, and this was all happening, all the parties at this stage were happening in warehouses, were they? Or was it slowly changing and evolving into a club scene? Yeah, by that point, by the end of 89, they had brought in what would then become the criminal justice bill. which was, was it the Criminal Justice Act at first, and then they turned it into the Criminal Justice Bill, but this MP, Graham Bright, or whatever his name was, he was the guy responsible for bringing it in, and... once people saw that they were probably going to start, you know, parties started getting busted, people started moving it back inside. And I think whereas clubs, established clubs, not established clubs like Heaven that had always put on parties like that, because there was still Heaven Rage and things like that were always going on. places in London but other nightclubs saw that they weren't going to be able to last this out you know they had to start bringing these people in and maybe then just start charging loads of money for water so it started moving back into the clubs once organisers thought they were going to properly get busted So that was a bit of a shame because it felt like such a free thing to be outside doing it in these places. And obviously it's come around again now. These things have happened over the last few years. People are doing illegal parties again. It made it a bit more exciting. But once it started moving back into the clubs, first of all, it felt a little bit like it was all over, really. The guys who organised the parties where I lived, they obviously couldn't keep taking these hits, really. They couldn't keep taking, having their gear impounded, having the records taken from the DJs. They couldn't keep doing that. So they opened their own, they bought a unit and they opened their own club just outside the town centre. And it was a good club, but at first it felt a bit like, oh, no, what a shame, you know. A lot of people were disappointed in that, but that was just the way that it had to go. And all this time, I mean, you must have been like making ends meet somehow. So what were you doing during the week? Well, I'd left school to be an actor. And I was, for the first few years after leaving school, I was working pretty steadily. You know, I would average maybe kind of two or three commercials. a year and a couple of other small parts in in other tv dramas things like that nothing massive a couple of you know a children's film foundation film when i was 16 and and the and but the commercials then you didn't get bought out you'd get repeat fees so When all my friends were on YTS training schemes and getting paid £25 a week, I was laying on my backside on the sofa at home getting repeat fees coming through the door. Living at home, not having to... So I'd save quite a bit of money. So that kept me going for quite some time whilst I was partying, up until we opened the shop. So, yeah, that's what I was doing. I was acting, basically. In around 93, I realised that I was living at home and I wasn't really earning any money. And what money was coming in, I was spending on records. So I thought, well... maybe I should just open my own shop. So I got together with a couple of friends of mine, Lee and Sid, and we opened up a record shop in Windsor. So I suppose that was my first dealings with, although it wasn't the music industry as such, as far as record labels and the like were concerned, it was definitely, it was still... the business side of music so it would have been that yeah so that we we we started getting that together in 93 and the shop opened in 1994 and then closed in 96 so what kind of music were you selling from the from the start then because 94 there must have been a whole range of different styles around from jungle drum and bass house techno Yeah, I mean Jungle at the time was still at that kind of very, very early. It was still being called Jungle and it still had kind of, you know, it was still in that Toy Town phase because it started off a bit of a Toy Town kind of thing, didn't it? so we didn't really stock that and you know the Jungle Raves had a bit of a bad reputation as well so we weren't really into that kind of music we were mainly stocking house a lot of UK house labels like Cleveland City and things like that were quite big at that time And the whole trance thing was quite big as well. So we were stocking quite a lot of that kind of thing. I'm not talking about, you know, sort of 145 BPM kind of thing. Progressive House and labels like Gorilla, they started becoming more spacey, more trancy. So Gorilla was a big label for us. and we were stocking a lot of kind of ambient and chill out what then became chill out music as well we were doing a lot of stuff from that and you know Warp again was another big label that we would do records off of and then towards the end of 94 that's when the whole relief thing kicked in so we were big on that but our customers weren't But we loved it, you know. But we were definitely trying to push a style of music, you know, Detroit techno, all that kind of thing, with the US side of things that we were doing. And we were definitely trying to push that sort of sound to people, but people weren't, I just don't think they were really ready for that in a kind of small provincial town, really. And it was a tough couple of years. It was a tough couple of years, but I did get quite a good record collection out of it. You know, because you'd order records in and, you know, you'd have your customers that would come in that we knew would buy certain things that would go for a certain... sound uh but they were few and far between and standing in a record shop six days a week can be you don't see many women basically so what kind of people were coming into a shop Well, like I said, you know, it's mainly blokes, really. I think we had one girl that used to come in there regularly and buy. She was a student at Royal Holloway College over in Egham. And she would come in. But we were very, obviously in Windsor, we were very close to Eton. So we would get... these kids coming in who you'd be looking at them and they were obviously they're probably politicians now because they definitely had the hair for it particularly the Tory politicians it's like what's going on with their hair there was plenty of that going on and they were they weren't the most they weren't particularly socially skilled these kids they'd come in and they'd just you know and then they'd get their coots checkbooks out and but they would never spend a lot of money but they were like you know buy two maybe once one we did start eventually we started doing drum and bass towards the sort of middle of 95 and a few of them were into drum and bass and a lot of them were into like acid techno have you heard any acid techno so they would come in and buy a bit of acid techno chris liberator stuff all that kind of thing So we would have those, we'd have general kind of like house heads and technobots that would come in. And there was one guy, because the shop was right opposite the offices of British Aerospace. And one day we were... where the music turned up quite loudly and it was like a Tuesday lunchtime and the door opened and this guy came in and he, I mean, he looked like he was an official from the council, basically. He didn't a nice suit on and, and, and, and, and, you know, in glasses and he looked, and he was in his kind of like late thirties, I suppose, maybe early forties. Um, And he came up to the counter and I thought, oh, right, okay, they're going to complain about the noise, aren't they? And he said, uh... Have you got any Lenny D? Or anything on industrial strength? And we just tried to not laugh at this guy. And he became a really regular customer. And he was just into the hardest techno that you could imagine. And he was in Gabba, basically. And lots of other sorts of things. We turned him on to Relief and stuff like that. And he would come in and buy. And he would always spend a lot of money. And he worked at British Aerospace. He was an accountant at British Aerospace. which I suppose is across the way from us. And David Slater, his name was, that's right. david slater and he would come in and spend loads of money he was great but he didn't you know he had decks he never wasn't interested never went to nightclubs he wasn't interested in going to them he's married he had a couple of kids and he would do a really lovely stereo at home and he would just go home and listen to gava on his headphones it was crazy so we did get quite some quite interesting customers coming in but we also sold a lot of you know dj mixtapes and stuff like kind of like Ravescape 94, sort of eight-pack. of tape things that we were selling at the time they were quite a big thing for us so yeah but the customers were were right across the board of the male spectrum and then when you shut the shop down um you started a record label yeah the shop was called mighty atom and then we just extended that into a record label it was something we'd wanted to start doing anyway by that point there was only two of us my friend Lee had left and he had a baby on the way and you know the shop wasn't doing well enough to pay three of us a wage so he kind of opted out basically and just you know needed to go and do other things so Sid and I started the label because basically I just thought I can't handle this the shop is going to close and we were a bit upset about it because we put a lot of hard work into it and I thought you know I need to I need to have something else that's going to continue on in some way or another so that had to be running the label. So we managed to get our first release pressed up and ready to go just before we closed the shop. So we were actually able to sell a few copies of the first release in the shop before it closed, which felt quite nice. But that basically then, you know. That was a continuation of it then. So you were making music as well at this time? No, the first release I didn't do, that was the guy Lee, who was the third partner in the shop. He'd started a label actually himself when the shop was going okay. He'd started a label and we basically just licensed, I think, the B-side of the first thing that he put out and got... I did a remix on that and Sid did another mix. And then we got Justin Drake from Peace Division and his partner at the time, Marvin, who's Dylan Rimes. They were doing a thing under the name Outsider, which is coming out on Junior Boy's own sub-label Just Tracks. It's got tough, sort of Chicago-influenced... tracks and we got them to do a remix and that was our first release but I'd started yeah that was my first foray into kind of production as I did a remix remix of that track so did you have a studio of your own at the time no no no i would that first remix a friend of mine who was a dj who lived in brighton he bought himself some equipment and he engineered that for us so i mean i basically just i sampled um mac one on and on although i didn't know it was mac one on and on at the time i sampled it off of a relief record Jellybean record and I just took some samples from the original track and then took some samples off this Relief record and just looped them up for Eight minutes. And I remember the guy, my friend who engineered it for me, he was a trance DJ down in Brighton and we didn't really kind of, we weren't into the same sorts of music, you know, but I remember when he finished, he finished engineering this thing for me, his flat, and he went into the other room and I could hear him go to his girlfriend. He says it's finished. because he just obviously thought it was just a loop that was going on for eight, which it practically pretty much was just a loop that went on for eight minutes, but I loved that at the time, that's what we were into, so it was just a DJ tool basically. You carried on releasing on Mighty Atom for quite a few years after that. Yeah, I think the last... release on Mighty Atom would have been 2003 or 2004 around about then so yeah 7 years 6-7 years something like that which of the releases stand out for you as being I suppose central to the sound that you were into Well, this is the thing, really. I mean, you know, we always struggled to a certain extent with the label, really making it kind of... It was always really popular with DJs. When we'd send out TPs or promos to DJs, they would love it. Or we'd have a release where the DJs didn't love it, but we sold quite a few. But we were always into lots of different... styles of house and techno so we wanted to do loads of different things but at the time you know we were being told by a distributor no you need to find a sound and stick to it whereas now you can spread out a bit more on a label labels put out lots of different styles of house you know you know some labels maybe even want to kind of do a dubstep tune and then they might do a Detroit influence track the next release you know then people were kind of definitely a bit more tunnel visioned than they are now so one that really stood out it was difficult for us to do that really so it was hard, I mean, and also now people, you know, you hear this, and this was in the mid-90s when everybody said it was boom time for music and people were selling loads, we weren't, we were struggling with it, you know, we were putting out what we thought was quality house music or quality dance music. And we were struggling to kind of make ends meet with it, really. But it was enjoyable and I loved doing it and I wouldn't have done it, I wouldn't do it any other way other than the way we did it. You know, when I hear people saying now, oh, you know, there isn't any money in it anymore, is there? Well, you know, I personally am doing better out of it than I ever have. So, you know, it's different for everybody, I suppose. And you were DJing as well. You said you'd amassed quite a serious record collection through the shop. particularly what um how did djing and bookings work back then because there was no internet no i mean unless you got you know there were a few big dj agencies around at the time you know and if you got if you got on an agency you just you know it was kind of you know it was a big result really but we didn't so you know we would we were putting on our own parties uh first of all next door and there was a bar next door to the shop so we did a couple of parties there so we would we were putting on some of our own parties and then we started doing a monthly thing uh in henley What was the name of that club? Was it Henry's? I think something like that. We started doing some bits and pieces there and booking some DJs and playing there. and that was it really you'd be playing at friends parties or things like that you'd have to send out tapes to people basically so you know people would get and I know when I was DJing for Checkpoint Charlie they would get Ian Undate with tapes and some people were sending great tapes fantastic, there were some great DJs out there with covering letters and things like that. And that was how people got work, basically. And, you know, if you were lucky, it would hit. But you had to be on it continually all the time, sending out tapes. So work was pretty sparse, basically. But the shop... led to Checkpoint Charlie in Reading, which I then eventually ended up becoming a resident at. So, you know, that was my regular gig, really. That was a monthly thing. So once I had that... And I was quite happy. And that brought in a few other gigs, a couple of international gigs. But I definitely wasn't as busy. I've been busier in the last two years than I have in nearly 20 years of DJing. And that at one point took you to... How about international bookings? Because at one point you played in New York as well. Yeah, there was a guy down in... Bournemouth he used to do a club called the Outer Limits Paul something his name was and he used to have people like Dave Angel and stuff come down and play for him he's a bit of a techno knight down there and through Checkpoint Charlie for some reason, I can't remember how it worked out, but the guy who used to run Checkpoint Charlie got in touch with him and he was, this guy from the Outer Limits in Bournemouth was putting on a party at Twilo in New York and I ended up going out and playing there, which was, you know, at the time, you know, I'd never been to the States before, so to go to New York and play at this kind of legendary club that had, being the sound factory you know was was quite an eye-opener you know I remember you know walking into the booth down in the main room and with a load of us went over as well so it was tied in that's how I remember because the guy ran checkpoint Charlie was doing some PR for music magazine and they were doing the whole bedroom bedlam thing so they were taking out a lot of bedroom bedroom DJs and Dave Mothersole from Music Magazine. So I was out there with Rick Hopkins and a few of the other bedroom bedroom guys and these guys from The Outer Limits. And, you know, we went into the main room. in twilight and i went into this booth and then you know four turntables all floated on springs massive big rotary mixer um you know it was a bit you know it was a bit daunting really and the engineer came up to me and just said oh it's a great booth isn't it and i said it's fantastic i've never seen anything like it and he went yeah yeah this that's junior's booth over there and he just pointed to the wall and there was a door in the wall with a bouncer standing by it, and then you could see raised up was the window, and that was his booth where he would play all Saturday night, basically, because he was still at Twilo then. It was before he left and Danny Tenaglia started doing it. So, you know, he had his whole, you know, I thought that was his DJ booth, but no, he had a whole kind of like little masonette tucked away. where he would do his 12-hour sessions. So, yeah, but the gigs, the strange thing with Checkpoint Charlie, you know, it was an amazing club to be part of, absolutely amazing, but it never really brought much work in. for anybody who was a resident there. You know, there were, over the period, you know, when it first started, there were three other residents there and then they stopped playing there. It was myself and a guy called Matt Carter. We then kept running it up until... I would say probably 2000, 2001, something like that. And it still goes on occasionally. I just don't have anything to do with it anymore. So can you kind of sum up? towards the end of the 90s and the beginning of the noughties can you kind of sum up what the state of British the British house and techno scene was well I think you know mid to late 90s was the whole speed garage thing that kicked off you know it wasn't the sort of thing that I was into. But that whole little scene was going on. You know, for me, things had come in waves all along anyway. There was like the first flush of it when you first start going to warehouse parties and it moved back into clubs. Then you had the whole kind of like orbital raves thing, like I was saying, 91, which then splintered off into Jungle and then it took a bit of a dip again. And then, you know, we opened the record shop and we were still into music. We were still DJing. but we thought you know the best times had kind of we'd experienced them you know sort of five years previously until we went over to checkpoint charlie just as punters because i invited us over there because he'd come over to put some flyers in the shop and just it was like walking it was like the first time I'd walked into a party. It was amazing. And that kept going. That vibe of Checkpoint is an insane vibe. It was in a West Indian social club down a little alleyway in Reading with a proper sound system in there that you used to put in every... Because it was on every fortnight then. They'd put that on every fortnight. proper sound system in there, cargo net across, you know, and when you were DJing there as well, you know, they'd have certain tunes and you'd call them net pullers because if you would know, I'm going to put this record on and they will go mental and start yanking, trying to pull the cargo net down. So that was another wave of it. And then the late 90s, early 2000s. was Wiggle really for me definitely we started going to Wiggle parties and again they were you know that that that's been forgotten about to a certain extent it's not really kind of talked about much now once Terry went off to kind of fabric and they still put Wiggle I think they've got one on on New Year's Eve actually because I think it got on fairly lumped in with that tech house thing which which you know They were saying, you know, the tech house that you get in the top ten of Beatport is not the music that Terry and Nathan were playing at Wiggle at all. You know, they would play pitched up US house dubs with Detroit Techno mixed into them, followed by, you know, a kind of vocal house track. followed by a Kevin Swanson track, followed by Chicago House, followed by Acid. You'd always be guaranteed to hear some 303 when you went to a wiggle party. And properly tight, brilliant DJs. the people that they had playing there. You've largely hidden, or at least not actively played up, your Mighty Atom productions. And I just wondered if there's a reason for that. Well, I think I pretty much felt like the shop had not been a great success. Then we struggled with the label and that was... It didn't reach the heights, the giddy heights that we thought it would do. And I stopped releasing music on Mighty Atom and didn't do anything for a couple of years. I was still producing. I was still writing music. I was still DJing occasionally at Checkpoint Charlie. Then that stopped and I didn't DJ out for a couple of years. And I just think when things started picking up for me, I just put that behind me really. It was a learning curve for me and I felt the music maybe possibly sounded a bit dated. So I was never ashamed of it. I think you've got to take heart in every little piece of music that you do, even if you maybe winced at it slightly, even if it's a learning curve. There are many people out there, I know people that are writing music that don't, oh, I'm not releasing it yet, no, no, no, it's not right yet, it's not right yet, it's not right yet, and they never end up doing anything with it. Sometimes you can't be too scared, you've just got to So I wasn't trying to actively hide it. I just had moved on and was doing new things. So would you ever consider re-releasing any of it? There's a few things that I've pulled out and started playing again. recently and kink is always telling me that i should be offering it to to to other labels to possibly put out so there are a few things there are a couple of things that maybe i would do and last year i got an email from Benji, I think it was Benji, at Permanent Vacation, and he sent me an email going, oh, I was playing somewhere last night in Germany somewhere, and the guy before me was playing all these records off of this label called Mighty Atom, and then I found out it was you. So maybe, I don't know, maybe. And even when the label... came to an end in 2005, you were still writing music because you've always written music since you first started. You've always continued doing that. Absolutely, yeah. The way I look at it is it's a compulsion and I think it's like that for some people. It's a compulsion. I can't not do it. it's got to that point where I don't think I could stop if I tried to. And that might change one day. It might change one day, but it's been a compulsion for a very long time. And that's just how it is for me. And I also think, you know, I often say to people that if I'm left to my own devices for longer than 30 seconds, I start thinking about music. It will just pop into my head and I'll start thinking about ideas for certain things. And yeah, so I continued. I continued to write. So how did you start releasing again? Well, as I said, I was always still producing, so I was writing music all the time. I was quite active on Myspace at the time. as well and I hooked up with kink and we started doing a little project together and then rush hour picked that up so that was the start of it but at the same time around about the same time I got back into contact with Andy Blake um who's now running world unknown but at the time was running dissident Now, I'd known him from the late 90s and early 2000s from going to Wiggle, him and his girlfriend Amy. And oddly enough, I had been doing a bit of a search for him. I thought I'd found a compilation that they'd done on kicking records. And I thought, I wonder what happened to Andy and Amy. And so I did a little search for him online. And, you know, I was buying Dissident Records at the time. and I didn't know it was him and I did a little search couldn't find them And then I put an Italo record and an old Chicago record that I had on eBay. And this guy bought it off me. And then it was near Christmas and he said to me, oh, you know, can I come meet you? I'm in London. Can I meet you and give you cash? And I said, look, mate, I'd rather it went into my PayPal account because, you know, I'm using the money for like Christmas presents. he said, okay, all right, I'll get it sorted for you tomorrow. So then I saw the name on the credit card and it was Amy's name. And I thought, it's Andy. So I sent him a message saying it's Neville one. He was looking for you, you know, and he said, I'm running dissident. And I said, I've been buying your releases. And I gave him a couple of tracks and he put them out straight away. So I started releasing for him. And then At around about the same time, the rush hour thing happened. So that was 2008. 2007, 2008, yeah. So, yeah, I mean, and that kicked it off, basically. It was that point then when things started to pick up. So the Rush Hour thing was, that was a track you released together with Kink. How did you and Kink meet? Well, I was playing for a guy that I'd hooked up with on Myspace in Rennes in France. And I was playing... a track that Straheel Kink had done for Chris Ducanfield's label Dory and the guy I was playing for took a photograph of me and that was on the deck when he took the photograph and Kink saw it sent me a message and said thanks for playing my track and I got chatting to him and I said do you want to do a track together you know I'd never worked remotely with somebody before so he's in Bulgaria I'm here in London So I sent him some parts. And he said, you know... I'm not a fast worker, but I'll come up with something. And, you know, we'll go from there. So a couple of months later, four or five months later, he sends me this track and says, oh, you know, I think it might get sued by Larry Hurd. And that was Inside Out. And he put it up on his player, on his MySpace player. And within 30 minutes, Rush Howard got in touch with him and gone, has anybody signed this record? We want to put it That was it, and that's what started it from there. We just started working on collaborations together. His career started picking up. And things started picking up for the both of us. And my career started picking up as well. You know, work started picking up for me. But, you know, we worked with each other for nearly four years before we even met in person. We'd never even spoken on the phone before. It was just all done via MySpace, then email, and then Skype. It got to the point where I could have easily phoned him via Skype and spoken to him, but I think we both thought, oh, no, that'll be a bit weird. You need to wait until you meet in person. And he was coming here to get some earplugs made, coming to London, and that was it. That was make or break, really. I remember saying to my girlfriend at the time, this is it, really. I'm going to go meet him. If we don't get on in person But luckily, we got on really well. I kind of knew we would, but we got on really well. And, you know, I just, without being too gushing about it, I feel very blessed to have met him, really, because, you know, when you travel with somebody as well, all of a sudden you're thrown together. And when you travel with them, that's a true test of whether you're going to get on with somebody or not. And we had had a few kind of... artistic disagreements on Skype before we'd even met in person and we managed to sort that out and I feel very lucky really we just you know we work quite well together and that recently led to the two of you producing a track for Kim Ann Foxman of Hercules and Love Affair how did that come about? Well, she did the vocals. She did the vocals for the latest thing that we did for Rush Hour, yeah. We just got in touch with her. We just sent her a message and said... I knew that she'd been playing a couple of our tracks, so we discussed it and said, do you think it's worth getting in touch with her? And we thought, you know, Strahill thought it was a good idea, so I sent her a message and she was up for doing it. A joy to work with, and not starry in any way at all, which it doesn't take much for people to start being a bit starry once they get a bit of success, and particularly singers. But she's not like that at all, and she's been really, really, really good fun to work with. So in between all of this, you've also released a book with your brother Gavin entitled Raving 89. Can you tell me something about that? Yeah, Gavin's a photographer. He'd released two books already. a collection of his photographs from when we were growing up as kids actually first one was called Skins second one was released by Vice called Skins and Punks now the first one was a bit of a cult classic and he always there's quite a few photographs of me in there so he would get interviewed a lot about it And people would want to speak to me. Who's the guy on the front cover? And he always wanted me to be involved. But I didn't really want to talk about it. It wasn't something I really wanted to talk about anymore. he was you know in a way I kind of never really asked to be have that thrust upon me really and it was something I wanted to put behind me I was you know something I did when I was a kid and I'm not a kid anymore you know I'm doing something else I don't really want to talk about the old days so but he was always trying to get me involved and I wasn't having any of it basically so when we discussed that maybe he could revisit his photographs that he'd taken at the early warehouse parties that we started going to. That was something I was a bit more interested in. Now, these photographs had been slung in a box somewhere because he basically didn't think they were any good because he'd only taken his camera there under duress because he could get in for free and he would get there, take a load of photographs. get off his head on a knee, take some photographs, and then take some photographs at the end. Put his camera away and then take some photographs at the end. So he didn't think the photographs were any good. But I got in touch with Bill and Frank at DJ History and just said, did they know anybody who might be interested in this sort of thing? And Bill said to me, they're thinking of starting up a publishing company themselves, so they'd be interested in seeing it themselves. So we went down to see them, showed them some of the pictures. and they wanted to go for it. It's my brother's book, really. My name's on it. I helped compile it. I can't take credit for any of this. the photographs that are in it so it's really it's it's really his book really I always I feel like a bit of a fraud saying you know I wrote the foreword for it but it's really his book but it was great fun working on it it was really really good fun working on it and that all happened around about the same time the rush hour thing had started kicking off the distant things were happening and the book started happening so it was a combination of things that meant things started picking up for me. Do you have it in mind to, having released a number of singles now, do you have it in mind to start working on an album? I think everybody who writes music wants to do an album. so Kink and I will be doing an album next year that we've started working on tracks for already and I've got a few things set aside for my own album as well so eventually and hopefully definitely mining Kink's next year and hopefully mine next year as well. I'll get both of them done as well. So how is it working remotely with somebody? Well, it's obviously very different from being in the same room as them. And when he has been visiting over here, it's much quicker, and it's a whole different kind of vibe than just... getting some files together and then sending them going backwards and forwards. We've now hit a rhythm where we both know how the other one works. So that's made it slightly easier. And we both had to learn Ableton for the live shows and also just so that we've got a common platform that we're working on because... For the first three years, he was using this software called Buzz, this PC software called Buzz. And I thought he was using Ableton. I didn't know. And I was using Logic on a Mac. And we were working on a remix. And I'd send him the parts, and I'd be thinking, I'd be waiting there for him to send me the adjustments to what he'd done. And I'd be thinking... what are you doing? Come on, get a move on. I'm sitting here. And then he said to me, I can't see the waveform. And I went, well, why not? I've sent it to you. He went, no, no, no, I can't see it. Buzz doesn't work like that. You've got to put numbers in. It's all hex code. It's like you trying to have a massive file in your 950 sampler. And I couldn't believe he hadn't told me this. So I was thinking, what are you doing getting a move on? And he was using a completely different platform to what I thought. that in its own way gave it its own sound the mixture of both of those kinds of things and hardware put into it as well so it's it's presented its challenges working remotely but ultimately it's been rewarding because it's just good to learn to just to stretch yourself in that way and learn to move around obstacles for anything, not just in music, in life in general. It's a good thing to have to do, to learn. And credit to him, I've got to say, obviously English is not his first language. And he's totally able to communicate, never has any problems really. We've never really kind of... We've never come to loggerheads as far as language is concerned. And it's really easy for me. I don't have to make any effort. I can type loads of humour into Skype or I can call him up. And, you know, like I said, we're lucky that we got on well together. But, you know, I've got to give credit to him. He's done a sterling job. Like I said, his English isn't his first language. You mentioned relief records. Well... You know, I've always loved Chicago house and Detroit techno, that classic kind of house and techno sound. I've always loved because that's what I first started going out and listening to when I first started going out to warehouse parties. I wasn't aware that when I started buying house music in the late 80s... that a lot of what I was buying was coming from Chicago. I wasn't aware of that. It was just US house to me. It was just house music. It wasn't until we had the shop and we started getting in these records from Relief and from Casual that I started then referencing it back. Then itself, it started referencing that acid sound. and going back to late 80s Chicago. So, you know, I've always been very much into that rough, dirty sound of things that sound like they're going to fall apart at any time, and I think Chicago... has always been great at making that type of music. But I certainly never set out to start some kind of Chicago revival. There were just a lot of people doing that type of music at that time, around 2004, 2005, people like Trevor Jackson. His playgroup stuff that he was doing was very Chicago-y sounding. And I think people wanted a bit of a change from that minimal thing. They wanted something that had a bit more texture to it, that had a bit more guts to it. Not that I want to be down on minimal music, because it's an easy target these days as well. Although it's not my sort of thing, it's a bit of an easy target. But I think that people were getting a bit tired of that and they wanted to start, and a lot of producers, I think, wanted to start using machines again in order to make it more interesting for them in the studio. But Kink and I certainly never set out to start some kind of... on a revival I think people like ourselves and Snuff Crew and we just caught the crest of a wave that was happening anyway really Inside Out did not start off as a Chicago house track It started off as just a house track that I sent to King and he did his bits to it and it came out sounding the way it did. It was not a conscious decision is what I'm trying to say. And do you think the music that you're making can even be called Chicago House or should even be called Chicago House? No, no, it shouldn't. It's not made in Chicago. Chicago House has to be made in Chicago. It can reference that. It can have that sound to it. It can have those influences, but it isn't Chicago House. I make it here in London, and Strahil Kink, he makes it in Bulgaria, and we make it between the two places. It's got that kind of sound, but it's not Chicago House in the same way that, you know, music made in Beckenham isn't Detroit techno. It isn't. It might have a similar sound, but it isn't because it wasn't made there. And I should imagine it probably winds up. from Detroit and Chicago. I should imagine it winds them up and why shouldn't it? It would probably wind me up if I were them. But I've never been just about making that type of music. You make music because it's fun to make it, not because you're making it because that's what's expected of you, because, oh, I'm a Chicago house referencing producer. I've done many things under many different pseudonyms, on Mighty Atom and on Dissident. I didn't just release the one track on Dissident under my own name. I did... a more boogie sounding thing, kind of dubbed out thing. I did a couple of Italo tracks under. under an alias so in order to stay interested you have to be making lots of different sorts of music so having been having been a dj a record shop owner a promoter at times and a producer over the last 25 years how do you feel do you feel positive about the outlook for the future of this scene? Definitely. Yes, definitely. Because people are always going to want to go out at the end of the week and forget their troubles and dance to music. And they're always going to be people who want to catalogue it and want to know about it and want to write catalogue numbers. down and want to research it on the internet and that has always happened people have always been archivists and they're I've always been party people. They're going to need a soundtrack for that. So, yeah. And there'll be times when it's rubbish and we don't enjoy it. And we will think, you know, and then there'll be times when it's great again. So I do feel positive about it. Yeah, absolutely. If I didn't, I wouldn't be doing it. I couldn't get out there and go and play music to people. if I wasn't happy doing it and that's not fair it wouldn't be fair on me and it certainly wouldn't be fair on them it's time to stop doing it when you're not you're not enjoying it anymore I know it sounds like lots of people have probably said that before but I think it is very important that you need to feel positive about it the day I don't feel positive about it anymore I'll stop doing it you
