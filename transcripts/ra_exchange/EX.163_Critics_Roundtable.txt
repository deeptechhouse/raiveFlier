Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. This week is a return of RA's Critics' Roundtable and as always we're going to be discussing three topics. First up, as we're now past the halfway point of the year, we're going to be talking about the albums, singles and producers we've been getting excited about so far in 2013. Next, electronic music has had its fair share of dominant trends over the last five years, but we seem to be struggling to label 2013 as the year of anything in particular. We'll talk about the genres that have at least been in contention for the title, and discuss why it might be more difficult for a sound or a scene to really change the game in the internet era. And finally, in light of recent features with Simon Reynolds and Mr. G, we'll be chatting about our changing relationships with dance music and club culture as we get older. So, it's the return of the critics around table this week, and I'm pleased to be joined in Berlin this evening by RA's Associate Editor, Will Lynch. Will, you just got back from a week's holiday in the States. Were there any particular highlights you wish to share with us? Um, I guess the highlights would be just getting a ton of reading done. Sunk into suck my teeth into Simon Reynolds energy flash for the first time which I've been to do for years So that was great. I'm just catching up on magazine stuff like that if there was any drawback It was um flying United no free wine crappy bread like product thrown at me 7:30 this morning Anyway, and I've got Jordan Roth line here also our as music tech editor Over the weekend, I witnessed a house party set from you. You must have been playing to five or six people there. I would say one of the hardest DJ gigs you can play if you collect house and techno records is the house party gig where you're playing for three people. It's very hard to get those three people going. I find that everything always just seems too bangin', even if it's like a record that you've never thought of as being especially bangin'. I settled on this new thing from DJ Fettberger and Telephones, this Tutti Frutti Del Mar track. Seemed to kind of get everybody going, everyone was like nicely lubricated, and by that I mean the three people I was playing for. Did you do the pitch everything down by minus five? I did. Yeah, I kept everything very slow. Yeah, I think I would say for a gig for three people, it was fantastic. Yeah. And finally, I have Finn Johansson from Macro Recordings and Hardwax. Finn, have you had a good summer so far? It was pretty confusing, I must say. I mean, it was like up and down all the time. And I was on the motorway for most of this day and it was really raining heavily. And then... like a few moments later the sun was shining so it was just weird and I think the whole summer was kind of that way how are you supposed to dress in these circumstances I don't really know I have this feeling that I mostly do it wrong So first of all, as it's been a fair few months since we did one of these and we're over halfway through the year, I'm going to start by talking about what and who everybody has been enjoying so far in 2013. We each put together a list before this and one of the recurrent names was Liberty Sound and the collective's members, Peverellis, Calton and Asusu. Will, you said in a recent Asusu review that at this point, Liberty Sound might be the most inspired label in Bristol. Why have they been doing it for you? For me at this moment, they sort of epitomize the approach of just coming at it from a very unconventional angle. Like it's at this point isn't really related to dubstep or anything like that. Sort of, you know. vaguely stems from like the UK bass tradition but in reality to me just seems like you know they see the possibilities of where the different drum sounds can go as just being very very open-ended and on the one hand it's quite like cutting edge but it also feels very organic and unpretentious and all the tracks are, you know, end up being very funky and, um, uh, yeah, it's just kind of, for me, this sort of optimal bass sound or whatever. Jordan, there was also a label that you mentioned. I think, um, Unpretentious is a great way of describing the music from kind of the standpoint of how everything is put together. It's not very complicated. Production-wise, it's not very complicated, at least on the surface. There aren't a lot of tricks being thrown around in these tracks. They just kind of get down to business. And I also find that they're very difficult to put... into a particular pile. I believe I played maybe one Asusu track at this house party the other day. You know, they can kind of be as hard hitting or as kind of light on their feet as they need to be in any given set. And I really haven't heard a record on this label that I haven't liked. I think I actually said in a previous Critics' Roundtable about Shackleton. And I was just thinking the same thing when I was listening to the newest Liberty sound earlier today that has this quality of where it sounds like the whole thing is just a hair away from just not. making any sense like if there was one clap or whatever missing or just placed differently the whole thing would just be a mess but it's just by a thread hanging on to this very kind of strange elegant composition um and when you're listening to it you don't it's almost like you don't understand why it works it's you know it's so um so out there and oddly put together, but also feels very right. I think for me, it was the cover of The Wire. Last month, Rory Gibb wrote quite an extensive piece on the collective in addition to Young Echo. And I think one of the standout quotes for me was what Joe Calton was saying about there being absolutely nothing superfluous. he was just saying that, you know, in a club context, if there's no reason for that element being there, then it just needs to be stripped back. And I think this is a kind of attitude that's pervaded the whole collective. I know they're coming at it from... definitely from some different angles like pev's um jungle roots i think really shines through and i think on uh from joe's side um grime the way he's kind of assimilated that into his sound this year um but i think that manifests in kind of what you're saying the sort of rhythmic explorations and the sense really that you never quite know what's going to happen next yeah i mean i said in a review i wrote of this um liberty sound six that to me um when people talk about like dance music being kind of like architectural or whatever that is. I guess that was sort of like a cliche sort of, but that I never really understood before. But when you hear these records, it sounds like the way the composition is approached, you know, there's, there's something architectural about it. I guess, like you said about there being nothing superfluous and every part kind of supports another part. Well, the tracks feel kind of like they're all built from the same parts, too. But it's kind of amazing how much mileage or how many different sorts of structures they're able to get out of, you know, what's really just kind of a very consistent kind of set of building blocks. Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean, I think that, you know, on the label, there is like a definite aesthetic, but... If you look at some of the work that the individual members have done in collaboration, it does show that what they do can kind of lend itself and it does have like a malleability. Like the collaboration Pev did with Hodge, like I don't think anybody saw a Dreamy House record coming out of his studio this year. Calton's collaborated with I've got noted down here he's done stuff with Bashmore of course Andy Stop Hytale he was on Bakes All Caps label and kind of spreading things around and you know I mean for me I'm always glad about the stuff coming in from Bristol because for me it's kind of an oasis right now because I still like UK records that kind of stick to their roots but are fresh nonetheless and I think most records out of Bristol totally deliver on that. There was also some overlap on Jordan Will's list with Lies. Jordan, do you feel as though, because Lies was a name on the tip of everybody's tongue last year, do you feel as though they've... ventured forth into 2013 in equally as strong fashion? I mean, they've kind of just kept doing what they're doing in almost exactly the same way they were doing it last year. They're putting out an almost unreasonable number of records. Seems like there's always something new that's coming to the shops here in Berlin. the records have been just as weird, if not even weirder than they were last year. And the label just kind of seems to be doing what it's doing. I wasn't sure how they were going to kind of keep going. When you have a banner year like that, sort of the first thing that you think is, well, okay, they kind of got it all out of their system. What's going to be the, you know... what's going to be the next label that's going to do this. But I think that they're just kind of continuing to do what they do. And there have been some really amazing records that have come out. The Florian Kupfer record has been absolutely massive, despite really not seeming like a massive record at all when you listen to it. They've kind of continued to... go down this sort of like hard banging techno route every once in a while. And there've been some great records from returning artists too that have maybe been better than the stuff they've done before. Tariq comes to mind, Steve Summers comes to mind. It's continuing to be a good year. I don't think there's really any other label out that's quite like Lies. Do you think there's at all a danger of them kind of flooding the marketplace? Actually, something I heard that was kind of interesting, someone that runs the label was telling me that in order it's it's very difficult to create a reputation purely by being a label that usually um artists that represent the label sort of carry the label's banner as like a dj or a producer and that's the way that you actually raise the label's profile and the other part of it was that in order to really um create a reputation as a label you have to release an incredible amount of music um And to me, I think Lies is kind of the example of that, where they release so many records that even if you don't like a lot of them or don't hear a lot of them, it still makes an impression on you. And I'm like, for instance, like Jordan mentioned, the harder techno stuff. Like I think of Lies as one of my favorite labels right now. I don't even really pay attention to a pretty wide swath of what they put out. Um, nonetheless, they have maybe four records this year that I really, really like, which is more than any other single label. Um, and there are at least as many that I just have no interest in, in, in buying or whatever, but, but yeah, but you know, they put out so much and it's all so different that, you know, Yeah, I think if you bought every Lies record, you'd probably be broke and you wouldn't really be buying anything else, but you would still sort of have a very rich collection of music. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's... Yeah, but I mean... What is the latest catalogue number? I mean, it's like 28 or something. Okay, they have all the additional white labels and stuff. But if you compare that to like some German labels that have been going for, okay, they're going for a bit longer, but they're all running in three digits, you know. 200 plus releases yeah i guess it's yeah it's not as many as like it's not that much and i think that they're pretty tight i mean uh it's stylistically it's really diverse but uh the level is still very high and i i um i actually bought more lice records uh than than before this year oh really yeah I thought that it really got going for me personally. I think a lot of the older records for me were just too retro and I think that that has changed. And now stuff is really developing. some some own signature the artists individually individually for example like steve summers doesn't sound like steve summers of two years ago sure i i almost entirely agree with you i think the least interesting thing on this label for me is something that resembles house music. I think it's anything above, beyond, below that tempo. Other excursions that are really exciting to me. How does this stuff do in hard wax? Do they usually sell well? Is this a popular style for Berlin record buyers? It's a really popular label, yeah. I mean, they're not equally popular. some releases are hotter than others maybe. But that is quite... I mean, it's just the music they put out. It's of course something like the Marcus Cabral album or stuff like that, which is pretty harsh. It's not as accessible as, let's say, the Florian Kupfer record. or other stuff and they have stuff like Svengali's ghost and that is I mean they have some records that fit in any DJ set and then they have records that don't and but the interesting thing is that you know people that are more on a house tip they get served and lots of people might not be interested in house at all and then they get some jacking industrial stuff And they do all that, but they have a coherent label identity. And I think that is really, really hard to achieve. and respect to everyone who achieves that. And they do. Yeah, I feel like the, or my guess of the explanation for that coherent identity or whatever is just that it's Ron Morelli's taste in music, which, you know, like one person's taste, I think often can have that quality of being, you know, on paper quite all over the place and crazy, but in some way you can't put your finger on, kind of, there's a common thread there, you know, it all makes sense in a way. And, um, I know there was a video interview with him recently where he said, his kind of A&R technique or whatever is sort of non-existent or it's basically just that people that he knows show him music that they've made and sometimes his reaction is like wow I definitely need to release this and that was why he started the label was just he felt like he had so many friends sitting on so much good music that it just the natural thing to do was to try to release it but he didn't think of it as a project of like, okay, I'm going to start the label and get some really good artists and blah, blah, blah. It felt like something just needed to happen. So I think, you know, since the process is so organic. And it's just, you know, a one-man show kind of that sort of explains why there's this, you know, palpable personality, even though there's so much, you know, variety in the records. Finn, are there any trends you found particularly exciting this year? That's kind of a... thing that interested me a lot of times this year you know these records that were psychedelic in a way very tripping verging on unstructured at times and I thought there were lots of really interesting records coming out that kind of fitted that field I mean even if it's hardwax related I really have to mention Labels like ACHIDO, which I think are incredible. ZÜD too, you know, all these Atelier related. labels that kind of also are down with the Sextex Brothers and stuff but they're different and I think that they're consistently putting out very interesting music that is totally on their own. A label and a pair of artists I want to mention were Mr. Top Hat and Art Alfie. I have to admit, I know very, very little about this pair of artists. Yeah, me neither. What I do know is there's been a series of releases on Karlovak. I'm pretty sure they've all come out this year. I think there's been six in total. but it's been for me like a pretty non-stop stream of just very very functional like club ready house music that has always had some element of surprise. It reminds me of like, it's kind of sound stream, but streamlined. There's a little bit more bass presence in some of this stuff, but there were just a couple of records, I think, with some very clever use of frequency manipulation. um like for example the track baby i want to see you're in love with me um holding off the bass drop till two-thirds of the way through the track. And it always struck me as one of those records that, as a DJ, there wasn't too much information about. Nobody was really repping these records. It would invariably have people coming up to the booth, like, what is this track? I think Ricardo's maybe been playing a few of the releases, which I think is always going to help. Could be, yeah. I mean, I was responsible for buying the label for the store and It was really interesting how quick the demand increased. I mean, it just didn't stop. It got more and more. And at this point, they probably repressed some titles even. And I just keep reordering the stuff week in, week out, and it sells. I feel like quite a wide range of DJs would fit their stuff into their sets. For house DJs, kicking things up to a next gear, kind of mid-set, maybe it's kind of loopy and functional enough for techno DJs to slot into their stuff. You know, I don't know who these people are, but they're certainly... found some sound, they developed some sound that is really working. Will, you've written two RA Recommends reviews of DJ Sprinkle's music this year. This kind of follows suit on RA in that we've favourably reviewed his music in the past. why does his stuff continue to resonate with you? Well, I think this is, you know, this is probably just like a personal history thing, but I guess I always liked DJ Sprinkles, Terry Tamlitz, but I never, it was only this year that I saw this kind of fun side of him. Like I guess before I... the past few years we've sort of seen the more, either the sort of cerebral side with Terry Tamlitz and the soulless-less, you know. thumb drive extravaganza. And, and before that was a few years ago with Midtown 120 Blues, which is very understated and quite sad and mellow and everything. And I guess, you know, so I've liked him for a few years, but this year was sort of like, I don't know, seeing this side of his style that I wasn't really familiar with before, which is sort of the DJ side, I guess. with the mix where Dance Wars stands still and then with the remix album. I guess I just, you know, it might come from being someone who gets quite saturated with this music and everything, but for me it's always nice when something kind of, you know, takes the... uh, clubby, a clubby sound and I guess elevates it somewhat by being sort of having these sort of emotional shades of gray and, um, you know, bring in kind of, or like emotional ambiguity, I guess, too. And, um, being kind of like sad and mysterious and everything. Um, but maintaining this sort of, um, uh, club vibe, um, to me, it's, I don't know. It's. I guess it's rare and it's very compelling. I started the review with this because I thought it was the best example, but his remix of Lost Area by June, Christian here at RA described it to me as an emotional rollercoaster. He was just like, yeah, it's like there's screaming and there's crying and it starts out really sinister and then it gets really sad. And that was, you know, it's sort of like when he was describing it that way, it just kind of dawned on me just how unusual that is. And I don't know, I think it's cool. I guess in the end, I think there really is much more range within the style of music than most artists take advantage of. So yeah, that's sort of what makes DJ Smirkle interesting to me. I wondered if anybody had had a chance to play out the remix of The Mole that he released on Perlon. Yeah, that's a weapon. It's okay. I haven't heard this dropped in a club yet. I was intrigued by what sort of reaction that would elicit. Well, the thing that strikes me about that record is it just sounds like DJ Sprinkles playing a record in a DJ set. You know, he's going nuts on the filter. You can really feel his presence very active in this track. It's almost like bringing a little sprinkles into your own thing that you're doing. I guess I've only heard it out once and it was really nice. It sounded like you had as well, Finn. I played it at every gig. for weeks now. I mean, I had it as a test pressing, so even a bit longer than others maybe. And I love it to bits. It's working really well. I mean, of course, it's a weird record, but... At one point someone was telling me that it's some record that either clears the floor or everybody's totally going nuts for it. And I never cleared the floor with it. Totally the opposite. It works really well. Did you see anybody doing like the DJ equivalent of the air guitar and doing the whole air crossfade thing? Yeah, I mean... Yeah, I mean, it's convenient for somebody like me who doesn't work the EQs at all. So I can probably maintain that I do it once in a while. I mean, I think it's not the interesting thing about that remake. is that it doesn't sound gimmicky and I think that's quite an achievement when you consider how much. He's applying these EQing, crossfading techniques in their track. But it's not disturbing and it doesn't come on as too jokey for me. And yeah, I think it's just a perfect example of him being just a great artist. you So despite all this great music that's been released this year, at RA we've started to think of 2013 as being the year without a dominant trend. So in the recent past we've had things like dubstep, minimal, disco, deep house and bass music. But it'd be difficult to describe 2013 as the year of anything in particular. Jordan, have there been any contenders for you? I mean, it seems like a lot of... People have been making really, really great albums. That isn't really a dominant sound so much as maybe just a trend. Maybe this is everybody's release cycle is starting to hit that same point. I mean, you know, we've talked a lot sort of internally about techno, maybe sort of making a comeback, this sort of industrial strain of techno. There's definitely a little bit of a trend there, but it doesn't feel like this overwhelming trend that is sucking a lot of things in, getting everybody excited. House has sort of remained... kind of this trend. This has been something that's been going on for the last few years, seems to be continuing apace. But again, it's not a dominant trend that's just from this year. It's kind of a continuation of something else. When I look at this year, I guess I've felt very strongly that I don't sense one trend kind of sticking out over everything else. I wonder if it's sort of the year that the internet has maybe really grabbed everybody and is truly starting to influence things in kind of a big and insidious way. When you look at something like dubstep, which is sort of the trend that we all kind of point to in these circles as being this... kind of this big, this very specific thing that had these wide-ranging repercussions. I mean, it's kind of happening in this one neighborhood, kind of this relatively small group of people vibing off of what each other were doing. Now, you know, if you're making music, you're probably engaged in the Internet to a large extent. And just think about how many more people you have to kind of get in, get on board with your idea at that point. I think the Internet is great that it introduces people to new ideas and definitely lets people get involved who wouldn't be able to otherwise. but it also creates this sort of massive that I think is maybe hard to move in certain strange directions. Yeah, I mean, for me, I think it's largely a case of things not having the necessary time and dark spaces to incubate. As in the past, if you'd like, you know, dubstep, I think is the perfect example. in order for something to really come and take a hold and for a sound aesthetic to really take a hold. It needs a little bit of time to develop. It needs its own rules. It needs its own people. It needs its own clubs. It needs the DJs repping this stuff. But nothing's coming fully formed anymore. And I think that anything, any little... blips in the continuum or blips in the lineage of this music are right away picked over you know these sounds like a you know a snare might be put in an odd place in a record or something two days later this is been written about by a journalist it's been all over social media this this has already been like codified and categorized and everybody's picked over it and moved on to the next thing um yeah and and i think the other thing is that that a lot of like developments or even what some people may call trends are more like reactions to something that's already there. For example, you had a really massive stream of all these really well-produced house records that Totally sounded like the presets that they were produced with and then there was a whole bunch of people doing something that sounded more trashy and you know what then got coined as outside hours and stuff like that. On the other hand you have like as we mentioned earlier you have like lots of UK producers being more straight with the beats and what they do. And then you have lots of records that are really interesting that do the total opposite and work with Eamon breaks again and all these proto-jungle ray signals and lots of sound system tradition integrated as well. And I think that's really cool. I mean, you know, yeah, you have something going on and then there's some counterattack on the way shortly after. And I think that's a good way. But yeah, of course, you're right. a dominant trend to evolve. I don't think that will happen too quickly. And there's a whole lot of reasons for that, probably. I mean, when everybody's working with the same digital equipment, it's pretty unlikely that someone will, you know, flip a switch and something will be completely unheard of i think that's that's one one thing that is responsible for it i mean it's funny that many of the things that you bring up or many of the qualities in the music that you talk about equally could have been applied to the music well roughly this time last year um yeah it feels like the loathe by aesthetic just has It's really been a, I wouldn't say a trend in that it's, you know, kickstarted a genre or anything, but it's funny that it's more of a, like a production style or something. It's like a permanent, seems like a permanent part of like the palette at this point. Yeah, very much so. Will, what has it been the year of for you, if anything? Well, I guess kind of going along with what we were just saying, I think, yeah, on the one hand, there's a lack of this, you know, distinct trends at the tip of your tongue. But I also think maybe, you know, part of that is like Jordan was saying about the Internet. There's this kind of cross-pollination that just becomes more and more efficient as time goes on and everybody hears about everything. I think, you know, one result of that that I've seen, I think there are a few different examples, but the one that I personally noticed this year was the sort of osmosis between club music and experimental music. And I was at this festival in Austria called Danau Festival. And it just occurred to me that virtually, or not virtually everyone, but more than half the acts I saw there were kind of like noise or drone or ambient or just out there. But they were all flirting with club beats of some form. And an interesting one. One for me was Pete Swanson. He basically does these walls of noise, but then this 4/4 thud would kind of sneak in there. It's interesting to me because, I don't know, I guess maybe 10 years ago, a little bit less, there was the same kind of overlap between noise music, experimental music, and rock. And there still is to some extent, but you know, like maybe 10 years ago, I was listening to bands like lightning bolt. and um wolf eyes and like they would play in rock clubs and there would be sort of a rock element like you know people could kind of headbang and people would crowd surf and stuff like that uh it would get crazy but it really was just totally you know out there and experimental and um anyway i sort of see that um that same kind of uh symbiotic relationship now happening with like house and techno and really experimental stuff. And, um, and actually I was talking to Bill Kouligas about it at that festival. he was talking about putting on the Pan Act Festival in Brooklyn. And he was saying that, you know, Brooklyn has this history of, like that other stuff I was talking about, Bullfies, Lightning Bolt, not that those bands are from New York, but the stuff was always popular there. And they had the No Fun Festival and things like that. And he sort of said that the Pan Act Festival would sort of tap into this audience that... You know, they used to be sort of like on the fence between experimental and rock, and now they're kind of on the fence between experimental and house and techno. which in a way I guess strikes me as kind of ironic because traditionally, you know, like with, with this sort of crossover, it's like on the one hand you have feel good vibes of like house music. And then the other like intentionally headache inducing, you know, no fun fest, like no fun vibes. So in a way it seems like a really unlikely. Pairing to me. It's you know, it makes kind of interesting it I mean is it a reciprocal relationship at the moment? are there a straight house producers and, uh, and DJs who are particularly interested in these and the kind of acts that you're talking about, or is this noise artists just, uh, gaining or bringing techno into what they do? Um, yeah, I'm not really sure, but, um, I mean, I guess like to give a specific example, um, like I said, Pete Swanson, but then also, um, uh, Obviously, he's always been sort of club-oriented, but I was pretty surprised to see Actress play live, and he sort of does away with the kind of open-ended, wishy-washy beats and pretty much just brings in a techno beat. And I think, not to say that they're this, you know... Cynical or anything, but for a lot of them it's a way of making it appropriate for for a club or festival or something Because that's where they get booked like most these artists don't get booked in galleries or early evening concerts They get booked in clubs. And so it ends up being kind of like a you know an easy way to, you know, perform, I guess, or to make their performance, you know, make sense to the audience. I found it interesting, actually, the few times that I've caught some of these acts, I guess that, you know, the artists you'd associate with Pan or like a label like Black is Ever Black, outside of their live performances, when you go along to catch them very, very often, like when they're... bringing together a DJ set or something. They're playing old Jungle records where it's like hardcore or they want to kind of rep what they've, or what they've come from or where their roots are with this side of things. I think for me, one of the biggest barometers with this thing was some of the lineups that Richie Horton put together for his enter parties. For those who didn't see it, there was acts like Lee Gamble. Demodike Stare, I think, played Andy Stott. I'm interested. I didn't hear any reports from those gigs, but how that music and if that music would translate. even in the context of like a tiny room in a six room club like space. Yeah, but I guess that's kind of the epitome of what I'm saying. Demdike Stare playing at space in Ibiza, like that's kind of an extraordinary phenomenon to me. You know, like sort of like how did that end up happening? How did that cross anyone's mind as like a reasonable idea? Yeah, I think as well. And we're talking about the leveling effect that the Internet's had and kind of what Jordan was saying at the outset, or maybe Finn brought up before, where a lot of these guys from the kind of UK sound system and bass music background are going into much straighter house and techno. And you're seeing this a lot on Rinse. where you have DJs now, I was kind of browsing over the podcast for the last couple of weeks and you've got names like Surgeon, Bleed Music, like I think Ben UFO had a bee mask on his show recently. You know, I don't think anybody would have called like bee mask performing live on Rinse like 12 months ago or something. Well, when I was recently at a lot of the Berlin Atonal events, you see all of the same people that you see when you go out to a techno show or something like that. And this is for music that is not necessarily club music. There just seems to be a great deal of crossover of interest. Do you think in a way that there was maybe a gap in the home listening market for people who were... kind of inter-club styles, but weren't necessarily having this box kind of ticked for them. It's not necessarily home listening, you know. But is it club music? Years ago, this was an integral part of clubland. As you know, yeah, what were they called? Like mostly chill-out room or whatever. I mean, mostly that what's popular today is not necessarily chill-out music in a classic sense. But I think it's kind of going in the same direction. It's vanished for years. And the whole, you know, all these classic IDM labels or whatever, they were like dormant or defunct. And it totally vanished and disappeared and it left a gap. And I think there are so many people that felt that it was missing. And probably also a lot of people that really need an introduction to that because they didn't witness it firsthand when it was going on. So now it's not like a classic chill-out room for people to just catch some breath. But it's, I think... the resurgence in that kind of more experimental music. not beat-centered or whatever. I think it was just a matter of time that it was resurfacing, and now it happens. But do you feel as though it's actually become large enough where it's taken a hold in these clubs? I mean, what you're suggesting almost feels like what would be the sort of natural continuation. of what we're discussing, but has this music actually taken hold in like in room twos, like sort of classic chill out model? Actually, it was, it was what Will was mentioning. Either you, you do it in a like concert context where you have lineups with experimental acts, or you just put a beat under it and, and see where it goes. And yeah, a lot of techno records nowadays are doing just that. It's kind of, they apply some beat and the rest is not like structured in a techno traditional way like there's some signal. some bassline, some melody, a lot of techno is just, you know, atmospherics and some industrial drones and noises. And yeah, I mean, for me, this is not really something that emerged this year. It's been going on for quite a while. What I found interesting is that And I agree with Will there that purely experimental acts will get much more popular than they did in the last few years. You could read about it everywhere. Some blogs are already really specializing on it. Some labels are specializing on it. Some distributors. Suddenly it's a market, you know. You mentioned industrial there, which you wrote what I guess you would define as a trend piece at the start of the year, like kind of posing the question, is this the industrial techno revolution? We were mentioning producers like Blauan and sort of a resurgence of interest in Surgeon and Perk and people like this. But what I guess what I want to ask everyone is if you've actually been dancing to this music this year, this has just been something that's been kind of showing up on record shelves, but not necessarily make its way into club sets. Well, I went to Melt Festival, I guess, back in July. And on one of the stages playing this sunrise set was Karen, which is, you know, Pariah and Blahwan. And, you know, this is about as bleak as techno gets. People seem to be getting into it. You know, it was kind of a very bizarre time to see that kind of music. But I don't know that anybody really noticed. I think it went over. pretty well. In general, I think that, you know, depending on what level of the club you're in, you probably do hear a lot of it. I think it was interesting that with Berghain, I didn't actually, I mean, in the times that I'd visited this year, I didn't necessarily notice the sound there being noisier. I didn't feel like this was a sound that they were necessarily picking up on or like this had somehow been absorbed into the palettes of like the resident DJs. I mean, I think it shows how sort of how mercurial trends really are. Like I would actually say that when I first moved to Berlin almost four years ago, like Marcel Deppman and Ben Clock, especially. It seemed like we're always playing pretty brutal, kind of overdriven sounding stuff. And now that has had nothing to do with, you know, it was before this industrial resurgence, so to speak. But yeah, I mean, I feel like a trend. uh could exist in sort of uh the world of blogs and critics and you know interesting boutique labels and could have in some cases like very little to do with um what's actually working in clubs and and so you saw what i was getting out with my questions i guess i guess so yeah well i mean i think um yeah i think it can go either way i think there could be something that is like a buzz on the internet or, you know, among sort of connoisseurs and stuff, but not necessarily on the ground or the two aren't necessarily connected all the time. I think it's also noticeable that for some time these, you know, industrial... drone flavor was only applied to techno records and now you know like some stuff of lies you can also say it's like it's a house beat it's a Chicago house reminiscent beat but it is in just sounds on top of it or take for example like like rough house who do like a very good drum and bass records um that sound like they're they're well purely made for berghain you know but their drum and bass uh also like a lot of the felix k stuff hidden hawaiian stuff it's it's uh it's industrial flavor drum and bass and that I think it's something that hasn't been there on that level. so working on the assumption that there will be a equal and opposite reaction to this stuff will next year be the year of pianos and polished music do we think? you So last month we ran a couple of pieces that got us thinking about our changing relationships with dance music as we got older. The first was an excerpt from Simon Reynolds' new update of Energy Flash, in which he attended Hard Summer in LA to write about the new incarnation of raves in the US. The second was a Machine Love piece with Mr. G, where he discussed his production methods with you, Jordan. One of the most notable things about the pieces is both Reynolds and Colin McBean are in their 50s. Finn, you have a wife and child now. How has your relationship with dance music and clubs changed in recent years? Do you still go out much? I mean, the main thing is that I don't go out as much as I used to. But it doesn't... I can't, you know, it's not because I have a family right now. It's more like I have a full working week as well at Hardwix. And in the years before, I was working as a freelance writer mostly and doing the macro label and stuff. And I just had more time to go out. And it's not like I'm not curious enough anymore and I'm not interested anymore. That's not the point. But it's just like I have to work a lot at this point. And on weekends, I'm really just tired. And it also applies, it also affects like bookings for me. It's like there's some certain schedule points I just reject. Like I don't start at 7 a.m. or something because I just can't do that anymore. It won't work. I mean, I want to, if I play somewhere, I want to perform well. there are some times I know it just won't work. So when you do get the opportunity to go out, do you feel like you're thinking especially hard about the context and where you're going and who you're going to see? No, not really. I mean, it's... I mean, I'm going out for like 30 years now. I started going out regularly when I was about 14. So I've seen a lot come and go. And over that long period of time, it's perfectly clear that things start repeating themselves. Not everything I hear in clubs is a revelation anymore. I mean, it's perfectly natural. But the other thing is, if you feel you're totally not surprised by anything anymore, then just stay home. it doesn't make no sense I'm still I'm still curious I'm still like to be surprised but that is like the main problem that I like to be surprised and the surprises are getting fewer and fewer. I have these talks with people my age and it's always like, or a lot of them are like, it was all better back in the day. And then they blame a younger generation who kind of agree that it was all better back in the 90s or whatever. And they try to... recover that and they want to do exactly that sound and and then you and then the old folks say like um please make it as as good as back in the days and it's it's like it's it's just uh going around in circle and it leads to nothing so two questions was it better back in the day and how old are you yeah i'm I'm 40 this year. And it was not back in the days. It was not better. It was just different. And that's the main thing. What you always have to keep in mind is that pioneering days are always easier. When things start out to happen, it's always easier because there are no rules and everything is fresh. And so when, you know, whatever, when house came on, when techno came on, when whatever style of both came on. There was no established rulebook, just some kind of club tradition, like there were some disco roots, there were some regular roots or whatever. But you could do whatever you want and you established something new. But the other thing is that, you know, and this is always something that annoys me, is that people say that... Today everything sounds the same or whatever. And it was always that way, you know. How many people tried to sound like Todd Terry in the late 80s, early 90s, with tons of records copying Todd Terry? that particular new groove organ sound or whatever there were always some people who had an idea and some people copying that for a while but of course you cannot You cannot deny that there were more lasting musical revolutions in those years. But yeah, the music hasn't existed before. And I'm pretty aware that I had the privilege to see that evolving. first hand being there dancing on the floor and of course that's great But I wouldn't say that the clubs weren't better or something or the music was better. There's still so much great music coming out today that would keep me interested. I'm not worrying about that. And I think if I would have to start worrying about that, I would also reflect if maybe it's just time to... To stay in. Jordan, were the clubs better when you were a young man? I had kind of an interesting experience this year, I guess, because I moved over at the beginning of the year from New York. coming to Berlin. And it's not that New York is lacking in nightclubs or in good things to see. I mean, there's some amazing bookings in New York, but Berlin is just on a sort of slightly different level. There's a different energy to it. So I got here and, you know, you... pick up a bear kind flyer, you see that there's, you know, a 46 hour homopathic every single weekend. And your gut tells you, I have to go out, I have to see everything. So I think, you know, the first month or two that I was here, probably spent almost every weekend at a club. And something that you learn about Berlin is that there are going to be amazing lineups every single weekend. And if you miss one weekend, there will be another one, maybe even the next weekend, where there's something that's just as good or nearly as good. And it will also be an amazing experience. And, you know, New York, when something, not that there aren't good things all the time, but when something really amazing comes through, you have to grab it. And here, almost everything looks like that. So I think that in my, what is it, seven or eight months of growing up in Berlin clubs, I've definitely slowed down in terms of... how much I've seen and I think it's made me appreciate what I have seen a lot more Will do you feel like you're as open to new sounds as you were when you were younger? No well or like yes and no I guess I think I sort of become a bit more realist in terms of, uh, I don't know, like if, if there's a artist who I don't actually, I haven't heard anything firsthand about how good they are as a DJ or whatever. Um, I'll probably not give them the benefit of the doubt. Um, where I think when I was sort of like, more on like a honeymoon phase. Um, want to check everything out. And now I sort of need a bit more of a guarantee that like this will have turned out to be worth most of all the lack of sleep. Then of course also like money and things like that. Um, but yeah, I guess for me that the sort of growing up that the swinging of the pendulum or whatever was, um, that I used to really look forward to an opportunity to go out. And now it's the reverse. Like I look forward to the assurance where it's like, okay, I can definitely take this weekend completely off. It sounds really strange, but it might, it might show how, you know, again, that might only be true for people that have such a saturated existence with this stuff. I, you know, there's this, I think there's a, something I always thought that was true of, um, you know, going out to clubs is, um, you know, like they say with like, um, people using drugs, like, uh, the nature of like a drug experience is like. you have a really, really good one, like first time or the second time you do something. And then from then on, you're chasing that first like high. And it was absolutely the same thing with going to clubs, at least for a little while. And I think you hit a point where it's like, you realize you're not going to outdo that time. you know, that was in your sometime in your first three years of going out where you were just, you know, completely transcendent, just totally mind blowing experience. After a while you realize like, yeah, okay, that's not happening again. And he was like, I'll still go out. I'll have a great time, hear great music. You know, it would be very memorable. But you just realize like you're barking up the wrong tree. If you know, if you think that as you're in line for the club, like maybe this will be the best one ever. Chance of that just kind of go down, down, down. So you now operate within this sort of reduced level of joy, of capacity for joy now. Basically. Well, I mean, okay, I have to say, like, I'm probably coming off more pessimistic than I actually am within the context of this topic. Do you feel like the sort of nature of the venues you attend has changed as well? Do you kind of seek out the, I guess it's the older person cliche of, like, intimate spaces and... the atmospheres and stuff. Yeah, but the thing is, if you're older if you're my age you can go wherever you want that's the really special thing about Berlin we all live in a bubble here you know if I go to a club it's more than likely that I'm not the oldest person there if I you know if I go to clubs or play in clubs in smaller cities That's really dramatically different. So, yeah, that's just a really important thing that you don't have to take care of. I mean, would you, I mean, maybe it's different for Berlin, but would you be closely considering what you suppose the crowd was going to be like? Would you go to an event if you thought it was going to be all 21 year olds, for example? I don't know. If it's a DJ I'm really interested in, I probably wouldn't care. But yeah, of course it would feel awkward. I give you that. Yeah, there's some, you know, like shades of responsibility that swing into action then, you know, what am I doing here? Am I a good example? I don't know. Actually, that reminded me of, you know, as you started with the Simon Reynolds thing, and it's not in the excerpt, but Angus Finlayson. contributes to RA did an interview with Simon Reynolds where he talks about the hard summer thing. And he said that he, when he went, he, um, ended up like his niece ended up tagging along and that he has kind of like a paternal relationship with her. And, um, being at you know he went one night by himself and like checked the whole thing out and felt one way about it and then when he came with his niece who he felt somewhat protective of he suddenly had this totally different perception of the whole thing where he realized he it was a little bit threatening like he didn't really want her to leave his sight and stuff like that and he kind of realized how um you know, just being in this parent, you know, semi parental position, cast the whole thing in a different light all of a sudden. And he almost felt self conscious. He'd been celebrating this culture his whole life. And then once he actually sees it through the eyes of a parent, he's like, Oh, what the hell is this thing? Yeah. I mean, I might put my own daughter on a guest list in a few years. It kind of freaks me out. Do we feel as though we're sort of actively exploring ways to keep ourselves fresh as we sort of grow older with this music? Do you have tactics for kind of keeping yourself fresh, whether that's through your listening habits or, you know, like we've been talking about the nature of clubs that you go to? I definitely think that I do. I guess now for a year or two have been basically working full time in music. And it's really weird when you make the transition from just being somebody who's... obsessed with music to now being someone who is not only obsessed with music, but is being paid to be obsessed with music. And I'm always looking for opportunities to remain obsessed with it kind of in the way that I used to be, where I don't have to take into account types of music that I'm not personally invested in or just having to think about it like I'm on the clock. Going record shopping, I think for me, is the thing that really keeps me excited about things because that's something I was doing back when I didn't have a job and couldn't really afford to be doing it. It's just, it's nice. Nobody's like giving you these records and saying, you know, please give us your feedback on these or you're not having to write a review of it. You just get to grab a bunch of vinyl and sit down in a listening booth and listen to it and see if you like it or not. And you don't have to give anybody except yourself a good reason for why you like it. I think, too, you know, just going to a club and trying to disappear as much as possible and not schmooze is always fun and keeps things fresh. And I think for me, these are just two things to try to keep kind of the weekends separate from work and keep record shopping as separate from work as possible. Yeah, I definitely think I was in that position a few too many times, certainly last year. And it was something I was looking to address this year. where I woke up the next morning and thought I was just chatting with the people I chat with on a regular weekday you know I'm not about the same topic about the same topics yeah Finn, do you feel like your listening habits and the way you consume this music has changed much over the years? Absolutely, because I don't have the patience anymore to deal with music that is not pushing things forward. I mean, I really try to concentrate on things that are really, to my personal opinion, worth pursuing. And, you know, try to cut out all the middle ground with releases that just serve some purpose on a publicity level or whatever. that were released not being really good music but just for some strategic reasons. And it's just heaps of that stuff every week and I tend to totally ignore that right now and really try to concentrate. on what is really, you know, what I think is this, you should probably check out. This is one level. And then, you know, when people whose taste you can trust, you know, recommend something, then you take some time out to check that and not, you know. browse through some releases that are probably not worth your time. So as an encapsulation, you'd say that at this point, what you're still searching for is innovation. You're still kind of after the shock of the new. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, that is my main motivation still. I think that really hasn't changed at all. You know, my interest in music, yeah, the obsession with it. I think, you know, it's actually the same. When I had my, you know, first pocket money and went out buying records with me, you know, I was like six years old or something. And, you know, when new boxes arrive at the store and I unpack them and put them on the deck and check what's on it, it's still the same. I hope I will never lose that. And if I lose it, I probably have to seek another profession because I think it's the only way you can do it properly. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
