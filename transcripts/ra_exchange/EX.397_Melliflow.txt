Thank you. Thank you. *outro music* Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Elisa Stolman, and this week's exchange is with Vera and Alexandra, who run the label Melaflow. They announced its inaugural release from Berlin-based producer Space Travel in 2016 after years of planning the imprint and working together on parties. Since then, they've released records from established talents such as BIN and fresh faces like Zapp and Andrea. While Vera's career as a DJ began in Germany's southwest with residencies at clubs like Robert Johnson, Alexandra hails from Romania, where she worked for years with the crew behind the annual seaside festival Sunwaves before building her own successful DJ career. When they dropped by RA's Berlin office a few weeks back, They unpack the science behind what makes mellow flow one of contemporary dance music's most exciting sources. You can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with mellow flow is up next. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I'd like to start the exchange, this joint exchange with you, Vera. And I'd like to know a little bit about your background. I know you come from the Heidelberg, Frankfurt. general area. If you could just tell me about how you got into clubbing in Heidelberg or in Mannheim. In Heidelberg, well, I was still living in Heidelberg when I started going out first to Techno Party. I don't know, it was just like something that was happening at the time. The first time I went to Techno Party was in the beginning of 93. And some friends told me they were always going to this club in Frankfurt and it's open until, I don't know, like from Saturday to Sunday afternoon. Or they go there like Saturday morning, like late. And I was like, what? Oh, wow. It sounds exciting, you know. And I don't know. Eventually I joined them when I was 18 and I was allowed actually to go to the clubs. Was this an omen? No, that was a Dorian Gray in Frankfurt in the airport. Yes. After that, I would always go to Omen because this was like more the club. We would also go to the Frankfurt airport. So Dorian Gray. But my first party was there, Dorian Gray. Who was playing the first night you went to Dorian Gray? It was Cosmic Baby Live. It was a big trans phase there. And I believe it was DJ Duck. d-a-g dj duck he was called like a german guy and did you did those two clubs have an impact you think on how you listen to dance music or how you collect it um well probably everything at the beginning had some sort of impact i mean it was like just you know it was so fascinated by this music you know like just i danced like the whole night through and like it was so fascinating you know they didn't like have vocals or anything like that it was pushing on you know like some text or whatever you were just like so free and yes it had definitely an influence because what those were the places that I would always go to you know and then also in my hometown in Heidelberg and in Mannheim which is next to Heidelberg there would also be like like regular clubs where I would regularly go. And yeah, it had a lot of influence. But in this time, you know, like there was so much happening. There was all kinds of stuff. There was drum and bass coming in, there was house and there was techno and techno trance and ambient. And I don't know, there was a lot of things going on. And I was just like a sponge, you know, like soaking up everything. I would go to all kinds of parties and listen to all kinds of electronic music and being curious about it. How old were you when you left Heidelberg? Well, I moved first to Mannheim, so it was kind of not still in my home area. And I lived there for three years and then I went to travel for a while in India and then I came back and then I went to Ibiza, which was in 1990. No, not true. 2000. I spent the season in 2000. I spent in Ibiza. And after that I came back to Mannheim for a little while, for two, three years. And then in 2002 or 2003, I don't remember exactly, I moved to Frankfurt. What took you so long to move to Frankfurt? Well, it was just around the corner, actually. So we would always go. It took 45 minutes by car. I didn't see a need. I actually wanted to always move to Berlin, but then I met my boyfriend. I mean, I was always going out in Frankfurt. I met my boyfriend there, and then eventually I just moved there. I just said, OK, I'm just going to stay in Frankfurt. Because I had friends there. It was like an easy thing. My understanding is that Frankfurt was the Berlin before Berlin. So in the 90s, the capital of techno and clubbing in Germany would have been Frankfurt and only later became Berlin. So it's interesting. You could not say that necessarily. In my opinion, Berlin was always there, but the scene was very different there. It was like kind of, I have to be careful what I say. I don't know. They were different from each other, you know, like the Frankfurt scene was very different from Berlin. In Berlin, Frankfurt was, I think, a little bit more, already in the early years, there was a bit more like hype involved around the DJs and stuff. While in Berlin, it was more, let's say, underground, you know. Right. I guess that's what I meant that the most famous DJs and clubs, Sven Veit and Omen. Sven was definitely like, yeah, the magnet. He was like, I think probably one of the first ones that got celebrated as a star, you know, like that attracted, you know. As a DJ in general. Yeah, exactly. And I mean, also Ricardo Villalobos, who I'm sure will come up again in this conversation, especially because you already mentioned your first trip to Ibiza in 2000. And I was wondering if you could tell me about that. first summer in Ibiza and what you were doing there, what clubs you went to? Well, it was, I didn't know much about Ibiza at that time. It's like also I decided to join my boyfriend at that time that I just had met like a few months before. They decided to, they were from Argentina and they decided to spend the season in Ibiza to work and yeah, well, I just go with them. And I had just started DJing at that time. And it was the first year that Cocoon actually was doing a full season in Amnesia. Yeah, like this kind of music was not so popular in Ibiza at that time. It was more about like progressive house and space, you know, and privilege. There's many mission parties and like this kind of DJ Sasha and Dick Wheat and all these kind of DJs. So Cocoon was very new with this techno sound and there was something fresh starting there at that time. It was nice to see and experience it because I always went to the parties of Sven Fed in Frankfurt and then to see it there in Ibiza. And yeah, I know I had a regular job like I was working from Tuesdays to Sundays and then Monday, Tuesday was off, which was quite convenient because Monday were the cocoon parties. So I had Tuesdays off, which was cool. And yeah. Were there many German techno fans traveling to Ibiza at that time? There was a bunch, but not too many, I think. It was more English people, I believe, and Spanish. So how did you first hear about Ibiza as a destination for someone interested in club music? As I said, it was not my idea, actually. It was my ex-boyfriend at the time that they had the idea to just go there for the season and to work there. And they knew that there was something going on, but I was not with my focus on Ibiza. I was just going there and it was more like a surprise what's going to happen. I didn't have much idea what the scene is going to be there like. And you said that by the time you went to Ibiza, you had already started DJing. I had just picked up on DJing. It was really at the very, very beginning. Did that change the way you listened to music? Or do you think you already listened to it a certain way that made you interested in DJing as well? I mean, what definitely had an impact was that I would every Monday listen to Ricardo Villalobos there. And he was resident DJ and he played in the terrace. And it was like just, I don't know, like generally the club was not full, you know, the main floor was not full. You still had enough space to dance there. And he was obviously the main DJ in that time still. And the terrace was just a side room. There was not a lot of people, maybe 200 people there in the terrace. And Ricardo would play there every Monday, you know. There I got to really listen to him properly. That's how I got to know the DJ, Ricardo Villar. what's his style, what's the kind of music? And this for me was quite an impact and this for sure changed. So I'm like this eclectic mix. Sven was more like a hypnotizer, let's say, the way he was building his sets from zero, slowly, slowly, slowly, going to a peak over hours and hours. This is how I experienced it, which had a strong impact on me, but also the way Ricardo is playing. It also had definitely, like, it influenced me, like the music selection for sure. And the way he mixes and like the energy he brings with his way of playing somehow. How had you started to DJ before you went to Ibiza? Well, I think probably in my head I was already like... DJing before I actually started DJing because you know like I had like my friends and like I had some friends that were like DJing like hobby wise and I was always curious about the records that I liked I always knew the names of the records that I liked and I liked a lot so I you know like I was really into this and then when music was playing I was always like oh look now I would play this track for example you know I had these ideas, you know, what to play with the music that was playing. And then eventually my friend told me, why don't you try, you know? Like, why don't you? I think you would be maybe good at DJing. It was like, gosh, it's already so late, you know, I'm already like 26. And like thinking about it and then, yeah, why not? And my friend gave me like a turntable and mixer and everything. And I had a few records at home. I just tried, you know, and I had success quite quickly. You know, I could figure out how to mix very fast. Of course, I got curious about it and wanted to try more and more. And yeah, that's how it started. So how did it develop from there? When did you have your first gig and where and how did you start playing out? Well, I knew a lot of people, of course, in the scene, in the local scene. And some guy, he was doing parties at the bar. the boogie bar it was called and I don't know like he just said yeah but if you want to play there and I played that was my first gig I played there in the bar and I played again in the bar and then eventually Actually, I played in another party of his, like my proper party. And then actually one of the first DJs that got to hear me at that party was DJ Clay, which was like quite a figure here in the Berlin scene. And he invited me to play in Berlin. And like, you know, like slowly, slowly I got... gigs around and like I was going to Berlin actually quite often then. It slowly developed like step by step by step, getting more gigs because, I don't know, it seemed like people liked it. You told me before we started that you had a residency at a club called HD 800, right? Can you tell me about that and how that came about and what that club was like? I call this club like still, it reminds me very, it reminded me very much of. Robert Johnson in the early days also. They had very similar booking. They were bringing artists from Berlin and Playhouse and Swayzeck was playing there and all kind of cool English acts like Autècre playing live there. cool stuff. Michael Meyer used to play there a lot. When this whole Köln minimal sound came up, they came regularly. And this club had really also definitely a very big influence on me, like the music that I listened to there. Mufti was resident DJ there. Andy Baumegger, who is now in Panorama Bar. It wasn't a long time. And yeah, eventually I got to play there and they liked it and I got to play there again and again and again. But then the club soon actually had to close because the venue was shut down. unfortunately but it was a super nice place really good sound system how did having a residency there how long had you been djing and how did that help you form a style or change the way that you dj it was unfortunately not long enough that i could say it really like like it was a platform for me where i could really develop you know it was like I don't know, it was maybe like half a year that I got to play there. To be honest, I don't remember exactly anymore how long it was. But it was, I think, after maybe one or two years DJing. So then did your residency at Robert Johnson... Did that provide a platform for you to develop? Yes, it did. But also there I didn't play like super often. I mean, not that I played like once a month, maybe every other month or something like that. But this was definitely, yeah, it was a super platform. Because I also played in really good, popular nights. I had regular nights with Magda in 2005, about that. And then later I had regular nights with Ricardo also that I played. And of course this was the best platform I could have. It helped me a lot, for sure, to get attention from people. Because at that time he was... already like attracting a lot of attention not as much as now but like he was just club or ricardo ricardo and also the club it went hand in hand kind of you know yeah so that also does bring me to another part of your career which is it's not just djing you've also produced music yourself um when did you start to make music But I really, I make music very rarely somehow. Like my main thing is always the DJing. Now, for example, I haven't been making music since, I don't know, like three, four years. Why did you decide to start doing it in general? I don't know, because I was curious about it, like how it works, you know, and just like also trying to make some tracks and see how it... Yeah. Was it easy to make something that you were satisfied with? Of course not. Although I have to say, until the day now, I believe my best track, one of my best tracks, is my very first track. that I ever made. That you ever made? Did it come out? Yes. It came out on the Spanish label Cyclical Tracks. It's called In The Nook. And it got on like, Alan Allen used it for a mix CD, for example, like years ago. It was like, it came out in 2000, maybe in 2008. One side was Mara tracks, the other side was my track. Like very minimalistic. So Mara Tracks was your collaboration with Mayan Nadam. Was it helpful for you to work with someone else? For sure, yes. I'm not a person that sits down and reads manuals or watches YouTube tutorials. I can learn very quick and adapt when I watch people do things. Marianne was already quite skilled in producing with the computer. At that time, she was still producing digitally. And she showed me a lot of stuff that still now serves me. How did that collaboration come about? When did you decide to work together on tracks? It was very funny because we barely knew each other. I heard the track of hers that I really liked and I wrote her on MySpace. MySpace times. I wrote her on MySpace because I was looking for the track and I couldn't find it. She said, yeah, she has a copy for me. something like that. She had a copy for me. It was not out yet. I don't remember anymore. And we started talking and then eventually she said, yes, I'm going to be in Berlin. Hey, why don't we meet and make music? Like I asked her, should we make some music together? She said, yeah, sure. We kind of met and we barely knew each other. I brought like my little blue electripe, cork electripe. to our house and we just made a little jam together based on some loops that I had. in my machine and we added some stuff and actually like the first EP that we released on Oslo that the Mara track the first EP was like from that time like from our first meetings and what period did you make the record that eventually came out on Perlon or the track I think it was 2012. So the collaboration had already been going for some years? It had been going for a while, yes. She would always visit me in Frankfurt and when I was in Berlin I would also go to her place and we would always jam a little bit together and I would bring a machine or she would bring something. But now you're mostly interested in DJing at this point. It's not that I'm mostly interested only in DJing, but also when you tour a lot. I mean, if you don't have a routine, like with anyway, like going to the studio every day, which some people do and they still go gigging, but I never had that. And somehow... I don't know. The DJing also takes up a lot of time, you know, like I usually use a lot of time to prepare my music and then finding music and also have a private life. I have two dogs. What kind of dogs? They were actually, there were photos in the RA article. They're small, they're like small. Pekingese mixes. Like Stray Dog and Pekingese. Well, I'd like, now that we have a little bit of background on Vera, I'd like to pivot just quickly and do the same for you, Alexandra. We'll bring your voice in here. Can you tell me about how you, how the first time you went out and how you started clubbing? It was an isolated event. my first party in 2002. And it was a party with James Abiela in Space Club in Bucharest. And after that, I continued watching, let's say, an eye on the nightlife from the internet because there was a website in Romania that was covering nightlife and my problem was that I didn't have a gang, I didn't have friends that were interested to go out so it was I was in my early 20s and I was not having, I was looking for a group of friends to go out and Like everything really started in 2004 when I got for my birthday, I got a present of ticket to this open air party also in Bucharest with... Timo Maas, Raresh and Demos. And for me, that was like everything changed in that moment. I had so much fun and I still remember the set was such a trip through so many styles of music and house and techno and a little bit of electro. And it was also it was a long set. It was like five hours or something like this. I remember all night long. I danced so much. And from that moment, I had only one thing in mind. I need to go out. I need to find friends. I mean, I had a few friends, but I'm not so into doing it on a regular basis. So I continued my activity on this nightlife. websites, forums and on a smaller forum that I was chatting with other passionate people they decided to make a meeting So we met and there were only two girls, me and another girl at that meeting. They were mostly boys. And actually that girl, it's still one of my best friends up till today. And with her, I start actually the adventure. She was doing a column in a Romanian magazine. She was doing the clubbing column. So she was having like guest list. free entrance and I start going out with her every Friday and Saturday. We were going in Bucharest in Crystal Club, which was in the first year of existence. And I... My taste in music was, actually was not defined at all. It was, I was just, the main reason why I started clubbing was I love to dance. We were going from like lately midnight till the end in the morning and we were dancing all night. That was, for me, that was the highlight. I was not even... Of course I was paying attention to the music, but for me it was important that I would go and I would dance and dance and dance. Yes, exactly, dance. And still, up till today, I really think that the engine... Behind everything and me here in this point in my life is the fact that I totally love to dance and that was the most important and driving thing. And in those times... I had the chance to see some names and legends. I've seen Frankie Knuckles. I've seen Danny Rampling. I've seen everything, like super broad area of music from Dr. Cuccio to Sander Kleinenberg, Stanton Warriors, DJ Son, John Digwid. I never had the chance to see DJ Sasha. Sasha, it was huge in Romania in those times, but somehow I never had the chance to see it. And also I have the feeling that I would not like it. Liberge I've seen for the first time. Mr. C. I remember there was a party. There was a private party. This was like beginning of 2000, end of 2004, beginning of 2005. So somehow. a little bit, I start to choose what I like more. And it was less the progressive part, more the tech house or more electro. There was also the 2005 war. was a good year or Tiv Shvarts were super big and they were making a lot of remixes for everything and a lot of DJs they were playing their remixes and this like Liberage and Mr. C were among those DJs and I remember we were also like Raresh was doing the also the same it was one of the like the main not hits but Something like this. And I was more attracted to that part than and also the breakbeat part. always, the breakbeat part was always there. Then the progressive. And this is how it all started with going out. You mentioned Crystal Club in Bucharest. Is that still open? Yes, but it changed venue two times. This is like the third venue in which they moved. But they are here for a few years. I don't remember exactly, but already four or five years I think they're here in this venue. How many different clubs were there for dance music fans at the time that you started going out? Not so many. Not so many. From what I remember, there were some smaller ones. like really, really small because I remember when I was writing for Clubbing Mag that I was going to some breakbeat and drum and bass parties in like smaller, like basement kind of clubs. But big club, it was crystal. Before that, Studio Martin also was the main club. But I don't remember why in that period, I think in the period when I started to go out, Studio Martin was closed for a while or was closed for renovation or something like that. Because I went to Studio Martin. for kind of a reopening almost one year later after I started going out. So I think it was Crystal Club and there were, probably there were some underground parties that I didn't know about, but there were big parties with bigger names, mission parties that were, they were doing it in... World Trade Center this is like a big quite a big venue for events. It's not for events, but it's, yeah, it's a big venue in Bucharest. I only remember about Crystal Club and like much smaller, very small, maybe clubs and underground somehow. I, yeah, for me, it was, I was just like starting to swim in those waters. So I was not, no, I didn't know very well the, what was. the scene under. I feel that now when you talk when one speaks of clubbing in Romania there is an idea of what style of music you might hear and the vibe and the sorts of DJs that you might encounter and I'm wondering if it was already if that was already a perception. or if things felt more stylistically open and there was a different perception of clubbing in Romania. I think it was a different perception of the clubbing. Exactly. There was a much bigger variety. Now I think people kind of get used to having some parties every weekend, maybe a few times in a week. And there's, I think the level of the energy now, it's a little bit lower and people are maybe a little partying more introspectively somehow. and they kind of used to have something everywhere, not being so enthusiastic. But those times, I remember, like, everybody was so, like, into it. And everybody was like enjoying it and like hands up in the air and shouting. And there was like, I don't know, like now there's a lot like there's this backstage who's always full of friends. And probably I had the perception of being in the public, in the crowd in that times. And it was exhilarating sometimes. It was like energy was so... so much and I met so many people, most of the friends that I have today that are involved in the scene one way or another, I met them all on the dance floor. Everybody was on the dance floor and everybody was like... Patching, kids, kids, patching. So so I think I think there was more enthusiasm and more joy and a little bit more appreciation. And now today people get a little bit like they got used to it a little bit. So it's not the same. It's not so raw. It was such a raw, such a. how to say, authentic, such a strong feeling. And also, I mean, people were enjoying every clubbing opportunity much more somehow, appreciating it more, I think. And also probably not putting so much emphasis on the style, but just appreciating the opportunity of having an international DJ coming and playing. I think also, especially for international clubbers who might consider going to somewhere in Romania to club, that there's an expectation of a certain style of music that you'll hear or an association of a style with Romanian club culture. And I'll just name the word. It's minimal. of some kind whether techno house or tech house whatever you like and um there there is a an association of a distinct take on that style as well for romanians and i'm wondering if you noticed that happen in in romania like when did that become the The word. Well, I remember the first minimal, okay, the minimal sound appeared in Romania somewhere in the dawn of, actually in 2005, there were two Circo Loco parties. The first two Circo Loco parties in Romania that brought a totally changing sound, that the sound was more... The majority of the DJs playing, they were coming from progressive houses. And that was the main, the main, most popular, let's say, until now, until that moment. And the minimal started with this, Circo Loco parties. Also Radu and Pedro that were already Círculoco residents in Ibiza, they also they were bringing this mixture of more minimal with maybe more house. That's where it started then. The step forward into bringing more minimal and more techno sound was made by Sunrise, who in the clubbing, who totally changed, not changed, but brought a totally new range of DJs. And these were Le Cocoon DJs in the summer of 2005. They were doing it. They took, I think they took a huge risk. and brought most of the DJs from Cocoon, Rosser, and Richie Houghton, Magda, Steve Bug for the first time in Romania in the summer of 2005. Most of the parties were empty. I mean, most of the parties were, I don't know, Richie Houghton in Romania for the first time in August 2005. I don't know, there were 100, 200 people, something like this, like quite a small, maybe I don't remember well because I was so, also like so exhilarated by the party and the music and just dancing and not caring about how many people are around me. But there was a small crowd. Small crowd, but... kind of mattered in that moment. And from there, from there, everything also, like, things start to evolve. Then it was Luciano and Thomas Melchior. Then it was Riccardo. And from Riccardo, of course, everything just went, I mean, went crazy. It's just... We finally, there was a new sound in Romania, a different kind of music. I mean, of course, I would not put Riccardo, I would totally not put Riccardo in the minimal sound because his first set in Romania was super techno and there was a lot of techno in-house and, of course, maybe more minimal. some of his production towards the end of the set, but most part of the set was filled with so much house and techno, and it was... It was, wow, it was such a lesson of music, yes. So Sunrise is the crew that also organizes Sunwaves Festival, which happens twice a year on the seaside in Romania and is also known for booking many of the DJs that you just mentioned. Did you work with the Sunrise crew? Yes, after clubbing Meg. I started to work with Sunrise in 2006, like close to the moment when they had the event with Riccardo Villalobos' first time in Romania. That's when I started working with them, and I continued for about two years, two years and a half, almost three years. And I was in the team who put up together the Sunrise Festival. I'm very nostalgic looking back on how everything started and how small and from a nice idea to just take advantage of this 1st of May, which is a moment in Romania. It was already kind of on the map of clubbing. 1st of May, everybody was going to the seaside and partying then, but they were my smaller parties. There was nothing. bigger. Yeah, now it's, it grew up so much. So Sunways was a way to bring together a bunch of parties that were happening anyway. I think it was just taking advantage of a really good moment when people want to party and when people are coming to the seaside to party, to bring a tradition. to another level from my point of view this is what happened and it was the great collaboration between Sunrise and Crystal Club and it was also the first Sunways it was also had two nights with techno and more techno and two another night nights with still a little bit of the progressive sound. I remember, I don't remember exactly who were all the guests because there were four nights, I think. Two of the nights, one was with Marco Carola and one was with also Circo Loco and RPR. And the other night, there was a trio, the Sin Macielo and another two guys. I don't remember now that I'm so bad with remembering some names. But it was also like bringing... also some music for a different type of public and that was probably from the beginning the idea of Sano is to offer not only one sound to offer sound for more people for more tastes in music and that's how it continues until today there are more stages and there are different type of artists and different type of musing to sadists. and to make people from all sorts of areas happy. Had you already started DJing yourself by the time you started working with Sunrise and Sunwaves? No. First it was buying records. I was collecting music anyway from online and I was following music online a lot and I was already kind of... And since, even since working in Clubbing Megan, this is like half a year before, I was, I remember I was sitting at the office in Clubbing Megan, like listening to the new records that were out on decks and stuff like this. At one point, I just decided to start buying records because after my working hours at Sunwaves office. We were gathering together and most of the time we were going to somebody's home and my friends were, most of them, they were DJs at that time, and everybody was like playing one record and one record and one record. And I was thinking, I think I might want a record. myself someday and it was just this was I was never thinking yes I want to be a DJ no I'll have few records of mine that I want to bring with me and join this back to back to back to back to back at home on a Thursday evening. So that's how it all started. I started buying records and I started to practice while I was still working at Sunrise but at that time When I started to practice, the office of Sunrise was in a club, was in a session club, a long-lost former club that Sunrise had in 2007, 2008, in that period of time. That was a super nice underground club, and we had really nice parties there. For me, it's the milestone. That's where... I was going after the office hour. I was just taking my few records, going back in the club and just practicing. And there were all the time, like at sunrise, there are always like friends of mine coming, going, visiting. And there was Prisla coming and telling me a little bit of an advice and the word Cesar coming and giving me a little bit of an advice and, you know, picking a little bit of... knowledge from everybody passing by and I kept that's when I started practicing and starting to learn how to how to mix but still not not on a very serious basis it was just for me it was just like a hobby to do after work to just be able to maybe maybe after next week after we party we gather together again somewhere and I will be able to play that two, three, four records of mine. I think that's a common way for people to start DJing as well. And I'm interested in the process or the, I can't say a moment, but... how that attitude changes and when people start thinking of this less as a hobby and more as an opportunity for a career or for it to take up a significant part of your career. And I'm interested in how both of you have thought about that and how your idea of where DJing would fit in your professional life. how that changed for both of you. You start, I talked enough. I don't know, like, it was not like somehow like a conscious decision. It was like I always had a job and the gigs got more and more. And like for a while I would, you know, like during the week work and then on the weekend DJ. I quit my job or I got quit. in agreement with the employer because I was not happy there. And I had like a year of unemployment where I got paid basically from the state, but I kept DJing and it was the time where I like was able to actually focus more on it, you know. And I already had a lot of gigs and that was, you know, the time when it actually was like, I don't know if you call it coincidence or... It just happened in a natural way. I stopped working, had enough time, but also enough money to spend more time looking after the music and looking for music and focusing on DJing. And at that time also I got to travel already quite a bit and it got more and more and I didn't have to go back to work. Okay, was there a point where your career as a DJ was underway, but you wanted it to be different, like a different kind of career? So maybe there are different kinds of clubs that you would play, and there were opportunities for you to play in bigger rooms, and you chose a different sort of... Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay. Still not that well phrased. Hopefully people see what I'm talking about. I referred also back to this Art of DJing interview. I said something that there was a moment when I got to play more and I started playing for bigger crowds and in bigger clubs. And I decided I didn't want that. It's like I have to explain a little bit differently. It's not that I don't want to play for big crowds or anything, but at that point it got, you know, I had like gigs in Ibiza at that time, for example, I played in Circo Loco and the Monza parties that were quite big at that time. time and playing Ibiza you have this international it's more like a bit more it's more commercial you could say you know like the scene there and I got into the DC10 booking agency for example for Italy. And the clubs they work with, they were also kind of like more commercial. It was like lots of like 1,000, 2,000 people clubs. And I came from a scene where it was more like 500 people, 300 people. And you have to automatically play different for like a bigger kind of crowd and depending also on the crowd, the kind of people that go there. And for a while, I was kind of trying to adapt musically. on the circumstance because of course you want to serve the people you want to make people happy you want to make people dance and um and uh i think it kind of didn't work out so well with the music that i used to play before this whole like situation had changed a bit um it would not work out so well because people just wouldn't get this kind of music that i wanted to play and i felt I started feeling uncomfortable because I want to play the music that I feel. If I have to play something that I don't feel... It's kind of, I don't, I cannot do it somehow. I don't want to do it, you know. It's like, it's taking the passion away. It's taking the joy away from me. If I have to just be like some kind of jukebox or like some kind of entertainer and just play something for the other people. It's like, ideally I play something that I like and that I enjoy and this joy spreads to the... audience you know and yeah so at that point in my career I realized no this I don't I don't want this I don't want to adapt so much and like playing functional music and just you know I want to express something differently. And then I decided for myself that I'd rather maybe play smaller gigs. I just started playing again more what I liked, and it was a natural development in some sort of direction. But in the end, it was the right... thing because I think only if you stay true to yourself and really express something that you that that that is you it it will also pay off eventually you know like it's maybe a slower path you know like that maybe the progress like in your career would be like slower and smaller steps But still, it paid off somehow, you know. And how about for you, Alexandra? How did it change in your mind from a hobby to something that you might make a significant amount of your income from? I would go back to one question. I mean, the way that you put the questions a little before you started playing, when it changed from, yeah, not... not a hobby, but when it changed, when it became maybe my, I decided that it should be something that I'm going to follow. I had a few gigs in the beginning. This was like around two years after I started practicing, somewhere around 2009, I started to have very few small gigs. And in that year, okay, Sunways was still like Sunways. I think it was the fifth edition. So Sunways was, it was the first year I did not work for the festival. and I was just like having crazy fun dancing and enjoying the festival with no responsibility. And in those times, the night times were scheduled and the day times were not. So we were actually just kind of gathering. There was a gathering of DJs from the DJs that played one night before or something. It was nothing scheduled for the day time. I was there having fun and following up a joke. I end up playing. And for me, that was the moment that changed everything because it was the little gigs I had before. Okay, the first gig I ever had, it was a good party, but I was so paralyzed by nerve. I was so nervous. I was like, I could not. For me, it was all about like, I need to be able to mix correctly and okay, play the tracks that I love, but I have to mix correctly. And that was the first gig. So I could not enjoy the actually exchange of energy. But in Sunwaves, also because it was everything happened like this, like unprepared, nothing like I... randomly happened to have my record bag still in the trunk of my boyfriend's car from one week before because I had the gig one week before in Bucharest and we just kind of left the bag there instead of carrying it upstairs and I was just... I really like, it was such a nice vibe and I had like such a nice small, like very energetic crowd in front of me. And I just played the tracks that I love and I could send everything that I want to send through music. And it was everything. they were like two hours so in two or three hours so intense that I said I don't think I've ever been sure about something in my life that I'm gonna pursue this and although I'm not I'm paralyzed somehow by the fact that I need to be there in front of people and doing it I want to do it because I don't think there was something in my life to move me and to feel that I want to do this. I want to do this forever. I want to, I'm going to, from now on, I'm going to take it seriously. From until now, it was a joke. Not it was a joke. It was a hobby. It was something for fun, but it was never something serious. And that moment I said, okay, I think. I think I want to be a DJ. I think I want to do it professionally and serious and I'm going to preoccupy and I'm going to take it super seriously and I'm going to dedicate my life to it, to continue searching. the music that I love and I'm gonna this this is what I want to do I want to send what I feel from the music I want to send it to people and when they send that the exchange of energy that's what I always remember that's always I appreciate about what I'm doing the exchange of energy is something surreal for me like you send something to the people and it comes back it's the waves it's something like it's for me it's happening like in waves and you you just get the energy back and you you know that Some people felt what you felt when you listened to that track. This is DJing for me. This exchange of energy and this exchange of emotions. A lot of emotions and a lot of what I feel. Well, I think we've set a good stage now with both of your backgrounds to talk about how these two stories come together. So my question is, how did you guys meet? We were discussing this before and we kind of like tried to figure out how, I mean, when it was actually. Probably we were introduced and we like officially met in Sunrise Office. In Sunrise Office, when I came to Romania first time to play and she was like working at the office. And I remember her, like we started talking, she was like, Olexa. telling me about her guest list, this cox list of tracks that she was looking for. I said, wow, this girl has a good taste. Really, I was like impressed about her enthusiasm. But yeah, Alexander says it was a different moment that we actually met first time. I remember... But that's what I'm not sure if we were introduced then or we might have been introduced, but like super briefly. In the beginning of 2007, Raresh had his first gig in Panorama Bar together with Ricardo. And we were a group of 20 friends. went to Berlin and I remember after that after the party she was playing in an after party in somebody's apartment here in Berlin and I remember and also I think my young came at my aunt's party before and we went together then to panorama yeah yeah and then we we all and I did the one I also just hadn't met my young like about that time And then, yeah, I remember the big group of Romanians and their partner. But of course, probably I know you from the internet or from listening sets of yours. So just because we were working in Sunrise and we were digging as many DJs around this sound. So these days in 2018, you both run a record label together and have a party series at Club Divisionaire. Right. So can you tell me about how this developed from a casual acquaintance slash friendship into a business partnership? I don't know. I would say like over the years, we would. always meet in Ibiza. This was like the main meeting point. That's when we actually bonded more. Yeah, we were always hanging out together in the after hours. We even played together for the first time. Yeah, we played one time together in the after party, yes. And... And I don't know, we always enjoyed the music together, dancing together. Yes, and being also super into the music and thinking of that track and that track. Yes, discussing about it and everything. So we had this musical connection somehow. And then Alexandra also, when she started playing more, I also helped her to get gigs here in Germany a few times and stuff. And I don't know, it was like I said, we spoke about, I think it was in 2011 when we got this idea. Maybe a little bit later. Or was it 2013? That party was in 2013. Ah, then it was in 2013, sorry. Which party? It was a party on Hoppethorst downstairs. My first party on Hoppethorst. Hoppethorst Allstars, it was like me. Alexander Bin. It was a return party, I think. No, it was Hoppetoss All Stars. There's actually still like a set online, but that's why, you know, Hoppetoss All Stars. And where we played together. And at that time, like, I had like a bunch of tracks from Bin that I really liked. And Alexandra had like a bunch of tracks from Dan Andrei. And I had this idea of making a label, and Alexandra also told me that she wanted to make a label. At one point. At one point, and somehow eventually I said, why don't we make the label together? And you were the good idea. Yes, exactly. I would. I mean, I'm a lazy ass. I know myself. And I would probably I fancy the idea. But OK, before before we talk about it, I was fancying the idea of having a label. But I was not really seeing myself putting myself to work to to actually make it happen. It was like a nice plan. that I wanted for my future, but I was not really. And Vera was more decided about it. And actually, I think she made things. I mean, she was more, I don't know, she had a stronger will and not a will, but... Just for me, like you actually help it. You were the catalyst thing to make it happen for me. I would have postponed it forever. Yeah, it could have happened for me as well if I wouldn't have to share this with, you know, because otherwise it would have just stayed in my head. But like, you know how I am. All of a sudden I have an idea. Let's do this. Yes. So how long from when you first decided to do it to when the first record came out? It took quite a while. It took quite a while. We gathered music and we gathered music, but it took really long. Actually, the design part was the longest thing. Almost one year, I think. Yeah, it took us really long. Because from the moment we came up with the name... And we started actually the first part. We said, OK, we have a name. Until we managed to start the label, let's start the parties. And I think the first parties were under the name Meliflow. They were in 2014. Yes, but the first record came out in 2016. Yes. So it took... It took two and a half, almost three years until we actually got everything sorted. Also, it was a bit complicated, for example, the paperwork, because Exana is living in Romania and then doing a company in Germany. I mean, we did it the proper way. We do it officially. Some people just start the label and produce records. But we wanted to have everything sorted from the administration part as well. And the design, coming up with an idea, with a concept. It took us long to find the right designer also to work with. And this was the part that took longer. The music we had, like, the music was the smallest problem. Exactly. The music was the least of the problem. Was the fact that you had so much. music, unreleased music from friends and so on. Was that the reason that you wanted to start a label originally? Or why did you want to do that? Why do you start a label? Because you think you have something to say, you know, somehow like musically, like you think you might have something nice to offer. That's, I mean... For me, it was the extension of what I really love to do, to select. The thing that I love the most is to select music, and I think I could extend this to take it to another level. I'm not making music yet. I'm not making music yet. I start to be a little bit curious. get very little bit into it like recently but still I'm a DJ I will be always a DJ first of all and I was thinking that I don't see myself making music but there are so many other people that are making so good music why not bring make select music that was not released from all these young talents there are or new talents or even old artists that I know that make nice music I don't care it's just I fit myself much better in the role of being a curator and this is how I I see the label I keep keep the selection going so when you say that you felt that you had something to say with the label did you know what that statement would be like was there a concept for the style there was never really a concept which is like which I think which is like just the music that we love yeah just the music that we like and we like like all kind of different styles even though like some you know like was always described as minimal, which I find weird because I don't consider it like only minimal, but I don't know. Yeah, I think we're bringing or we try to bring quite eclectic music. Okay, it's shades of house and techno and electro and a little bit of minimal. There is a little bit of everything, a little bit of tech house, but I would not call... our label Minimal. We have very different, I think we have quite different releases style-wise. Before we wrap up, tell me a little more about Melaflow and what you guys have done so far with the party and the label, and also how you work together. What is your working relationship? Well, working relationship, we talk about it almost every day. We have little work meetings almost every week. It's very... I think we're taking all the important decisions together, especially the creative ones. Yeah, yeah. And then we have like, we try to spread some tasks. Like sometimes we're taking care of social media. I'm more like, for example, in the event organization, I'm maybe more like with the communication and stuff. But we're consulting and we're taking... decisions together like yeah everything that's important we take it together and this was how from the beginning yeah and we discuss stuff and we also sometimes you know like we have like maybe different opinions or I'm usually like I'm changing plans a lot Or like I am with the first exam and then I have another exam. Alexandra, why don't we do this? And I say, no, no, no. Come on, think about it. Yeah, sometimes I'm sticking more to a plan that we have and I'm more... Yeah, but the good thing is somehow we manage always, like we now know how to communicate with each other. Yeah, to find the right decision somewhere, even if it's somewhere in the middle. With the parties, it started from a very little party in Hoppetosse on a hot day of May, which was very hot. In Hoppetosse it was hot, it was very hot, although there were not so many people. And now we grew up to have regular dates. Plus, twice a year we have a big event that we make in collaboration with Closer Club in Kiev. which is a 30-something hours party, so it starts from Saturday till Monday. For these parties, we also consult and we advise with the guys from Closer, and we are trying all the time to bring all the artists that we like. We want to have all the DJs that we ever liked, even if they are not, maybe they never played in Hopetose or in CDV before. Maybe they are part of other, let's say, scenes. Or we are just trying to bring... all the people that we love and whose music we're enjoying. I think also one of our focuses was always like offering opportunities to people that are like talented, but don't get the attention so much. We are using our, you know, how you want to call it, popularity or whatever, our platform to offer platform also to. new artists as well with the label. It was somehow like that, not on purpose, but it turned out like that. We picked up on a few new artists that we found interesting. And also in the actual events, we proposed a lineup. that was maybe like no big names at all, but somehow it really worked out because they're really good DJs. And we have a feeling that people started trusting us, our taste, that they knew even if they would not know maybe the names of the DJs, that we picked them for a reason and they were curious about them. And that's why they come to our parties because usually there's a red line in the music. It's just solid DJs that are playing in our parties usually. What about Meliflo and Meliflo x Closer parties are unique to your party versus other parties at the same club, Hoppetasse or Club de Visionnaire? What do you bring to that venue, I guess? I don't know, maybe like some kind of female touch. I don't know. I mean... You're going to drop the F word this late into the interview? I don't know. What is so special about apartheid? I don't know if it's so special about... I can say like definitely the big party that we do together with Closer is especially, it's long. It has like, there's a consistency in the music. I have never heard anybody complain about any DJ that has been playing in the party. It was like a big vibe from the beginning till the end, which I find rare for a 30 or 30 something hour party. Plus. We introduced something that was big in the 90s that is slowly coming back, hopefully, and we helped coming back. It's the chill-out room. Yeah, so with Hoppetosse having those two floors, like we had this idea that, well, yeah, we should like, it's a long party, you know, we should give people the opportunity to relax a little bit, like hang out, you know, like just lay down, like look at the visuals, like listen to some like ambiental music to calm, you know, like calm down to just, you know, to relax. And people really loved it, I think. And now in February, it was super full, the jailout room, all the time. And you could have people really enjoying, like they're drinking a tea. We offered also food, you know. That's what I mean with female touch. Women are caretakers somehow, you know. Like we take care of the bunch that's around us. And I don't know. We're trying. have people to have a good time you know like and we are trying and I think we are trying to be okay the best host as we can we we want any of our guests to feel as we wish to feel when we are going to play for somebody and to feel welcome and taken care of and everything to just flow from like the organization wise and and also to offer this nice crowd. I think we managed to get together a crowd that's sending a super nice vibe. And it's also like, I think, especially in the big party in that goes closer and more flow. We put the lineup together in a way that is like putting all this kind of underground minimal names all together in one party. Like a lot of them that already made themselves a bit more. Some are just upcoming. Some have already established and they're like Nicolas or Bin. that are also close friends of ours, but then also like upcoming names like Quest or like Andrea or like, there's like, you know, like a button, we put them all together in one pot. And it's like this combination is attracting people from all over Europe that are interested in this kind of. music and this makes a special vibe because they're all the most of the people that come they're really into this music they're not coming for a hype or whatever they come for the music yes and all the all our guests are people who are deeply passionate and dedicated about music i think this is the the concept. People, all the artists we try to bring together. It's so pure somehow. Talents that are known or less known that are super dedicated and passionate about music. And the same with the closer guys. We share the same ideals, I guess, somehow. residents or also the organizers of Closer in Kiev. And yeah, this is maybe what's brought us together also. So then what do you have lined up for this year in terms of the parties and in terms of the label? The parties, we'll see. We have like now in April, we have a party at Hoppetosse. Then we'll probably have like one event per month in CTV in the summer. in August going to be the big event again the one was closer and you mean also like We are booked like as a Malifont Flow night also outside of Berlin. We have what they're playing in Lisbon, Electronic. Lisboa Electronica. Lisboa Electronica. It's a big festival taking place in Lisbon between... They're showcasing all kind of underground labels. Labels, yes. And it's like four or five days festival. Also like arts. music arts it's a big festival yeah we have a Meliflo night in Bucharest in guest house for first time and we have Meliflo night now in Rome in Goa club which is also quite nice And for the label now, well, we're probably not going to say everything, but the next release that's coming up is going to be a double from Space Travel. And we just had released like a little special series. We called it Season 1, Episode 1, The Medley Flows, which is like, it's not a sub-label. It's just like a special... a series of a few records that we're going to release from Federico Lichtmeier that has just come out just now this week. So we'll continue with more episodes? Yeah, we're going to have some more episodes and we have another three releases, probably four releases this year. coming up. And maybe there's a slight hint, maybe someday we'll hear an Alexandra record. Well, I am... Okay, I got curious, but I'm not sure I would like to be honest, honest, honest. I'm not sure I have any call to make. music like this kind of music that I would maybe play I would probably try to experiment actually really I would like to make hip-hop like negatives but this is like for me it's just like just an idea like what I would like to do I would like to do hip-hop I really like downtempo Okay, cool. I want to say something also about the production because before we left it kind of a little bit open and I feel like it sounded like I was not interested in. producing any more music or was like not really never my thing it's not it's not like that I actually I didn't stop because I didn't like it anymore anything there was like some situations in my life that changed you know I was putting more focus on the DJing because after all this like a feeling that was getting a bit commercial I wanted to find myself again and I put more focus on the DJing I was still making music at that time and also you know with my young I had this releases and this record that was One side was with Ricardo and the other side was a track of mine. Those were the last releases that I had. After that, though, there was like some private situations that brought my life into movement and change. And I moved twice. And somehow after that, well, I stopped a little bit. And yeah, and then like we started the label. And it's a lot of work also. And somehow I put it aside. for a bit and then I kind of you know like it was they're sitting there waiting for me to rediscover it you know but I'm also planning to make music again of course it's actually I'm in the process of preparing that okay well that's an interesting that's perhaps an even bigger open end but it's an exciting exciting note to wrap it up, I suppose, that there's roads open ahead. Well, thank you very much for joining me. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Thank you. you
