you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor of Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Dave Beer. He was the founder of Leeds Back to Basics Party, which is one of England's longest running dance music events. A notorious raconteur, Beer has been the life of the party for over 20 years, and has just landed himself a new venue called Church. Despite having recently shattered his ribcage, Beer was able to run through his story with Kristen Carpenter. barrel last week. How's your health at the moment Dave? Because you've had another accident, you've been in the rave trenches again recently, I understand. Yeah, well, I've come out of hospital. I've managed to shatter my entire rib cage at the back. I've got nine fractures, five broken ribs. Three of those have been broken in two places. But yeah, I fell out of a tree at the bottom of my garden because I've got an homage to Joe Strummer. I've built my own little festival Strummerville down there. So we've got a campfire because I love nothing more than sitting on a campfire. But I had fairy lights in the tree. But although the man den and the caravans in camouflage, you know, I thought it was a smart idea to put lights in the trees, which defeats the object slightly. Yeah, whilst taking them down or lowering them, my missus comes out and says, is it going to fall? And I'm saying, like, don't. say that being bullshit and the next day I know I'm in agony but I thought I've broken my ribs on many occasions you know what I mean so I just went to the doctors and just gave me painkillers for it but and I was playing with a primal scream opening up for primal scream and James playing the sets in between at Roundy Park in front of 9,000 people and I was like in total agony and I was just on painkillers and alcohol. Well, after the after party, I thought I'd better go to the hospital. Straight away they admitted me and said, you know, how on earth have you managed to... you know, survived the week, you know, considering that you've, the amount of damage you've done. And I was really lucky that I hadn't punched in my lung or, yeah, besides that, my health's perfect, you know. And it's not the first time, is it? Because a few years ago, you were in hospital for a week or two, was it, with a lung infection? Well, gosh, I was in a coma for 10 days about five years ago with pneumonia. So... Musically, you actually started out, I don't know if many people know it, being a roadie for bands like The Clash. Yeah, I wasn't actually a roadie for The Clash. I just ran away with them because they were my favourite band. So I was more like a pain in the arse, you know, to be too close. I managed to sneak into the gig, but then the security got me and threw me out. So I was still having none of it, you know. I was like there with red hair and a kilt and managed to shimmy up a drainpipe and through this window, which I'd noticed was open, and I felt like it was unbelievable because it was their dressing room and they were like, who the fuck are you, you know what I mean? I went, never mind who I am, you know what I mean? I know who you are and you're probably the most important thing in my life, you know. But anyway, please don't grass me up. The security are just about to arrive and they've already knocked me about a bit. So they hid me under the table and then after that the security came in and they said, no, we've not seen anybody. So they were like, right, who are you? So it was Joe Stummer and Simon and Mick Jones there on top of Eden. Like, I'm Dave, I'm Dave Beero. They said, well, how old are you? I'm like, 18. And they're like, how old are you? I'm like, 18. How old are you? I went, 17, 16. Come on, 15. OK, does your mum know you're here? No, so I ended up with her. And Joe Summer bringing my mum up saying, we've got your son. And she's going, well, you better bloody look after him. It was quite amusing, really, because they told me to go back home, which I totally ignored and went to the next night, which I think was in Coventry. That's when they sort of just said, no, not again, you know what I mean? Put me on the train the next day back to Leeds. under the proviso if I went back home and did my work and did what my mum told me to do, they'd let me go on tour with them. And so that's what I did and that's kind of why I'd sort of... It totally changed my life. If it wasn't for that band, you know, I learnt so much from them, you know. All my early learning, really, was from music. So what took you away from Clash and that sort of scene into house music? Well, I mean, I'd been touring, you know, from the age of... When I left art school at 18, that's when I moved away from home, moved in with... with Sisters of Mercy at the time, because I was like, you know, I'd outgrown punk. Punk had gone sort of sold out to an extent, which, like most scenes, when it sells out, you don't want to be a part of it, so... I was living with the Sisters of Mercy and then ended up roading with them. And then from there I went on with bands like, you know, Popularity itself, more sort of crossover, sort of sampling bands like Back Petal Emotion and then went on a world tour with them. I say a world tour. It was supposed to last a year with Bundy MC, Public Enemy. Eric B and Rakim and loads of other rap acts. I only lasted three months before I got thrown off the tour because it was at their stage when they were at their most militant and they were like, you know, Black Pampers and stuff. Professor Griff there with his, you know, black army uniform on and I'd be totally taken to Mickey when they came back. You know, he's totally taking the piss and going to play the flag because he had his cloak around his neck. And, you know, I just wouldn't let it lie, the time jokes, you know, going, hey, mate, hey, Flav, you haven't got time on your car, have you? And he was like, oh, man. And it just went on every day, so every day he'd come into catering and I'd probably exhausted. By the time we got to Belgium, we was three months in, I mean, it was quite a violent tour as well, you know, the crowd were, you know anti-Semitic, you know, in the opposite way, you know, it was like very strange environment, but, you know, I just kept going on about these time jokes, you know, like every second counts, and, you know, and the tour manager kept telling me off, saying, you know, look, it's got to stop, you know, Flavio didn't find it funny, and I'm like, okay, it's not like, you know, I don't mean to wind him up, Eventually, when he came into catering, I was on my final warning and Flav came in and I looked at him and he looked at me and I was like, silent, not a word this time. And everybody's looking at me to see what I was going to come out with. All I did was like... look at me watch and raise me eyebrows and everybody just fell on the floor laughing and they went, right, that's it, you're out. So I just said, oh, come on, man, you know, I'm really good. Fuck it, it was only a matter of time. And so getting kicked off that tour is what made you focus on housework? Yeah, well, I mean, I went then to America. touring with bands in America because I toured with a lot of bands you know and a lot of punk bands like the Ramones as well and when the gig finished obviously we'd packed the truck up and we'd want to go on somewhere so we'd go to parties and unbeknown to me, you know, the only things that would open were like kind of, you know, black gay clubs, you know, and like, you know, in places in like Detroit and, you know, like fall upon places like Paradise Garage and stuff and really early on in clubs like Save the Robots and I was listening to, you know, this music that I'd never heard before. But, you know, it kind of appealed to me, you know, just like... I kind of thought, wow, this is, you know, this music, you know, and it was like, you know, although it was sympathetic and at the time they said it wasn't real music, you know, it didn't have soul, which is absolute nonsense. I was lucky enough to experience it, you know, in about, you know, around 1986, you know, maybe. Early '87, I came back to England and we used to go to the Hacienda in '85 when nobody went, you know, '85, '86, nobody actually went to the Hacienda. My mate said, "Oh, come on, we're going to the act tonight." And I said, "Why do you want to go there? It's always dead." And he said, "No, it's having it." And Mike Pickering had started his nude night. So we went to the Hacienda insane you know just soon as i walked in there you know it was like wow you know the energy and the acid house thing that was going on there which was you know now famously known as the summer of love was the beginning of that whole acid house chemical generation scene and it was like i was just totally hooked up all right where do i sign up and that was me you know i was like It was like right time, right place. Whereas maybe with Punk I was just a little bit too early. Still there but not old enough to play a proper role in it. So how long was it after going to the Hacienda that you started Basics? Was it a direct influence on you? Obviously it's a massive influence on me and England had changed. We were also coming down to... Well, they called it the Magic Roundabout and the parties on the M25 ring road round London. So we'd come down, we'd go down for parties there and, I mean, the Blackburn raves were, it was just like amazing. The illegal scene at the time was just like, you know, lawless and it was like everybody... I've never, you know, seen anything like it. You know, you just thought like you were changing the world and as it turned out, we probably were. It was when the criminal justice bill was coming in around that time and the police riots and, well, the police busted everything really and it was time for this music to go into clubs so that's where Back to Basics came in, you know, in 91. and there was no music like that, we'd been to Ibiza. We'd come back and we'd met people like Charlie Chester and the guys that were doing flying. the boys' own lot, you know, like Terry Farley and Weatherall and what they were doing and the Love Ranch guys down in London and James Bailey in Nottingham. So there was nothing in our area for that kind of music because we were sick of that kind of, you know, that whistle-blowing, glow-stick-waving, wide-glove-wearing. you know, nonsense that was going on and everybody covering themselves in vics to bring themselves up on their knees and stuff. It was beyond me. And I heard that you met all 80 of the people who came to the first Basics Party on the door. You were turning away people with whistles and telling them to try harder? Yeah, we used to have a system. I mean, you probably wouldn't get away with it as much now, would you? I didn't get away with it then. We used to have a red and yellow card system and we'd stand on the door, me and Gary, in our kilts and leather trousers and things. And we dedicated it to those in long trousers and sensible shoes and it was two steps further than any other fucker. You know, so we just... It was more like, you know, come out of a punk rock, no-sell-out attitude. So we were like, somebody was not right, and we thought he was obviously a good kid, but he just didn't look the part. We'd just yell at him and say, sort yourself out. But then when, like, you know, the wrong elements came out, you know... football hooligans or, you know, people who were just not right, we'd just red card them, you know, and on many occasions I'd be threatened to be shot, you know, like gangsters from, you know, from out of town and going, and I'd say, well, you know, sorry, mate, you're red carded, you know. We're red carded, loads of people, including football players. And you mentioned Ali Cook there, and that's the guy that you started it with, and not long after, there was a tragic accident with Ali. Yeah. Can you talk about that? Yeah. It's still really hard to talk about, you know. It's like, it's one of those things that you never really get over, because he's my best friend, you know, from when we were kids. On our way up to Scotland, there was me, Ralph Lawson, and Ralph Lawson's girlfriend, sorry, and my girlfriend, my son's mum at the time. an alley driving the car going up to the sub club but we got to Carlisle and there's a really dangerous part of the road that goes from being on a dual carriageway to just a single two way traffic. Weather conditions were so bad. The rain was pounding down and we could hardly see out the windows, but it was totally sober. Well, Ali was... I didn't know anything, but we thought we were still in a dual carriageway, obviously. Well, Ali did, and we went round the corner and the next thing we saw was the headlights of an articulated lorry. Yeah, we hit it head-on and sadly we lost Ali and Jocelyn, Ralph's girlfriend at the time, me and my... my son's mum, we were in hospital for quite some time. I actually discharged myself to go to Alice Funeral, but yeah, it was crazy. I mean, in my time, it was the first kind of accident, I don't know, of its kind, you know. I mean, I don't know if there's been many more since. I mean, it's kind of odd when you think about the... And the chances of it happening, you know, are quite high considering, you know. But it sent shockwaves across, you know, the dance scene. And, you know, Ali was a really, really, like, special, very loved character, you know what I mean? It's like, again, you know, his whole approach to DJing was very... unique, he never like rehearsed, he didn't have decks at home and he'd be mixing in anything from you know old like public image records to things like DAF and industrial music alongside like like techno tunes to, you know, songs like Esperale. There was all sorts of mash-up. Webber all said if Ali Cook had lived, he probably would have changed the course or the sound of English dance music. Is it fair to say that his memory lives on in basics? Is that memory of him and what you set up originally something that's inspired the night and kept you going through the last 25 years? That's the reason why we never changed path, changed course. That's why we've always stuck with the original ethos and the original no-seller attitude of not going down that brown nosing. corporate record company route. So, you know, that's why we always refused sponsorship. You know, we'd sell merchandise. We never considered ourselves a brand, you know, and because Ali wasn't there anymore to have those discussions, you know, should we do this or shouldn't we do that? when the old super club was blowing up, that kind of scene, you know, and clubs like Cream and Ministry of Sound and later Gatecrasher, these sort of places, and Renaissance, I just refused to be a part of that. We were just like back-to-basics sponsored by Fuck All and we've like totally prided ourselves on staying deeply rooted in the underground. As well as paying homage to some of the greats and old past masters of house music, we're always looking for cutting edge and fresh talent to keep it exciting. In that respect, you've always stayed loyal to quite a core group of residents. Was that always the idea from the start or is it just something that happened naturally? Yeah, totally. I mean, you make your mates, you know. To become a basics resident, you know, is virtually impossible unless you've really got something about you, you know. And what is it that you think Ralph's got as your longest standing resident? He played the first record, right? Yeah, he did, yeah. I was trying to remember the other day what it was and for the life of me it keeps slipping away. But yeah, he played the first ever tune. Ali introduced me to Ralph at a night that he used to do. I think it was called something like Clear or Bubblegum. I can't remember. But he was the perfect kind of... He played a kind of music that was not, you know, the same as Ali's, but, you know, but real quality house music and quality. You know, everything about Ralph is set standards, so he was obviously going to be the perfect resident. Yeah, Ralph and Ali were the first two residents, along with Martin Lever, who told us that we'd never work again when we fired him after the first week, which is quite ironic, now residing in the where-is-he-now files. And talking about that first week, can you remember what the vibe and the atmosphere was like at those early parties? Was it much different to today, do you think? Oh, I mean, what we were doing was totally different and unique in itself, you know. Although we'd taken inspiration musically from what we'd seen, say, people like Alfredo in Ibiza doing that Balearic sound, which people tend to think Balearic means something like, you know, acoustic guitars or something like that these days, or, you know, on bongos, but, you know, Balearic was more about... playing lots of different styles and a big mash-up of different kinds of tunes. And we were also just a kickback to the stale kind of rave scene at the time. So what we were doing and the way we looked was totally different, even down to our design. You know, using the punk rock imagery that we used, you know, from Jamie Reid and plagiarising some of the ideas from that, you know, using the Queen's head and getting pictures of Elvis and putting cocks on him and stuff and just, like, the total sort of anarchistic sort of approach to the way we were doing things, the way we were and the way we looked and acted. But the energy seemed to resonate with so many people at the time because something had to change and change is good, you know. Everything needs to change after a while. You mentioned some of the flyers there. The Queen's Head's really iconic. done your own take on sort of coke slogans and stuff how have you got away with it have you ever got in trouble yeah we know but you know it's kind of just you know it's normally a slap on the wrist you know um i think when i did the one that um had the the nun been taken from behind by the monk and it just had no beating about the bush I got into a bit of a bother about that one. Who with? Well, it was just some religious group. We just said sorry, you know, obviously. I mean, the Queen, we've always got away with that in England, but when we went to America with it, I had her sat with her tits out, sat on the toilet. And the Americans were just totally outraged by it. And that was when the local authorities came down on us and we nearly got kicked out of America for it in Oakland, which in the Queen's got nothing to do with America. How important are the people inside the club as well as your own attitude? Is it possible to have a utopia where everybody's welcome? I mean, you've talked about the strict door policy. I mean, the strict door policy was like, I mean, which is something that's going to happen again, but in a totally different kind of way. You know, back then it was... It was a totally different reason. We wanted to keep the football hooligans out, for instance. That's why we started in a gay club. We wanted people to come for the right reasons and come get dressed up and come for their night and be psyched up. for it too, they'd have the right energy rather than coming straight from the football match in the afternoon pissed up but the energy and the attitude of the crowd, everybody the timing was perfect for Back to Basics then as it is now for the newer angle on it with churches like good things come to good people There's been a big change and everybody seems to look the same or do the same dance these days in clubs. There's a lot of pushing and shoving going on and not a lot of individuality and I want to promote that so people can come and express themselves and do their own dance. and wear what they want, you know, even come in the mum's frock without fear of persecution or ridicule, you know. So it's not so much it being a cliquey sort of door policy, you know, but we're not just going to let everybody in just for bums on seats. It's not about money. Clubs are too crammed these days. They just get as many people in as they possibly can. cattle prod them all over the place, nick the gear, you know, tax them, kick them out, you know. The overall cost of it, you know, it's like, you know, to me, they're creating a society of, like, handbags dealers and drug dealers, you know. I don't know how a young person, you know, can really afford to go out. You know, going out on a weekend should be a release, should be fun. It shouldn't be something that you're worried about. How are you going to get the money together to... afford the entrance and you know your bits and bobs that you need for your for your lunchbox when you go out on a night and um the taxes you know over pricing everybody when they're leaving venues i mean it's it's insane you know i mean you know you need at least 100 pounds per person to go out on a night out now you're going out every you know, every week, you know, that's a lot of money, you know, so it's... It's kind of mad when you think about it in that extent. I think the DJ bidding, the bidding war on overpriced, overrated, over-eared DJs, at some point that has to hit a wall and stop. Is that one of the reasons why you've stuck to quite a... As well as your residence, you've stuck to quite a core group of DJs over the years? Basically, it's not really a party that will... book the latest hot guy you know you've got quite a specific pool of DJs it tends to be if it's the latest hot guy we tend to sort of stop booking them you know we've prided ourselves on finding them first for instance and the ones that we did and still recognise that play for us for a much better price you know even when they've blown up you know to superstar status you know The door price hasn't really changed. I mean, it was a fine book when we first opened, but 25 years ago, but it's been around £10, 15 max, you know, like 15 years at least, you know what I mean? It's crazy, really, but, you know, I refuse to... be a part of that system. I don't want to be a part of that. It's not about ripping people off, it's about giving people a good time. And I feel guilty. I used to have this Mercedes before I got banned from driving, but I never had the hood down, you know, because I'm just in town, because I didn't want to be giving it to Barry McGuigan, you know, driving around giving it the biggin' in my Mercedes, you know. I think very much Basics is a working class party and it's, Tristan said to me, another resident, Tristan Nakuna, that it's as much a working man's club as it is a youth club for the kids. Again, that comes from the clash for me, you know, that kind of working class hero, that, you know, working class people doing good from... the love and the joy of music. It's not really about the class system, you know what I mean? I've got friends from, you know, homeless people to people that, you know, the grandsons of prime ministers, and everybody's welcome to the club, but maybe we should start playing darts and having dominoes and stuff in there. Sometimes it's got a bit laddish, but I think Clubland in general has become a bit more like a boys' club. which I think is a shame because a lot of girls don't feel safe. Well, not so much safe, they just get pestered too much because there's not enough girls to go around, which is something else that I'm hoping to change with the new venue by making it a much safer environment. There's going to be certain rules. So now would be a good time to talk about that. It's called Church. It does what it says on the tin. It's inside a church. It is inside a church indeed. And the strangest thing about it is it used to be called St David's. It has been a nightclub before. It was a student club because it's quite close to the university. Nobody's ever really been in it because it wasn't that good. And who are your partners in this? Because you're doing it with... Yeah, well, it's Aaron Mellor who... who owns Digital in Tokyo Industries in Newcastle, from Tuk Tuk Palace. But he's partnered with Peter Rook at the Hacienda. It was like talking to Aaron and Peter Rook at Howard Marks' funeral, how it came about. And I'm a strong believer in, you know, when somebody passes away, especially when somebody close to you passes, that there's another angel looking over you. And I've been looking for a venue for two years. And I was awake, I was talking to Peter Oaken, he was saying, have you been talking to Aaron about the new venue? And I was saying, yeah, I got a call, and he said, well, what do you think about it? And I'm like, and I realised it was St David's, and there's been a lot of synchronicities that have gone on. You know, it's really strange, synchronicities, you know, the fact that I've even got a band called The And even my tattoos look quite religious, even though I'm not religious. And all sorts of really strange, I don't believe in coincidences, but lots of synchronicities have kept happening that are almost like... hard to believe, you know, so I'm just going, looking up at the sky and going, okay, whatever it is you want, I'll do it. And it's going to be more than just a club, right? It's going to be an academy? Yeah, I mean, this is an idea that I've had for such a long time I wanted to do is like a music academy. I mean, I used to be a strong believer in those that can do, those that can't teach. But, like, I disagree in that now. I think it's those that can, you know, should teach, you know, and pass on the knowledge, especially in, you know, in dance music. And the fact that I know I've seen these courses going on at music colleges, which I couldn't believe when I first did it, I got asked to be a guest speaker at one of these places. 30 kids sat in a classroom all, you know, there to become, like, you know, DJs. I couldn't quite believe it. I was saying to them, well, you know, this is not the right environment. for that, you know, so I mean, it's a long story really. I found out about a young black kid that had won a scholarship to a music college, which I won't name, and on Enrollment Day he was there, you know, buzzing obviously, and he was swaggering down his hood up and his pants around his ankles as you do. And the security wouldn't let him in. And they were saying, like, what are you doing here? I'm here to be with Noel. So there was a bit of a tussle on the door and he got his windpipe, you know, so he blacked out. There was a security act, we were restraining him. And he ended up coming round in hospital on enrollment day and I was so outraged by it. I just thought that sort of shit is just ridiculous. Why should it be just for a certain group of people, that privilege, if you've got the money or a grade two piano qualification? So I just thought, well, where's the justice in that? It's like, surely... People with talent shouldn't be able to get into these places anyway, so I just said, right, that's it, I'm going to open my own music academy and learn the basics from back to basics, as well as getting a degree, which you can get a degree the same as you would at any other university or music. you know, I'm going to give classes away to, you know, less fortunate people, people who... you know, dysfunctional backgrounds or, you know, people that don't have the money or, you know, disabled kids, you know. I don't think it's fair that, you know, if it's down to, you know, the colour of your skin to where you get taught music, you know, like, you shouldn't have to go to be taught in Chapel Town, you know, in some community centre, you know, like, by an ex-con that you... to be a DJ or, you know, disabled kids shouldn't have to get on special buses and special places to learn either, you know what I mean? It should be a mix of everyone, you know, because... Just because you've got wonky legs doesn't mean to say you've got a wonky head. Not that I think it's a bad thing that there are these places. I mean, it's a good thing that there are these places. My vision and my dream is that I can have all these people mixed up together and that'll be a great melting pot and probably the next generation of you. you know, artist musicians, you know, your next Vivian Westwood, your next, you know, Cal Cox, your next, you know, Damien Hirst and so on and so forth. All the best bands that I can think of have always, like, been a mixed match of people that become mates from different backgrounds and got together and, you know, youth movements have always come out of the underground. and always come out of, like, you know, that melting pot which nightclubs have always provided. That's why I think what's going on in the governments is absolutely outrageous, you know, having another clampdown again, you know, as they did back in the criminal justice bill and what's just gone on with fabric. It's disgraceful. Have you found that with church and also with Basics over the years that it has been you against the establishment? I wouldn't say the government. It was more against the record company. That kind of pop industry and the commercialism of music rather than against the authorities, although the police would bust all the... parties that we were throwing illegal parties so you know we stopped doing them and went into clubs but we've not been it's not an anti-establishment in that direction better to work with them and against them you know because that's a war that you're never going to win anyway even if you did want to go against it there's a cusp you know amongst you know there's an air of discontent from from clubbers as well, you know, now they want something new, they want something fresh, but, you know, I'm hoping that, you know, my answers about what might have been going on with Fabric, you know, and the closure of other clubs across the country is... It's not, you know, again, another way of culling a scene that maybe is looked upon in the wrong way because far too often, like, dance music gets bad press, you know, but, you know, Acid House and dance music has done more for young people and bringing people together and stopping, you know, racial issues and... football violence and there's so many things about bringing people together and actually you know spreading the love than any other institution I can think of. And basics or is it you specifically have actually been recognised in that way by Leeds Museum is that right? Yeah yeah yeah I mean Leeds is great because we've got you know a forward-thinking council you know we've And, like, Lorna Cohen, disco granny, we used to know her, and she looked into the licensing laws and realised that as long as we, you know, establishments didn't serve alcohol, they could stay open longer than 2 o'clock. And back then, everybody pulled onto the streets at the same time. And obviously everybody was guzzling the drinks down as quick as they could and everybody's coming out onto the streets pissed up and there's a lot of violence and inner city places weren't safe. So she set standards by giving dance clubs late licences and obviously for reasons unknown to anyone, a lot of these establishments didn't need to drink. late on until the early hours of the morning. In 25 years of parties, what have been the biggest challenges as you look back? You know, somebody said to me, like, oh, it's amazing that you, like, you've survived it, you know, and it's like, survived it? What do you mean survived? It's not... I haven't survived anything, you know what I mean? It's like not even being a challenge, you know. It's like, obviously, there's been, you know, challenges. It's been a rollercoaster ride, you know, up and down, losing venues, gaining venues, you know. Because I just live and breathe what we do, you know, like all our guys do. the DJs, you know, and it's like, it's everything to us. So, I mean, really, I suppose it's more of a challenge as far as, you know, the people around us, you know, like our families that have to... to put up with what we do and, you know, and how staunch we are and the way we go about it, you know, because, you know, I risk everything, you know. Back to basics is my baby, you know. Always has been. And like any parent, they'll do anything for their kids. And in more than 1,500 parties, I think it is, what have you learned about what it takes to make a good party? What are the key? ingredients would you say? I think to make a good party you have to be ready for a party because you want to have a party I mean the old idea of a party is having fun having a good time you know and I think that's what tends to have disappeared a little bit you know I think if you want a good party you have to start with the love And it has to be about love, not money. It has to be. It's what you want to do, what you're into, and that's totally essential. And then it's down to your crowd. Obviously music is quintessential to it, but also having a good crowd, it always comes down to that. I say a perfect crowd would be like, you know, well, for me, it would be 50% female, 30% straight men and 20% gay men, you know what I mean? That would be a perfect crowd and a great party. Having an eye for detail, you know, and making sure it's a... You know, it's like a party, it's like an aeroplane journey. You know, it needs to be right from take-off to landing. When you approach a club, you know, it's nice to be welcomed into it and then start off on the runway and get up to about 30,000 feet, get peaking and then bring it back down again and have a safe landing. and send everybody home safely. Like you say, their basics has always been about the love rather than the money. Do you think there is a place for a professional slick run party with really great graphics, or do you think that that belongs somewhere else? Well, you know, times have changed. Obviously we're having to adopt new ways, and change is good, and I can learn as long as... You're never too late to learn certain ways. Some of the old ideas maybe that don't serve me as well now. I've had to... I've changed, you know. I mean, I found myself in a jungle. I found myself in the Amazon and I was there. And I went and lived there for a month, you know, in the middle of a jungle and we were shaming, doing ayahuasca. That time in my life was probably just about perfect timing, you know, in me, just as I was about reaching 50. And it was like, that in itself was like, if not life-saving, was life-changing. And I came back out of that jungle, you know, a totally different person. There's only so long you can go on losing money, you know. and not advertise it. Sometimes I wouldn't even advertise parties just for the sake of the artwork. But it's not just me at stake there. There's other people. You have to pay people. And sometimes there's nothing worse than having to go to a DJ and say, you haven't taken enough on the door to sort them out and you're having to sort them out later. And that's when your kids have to go hungry because you're still having to pay off things and debts from throwing parties. So I have got a team of people around me now that are coming together, that we're putting together, that are really good at social media. And it is something that we're going to endorse and take on board. I think you have to move with times as we do with technology. I think you will always remain basics and basics will always be you though. Do you feel an expectation to be the sort of the figurehead of the party every weekend? Because people often say that it's not the same when you're not there. I mean, like again, you know, something else that I learned, you know, I went into the jungle, maybe a prison of my own identity, you know. For instance, if everybody said, come on, Dave, let's get out of here, here's the party, I'd just go along even if I didn't want to. I went in as Biro, which I still am, but I found David Michael Beer again in there, and I came out kind of almost... I felt like a toddler, like a newborn baby or something. I felt like the master of my own destiny then, rather than the prisoner of my identity. Back to basics is... I don't know, Peter, that's not really for me to answer. People say that to me, it's not the same without you, but I don't know about hanging my boots up as such, because I enjoy... I've been the other side of the decks now. The reason why I didn't DJ as much, a lot of people don't even realise how much production I've done. I've worked with David Bowie and Chrissie Hynde. I've probably got about two albums worth of music, things I've recorded with people like Robert Owens. I've not even released, I've just made music. What sort of role... Were you in those collaborations? Were you the producer? Yeah, totally. It's all my music. I wrote the songs, produced the songs. So, you know, I often work with different engineers, you know, I like to work in a similar vein to, like, say, you know, Phil Spector did, you know, back in the day, you know, like building that wall of sound. But, you know, I think by becoming a part, becoming into character and, you know, and having a... and knowing exactly what you want to create, but then people say that if you don't engineer it yourself, it's not your music, which is nonsense. It's like just because you've got somebody doing the technical side of it, which you understand, really doesn't mean to say that you can't get... You know, well, if they do it quicker than you, you lose ideas if you're having to look up on YouTube how to, you know, gate something. If you've got somebody that's really good at engineering and is clever at engineering who's not generally a songwriter, why not do a collaboration with them? And, you know, I find that... I'd rather be pulling out samples or playing instruments and finding sounds and using those and manipulating them, as we do with our artwork. It's the same with me and Nick. I give him the ideas, give him the images, and he puts them together for me, because I don't know how to use Photoshop, but I know exactly what I want as an end result. And talking about production, we're sat here in a very nicely well-equipped studio, your house, which many people might not know that you've got. How do you link with musicians to work here? Do you go out and look for them and get them in or do they come to you? I mean, Ricky from the Kaiser Chiefs, you know, did... I tiled my bathroom for some studio time and I've been trying to find him. When he was on The Voice, I was like, Oi! You know what I mean? I said, John, my bathroom's falling to pieces, mate. You know what I mean? You're hanging out with Tom Jones and Kylie and that, you know, are you going to get my bathroom fixed? And which he agreed to do, you know, but he brought Tom Jones to my 50th birthday party, so... I mean, I let him off a bit after that, you know what I mean? But, you know, no, I mean, like, what we do here, it's a live studio. We've done a lot of people like Coon Bailey Bay, a lot of Indiacs like, you know, Pigeon Detectives, local... indie bands and now Bob is a great producer he's doing a lot of punk stuff and it's not you know it's a it's a more of a a band studio than it is like although we have a mastering suite and we do finish off tracks now you know it's mainly predominantly you know a band studio you know i don't have a lot to do with that you know getting the bands in here you know bob does all that who manages it so if you've always had one foot in bands guitar music what is it that keeps you coming back to house is it the one foot in the waves is it the people and the party as much as the music itself Totally. I mean, it resonates for me. It's always Asden, Thought of the Floors. It just works for me. I love that plagiarism of it, the sampling, the stealing. I hear people complaining these days about re-edits. I think that's insane, you know, about putting your personal imprint on stuff. It was never there in the first place. All music's been taken from somewhere, be whatever style it is. There's no such thing as an original idea. It's always been influenced by something else. They blamed Elvis for stealing black music. He didn't steal it. inspired by it. And so going back to basics and to put you totally on the spot out of 1500 parties is there one that sticks out or two that sticks out or a particular moment or after party? I mean it has been one big party although there's been its low points but there is a couple you know I mean obviously I mean there's a couple at the first club I mean I remember when Danny Rampling first played and I was looking down at the balcony. at the crowd and you couldn't get on the balcony. It was just me up there. And I was looking down thinking, fuck, wow. And the DJ, Ralph, was playing in a truck. And then on the first birthday, we had a roadblock. I remember looking out of the window with Charlie Chester, looking down on the street and it was just total mayhem. That was amazing. And you've had some... people who have gone on to be pretty massive, like Daft Punk. Yeah, well, that's another party that was amazing. When we first brought them over to England, we had Daft Punk in one room, Goldie in another, and I think it was either Norman J and the Jam MCs or something in the other room. And that was, like, phenomenal. I remember, like, my mum and Goldie getting on like house on fire, you know. She said, oh, the bloody hell are you? And he's there dressed head to toe in gold and his teeth and his jewellery. She's going, he said, Goldie. And she went, well, that bloody makes sense. But that was a great party, you know what I mean? And, yeah, you know, Basement Jacks again, phenomenal, you know, it's just great just to have been a part of what they do. Again, when we gave the homework album, it was Dave Clark from SOMA in Scotland and myself, come back from Paris and met Gustav Punk. really speak english then and they were listening to the funk you know and going what the is and it was you know and it's like well what's your name it's like that punk man oh out where that punks you know where the dad punks and it was like well do you want to come back to england so we brought them back and we'd given us a cassette of the homework album I can't remember if it was David Patton doing it by himself. It was a bit vague who told Caroline Provero and gave the cassette to Virgin. We should have asked for like 20%, but we didn't ask for 1%. So 1% off that could have been retired probably. Have you ever tried to get them back? Yeah, they could have been back. They have been bad, but it's impossible to have bands, you know, of that size, you know, play now. I mean, they do a different thing now. It's not as if they're DJs as such, you know. They've come under different guises. I mean, when they do come and play to, you know, somewhere local or at a festival, they always phone up and say, you know, put me plus 50 on the guest list or whatever. And, you know, bands like Basement little sneaky freebies which is great because when I told them how big they were going to be they didn't believe me you know you'll be too big to play for me in a year's time but you're not really big believers basics in big guest lists and celebrities are you because you've turned away a fair few yeah I think it's great to do it I mean we don't give a fuck really people are people you know you know that kind of VIP celebrity status thing means nothing to us you know I remember for kicking Cantona out of the club you know for He'd go, ooh, actually, as he fell down the stairs as we booted him out for nipping some girl's arse. And, you know, like, you know, Galliano nearly didn't get in because of the shoes he was wearing. I think Gary thought he was wearing them ironically, so he let him in. But I think a great story I heard once about Martin Fly from ABC turning up at... And at the end of going, excuse me, excuse me, walking to the front, going to the bouncer's, my flight, ABC. The bouncer just went, smacked him straight in the face, knocked him out and up all those billion. You mentioned Gaz there and he did the door every Saturday. for 20 years? Yeah. How important a figure is he in the history of basics? Oh, totally. You know, Gary's been at the club more times than I have, but he had for 20 years. He retired, I got him a gold watch, but, like you would when you finish a job. But one year I got him a samurai sword, which I had engraved saying, for duties above and beyond the call of duty. I mean, it was very stringent, you know, to get past him. And yeah, so obviously it was crowd control. And so if Gary dare retire, do you ever think about it? Could the party live on without you? Would you let it live on without you? Yeah, totally. I mean, if it had its own energy, you know, yeah. My daughter's like, she's 16, she wants to have her own festival. I don't know if it'll be Back to Basics, but she loves it, and so does my son. I can't imagine stopping ever doing Back to Basics. I think even when I'm 90, I'll probably at least do... You've got to have a party once a month at least. You don't stop dancing because you're old. You become old because you stop dancing. So looking ahead now, there's been many iconic birthday parties. You often have a theme. Can you give us any details about the 25th? Is it such a biggie? Yeah, well, I mean, I think, again, seeing the Queen's always been at the forefront of our imagery and we've always been at the... gone end of our jokes. again we're going to in the same vein we're going to have a silver jubilee as the Queen had her silver jubilee street parties in 1977 which most people won't remember but they had buntings across the streets all across the country and all the people came out of their houses and had these parties with cakes and pop for the kids which then turned into a party at night for the grown-ups. So that's exactly what we intend to do, do something for the kids in those three. and give them away, you know, get loads of people to donate software and bits and musical equipment for the kids, give them cake, and then in the evening just have a full-on debauched rave. And that will be the official opening of church as well, right? No, no, the official opening is going to be on the 8th with Damien Lazarus, which is kind of weird, again, talking about the synchronicities, you know, Lazarus in the Bible. which I didn't know too much about the Bible until recently, but Lazarus with the resurrection, which was again accidental, but it's kind of fitting that, you know, Damian Lazarus is doing the resurrection and a batch of basics as such at church.
