Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is Jesper Dahlbeck. The veteran Swedish producer sat down with Aaron Kooltade, our news editor, in London recently to chat about his alias, The Persuader, which he recently dusted off after a 16-year hiatus for a new album. There's loads of history here. Jesper and Aaron cover the Love Parade, and the cult label's feck. And artists like Adam Bayer, Carrie Lakebush, and Tiga all make cameos in the narrative. You can sense that Dahlbeck is as surprised as anyone else by how much ground he's covered. over the course of his decades-long career. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. Jesper Dahlbeck, up next on The Exchange. 🎵 ♪ ♪ On your new album you revived the Persuader alias after a 16 year break. Tell me how that came to be. Yeah, it's a pretty funny story. There was a couple of guys from Paris who had these Sunday parties. called Concrete and they wanted to book me to play for one of their parties but they wanted me to play as the Persuader which is an old alias that I used a long time ago and first I thought the idea was pretty horrible actually But then after a while it kind of sunk in that it was actually a pretty interesting idea to sort of revive that project again. So I went there and played and also I gave them a record and it was released as The Persuader on Concrete, the label. And then I started to do more and more music. And yeah, it was a good decision because a lot of good music came out of that. Like lots of good inspiration from the past together with the present sort of. And why do you think your initial response to that request was one of, you know, you say you thought it was a horrible idea at first. Why do you think that was? Well, I mean, I'm not so keen to maybe revive everything I've done. And also when you sort of close a chapter on one project, it's sometimes kind of awkward to open it again. It's sort of, you start to write an alternative ending to the book, sort of. So you had considered the Persuader chapter close? For me, it was closed, but then I was actually persuaded by my agent. And when I started to do the music, it felt very natural. So that was good. So going back into the studio to record as The Persuader, how did you go about making it a Persuader record and not a Jesper Dahlbeck record or a record under another one of your aliases? Well, it's a little bit about also the, I guess, the studio technology that I used at the time. It's now kind of... also making its way back to the studio but with new technical possibilities obviously that makes things that was quite hard to do in the 90s quite easy now actually. So the recording process was very fast, but I used kind of like my old way of, you know, working in the studio with old equipment and old glitchy synthesizers and stuff like that. But I could use the computer now and really, you know, edit out what I wanted to use in the end. So that was the big improvement. So kind of... I guess getting the best of both worlds. Exactly. The Persuader alias, well, the name of the alias seems to be a nod to Roger Moore. You're a fan of Roger? Well, at the beginning of the 90s, they aired, first they aired The Persuaders with Roger Moore and Tony Curtis, and it had an awesome theme. It's sort of a Moog style intro. And then also they aired on Swedish TV The Saint, which is also Roger Moore. And I just kind of liked the whole atmosphere of the show, you know. And then for some weird reasons, I made a modeling job for a shoe company. Some really awful shoes. It was kind of a lousy payment, but part of the payment was a rather nice print of me listening to a watch in this kind of like, you know, English jacket or something. So we took that picture and put on one of the first... Perseid records and I mean the only text that was on there was just what's the time is the Templar well not track names or nothing I wanted to ask you about that that sleeve actually, because it's kind of awesome. Yeah, for the new album that I did now, I actually did a kind of reactment of the old picture. So I found almost the same gear and we tried to imitate the picture. But this time, instead of looking down, I'm actually looking into the camera. And the album itself is named after, well, it gets inspiration from the Stockholm Archipelago. Yeah. Tell me a bit about that. And in terms of like, obviously you've lived in Stockholm or near Stockholm for a very long time and how that's kind of fed into what you're making musically. Yeah, it's a kind of special... environment. It's just outside the city of Stockholm. It's kind of like a big area of just small islands. And some of them are a little bit bigger and have people living on them. Some of them are a bit smaller, maybe just one house. But mostly it's just like small, you know, stones almost, you know, peeking through the waterline. The further out you come towards the ocean, the smaller these stones become. I don't know what they're called in English, but almost like a reef, but they're made out of stone. So when I was looking for names for the album, I was actually looking at this maritime map. with names for the different areas and these kind of like old names really in Swedish it's really weird and like poetic and but sometimes it's poetic and you you also get from the name the understanding that you shouldn't go there because you're gonna damage your boat you know So there's all these meanings in these track names. And I've spent a lot of time there as a child and also as a grown-up, so it felt natural to pay a bit of tribute to the archipelago after I named the first album after my hometown, Stockholm. Absolutely. And I mean, you've had so many different aliases and projects, of course, down the years. What do you think it was about the Persuader that appealed to people and Creek Crew in 2015? Well, I mean, music always goes somewhat circular and kind of like tides, you know. I guess now that sound that we put out on Sweck, the label at that time in the mid-90s, is now again kind of popular. But I guess we were also lucky that we also found a particular sound that was kind of like timeless in a way. So... I mean, most of the music is not really timeless. You can really hear that it belongs to a certain era. But sometimes you just do a record that seems to be valid for, you know, like this. obviously has been popular for 15 years or so so that was a good one and you've been playing live as as the persuader um a bit recently how have you found you know the crowd reacting to those performances yeah it's interesting because it's actually um um I mean, it's an honor to first have produced a new album with all new songs and to get to play them live in front of an audience is really cool. And to see the direction. And to be able to also change the songs while you play them to fit the mood of the party or the concert. So that's kind of like next level DJing in a way. Does the live show comprise just material from the new album or are you throwing in kind of older, persuaded material as well? This live set is, I'd say, 95% new material. And a little surprise, too. And you mentioned Svek, which is kind of like a bit of a legendary cult label. Can you tell me about how... You first met Stefan, who started the label, I believe. Yeah, so let me have a think. Because I was working in a record shop together with Adam Bayer, actually, in the mid-90s. And we were selling techno records. A little bit of house. And one day this guy Stefan came into the record shop and started to talk with us. I mean we became friends and he... wanted to do a label that was kind of different from this hard pounding techno that was going on at the moment. And go back to more like... I guess techno but in a house tempo. And we took a lot of inspiration from labels like Compact in Germany and so on. And we tried to do our own style with this kind of... dubby techno house undefined style I guess and Stefan played on the steel drums in that Chaos record. Is that right? He did with you? No, that was actually a guy we found in the subway. So he came in and didn't say much, but he just played on the steel drum. And at that time, there was no hard disk recording. So everything had to be done in one take. What was that session like? Weird. And so from getting to know Stefan, how involved did you become with with Svek? Obviously you put out quite a few records on the label. Were you also sort of, did you have anything to do with the day-to-day running of things? Well, he was the main guy running the label. But we ended up working quite much together. And I also co-produced his records. I wrote also a lot of other records with other people. I had some different projects on the SWAG label. So I guess I was probably involved in about half of the catalog in the end. And why did it sort of come to a close around 2001? I guess, I mean, someone's probably going to write a book about it, but... Prior to the millennium, vinyl business was quite good. And then, I guess with the introduction of MP3s and downloads and all this stuff, a lot of distributors started to go bankrupt. just didn't seem to be you know working out the same way as it did just five six years before that and also there was some distributors owing money and it was just not a good situation A lot of labels really were hit by that and didn't survive. Even the ones that did survive seemed to sort of really struggle through those years. So it was like, you know, almost overnight spec records that just weren't selling as many copies. Yeah, I think there was maybe the second or the third distributor that went bankrupt. And that was kind of like the nail in the coffin, you know. And Stefan lost interest in trying to put out new records. I mean, you mentioned the kind of circular nature of music. A lot of those records now fetch a fairly tidy amount of money on Discogs, for example. So I guess it could be, would it be something that's ever, are you still in touch with Stefan and would you ever consider restarting that or reissuing any of those records? I don't think that it would be economically feasible to repress all those records again. And I think it would just piss off all the collectors anyway. So I think... I think we probably leave the records where they are. And I want to sort of take things back a bit. I mean, you come from a very musical family and upbringing. Grandfather, father, uncle, all musicians. What was it like growing up in that environment and how did you end up getting involved with club music? Yeah, that's a good question. I thought that I was going to become some sort of engineer or work with computers or rockets or something. And I was actually in school all the way up to I was about 16, 17 years old, I think. And I started to hear hip hop and kind of, you know, Belgian new beat and all this new sort of... music coming out on our only small radio channel that we had in Stockholm at that time. And I guess sooner or later I started to dream about having my own equipment, studio equipment and getting computer which would then be like an Atari which could control synthesizers and drum machines and so on and because you had to buy all the all the equipment if you were to record anything even to cassette you still needed so much equipment And then later on, I started to go to the early rape parties that was held in Stockholm in the early 90s. And around 93, I met some other Swedish people, among them Adam Bayer. And we got together as a small group of friends and actually went to Berlin to the love parade. And just seeped in all the atmosphere that was going on at that time. And on the train down to Berlin, we actually started planning. who was gonna buy which machine and so on. So that when we came back to Stockholm after the weekend, we were all pretty tired, but we just started to try and pull together this studio, me, Adam and Peter Benesch, another guy. And I think a few months later, we had our first studio in Peter's mom's basement. And we started to do records from there. So tell me what your experience was like at the Love Parade. in 1993? First of all it was overwhelming the whole party thing was pretty crazy with all these trucks going up and down on Kurfürstendamm with people dancing and it was quite different from Sweden we were not so like open in this way in the 90s. But then also the whole atmosphere of running small record labels and actually doing music and putting it out on your own label and getting it distributed and played by other DJs and seeing that it was actually possible. That was a very good inspiration to actually go back up to Stockholm again and then start the studio and be determined that we're going to have our records played at the Club Parade next year, 1994, which they actually were then. Also, we actually had... Two records, I think, that was played at least once. The following year? Yes. So you very much achieved that goal. That must have been a wonderful feeling. Yeah, I think that was probably the reason why also we kept on working with music and has been doing that now since the beginning of the 90s. because we had that really nice experience the first year. And in terms of coming back from the Love Parade, setting up a studio and making music, As you kind of got into the groove doing that, was there a bit of an actual party scene coming up in Stockholm that revolved around that? Were there raves happening that you were attending or playing at? Yeah, in the beginning of the 90s, like around 1991, there was the first wave of kind of like illegal rave parties. And you had to call a phone line with an answering machine that was going through all the party information. And usually they had all the boring stuff first so that you had to pay for five minutes at least. And then came, you know, the address for a bus or something to go to a warehouse somewhere. And that's how, for instance, we met also Keri Läckebush, another Swedish techno producer. It was kind of also thanks to him that we also got the knowledge about the studio technology and the equipment and how to connect cables with the equipment to actually get it to work. How long after that did you actually set up Globe Studios with Peter and Adam? Yeah, Globe Studios opened, I think, on the 1st of September or something like that. Okay, in 93. So in terms of where the location of Globe Studio has been, where has it moved down the years? Actually, we're in the same spot. And it's kind of fun and scary at the same time that I'm actually 40 years old now and sitting in almost the same room as I started doing this. So the studio is actually 22 years old this summer. And we'll see how many years we go on for. And tell me about what it's like in there. Well, now we have the whole basement. So it's actually made up of, I think, eight rooms. And so there's a bunch of people there. My cousin John has one room. There's another guy called Albin Meyers. and there's another Swedish guy called Thai Stripes. and another young Swedish techno producer called Nima Kak, and a couple of other guys as well. So we're kind of like an office, really, that goes to lunch at the same time. Yeah, it's very good. I mean, back around that time, it wasn't too long after the studio opened that you were also working in Planet. Rhythm also put out records on their label. Who was running that? That was a guy called Glenn Wilson who came to Sweden also in the beginning of the 90s and started first a mail order for records and later he moved to Stockholm. and opened a record shop. And then he hired me and Adam Beyer. and also Alexey Delano, who lives here now in London, by the way. So we were kind of working there, all of us, nicking all the good records that came up from England and Germany. And there was also the label Plant Rhythm. And Cary Lickerbush actually had his studio in the basement. And he was also running his own label called Hybrid. So that was also a nice little unit there with labels and producers and records and everything. Obviously having access to all the latest records is hugely important, especially in a kind of pre-internet era. Were you also kind of interacting with customers coming into the shop who were kind of on the same wavelength as you musically? Yeah, there was a lot of actually young people with very little money coming in to listen to the records we had in the stock. We knew that they didn't have so much money or no money at all actually. It was also interesting to see how important it was for them to also see and feel the records that they heard over at the parties, the techno parties. or just when the sort of internet phenomena started with DJ mixes that was distributed on the internet and so on. So we actually, for a while, we had a big crate that took the whole, you know... half of the store was just tucked away records for guys who wanted them so badly but they didn't have the money so we had to pull them out and um but it was it was a very interesting time to work there and to to see how other people reacted to to the music because We had our own... sort of journey to the music. And that was kind of the first time that I really started to interact with other people as well who had a similar fanatic interest in techno and the machines, you know, the classic Roland stuff and all this. Because before there was no forum really to discuss. You could maybe discuss. discuss at the rape party or something like that but and i mean that's why record shops were and i i guess you know continue to be so important because it is it is like a meeting spot a hub for pete for for like-minded you know music obsessives yeah i mean i mean it was only i think it was roughly a year after that sort of formative love parade experience in 93 you put out a record 202 bpm which is probably one of the most brutal pieces of techno I've heard was it built to play at any of the raves you were attending actually that record I recorded it at a friend's house in '92. And at that time, it was just about having fun. And I had this little drum machine and he had got land of a Roland 303. And I also had some other... small synth that we actually managed to connect and get them all to run at the same time and then we just recorded a bunch of tracks onto a cassette tape and I didn't think they were going to end up anywhere but he started to send them you know to different labels and at that time you had to send cassette copies you know in an envelope So we actually got a response from a few labels. They would maybe send us a sticker saying thanks, but no thanks. But then we had this label in the US called Drop Bass Network, and he loved the stuff. That was it. And in the kind of, I think it was in 1996, you started a label with Thomas Crom, DK, and you also started a Blank. So tell me about those two labels and how they kind of, they got kicked off. Yeah, just to try and recall the timeline here a little bit. There was so much things happening at the time. when I started working in the Plantarhythm record shop. Because we also got in contact with Prime Distribution, which was a big distributor here in the UK for techno music. And they started to ask us for music. We just tried to find different styles of techno sort of and try and start new labels and new projects and try to see what worked best. And they would say, ah, this record is good. that record not so much more of this style less of this and we try to adapt to that So I started DK with Thomas Chrome, which is actually Dahlbeck and Chrome Records. Actually, Thomas did a couple of releases, but then I sort of took over the label and run it by myself. Blank was also a label that I started by myself, which just had these handwritten Senti labels and sort of quick studio experiments that I just sent that tapes down to England and they released it. And I mean, it was only a couple of years difference between, you know, the 202 BPM track and sort of you experimenting or, you know, really pioneering like a super headsy, minimal, deep house sound. So I guess, were you trying all sorts of things in the studio at this time? Well, the 202 BPM track... I think we did it summer of 92 or something like that. So at that time, I still didn't know that we were going to start a studio. But at 93, 94, it was quite obvious that we were going to be able to do some really good stuff that actually people outside of, you know, our... crew and out of Sweden was actually gonna enjoy it which was really a bizarre feeling that someone you know would actually buy this record so I think fairly quick the the the awareness of the quality increased that you know we have to actually show that we can do something here that uh is on par with all the other stuff. And for this, we had a lot of discussions with Cary actually. He already had a lot of experience in a big studio environment. He knew the big mixer consoles and effect units. So we tried to just see in all the information we could in order to do as good techno as possible. I mean, there was also a bit of a jazz phase in terms of your own listening experiences and that seeped into your productions as well. And I guess that was more around the mid-90s, wasn't it? Yeah, because later in 96, 97, I guess, when I kind of got fed up with techno for a while. And that's where Zveck came into my life. And that really opened up a whole new world of, you know, doing music. which was actually more like music and not just a machine or a drum machine that was stuck in a loop. So that's also when I started to experiment with real harmonies and scales and chord progression and more sort of the musical side of them. You work with percussionists and trumpeter and stuff like that in this period. Was that musically fulfilling for you in a way that techno wasn't? I guess it became quite clear already after a few years in the studio that with all these drum machines and synthesizers, we had already sort of perfected our... our style of doing techno music. So it felt already like you were stuck in a groove, you know, or had to move on to a different challenge. And that's when I started to... try to experiment with real musicians and try to bring in you know different real instruments like the the chaos 10-inch for example we had to do it live because there was no computers and also Later on I bought a quite expensive sampler that could actually sample longer bits of sounds. So I could actually bring in some musician or actually play myself something and work with those sounds in a different way that was possible just before. In the early 90s, there was only a few samplers on the market for, you know... let's say under 1500 euros that could do more than let's say 20 seconds of audio. So it was very limited at that time. And the newer samplers that came later on towards the later half of the 90s could do maybe a couple of minutes even. So that was a big difference also. in the possibilities of using real instruments and stuff. And there was a tune, Real Jazz, that... you released around that period that was sampled by the Chemical Brothers and you weren't too pleased about that tell me sort of what happened and how you reacted well I think it was Tiga who played me this new single from the Chemical Brothers and he told me that they sampled the real jazz And so actually, for a while, I tried to look into the possibilities of some sort of... compensation with my publisher at the time but it didn't really work out well so but just a few I think months later or a year later there was another group from the US on Strictly Rhythm I think who released yet another with the real jazz loop just stuck underneath a couple of extra elements. So then I got a bit pissed off and took their track and looped it and did a new track that was actually released then on the DK label again. And this time it was release number seven. And that actually became a project called DK7. together with another guy called marcus sullivan who was doing vocals for this track and did you know if like if chemical brothers ever had a response to your response did you ever hear from them again after you put that after you put that record out Well, I'm not mad at them, but I think that it was an interesting lesson just to see how far you can go. Because as I looked at it, I didn't really see myself as, you know, the track is not that original. They were coming sort of from the underground scene and maybe I was hoping for that they would pay something back to the sort of underground scene by at least acknowledge that they took the sample. But this is how music works. I guess, you know, there's a lot of people who never got paid. It is the kind of the age-old debate sampling in electronic music. For sure. No one really seems quite sure where to draw the line even now. I mean, we've spoken about some of your collaborations already, but there's a couple of others I wanted to touch on. You put out a record with Alexi Delano in 99 and you mentioned that you've known him for... quite a while um you've got another album on the way this year is that right yeah we've been working for i don't know three four years on and off with some new material we have this pseudonym called adjd so hopefully we can put this out also maybe at the beginning of next year or so And you've put out music with your cousin, John. That kind of started around 2003. And you mentioned in a previous interview, that was also the time you kind of packed away the analog gear and started using a laptop. Yeah, that was also an interesting time because just in the beginning of 2000, I... started to do music only with a computer because the computers started to get really powerful and you could actually do a lot with them. So... me and my cousin who was actually quite young at the time then we had this sort of study group you know trying different plugins and different techniques and styles of writing and really just going through all the capabilities of the computer. So all the analog outboard gear was locked up in a storage sort of. And for a few years I was only working the computer and doing music in that way. And then sooner or later I got fed up with that also. So was it a case of when you revived the Persuader alias that that was when you kind of dusted off that equipment or had you been bringing out or sort of incorporating, reincorporating hardware into your setup before then? Well, I started to... try and record different machines four or five years ago but it was still quite difficult to get them to work with a modern computer which is really weird because you know we're in modern times and and so on but all this And studio standards like MIDI, for example, which is more than 30 years now, I think, is still so dominant that... Many studios still rely on this old technology. But now there's so many new interesting companies doing new inventions in the studio field that you can really mix anything with anything. in the studio. And there's really nothing that is a mystery anymore because of the internet. You can go on the internet and find information on any weird little gizmo that you can find in the flea market. So that's both the good and the bad. with the modern technology. Do you feel that has invigorated you as a producer? It definitely made it easier to record the Persuader album because at that time I was still using the Atari which was just a small game computer with a small monochronic TV screen. We had to record everything on that tapes. And once you recorded it and closed the studio, someone else maybe went in. right after and changed all the settings so if you were unhappy with something in the track you had to sort of build everything from scratch again to find the samples the settings the the effects units had to be restored and all this stuff And nowadays, my way of writing music is that I kind of use that old way of... creating music but i can record every segment as a individual track in the computer and then sort of mold everything together which makes it much easier i mean you've said before that you see yourself as a producer and not a dj and it's i guess it's always strange that people continue to get those to disciplines mixed up so regularly. Do you find that you're still getting booked to DJ regularly? I notice often when you do a DJ set, you are just playing your own productions as a kind of showcase of your sound. Yeah, it started, I think, 10 years ago. I realized that... I should maybe just stick to playing my own music because there are so many DJs already that play all kinds of styles and all kinds of records but there's only one Jesper Dahlbeck who can play. my own stuff and and and the way i want it and that approach has worked worked for you yeah it's worked really well i have a quite big catalog luckily now that i can choose from and do you find that you you enjoy djing uh more since you've decided to go down that route Yeah, it's a fantastic feeling to be able to play for a couple of hours only your own music or music that you wrote with other people or remixes that you've done for other people and so on. It's kind of like an ultimate ego trip to do that, actually. You've had some issues with tinnitus down the years. Is that... affected you much in terms of what you've been able to do performance wise or in the studio and are you managing okay now? There was a period in the beginning of 2000 that I started to get problems with my ears and for a while I was actually worried that it was tinnitus. And I went to an air specialist and she checked them and they were actually quite okay. So I actually got these special plugs, the molded ones. And then as soon as I got... them I actually used them for I think almost a year every time I went out through the door I put them in my ears and also started maybe to live a bit healthier and that sort of made this tinnitus thing go away actually So since then, I actually use my plugs whenever I can. If it's a noisy environment, I try to use my earplugs. It's a very good advice. And I wanted to ask you about Tiga, who's someone you've sort of been involved with for quite a while. How did you first cross paths with him and get involved with Turbo? Yeah, that's actually also a funny story because he called me once when I was in the studio and probably around 96, I think. And he wanted to license one track from my label Blank. And I guess... He didn't really know what sort of guy I was, so he tried to impress me by talking about his car. And I was totally uninterested by cars, so it was kind of an awkward talk. But then we actually realized that both of us had been to the Love Parade in both 1993 and 1994, I think. And when I went through my pictures from the La Parade, I actually realized that I have a photo where I think you can actually see his cap from the distance. So there we were on the same spot almost. a few years earlier and then we became friends actually you know it's in 2015 what's uh stockholm's party scene like are you in are you invested in it in in any way i think that um This sort of club scene in Stockholm has never been so good actually as it is now. There's a lot of DJs obviously and a lot of also producers. A lot of promoters doing different parties. It's actually kind of like a dream come true in a way, but it's a bit too late for me, perhaps. But in the 90s, we were really glad if someone made it up to Stockholm at that time. But now it's actually a quite vibrant scene. And it seems like the label you're most focused on these days is Templar. Tell me what your plans are. Templar is yet another label that I opened with no real plan. And I'm just going to see where it ends up. And now we do the album. which were preceded by these three first 12 inches with the Persuader stuff. And then we'll see what happens. I have some new material and I really look forward to releasing it over this year. So more Persuader records or will you be doing it under different names? I think there's going to be at least a couple of more Persuaded records. I have also some plans to revive another project called The Brommage Dub, which I did with another guy called Sean Lee Hukta. That was also on Sweck back in the days. So you're back in the studio with him? Yeah, we've also been working on and off the past years. We have a lot of unreleased material, actually, that I want to get out now before I quit. So another chapter open, I guess. For sure. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ so you
