Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Chilean DJ Luciano needs no introduction. Let's try one anyway. Cadenza, Orange Mistake, Blind Behavior, Love Dose, Chile, Switzerland, Ibiza, DC10, Vagabundos, Pasha, Tribute to the Sun, Brand. There's more, of course, and we hardly scratched the surface last month when we talked in Berlin, but we did try our best. It seems like the last couple of years have been crazy for you. Was there a certain point at which things, I mean in my mind at least, once the label really in 2008 or 2007 became a very important thing to you and you were like, got it on a schedule of release after release. Was that the moment at which things sort of changed or transformed? Well, somehow it was like more... It's like, I mean, it started so simply and of course while you go on the road, while things happen, while you have more artists, you have more responsibilities. More responsibilities come, you have more people working on and suddenly everything becomes like you find yourself with 20 people working around. And you're like, I just wanted to do one record man. And somehow that's hard. It's very hard also to... to be really present for every little aspect of it. And at the same time, if you're not paying attention to each thing, it's a lack of respect also for the people you're working with, but also for the customers. So there was one point where I sat down and I said, it needs to be not reorganized, but it needs to be a little bit more. I need to focus myself a little bit into this, like leave a little bit some things that I do also on the side and just focus because I need to show respect also to the people that they're respecting also my work also, not only people, fans and stuff, but also the people more professionals and stuff like that. And that's when a little bit, yeah, the direction changed and we decided to go a bit more professional, a bit more, let's say, more attention to each product we're doing and reorganizing somehow. But music-wise and stuff like that, always trying to keep the same direction, always to not to have one direction with music, but the more the, let's say, what we have in mind at the label is if we have an artist that have a universe or... his world of music we are trying to push him to be in his bubble let's say not to be like a lot of people they're always like we are doing the sound of cadenza like we don't have like a specific sound what we have is artists that they have a sound and we're trying always to push them into their own bubble to to develop their their their own talents and stuff like that And I think this was the time when things a bit changed and we got more real. Like, let's say, okay, let's focus and let's work a bit harder into that. What do you think people think is the sound of cadenza? Well, I don't know. It's like probably this Latin bling, bling, bling. I don't know. It's like everyone is like, it's extremely funny because there's so many interpretations of things and stuff. But as I said many times, there's not real sound. What we're more doing is we always... focusing into finding people that have a musical universe in, of course, in a certain sound. And I would say the sound of what we do is very, has to do probably, it's probably maybe my fault, I think, because I have South American influences, has to be a lot with melodies, rhythms. and stuff like that. And of course it's dance music also, because that's also what we live from and what we're working every weekend. And let's say that's the sound of it. But we're so many into this. There's so many different visions. And for me, sound-wise, it's like you pick up a Frivolous or you pick a Reboot. It's like two different worlds, yeah. And it's very different music also on the level of quantity of instruments or stuff like that. But both are great. Both are amazing universe. They have a vision very clear of music and they know where they want to go. The vagabundos concept. I would say that's also kind of this overarching thing that people... associate with the label. Where did that come from? Well, Vagabundos, it's more, it's hard, but we always try to dissociate Vagabundos a little bit from what it is Cadenza, actually. Cadenza is the core. Vagabundos is the project that came around it, let's say. Vagabundos was something, I mean, this comes like years ago, I had I'm working in Ibiza, I'm doing parties since 11 years, I was president like 5, 6 years at DC10, I did many things there. There was one point where also I needed to, I had 20 guys behind me, artists and the label and everyone wanted to take part of it. And Ibiza, it's like Berlin, it's like a place where it's like music-wise, there's like three or four months or maybe a little bit more that lots of people go and it's a nice place to go to be. Music-wise, it's like, it can be cheesy, but at the same time, there's very interesting things happening also. And I think slowly the things were kind of constructing to a point where it's like, okay, I have to step. I have the possibility today to step into something where I can do something for my boys, for the guys that are on the back, that they want to do something, and I believe 100% in them that they have... the opportunity to do something and it's not playing one time and you have the opportunity also to do something you have to be constantly and stuff like that so we decided to create our own night and this was the beginning of Vagabundo and Vagabundos of course you need to when you create your own night you have to create like a theme or something And I remember... It's interesting that it stays the same, like Cocoon changes it every year. Was it always the idea to have the same theme? It's only been two years so far. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no. It's okay. And the same theme, I mean, we thought, I mean, it became so, like, quickly, the brand became so strong very quickly. that we thought if it's working it's because people like it. People enjoy coming, putting their heads and having kind of this gypsy blah blah blah crazy thing at the same time. a little bit, you can break barriers with these very high people that come also to Ibiza, very rich to the crowd also that comes from anywhere and comes for dancing and stuff like that. And it was a good matching point to merge a little bit all this together in a big thing. and just having fun and stuff like that. And Vagabundos was a bit related also to the lifestyle that I think all of us, we had also. We were always traveling, always with the... with the no sleep and blah, blah, blah. And it's like, hey, they had something to do with this vagabond lifestyle and stuff like that. Did Pasha, was that the only sort of offer on the table? No, no, no, no, no. The Pasha decision was, was, this is, it's very interesting because Pasha is like, it's like, let's say that Pasha came like years, I had proposition from all the clubs, like Privilege, Parnes My thing that I had in my heart always from the beginning was with Ushuaia or DC10, the things that I did from the very beginning that I did on side project. But Pasha... was because Amnesia wanted me to go there and I was almost like eight years playing for Cocoon. They are very good friend of mine and I was not going to war with anybody if I did something there. I was just trying to do my alternative with my people that I was trying to bring to the island. So Pasha, after thinking and thinking and thinking... It was not the best club from the island, let's say. It's an old club, but it's an institution also. And I have to say that Pascha, the choice was because I thought that it was a smaller place, was the best, let's say, kind of house, like billet for... for new groups starting, let's say. And also at the same time, it was like music-wise, they didn't have like a program change for years. They were going... with things more like classic house, defected, and all these kind of things. And we thought maybe it's probably a cool space to go in and to create something, to bring a new vibe inside. And the goal was that, the idea was that, like behind. And we knew also that... probably technically wise and stuff. There was other clubs that they had best equipments or best sound and stuff like that. And we knew that we had to invest also ourselves into the night, into trying to make things better. And that's the way we went with the Pasha, yeah. You've also brought in quite a few interesting people on those nights. You would never expect Theo Parrish or someone... to be playing there. Yes. It's been a passion of yours to make sure that you're bringing in... Well, the thing is, before I signed with Pasha, when we started three years ago to do the Vagabundos, they offered me also to come in. They wanted me to be resident of Pasha. I told them, like, guys... I'm not coming here to be resident. If I come here or if I come to any club, it's because I come with my crew. We do the lineup. We do our night. And we don't want anybody to let us in. And we're going to probably bring people you've never heard and things you've never saw and things you probably won't like. but that's the way we want. And they refused the first year. And I was like, I've refused also being resident because they were not ready. And I was not ready probably for that need. And the year after we said, okay, now take your night, do your shit, blah, blah, blah. And we picked up. And for me the most important was of course to try to build something around the music that influenced me. The music that the artists I always liked and the artists I always respected. And of course it was a bit of a challenge because when you approach anybody and you're like, hey, you want to come and play at Bach's? And they look at you and it's like... And of course it was kind of hard because the image is like, it's a very strong brand and it's a very strong image and it was hard to try to convince. But slowly, almost all the artists that came, they had a good experience. Some others had a bad experience because sometimes, of course, it's like you're taking a problem or whatever and things can happen, yeah. But... Matthew having a lot of fun. What's been the most surprising thing to you about playing there at that club, doing your night there? The most surprising thing that I had at the club was actually seeing the... We brought a lot of old people from the island that quit going there for about 10 years. coming back to the club. I have to say we were not expecting a quick success like this and stuff like that. We were like, okay, we're going to have to build it slowly and it's going to be hard because we know that people, I know a lot of people from Ibiza have been there for a long time, with DC10, with Cocoon and all this stuff. And I thought it's going to be harder, let's say, not to bring back people to the Pasha or to feel for the night, but... to make it nice, that there is a nice atmosphere, that there is no barrier between this, you know, like, VIP, blah, blah, blah. That there is a community of people coming for music, whatever background they have, whatever nationality, whatever it is, the main principle was music, yeah. And of course, it's a B-side song. So I think we got surprised very quickly with the impact that we could feel that there was something cool happening. and people enjoying and the response also from lots of artists that as we said as Moody Man or Theo Parish like guys that everyone knows that it's hard to bring them to play and they kind of not hard behavior but they will do you something very strange that you like You know, you're always kind of freaking out and stuff like that. And they were totally cool and even making some makeup and putting hats. So it was pretty funny. And that was surprising. I think the whole success and the familiar thing that built up so quickly was a big surprise also for us. We didn't expect that fast. How has the island changed your music in the way you DJ? Has it changed? Yes, I think so. I mean, I think so. It's like, it doesn't change, but me, I'm always, as a DJ, I've always compromised. myself. It's not as a producer. When I produce, I'm always doing my thing. When I DJ, I'm always, I feel responsible for the crowd. I feel responsible for the party to make it happen, to create something. And sometimes it's of course, it's like, it's summer, it's like... depending on where you are, it's like beach, it's daytime, whatever, and of course you, I mean, it's not about setting the salt, but you're transforming certain moments into certain music, and you have certain things for certain things, like after our music, or you have a... sunset set, for example, you have a nighttime big crowd or you have a nighttime small crowd and you're always adapting things and that's the things that I do if I come to Berlin, that's the thing that I do if I go to New York, that's the thing that I do if I go to Brazil and everywhere you go, I think you should compromise with the place that you're going to because you should... That's what you're able to do, actually, as a DJ, is to merge little pieces of the culture, of the place, and make un clin d'oeil, as you say in French, which is like a... And you're kind of showing the people, that's what you're able to do with the technologies. You can make a little trick to bring you something special. How do you play differently in Berlin than you would in... You're playing today at Panorama Bar, for instance. It's very simple. It's a party that's been running for 19 hours. When you get there in, you smell the cigarettes and everything. Of course, it's like something that affects. It's not that it affects the music, but I'm very, very, let's say, I'm going to pick up slowly because I'm going to turn up into the people's mind. I know that they've been going for 19 hours and I know that I'm going to treat them with a special sound or something like this. you can trick it, yeah. And that's what I love about the DJing, let's say, that you can really pick up moments and go slowly into people's mind and make something happen, something happy, something melancholic, something some people might not like it or whatever, but that's the magic of music, yeah. And as I said, Berlin, for example, I know that's going to be special because... it's a party that's been running for 20 hours. Yeah. It must be strange. People have a different state of mind of people who have been dancing for four hours at the sunset around the beach. It's different. If you've been in a club closed for 10 hours or 15 hours. I was watching a video online and it showed your tractor setup and it had comments where you had written little bits that said like warm up, bomb, whatever. Is that what you use sort of in your – Yes, absolutely. Quite a bit? Absolutely. That's the way I work. Of course, one of the things that I miss from the record is the visual part, the touch thing. My records, I know you can pick up any record in my collection, I know the record. Because I had a visual contact, a physical contact with the digital. I lost this completely. And it took me a while before I could organize myself, finding the themes that I felt. So I decided actually to go through my whole library each time that I'm getting music. And of course, there's artists that always repeat that you know and the music that you know. But there's so many new people making music that they did one record or two records or three records that you might not, of course, remember and stuff like that. So I started to organize myself also with the comments, which I love, especially. And that's the way I do it. It's like, I know that I have my, I do this after our music, or I have like big time music or bombs or. warm-up or so what's the difference between peak time music and bomb there's no difference it's interesting in the digital world now how you organize your music it's very hard i have to say it's very hard and it's it's this is the only like it's a difficult and hard part of it is is this is like it's very hard to to kind of have the feeling that you had with the records or even with CDs or whatever. It's like you lost this completely in the digital world. How long have you been playing with Traktor? Traktor's been now, I think, four years, no, three years. And it's always, you're running three, four tracks at the same time. Always, always. Sometimes six, sometimes seven. For me, it's like... The whole idea when I jumped from records to the digital was only because when I was playing records already I was always trying, for example the greatest in band for me after the Deep Facts and stuff like that was the loop machine yeah because i loved when i used to play records using loop machine and doing edits and and and things and putting acapellas and and being able to stop a record and put another one with acapella so with sound and stuff and cre start creating with the records yeah not only playing you wait till then but really being able to bring like a piece of the studio In real time. And jumping to digital was only this. I'm able to go so much further with my ideas. and the things that I always wanted to do, mix like old tracks from the 80s with the thing, pick up a loop, put up a shaker, put up a percussion, bring up the the bumble, cut it up and that brought me so... it motivated me so much into DJing from the point that I was playing the records. that I couldn't step back and I can't. It's like I'm so addicted to this somehow, not maybe the format or the interface, but just the way you are able to bring music today in a club that is almost like a life. What about production these days? Production is... I'm working on my album at the moment. I'm doing... I'm working and I've been working for pretty much time, but I'm really focusing into... into the music I've always wanted to do, which is always compromised. It's like between the blind behavior, some dance track and stuff, but... It's always been about getting better in the sound quality, in the production, in the studio, in the richness of sonorities and stuff like that. So that's what I'm doing at the moment. It's like working with... I also rebuilt a little bit my studio. I customized an old studio. that I customized with some special electronic things inside and I'm very proud of it and I'm very very excited about like where the actually the machine and the whole electronic and the whole ideas are getting where they are getting with the sound and stuff like that and I'm working also on lots of collaboration at the moment for the album and for example for the album I'm going to be with Jorgus Mangas which is a very old 75 years old clarinet player from the Gypsy communities that is absolutely amazing and we are recording next week I did also some things with Martin Rebelski which is like he's a composer of let's say more Sound film music, soundtrack music and stuff like that. You seem to really love to collaborate. I like this because of the... First of all, because I've been also... I isolate myself also. a lot. I'm not like having a studio in the middle of a city where everyone pass by. I'm very isolated. I work from my home in the fucking mountain where I live and stuff like that. So it's like there's not much input as I had, for example, when I was living in the city. So I spend a lot of time actually on my own on the studio producing the most important stuff like that. And when I go out, it's probably when I have a piece ready and stuff like that. And and work out with other people. which makes it very interesting also. I've always, before being a DJ or before being in electronic, I've always wanted to be involved into music, but not only in electronic music, but more into the music of bands and getting back the instruments and all these kind of things. that's what is, what's happening today and I have the opportunity to doing it and I'm learning so much about like, people like this, yeah, because they are, they are absolutely great musicians, yeah. How do you fit something like a clarinet player into what you do without feeling like it's you know not watering it down or something like this I find that has to be the most difficult thing yes that's a hard part but for example for me it's more about like Getting myself sitting down and saying, "Okay, I'm going to produce what I do. I'm not going to produce a whole track and say, 'This is the thing.' No, I'm going to produce a couple of, let's say, 16 or 38 loops, bar loops and stuff, with something that rolls, that has the basics, rhythms and little melodies, bass and stuff like that." develop it and then you know it's like we start exchanging stuff for example with all those guys exchanging and say like are you into this are you not into this and starting to talk about the ah yes I have this it's about a feeling yeah and that's the only way I could talk it's like that's exactly the most important thing to work. Music is a feeling. It's something that you have to feel. Be rude to me if you don't like it, but be true. Let's not step into something that we're not convinced, both of us. And I wouldn't feel bad if you say like, no, it doesn't work. And I hope you don't feel bad neither. If no, it doesn't work. So it's like. What does a 75-year-old clarinet player make of your music when you're playing? No, this is more like a dream for me. It's more like the... Yorgos is... So many people did bootlegs. I used to play a lot. One of these tracks, which is like a geo-anthropus... I don't know how to say the last word. It's like a very famous, not a cappella, but from clarinet that lots of people have used in records and stuff. And he's just amazing. The way he picks up the instruments, it's like he will play it and nobody else in the world can put the sound like this out of his mouth and stuff. And he's able to merge into anything and that's the amazing thing. And for me it's more about like, I'm not telling, now you have to play this. I'm like, my part is the rhythms. I'm the rhythmic boy. So I do the rhythm and create the rhythms, leave it an open, let's say an open plage. and jam, go with the flow and I will follow you. You write the "muh" and I will follow you with what's in the background. So when is the album coming out? I think it's probably, I don't know yet, but it's this year, that's for sure. I don't care when, but for me of course it's important to, as a person, to... Of course, to write an album is always a piece of your life you're trying to achieve and you're always trying to... to get better, to involve more things, or to experiment different things and stuff like that. And since I remember my youngest age of 12 years old, that's what I wanted to do, yeah. You started playing guitar earlier, right? Can you still play? Yeah, well, I have to say... Do you still play? I still play. I have my Les Paul at home, and I'm always playing guitar. I'm not using it that much. I do use it in composition. I've used a couple of tracks that I wrote lately. But I have to say that I left it a little bit. I left it and I'm not playing what I used to play when I was from 12 to 22. I was playing every day. I had my corns in my fingers. No, now it's more like I discover machines and... What is your favorite machine in your studio? Is there something you come back to all the time? Yeah, well, I have all the studio electronics that I love. Sound-wise, let's say that the sound that they are giving, like... the speciality of the tonality, of the strongness of the synths, let's say. Then, well, you know, it's like all my machines that I have at the moment, it's like I sold a lot of old things, but I kept only the things that I know that I will never, ever split, yeah. And I have my Studer border that is customized. I bought very old Studer from a radio station in Switzerland. And there was two. There was one, Jamie Liddell bought one, and I got the other one. And then I found another one in Paris. When they closed down, they shut down a whole TV channel, and they all went to digital. So they threw out all the tables, and they were selling it for nothing. It was in the lower states, and we merged both circuits together, and we did a mixer out of two mixers, which is amazing. And now it works and sounds fantastic and stuff like that. Then I have also like an unsplittable Eventide, for example. It's an effect board and stuff. But it's like a whole world. Whatever you put inside gives you so much space and depth. And well, I have a lot of equipment that I can talk for hours. Do you like living in Switzerland? Yes, I do. I do, you know, I have kids and I have been at a very young age, I was a father, yeah, and I enjoy this, I enjoy being a little bit, sometimes I miss the city, of course, the living of having an input and being able to go to different places, but I... I always liked nature and I always liked to see my kids with this surrounding, with growing up, you know, they go out, you don't have to worry and then they're always playing in the nature. behind the trees or building cabanes or whatever it is. I remember this, growing up like this, and I remember how pleasant it was, how enjoyable it was. It's always been about the family for myself since I'm young and I'm always having the choice. I have the choice today about... doing a job that permits me to say, hey, maybe, why can't I go to live there? I don't have to be stuck, for example, that's when I decided to leave Berlin. I don't have to be stuck in Berlin. Maybe, of course, yes, I will have difficulties for buying records, for blah, blah, blah. But today I have the possibility of just leaving and going somewhere else. and making the chance this 10 or 15 years for them to make something special or something that will probably also bring them also something. I think always nature for kids is something very special and also make them conscious about certain things and stuff. And, yeah. I would think, though, that the airport situation with you flying so much, it would be annoying. Yeah, but it is. But, for example, I'm... I think 15 minutes from the airport from where I live. And in Switzerland it's pretty cool. It's one hour, one hour 20 from anywhere in Europe. And if I needed to go to a big, bigger, longer flight, I go to Zurich or Madrid or Frankfurt. And it's not that. I'm pretty in the center of Europe, so it's pretty easy. The kids were the reason to move out of Berlin then? Yes, there were several reasons also. It's like there was more, more, more, let's say more reasons. There was also, of course, I love partying and stuff like that. And I'm a very influenceable person also, I'm very easily... I will come back three days later and stuff like that. And there was one point, that was not the problem. The main problem that I've realized to one point that this was affecting to my kids. And somehow this was very selfish for myself because they're not responsible for that. The whole weekend was not there. There was babysitters taking care of the whole time of them while I'm in the same city. So there was one point where I was like, it's okay. The lifestyle I have, the thing that I have, I've never hidden from my kids. I'm always telling them, that's what I do. When I come back, sometimes I do it because daddy hasn't slept. and I'm like this, I wouldn't lie to you, I want you to know myself like the way I am. But seeing them, okay, you know, you start to realize that this is affecting them, and they are sad because they're scared, afraid, because they're always alone, and there's certain things that you see in kids, that they react in a different way when something is wrong. Have you become less influenceable over the years? I think a little bit. I don't know, but I think it's like more, I'm more careful. I'm more careful and I'm thinking twice. In the way of, I'm always the first one to jumping into something, but I'm always, yeah, I'm more. I'm thinking twice, I would say, yeah. I guess it's been an enormous help to your career, though, to be the one to jump in first into these things as well. Of course, of course, of course. It is. Tell me more about... The label, it seems like you have your stable, you have your crew. Yes. And it seems very distinct. There's a lot of names that are kind of just releasing for the most part on the label. Was that always... part of the dream or part of the idea with the label? Yes, that was always part of the idea, but then when you start to go in this direction, what you realize is that it's actually the hardest part. It's the hardest part to have a complete harmony between the people that works, between the people that release, between the artists. We all know that artists are diverse, that they are difficult and stuff like that. I think it's a long, long, long way before you're turning into something that actually works. It's a very easy idea. Everyone starts with this idyllic, I want to do that, and tomorrow, family. But to stand up and raise a family, it's very hard. And before having harmony and understanding and respect from each point of view, it takes time and it takes a lot of effort also. It's a lot of effort. I've spent so many hours. You can't imagine resolving or trying to make things, to balance things, that things work. At the same time, not being like an enterprise. No, but being respectful, but at the same time being balanced and right and stuff like that. And today, yes, I think we are there somehow. It took a couple of years, though. It took a long time, yes. It's like you're the father of two different families, right? They're always telling me this, but at the same time, I feel also... I'm learning also all the time from all the people that I have around and I don't feel that I brought them, no, maybe the artistic position that I had brought the whole people with me somewhere, but they're teaching me also everyday things. I'm learning so much also from the experience that everyone is having and stuff like that. So it's like, I would say that we are more like a family working together and we're all learning from each other. And it takes a long time, I tell you. It takes a long time and it's not easy. It's not easy at all. What was the... What do you feel like you didn't know or stumbled with early on, you know, getting the tool place? The things that I didn't know is probably the things that I thought I know. Like some things of probably, like, you know, codes and stuff and... and you think you're going to do that thinking that it's going to have no repercussion and then you realize that this is actually breaking the balls of half of the people and then you're trying to also being polite in a certain way or doing things that you're trying to do good around but you can't do good all the time sometimes you're trying to do your best doing good things and stuff And sometimes it might have bad repercussions. I'll give you an example. For example, years ago I used to do five gigs a week, for example. And because you want to please everyone, you want to be everywhere, you want everyone, of course, they're like, hey, baby, come, come, come, come, come. And you're doing. And then I got to a point where it's like. I'm like, man, I was like, after the third day or fourth day, I'm like, yeah, calling the promoter, yeah, I'm sick. And you're not sick, you're just having a party, you haven't slept, blah, blah, blah. And I was getting to the point where I was not enjoying what I was doing. I was like, just like, oh, shit, I have to take the plane. And I was like, hey, man, that's wrong. You're disappointing also. You disappoint lots of people that are coming to the show. You disappoint your promoter and stuff like that. And then you start to realize that also it's like, okay, Luciano, I got to a point where you have to learn to say no. That maybe I'm not the superhero DJ that can play five... days a week but I can do I can refuse a lot and do two days and of course it's going to be hard because I know that half of the people are going to be pissed with me because they think that I'm not going there because I'm a superstar which is like no it's not like this And at the same time, each gig that I'm doing, I'm pleasing the promoter, I'm pleasing the people, and I'm being fair with everyone without disappointing them. And it takes also time to do this. And the people around... it also helps you to learn that and stuff, yeah. Playing in Ibiza, though, it must be nice because so many different people from around the world come there. So you just come here and see me. Exactly. Which I think is great. And that's one of the things of what I like Ibiza is that Ibiza is like the little world of electronic music. Lots of people go there. because it's, first of all, it's a holiday, because the island is precious, it's like a part of party and stuff, there is beautiful places to go swim, eating and stuff like that, and it gives you a little break from... from let's say routine and stuff and there is this thing about this the island is magic it got the things from the 60s the 50s 70s do you still feel that yeah of course of course of course it's like the the the this video shooted from Big Floyd in the 70s there, or whatever painters they live in. It's a place that has something. You can't explain what, but it has something. It has this kind of feeling of freedom, of non-sexual direction, of a little bit of everything. And people do enjoy that. People do like these kind of things and stuff. And it feels like a place that you can go and you can kind of release yourself. But releasing yourself doesn't mean that you have to go to a club. No, it means also that you can also meet different people, go to the beach, relax, go once, party, and then that's it. That's what I do with my kids. I'm not there because I'm always partying. No, I enjoy a lot, let's say, the beautiful side also of it and stuff. So you're playing less these days? Well, I'm playing less than I could do, yeah. I'm still playing a lot, but I'm playing less than what I used to do and what I could also, yeah. I'm just realizing who and until where I can go constructively and not being destructive. That's hard to find the point where it's like... The balance. The balance, yeah. So you found that balance? Well, I don't know if I found it, but I feel better. with the balance I have today than the balance I had a couple of years ago, yes. Because I'm happy with each time I'm going to a gig, I'm okay with it, yeah. It's not that I'm like, oh, I have to fly, blah, blah. No, I'm very motivated and excited, and it sounds tough, maybe, saying this from my side, but... But when you do it that often and stuff, it kind of becomes tough and it doesn't entertain you anymore. And if you're not entertained with what you do, then you're losing the special thing that you're doing and stuff like that. So it's hard to really concentrate, focus and getting to this point, I think. And through years, yes, I think I haven't found it, but I'm more organized and I'm more satisfied with things that I'm doing at the moment. What's next? Where do we go from here? I don't know. I mean, NEXT is like probably... I mean, for me, NEXT is always... I'm thinking the next thing is always studio. It's always like... There's a couple of projects which unfortunately I can't talk yet about it and stuff. But very surprising and very, very... like, let's say, big and beautiful project. and that they are coming but it's more like I'm merging let's say different identities together and creating a new thing and on the other side the next thing for me is always the studio and I don't see let's say it's evolution it's like trying to to be and give as much more as I can in the studio, let's say. That's what I would love ending doing. It's like just sitting down in the studio and producing, actually. I love doing that, yeah. It seems like, though, with people buying less and less music, or at least it costing so much less monetarily. It's not the smart thing to do. No, yeah. To spend so much time in the studio. But actually, if you see the... Maybe the market selling and stuff like that, of course, it's changing because everything is like... The whole thing of music has changed because it was also somehow... created in the wrong way also in the 50s or the 60s was wrong also the way that music became also such a business and stuff like that it's just like being free again music and I think the traffic hasn't got less than years ago. I think the traffic is the same thing. People are still listening to as more music as never. And that's, for me, that's the only thing that is really important, let's say. Because the rest is just part of an evolution. Things are changing. Things are evolving. And in 10 years, I'm sure we're going to have other... trouble with music and it's gonna be totally different approach and we're gonna look back and we're gonna say oh we were so retarded and it's gonna be probably like this yeah and I don't know I understand the thing about that it's hard to live out of it, but there are so many people looking for a new solution. And at the same time, this monopolism from big companies that is breaking down gives space for so much other people. And of course it's hard for small structure like, for example, we are and stuff like that. But it gives also, if you have good ideas and if you're smart enough, you can definitely make something out of this also. Do you think you'll be DJing in 10 years? No, I'm not sure. In 10 years, I'm going to be 43. Yes, maybe, probably I'm going to stay DJing. keep on playing but but not no no no no no no no but you look at Sven for example. Yes, it's amazing. And he's doing it as much as ever. Yeah, it's amazing. I respect him so much. He's like a guy who's been for so long, gives so much energy to people who are also rich or other people who have been for long. But for me, it's hard to see myself like this because I... As I told you, I'm involving myself too much with what I do. And I know when I'm involving myself, you put me behind decks, I can stand there for 18 hours and non-stop. And I'm all the time like this. It's not like I do this once a month. No, I'm all the time like this. So I know that it's something that if I want to keep a long ride. I have to also take care of it and stuff like that. And it's hard for me to be very serious and, you know, going to work. I'm always sucking so much from the crowd and the energy and leaving myself, like losing myself into this. And I like that, yeah. But it's, yeah, I don't know. It's hard to say. Thank you.
