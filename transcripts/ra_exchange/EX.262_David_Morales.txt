Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Stephen Titmuss and I'm a staff writer at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is David Morales. Morales is one of the most storied and successful DJs in dance music history. He started out in New York's disco era, graduating from playing local house parties to manning the decks at the Paradise Garage, and later the influential club Red Zone. During the 90s, alongside Frankie Knuckles and the Death Mix crew, he redefined the remix by radically reworking pop music records into house music anthems. These mixes were not only some of the biggest dance tracks of their time, day, they routinely crossed over to become hits in their own right and even earned David a Grammy. In this far-ranging and occasionally emotional exchange, we discussed 40 years of house music history with one of the genre's pioneers.

A dream come true To have said how much I care Would never be enough Oh no I live for you each day my love But I love you much too much And I love you Ooh And I loved you, and I loved you, and I loved you, and I loved you, and I loved you. It wasn't all sugar and spice, and everything so nice, nor would the ♪ If you do make me feel ♪ ♪ I love so strong ♪ ♪ Had now gone wrong ♪ ♪ Maybe the feelings I said all alone ♪ ♪ I love ♪ So... grew up in Brooklyn in the 60s and 70s. Was music a feature of your family home? You know what, not really. I mean, my parents are Puerto Rican, so they migrated from Puerto Rico, so they didn't speak English. At our house, it was Latin music that they played, and we talk about Latin music from the 60s, okay? But I was always attracted to black music. I didn't care for Latin music. I really didn't appreciate Latin music until, I guess, the 80s when I actually started making music. And I really got into the details of what goes into production and stuff. And then I appreciated more for its musicianship. So black music, was that something you kind of encountered in your neighborhood? Yeah, we had an illegal social club downstairs from our apartment. And it was like the typical old school social club, black with day glow paint and stuff and, you know, and a jukebox, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't a legal place, but they play black music, you know what I mean? And I was drawn to the black music. And, you know what I mean? I, I, that's, that was what I liked. I didn't like, um, I don't want to say white music per se, rock or anything. I wasn't into that. But anyway, I didn't grow up in a white neighborhood anyway. My neighbor was Puerto Rican and black. So it was all about soul. It was about stacks. It was about one ads, Mr. Big Stuff, you know? So from listening to music on that jukebox, when did you start playing records to other people? I think when I was about, I almost want to say 11 years old, when I bought my first 45, it was Put Your Hands Together by the OJs and Philadelphia International. And I played that record to death. I stick the speaker out the window and like, you know, the bullshit sounds in my home and I put the speaker out the window and that's what it was. You know what I mean? You know, because back in the day, it was about before the technology came out of two decks and a mixer, you play one record at a time. It's really what it was, you know? So you put it on, you know. or you used to have the spindle that used to hold five records on top and when the other one finished the needle would go up and the thing would drop. You know what I mean? God, technology's come a long way. But I suppose, you know, that was obviously the beginning. When did you first see someone doing, you know, the non-stop disco mix, playing with two-turned-aples? When I was 13, my junior high school prom, and that was when the first 12-inch that was out was 10%. Double Exposure on Southsville Records. And I was just mesmerized by, here, see this guy, you know, he's got two decks, a mix. I was like, wow, I was just like caught up in it, you know. And we used to have block, we used to call them block parties in Brooklyn, where guys used to set up outside and they used to play, you know. And I was a dancer. I used to battle, you know what I mean? But the music bit was something that I... I liked music, so it wasn't about being a DJ because there was no DJ culture. It was about loving music, having the passion. And like I used to hang out with my boys and they'd say, yo, Dave, play some music for us. You know, we'd hang out, we'd hang around, we'd smoke weed, drink some beers. Like, yo, Dave, play some music for us. And that's really what it was. I just sat by the stereo and just was the selector. And then when I saw the thing about the mixer, I remember one time I played at a house party. My friend's sister-in-law was having a party in San Francisco by the village people was out at that time. I saw the guy playing, and it was two decks, two techniques, and a Clubman One mixer. He had headphones. He was cueing. I was like, wow, what is he doing? And my friend asked, yo, D, you want to play some music? I was like, yeah, sure. I didn't know what I was doing, man. I put on the headphones. I was like, I think I know what I'm doing. I flicked the switch, and I heard the cueing. I Because I did everything Braille, you know what I mean? My first mixer was a mic mixer from Radio Shack that I got from the blackout, you know, that I rigged to put two decks through it. But, you know, it had no Q and it had no nothing, you know what I mean? It was just like something like I threw together, you know? And I guess it's important to get across, like there was no guide back then, you know, you just had to kind of... pick these things up from people in your neighbourhood or that you'd seen perhaps. Well, you know what? Because it was all new. The mix wasn't important. Do you know what I mean? The mix wasn't important. You know, the whole thing about nonstop disco mix was that there was never a pause that was before. You know what I mean? There was no longer a pause. Now it was just nonstop. So that was the whole advertising. Nonstop disco mix. You know what I mean? So that's when the era of, you know, pitch control, turntables and the mixers were born. Eventually, you started to throw your own parties. Why did you want to start doing that? Well, you know, I went from entertaining my friends, which was really what it was, to entertaining more friends. And, I mean, even when I was in high school, I did hooky parties, which were great, you know what I mean? Which was, you know, people would cut class. We'd take over somebody's apartment because their parents went to work. We bring a sound system, literally, after 9 a.m., their parents go home. Oh, my God. The poor apartment used to be so wrecked. People putting their feet up against the wall and everything. And people would cut class. It was hilarious. Advertise, okay, free beer and free joints. My God, you should see, like, we have 100 kids show up to go to a party. So imagine on the block waiting as we're setting up, bringing the sound system up the stairs and all this kind of stuff, and 9 o'clock in the morning on a school day. So, I mean, it sort of started like that somewhat. And what really got me into really doing parties was I had access to a club. And I would hire or invite promoters or hosts. as it was back then. I would handle the logistics. I would just ask for, imagine, I would give them the door and everything, and I would just ask for a DJ fee. What I started to realize was that people were coming for my music. It wasn't for the host that I was having. So it made me realize that I didn't need people. And, you know, I used to design my own flyers on my lunch break at work. I used to post them on Google by the train station, the bus stops. I used to do the mailing. I used to decorate the club. I used to buy the fruit. I mean, I used to do everything, you know. I remember even dragging my records in a shopping cart during a blizzard and a storm, you know what I mean, like down on Main Avenue just to make it to my gig. I mean, the dedication was like. But it was at my neighborhood. So like when I did parties, it was in my neighborhood. So I had people from my neighborhood that I knew. And you start out 50 people, 100 people. It got to a point I was doing 600, 700 people. I started to make a living. Amazing. And what was your neighborhood like back then? then it obviously must have been a very different place it was Brooklyn Flatbush Avenue it was you know nothing pretty but you know everybody knew each other you everybody grew up in the neighborhood you know I grew up where I was in the neighborhood from like I was So here I am, 19, 20, and doing parties in my neighborhood. I mean, I did house parties during the years, but when it came to actually playing in a club, which is any person that likes to play music, any DJ, the dream is to play in a club. It really doesn't matter what club, it doesn't matter whether there's anybody at the club, you know what I mean? I just wanted to play, you know? And there could be nobody in the club. I just wanted to play, you know? And I suppose those very early club gigs, they were an avenue for a big change in your career when you met Judy Weinstein and were able to join a record pool. Can you just tell us about that? Because obviously Judy is hugely influential in your career. When I joined the record pool, really the dynamics changed. You know, to be part of the record pool was something, it was an association. And you're talking about, for the record, record pool, which had the best DJs of the tri-state area. if not America. I mean, we're talking about Jelly Bean. We're talking about Larry Levin. We're talking about T. Scott. We're talking about Tony Humphries, Bruce Forrest, some of the great mixers, you know what I mean, Steve Thompson. It's through the record pool that... Because of meeting her, I got to play at the garage. Because of her record pool, I got to meet and be introduced to remixes and producers and how I got exposed to the studio. So it was a great place to network. The record pool is almost like going to a record store. So come Thursday and Friday, everybody will get together and you talk shop, which is something that's really sorely missed today. you know, that camaraderie that, you know, you're biting me, how's it going, you talk about clubs, you know, there was more of a support structure than we have today, you know what I mean? Today, you know, it was nice when every Friday you went to the record store and you meet up, yo, come on, let's go over there, you know, and then you talk shop, yo, you know this record, you know this record, you know this record, you know what They shared their opinions about records, you know. That's gone today. You know what I mean? Yeah. You know, I suppose in a way people are more connected through the internet, but to have that social setting that... actual place where you meet, that's something that's perhaps gone from DJ culture slightly. Yeah, I mean, it was great. I mean, I was here, I mean, I went to the record store, a couple of records stores that I had no idea that some records stores like this still existed, you know? And you sort of like miss that. You know what I mean? You know, when you went to the record store and you went to your normal record store, or they knew you were coming and they have your stack ready for you when you arrive, you sit on the side, you go to your tunes, you know? maybe five copies or something came in and you know you know you had yours you know i mean you know i find it when i went to some stores it's like it's like wow it's so sad you know it because really that was such a important part of of djing technically speaking you know i'm saying absolutely yeah the culture surrounding it but just to talk about the record pool for a second like how did you get on it because obviously you're saying all of the best DJs around I'm sure it couldn't have been easy to get on a record pool like that right away I gotta recommend a friend of mine Kenny Carpenter he was a member of the pool he was working at one of the top clubs at the time it was called Bams International in Manhattan on Broadway It was a club that held 5,000 people. It was massive. I mean, you could drive a car around there. They could do laps. And in the record pool, you were only able to be a member if you played at a club. So you had to get a letter with a corporate seal on the letter to prove that you work at the club. Otherwise, it wasn't about, you had to be working. And you had to come in and you may make your top 25 because you got records, so you had to do feedback, as we call it. You played 50 bucks a month. Oh my God, for the 50 bucks, the amount of records you got me, you got easily 100 records a month. all the promos, you know what I mean? A lot of crap as well. You know what I mean? But a lot of promos, things that wouldn't come out, wouldn't come out, you know, commercially. You know what I mean? It was almost like, it was like a VIP record store. You know what I mean? Yeah, definitely. And of course, through that, you got to play at the... Paradise Garage. Were you 21? I was 21. I never played in New York. Never played in New York at that point. Never played in New York. Had you been to the Paradise Garage? I went there as a dancer. Yeah. So... I went there as a dancer a couple of times on a straight night because Friday was straight, Saturday was gay. And they never heard me play. And of course, I was one of those kids that was like mesmerized and like dream. Wow, you look at the DJ booth and, you know, I couldn't I couldn't see the booth because it was up. But my guy, you know, he just you fantasize, you know. And when I got asked to play, I really thought it was a joke. Because it was like, there were so many other DJs that really deserved to play there before me. You know what I mean? That I knew for a fact, you know? I mean, a lot of people weren't happy that... I played because it felt like, who's this guy? You know what I mean? And I never... I went from Brooklyn, from playing like at a small social club to playing at the Paradise Garage. You know what I mean? In one weekend, I played a Friday and a Saturday. I played 22 hours. I play 11 hours Friday and I play 11 hours Saturday. Amazing. Was that the one that Jocelyn Brown performed as well? They said, who do you want to perform? I said, I want Jocelyn Brown. Jocelyn Brown was one. The other one was, the record was No News, but I forgot. No, the other one was Captain Rap. I come to realize it was one of the first records that Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis wrote and produced and I had no idea. Well, you had the ear back then for the hit. I mean, you know, back then it was all music. Yeah, of course. You know what I mean? But speaking specifically about the gig, you know, what was going through your mind? So young, you know, you're playing this amazing club. Do you remember? Were you nervous? Did you remember what your feelings were? Well, the thing was that they had Thorne's 125 Mark IIs. And I asked, can they install techniques? They were like, no, you have to play in a alternative. I was like, shit, you know? But when I did my first mix, I looked at a friend and I was like, wow, the turntables were amazing. They were just so smooth. I just knew it was going to be amazing. You know, you talk about three decks in the reel-to-reel. You know what I mean? It was like, you know, no monitors. So you imagine you were up like on the second level. There were no monitors back in them days. You played off the delay in the room. So imagine, you You had to spin, you had to be locked, your mix had to be locked, and you played with a delay, which is pretty, you know, but it was amazing. It was amazing. I could have kept playing for days, man. And after that first weekend, I came back the following year in January, two weekends. straight. You know, the guy was really impressed with me, you know what I mean? The thing was that they wanted someone that nobody knew, that wasn't part of the politics, part of the drama. So I was really naive to it, because I wasn't part of the scene. I was from Brooklyn. You know what I mean? I was a knucklehead from Brooklyn. And so I wasn't part of the scene, the drama, the politics, the groupies, you know what I mean? Because imagine how Lavi's groupies, his friends, like, nobody knew me. Nobody knew me. I came out of left field. Yeah, yeah. You know what I mean? I came out of left field. People were like, how did you get that? You know what I mean? People were jealous. People were like, how dare you? How dare he? I was like, who the But in a way it was perfect for Larry because he didn't piss people off around him. He had this new kid come through. No, he didn't. Larry didn't ask me to play. Oh, so it was the owner. It was the owner. Oh, I see. They did it to get on his nerves. That's what they did. So they had to get somebody. that's outside of the loop that wouldn't be afraid of Larry, that, you know, wouldn't be, don't want to be part of that. You know what I mean? So was I used? Maybe. You know what I mean? I didn't know. I didn't care. You know what I mean? It was. I got a lot of exposure and it made me the new kid on the block. Absolutely. So from there, did you start to get more gigs in Manhattan and in New York generally? Oh yeah, sure, yeah. I was hot. I was hot. And what were the other clubs that were an influence on you? I read that Better Days was one as well. The Loft was one. Yeah. The Loft was a big influence. I went from being a commercial DJ, by that I mean, you know, where I played, I knew about the hit records, to underground music by going to the Loft, all these imports, being introduced to vinyl mania records as opposed to downtown records. And by no means it was. You know, you heard things at the law for the garage, and you saw classics. You know, some records were $40, $50, $75. You mean some classics. You know, there were some records that were hard to get. That the only place to get those records was by Binomania. My first resident in the city was a place called Inferno. First it was called Thriller, then they changed it to Inferno. And, you know, we did Axiom Day. We were talking 1985. Around the same time I started to do Better Days on a Thursday night. And then somewhere around '86, '87, I was doing Sam Zabon. You know, I played to different places along the way, the world. Then my next big one was Red Zone. Red Zone was a big pivot for me as well. I just started coming to the UK, and I was playing music from the UK. I was really one of the only guys that was playing this different music. playing KLF, What Time Is Love, Soul to Soul, Snap to Power, Pump Up the Jam, you know? So aside from American house music, you know? And I was mixing a lot of records at that time for the UK. I mean, it's the UK that put my name on the block when it came to remixing records. It wasn't America. But all these imports were coming over, you know, they had my name. So anyway, from the world, you know, The Tunnel, Club USA, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. All of them, basically. When did you first start editing records? Because that was obviously a part of your career, you know, your move from the DJ to the studio. Was that like the mid 80s? Well, editing, when I started with editing, I started with a small reel to reel. I used to do like my own. mashups per se. You know what I mean? So I would put two records together or let's say I'd have one main record and I'd float some other records on top or overlay and record pieces and then edit it together and I would play my own special edit at the club. From there, I went to, I was editing, I would edit people's remixes. They would say, you know, because back in them days, it was all tape. So you had these reels that each had like many different passes because back in them days, there was no automation. So you had a bunch of passes with different pieces. So you imagine, I would get 10 boxes. of different parts of the mix and I have to listen to all of them and then remember pieces. Because you have two machines, one that played the main one, one to copy to, and then you edit it to copy. So from those 10 boxes, I will give a 12-inch a DAWB and a radio. And how long would something like that take? My God, it really depends on the time, you know. It depends how much music you have to listen to. You know what I mean? Yeah, totally variable. Editing was what got me first into the area of production. and it was Playing at Better Days with Bruce Forrest that he was remixing at the time. He was one of the big mixers at the time, and he was like a super geek, you know what I mean? Bruce, we're talking about 1984, 85, where he had samplers with triggers in a DJ booth. He had a drum machine and a keyboard, you know what I mean? besides three decks in a reel-to-reel. In 1984, that's amazing. In 1985. Yeah. So, you know, you're doing live overdubs, drum overdubs, have David Coley come play keyboard overdubs, two Korg samplers with a foot pedal to trigger and another trigger to set it. So it was like... It was like doing live overdubs over a set. - So he was a big influence on you, Bruce, then? - He was the man. Besides being a brilliant DJ, but production-wise. I mean, he inspired me to get my first Casio CZ 101 keyboard, my first drum machine, you know? I was trying to play a keyboard even though I couldn't play a note. You know what I mean? I practically still can't play a note. But you know, it really inspired me to go that route. I mean, I never... I was never a musician. I never aspired to be a musician. I just love music, you know? So I guess your first record, you know, official record was two Puerto Ricans, a black man and a Dominican. No, my first one was actually some in sync, sometimes love. Oh, okay. On Easy Street Records, produced by Blaze. Oh. I actually even got them the record deal. You got Blaze the record deal? Yeah, I was paying at Zanzibar and I met Kevin Hedge. And I even got them the record deal. Amazing. And I had David Cole play keyboards on it. And that was my first remix. And then I did a couple of things for A&M Records. My first big remix was Imagination, Instinctual, Arthur Baker produced. That was 1987. And then shortly after that, I remixed Love Will Save the Day by Whitney Houston. For me, that was like when he just came out. And I was like, wow, I'm mixing Whitney Houston. My God, they wanted a house mix. It was like, okay, I'll get my house mix. But it was too cool for them. Oh, really? It wasn't commercial enough. And it became really the only released promo. And I really was disappointed because it would have meant a lot for my career at the time that I was starting off in the remixing game. Well, of course, that progressed a lot much later in your career, you know, soon after. Well, you know what, remixing, I mean, remixing today is another story. I mean, people do remixing today. It's a whole other game. I mean, when the remixing game first started, remixing was really about taking the original element and just extending it. Maybe you added... of things but you didn't go that way. I mean you couldn't distort the record. It was really just create an intro, create a break, create an outro piece. Then it was about okay add a couple of keyboards. And then it became, but you always worked with a song. You understand? You always worked with a song. So I was a remixer. So my job was to remix records, period. End of story, you know? And then, surely soon it became, once time stretching started, then everything had to be time stretched. And then when it came to the point when it started with the time stretch, That's when you got rid of all the music. So now it changed. Even when I did Dream Lover. When I did Dream Lover, it changed the whole record. Now it's almost like rewriting a new song. Okay, it's still the same title. Maybe some lyrics are the same. But I actually rewrote the record. I mean, we went from pop to a dance record. But yeah, I didn't get any publishing. I didn't get any royalties. You know what I mean? But, you know, yet I produced something new. She came into the studio. We sang it. We programmed it. We did the whole thing. Yeah, I think that's a really important point to make because, you know, Mariah at that time was, you know, a very big star. You know, 93, she married Tommy Mottola, like the kind of boss of the whole label. But Were you surprised that she went back and did it again that way? Well, yeah, because I really called a bluff. Because when they sent it to me, the original, I was like, nah, this is too baller gum. I can't do shit with this record. It's not happening. I'm like, the other way it's going to happen is if he sang it. And they actually floated the idea to them. And they were like, OK, should we sing it? I never produced a record. I mean, two Puerto Ricans and a black man was a whole other story. That was just being at the record pool, But this was Mariah Carey. I'm going to the studio. It's like one of my first artists is fucking Mariah Carey. You know what I mean? And she was like, you know, it was Honey Winnie back in them days, you know? And she never goes into the studio with a producer at all. At all. She's one that does things on her own. She doesn't need, you know, she knows what she wants. She used to tell me, she's like, you're the only one I go into the studio with She's like, it's just, you know, I brought something different to the table. You know what I mean? Because she wasn't into it. dance music, a house per se. And obviously the results were, you know, obviously great for everyone involved. Yeah, sure. I mean, I did about, I've done at least 11, 12 records with her. Yeah. And the majority has been re-sang, you know? Yeah, absolutely. And I guess it's a very important thing to note about your career. You've almost changed the dynamics of a remix, like you said when you first... No, changed it for sure because it wasn't just, it It was Shabba Ranks, Mr. Lover Man. That was a dancehall record. And again, a record that I mixed, I changed it, I flipped the whole thing. I even sampled Maxi Priest from another record that I did with him. The record was really called Champion Lover. They even changed the name of the song. But again, all I got was a fee. That record sold over a few million records. So the original writers and producers, they ran to the bank. But it had nothing to do with them. Anyway, I got Aretha Franklin, Seal. And I suppose it's you and Judy in a way that have helped kind of build a bridge for remixes of a certain caliber to actually get better deals, to get the writing credits and stuff like that, you know, before you guys did those kind of mixes. Well, we weren't getting any writer's credit. You weren't getting it. You weren't getting it. I mean, eventually down the road, you got royalties, but you weren't getting writer's credit, which you really, I mean, even today, I you know, it's really not fair because the mixing, remixing game has changed so much, the dynamics that you're giving away your production in reality, you know what I mean? So no matter what, I mean, and today, more worse than ever, I mean, and it's only because it's the only outlet for people to, to show, you know, to expose themselves, technically speaking. But like a lot of these things, you can't even call them remixes in reality. They're really reproductions or rewrites even, you know. And I suppose in that mid-90s period when you was having, you know, huge success, you know, taking these records and turning them into bigger hits, you know, like Shabba Ranks you mentioned. For me it was Shabba, Pump Up The Jam, Finally. Space Cowboy was another one. I mean, that wasn't even a song. That was a jam. Yeah. You know what I mean? And that one was really like taking pieces and creating a song, like verse, chorus, verse, chorus. It wasn't like that, you know what I mean? But, I mean, it was how I got my reputation. And I suppose, you know, when you're churning out these hits, you know, massive hits in Europe and all across the world, you know, some of the, you must be getting huge offers at that time from major labels, you know, to work with their stuff. Did you ever turn anything down? You know, even though the money must have been great, you know? Oh, yes. I think my biggest one was probably the Rolling Stones. And they're like, we want to know what he's done. I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? Are you joking? Like, really? I was like, you know what? Do your homework. You know what I mean? Yeah, I've turned down Whitney Houston. I've turned down... You know, one of my favorite people I worked with that was really nice was U2. They were great. They sent me champagne. Thank you very much. I mean, I made Edge and Bono, hooked up with them in Japan. You know, they were really... You know, for some people... was great to work with. Mariah was one hard worker, brilliant. I don't care what people say, she works. I don't know if she lip syncs or whatever. All I know, she works. She knows what the hell she's doing. Another one is Seal. Amazing. One of the most amazing voices I've ever heard in my life. Wow. And, you know, I've worked over the years with some amazing talent. I mean, some of the best. I mean, Aretha Franklin. I think my... Julio Iglesias, even. I think my most intimidating... And we're talking about icons. We're talking about legends. We're talking about real legends. I mean, so maybe some kids will hear this right now that we're talking about. Julio Iglesias, please. But you really don't know what that is. For a person that, you know, these people are legends. They are icons from the generation, you know what I mean? They're in the Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, these artists, you know what I mean? They've worked with the best. They've sold millions and millions and millions of records. Me going into a studio with Enrico Franklin, it's like, Enrico is my most intimidating. artists I've ever worked with. Because Rita Franklin worked with Quincy Jones. She's the queen of soul. You know what I mean? I wasn't even born when she was already making hits, records. You know what I mean? And here I am working with the queen of soul. You know what I mean? When I look back on my career as far as making records, what has brought me this far, you know what I mean? is working and having the opportunity and the pleasure of working with such great musicians from around the world. And we're not talking about DJ culture. We're talking about music. We're talking about songwriting, production. We're talking about a whole other level. You know what I mean? But a great producer... If you're a good DJ, it makes you a better DJ. Why do you think that is? Because you understand music more. Yeah. You understand keys. You have programs out now with this track or a record box. There's something about keys, so they show you the key. Some people know nothing about keys. I don't know anything about keys. It's all about having a good ear. It's about understanding arrangement. It's about having records talk to each other. Do you understand? Because you're understanding the melody. So you're interacting with melodies, rhythms, you know? You obviously mentioned many of the great artists you've worked with in your career. But perhaps one of the most important ones in your own personal career was Frankie. Can you just tell us how you first met Frankie Knuckles? I mean, Frankie met in New York. And of course, I've heard about Frankie Knuckles. I mean, from Trax Records, from DJ International, and of course, from Judy as well. You know, I mean, I played Frankie Knuckles remix from Trax. You know what I mean? I played Baby Wants to Ride. I played Your Love, you know? There was another record he did, I think it was Peter Black, it was Only the Strong Survive, and that was on DJ International. So I met him through Judy, he came to the record pool, he was playing at The World. And we immediately hit it off and became friends, real close friends. And, you know, with Frankie, together we launched our remix careers. We created the Deaf Mix Sound. I mean, we owned walls in record stores. We come to England, we were like gods, you know what I mean? And, you know, with Frankie, I traveled the world with him, you know? And I spent a lot of time with him. You know what I mean? We were on the road. We were in the studio. You know, we were beyond mates. Yeah, absolutely. We were beyond mates, you know what I mean? You made a statement, you know what I mean? First time at the Grammys, first time traveling, you know what I mean? You know, we traveled together in the beginning of my, you know, my career. So, you know, Frankie was a very special person, you know, very... Very special. Frankie was Frankie. Frankie had a unique, Frankie had a style. Frankie just had an aura about him that was just beautiful. You know? It was really, really hard losing it. It's got to be tough when you, you know, someone for 20 years you've spent hundreds of hours with, working with, you know, like a brother, like you say, like a family member. But we were death mix. We did Ibiza. You know, we were the brand together. You know what I mean? We, you know, you have masters at work, you have Kenny and Louie. that was me and frankie you know what i mean one thing i found interesting that i read you know that obviously that was obviously a huge blow losing frankie but one thing it did very quickly number of days it inspired you to go back into the studio and start making music because you thought that was what frankie would have wanted you to do well you know what it's like when i found out it's funny because i saw him like probably like the week before in miami And I remember hugging him and telling him, I love you, I miss you. And then I got to New York, and it's very numbing. It's like I couldn't even grip it, you know. And I've lost people before in my life over the years, but Frankie was really hard. You know, it's like I lost something. And for three days, I didn't come out of my hotel room. I didn't go on the Internet. I didn't want to answer my phone. I mean, besides talking to Judy, because we had to be there for each other as a support structure, you know. But aside from the family, I... I couldn't, you know, and even to write something, you know what I mean? It's like it took me a moment to, and even to write something was very difficult to write something, you know what I mean? It's like the emotions that are pouring out. And to finally let go, but I had to arrive at the point to realize that he wouldn't want me to sit around. You know what I mean? I was like, this is not what he would want. You know what I mean? It's like enough with the moping, you know what I mean? try to not make light of it. It's not that, but, you know, it is what it is. And, you know, we have to carry on. You know what I mean? So try to turn it into another way as opposed to a moment of sadness because it's sadness no matter what. You know what I mean? It's like even me trying to talk about it now. I had to stop myself from, you know, breaking down. And sometimes... I'll listen to some records that we've done or that he's made. And he just brings it full circle, you know. Sorry. No, it's fine. You know what I mean? So, you know, it came to like, so even now, you know, we've done some tributes and it was more like, you know, you have to celebrate. You know what I mean? We didn't have a funeral service for him awake. You know, we brought some of the great singers that we've worked with and there's me, Sons of Black. this come in and she's taking the pressure and you know we put a really beautiful show on and we sent them off in a good way yeah and you know i i had friends who are the one you've done at glastonbury and you know they said it was the best thing they saw there you know the best thing they saw that year you know and the emotion that you brought to those tribute concerts was was really special and it touched a lot of people and i think as you were saying, Frankie would want people to celebrate in that way. I think you really carried it off. And I think, you know, that's ready to be celebrated. His passing definitely... had triggered something in me, musically speaking. And a lot has changed for me musically since Frankie's passing. You know, people will say, oh, you know, you have to step up and you have to carry on the torch. And it's like... I could never fill Frankie's shoes. Nobody can. You know what I mean? So I'm not here to try to, I'm just here to carry on how he will. I'm not here to duplicate, to make Frankie records, because nobody can. Even though we work together, there's nobody that was closest to him when it comes to making music than me. That's for sure. So it's just about, you know, carry on. There'll be nobody that will ever be able to replace him, come to DeafMix. and be my sidekick again. I don't think I will ever have that again. Thinking about some of the work that you're doing today, you're still very active. You're still doing Red Zone stuff, for example. Can you tell me a little bit about how you decided to do some more of that kind of older stuff? Well, you know, did anybody tell you house music is back? You know, house is back. The 90s is back. Does that seem weird when people start saying that to you? Because you are before house music. You know what? They had to accept it once. Disclosure did something that sounded very 90s. It's like, oh, it's cool in a young kid, but God forbid a guy that's from the 90s. It is like, oh, I want this. You know, the Red Zone was a big moment for me, and the Red Zone mixes were very happening. I mean, very popular because the Red Zone mixes was, it wasn't New York. It was something different. I mean, there was something unique about it. Some people said to me that, I mixes from Sasha to Digwee to Carl Cox to George, everybody back in them days played red zone mixes. So it was, it was something, the red zone mixes were edgy, dark, you know what I mean? They were always dark. So people always say, you know, why don't you do some Red Zone stuff? Red Zone stuff, DJs around the world, guys have been playing for years, do some Red Zone stuff. It's like, okay, you know, it's almost like going back to basics. You know what I mean? So I just released Red Zone Project Volume 2. Last year I did Volume 1, which was like an EP, four-track EP, I think. I think this one's like eight. a night. I did a new, a phase single that I released in February with, no January with Kim Mazzel called Lovin'. I have a new phase single coming out in June called Everybody Get Up featuring Keith Anthony Fluitt. I have a new record with Janice Robinson coming out as well. I have another one. I'm at the point now that like I'm releasing something every single month now. I'm in love with Ableton. I love Ableton. I live with Ableton. I mean, my studio's right here. Literally, right next to my feet. You know what I mean? I got a little keyboard. No, you're going to laugh. It's like, I'm not kidding. You know what I mean? So, you know. I love that, you know, not to get away from what you're saying, that the technology and stuff, you know, so I'm into, the redstone is like my tracky side. That's where I'm at with that. It's very interesting that, yeah, you're just pointing to a tiny keyboard that you're pulling out from your bag there. In the 90s, yourselves, I think a lot of people might not even appreciate this, yourself and Master at Work, you guys would spend hundreds, literally hundreds of hours in the studio a week almost. I used to spend an average five days a week in the studio. And I'm talking about almost 24-7. I would sleep on the sofa. what makes you have that kind of work rate because you know that's we weren't working we were having fun yeah you're having jam sessions yeah you know what i mean you're with a group of people i mean with musicians you're creating you're making music it's not tedious you know i mean the only thing that's tedious is listening to the same record for 48 hours You know what I mean? You know, day one was overdubs. Day two was mixing. So, you know, there was an average of 48 hours spent on each record. So I was doing an average of two to three records a week. Wow. And do you remember any particular weeks that were particularly great? Like, you know, It's been a week where you, you know, say done Alison Limerick, Where Love Lives, and then maybe another track the other week. Yeah, for sure. And there were some records I was like, you know, but I was in a, I was a remixer. My job was a remixer. You know what I mean? So if a record company wanted to pay me money to remix a record, that was my job. You know? So back in them days, it was different tempos. You know It was about remixing a record, making it more danceable is what it was all about. It wasn't that I, whether I played it, whether it's something I would play in a club or not, it wasn't about that. And I suppose around that period, it was one of the first periods where you really started touring a lot, you know. Was it unusual for you when the first time you came to say to UK to play like an hour set where you'd come from this New York culture of playing 10, 11 hours? I threw the funny story. I came over for the DMC convention and I was asked to play with Pete Tong and Nikki Holloway at Cinder Astoria. And, you know, I come from the school, you play first record and last record. Okay, you're a guest, DJ, but I assume that once I get on, I'm on. That's it. I play for 55 minutes, and then they were bringing on an act. It was Jomanda at the time. And Pete Thompson said, yo, thanks. That was great. I mean, I was like, huh? So nobody told me I was only playing for 55 minutes. Yeah. I just thought once I I'm like, listen, I'm okay. No, no, no, that's how we do things. And everybody from New York was like, what happened? And I'm like, all I was doing was warming up. I didn't even get to play any of my big records yet. I didn't go anywhere. You know what I mean? So it wasn't like, wow, you know. It took me years to really, because I was never the kind, come on and shoot my load. Bang it. I mean, I need two hours to get accustomed to acclimate to what's going on before I even go anywhere. I mean, it's still like, I mean, okay, I prefer longer sets than short ones. And so when some guy's like, oh, two hours, oh, it's too long. I can't play. Oh, my God, I'm tired. I'm like, huh? I'm like, man, you have no idea. I mean, my longest set was 27 hours. Where was that? At Club Ace Home, Stegger in Montreal, 27 hours. I mean, and I used to do once a month of an average for nine years, the last Saturday of every month. And that was a minimum of 15 hours. You know what I mean? You play first, second, like you play whatever you play. It was great. And the people were going anywhere. They came for the music. You know what I mean? Strictly for the music. So, you know, and it was great. I mean, when it's your home, when it's your place, you can do whatever you want. It's the beauty of it. I suppose the concept of a resident now doesn't even necessarily exist in modern dance music, not in the way that where someone's playing for 15 hours regularly. No, and you want to know something? What's better about not being a resident, and by a resident, I don't mean... somebody that just opens is that, see, when you're a resident and, you know, you were able to break records. You know what I mean? You broke a record one week. They came the next week looking for that record because it was a promo. Nobody has it. You can't buy it. You know what I mean? People are like, wow, he played this record. My, they can't wait to hear that record. You know what I mean? I mean, that's how you broke records. And the longevity today of records is, you know what I mean? It's almost like non-existent. I mean, since when is an artist putting out two albums in one year? Oh my God. You know what I mean? Or every year, you know what I mean? It's just, you know. Yeah, I suppose it's both the combination of... lack of people breaking records, but also so much more music around nowadays that people feel like they've got to make a run. I mean, even the Winter Music Conference years ago, even the Winter Music Conference, I mean, you know, in the vinyl days, there was always, there was one or two records that popped out from the conference that there was a big buzz on, you know what I mean? That everybody talked about. Now it's just, you know, you have ultra fes. It's just, it's like going to a festival for a week, you know what I mean? And so many DJs and so many genres of music. I mean, at that time it was just house music. So, you know, it was easier to, you know, to stuff. But today it's just all over the place, you know what I mean? And even for each genre of music, it's hard for things to come through. Do you find that limiting for younger DJs? Obviously, you come from a place where genres, you know, really didn't mean so much. You know, it was more varied when you first started playing. Now you get DJs playing very specific subgenres of music. Do you think that has a negative effect? I think it's kind of like limiting and actually boring to play one style of music. I mean, I like everything. I mean, you know, we played everything back in the day. I mean, you play John Lomoboro, you play Kraftwerk, you play the... So, you know, I think, and even in the early days, like... I mean, in the 90s, I mean, you know, okay, you played some house and there was some techno-ish kind of things. Pump Up the Jam was a different thing. Nice of the Jaguar was a different thing. I mean, What Time is Love was a different thing, but there were great records. You know what I mean? Snap to Power, Soul to Soul, Keep On Moving. These were all played together during the night. You know what I mean? And it was interesting. You know what I For me, if I just play one particular type of sound... it'd be linear for two hours just the same or drop after drop after drop build up build up build up build up build up it's almost like playing one long record and that's obviously not a great thing for the audience or it might be yeah no for some audience i mean this is what it is yeah this is it is this is what it's become this is what it's become One thing where that isn't a thing is your Kings of House project. Yourself, Louis Vega, Tony Humphries. How did you guys... decide to play together because you must have known each other for you know many many years oh yeah we each know we know each other since the 80s 25 years easy and years ago louis had a party called the evil souls and me him and tony played and it was at vinyl we played together and then john david had this body and soul wanted to do something again and they had to come up with a name So first it became Three Kings was the idea. That was the idea. And it was me, Tony, and Louis. But the original concept was to play 90s house music. So it was a huge success. Now it's Kings of House in New York City, so we were able to brand it in New York City. It's mine and Louie's project. I mean, Tony is a guest DJ. For me and Louie, we run the thing. We've been making merchandising. We've been doing parties. We've been starting to tour around the world. I mean, we did Ministry of Sound. We did Hard Times. We did Italy. We're getting ready to do Ibiza, the IMS, IMS, blah, blah, blah. It's been going really, really well. So what started at, the thing is that me and Louis, we make records, and Tony's, and we don't want to play 90s music. So it's really, it's a combination of everything, new and old. Do you each bring something different to the table, perhaps? Well, it's funny. I think, well, we each do play, do our own thing. And then at some point, it's almost like we do back. back or on top of each other, you know. Me and Louis really get along really well together. I mean, we'll be playing on top of each other. You know what I mean? It's not really back to back, together. You know what I mean? What's brilliant is it's so much fun because it's not scripted. We never know what's going on. It's really great when... one of us pulls out a gem and we'll look at each other like, Tony will pull something out of his hat, Louis will pull something, I'll be like. So we were like, it's nice. We have fun. You know, we have fun. You know, there's a lot of history there. You know what I mean? So we dig. So it could be a disco record. You know what I mean? It could be something from the 70s. It could be something from the 80s. It could be something from the 90s or something new as well. Is that perhaps the secret? You know, you've been doing this for 40 years. Is it about, you Is that how you've stayed so engaged with dance music for all these years? I think the main thing is the passion, for sure. My roots are one record at a time. Before the era of mixing, non-stop mixing, so we're going back a long time of what the culture was really about. And it's really music, programming, a tune at a time, you know? It wasn't about being famous. It wasn't about festivals. It wasn't about even people looking at you while you were playing. You used to be in the corner. You could be behind the glass. You were somewhere in the stratosphere. Nobody saw you, but people came because the music was good. So it wasn't about people looking at you. This is what it's become. I don't know how to do anything else. It's the reality. You know what I mean? 40 years, so I don't work. You know what I'm saying? I look at it as work. Sometimes a gig can be flat, for sure. I mean, Hadoop doesn't have... It's about consistency. You know what I mean? Two nights are better than two out of three. You know what I mean? I mean, like I said, I love Ableton now. I love it that I get inspired. I hear something. Oh, I want to do this to it. I mean, you know, right away, boom, boom, boom, boom. And I look forward to playing it. You know, it's all of that. Do you perhaps have a career highlight that, you know, over those 40 years, you think, you know, perhaps something that stands out the most as something you feel super proud of? Proud to be who I am today. I think that's the way to sum it up. 40 years. I'm 52 years old. I still feel I'm at the top of my game. I haven't lost a step. I still have a passion for it. It's not a competition. So when people say, oh, this one's a better DJ, better than this one, it's bullocks, you know what I mean? It's not a sport, you know what I'm saying? I learned things from other people. I learned things from David Mancuso, the law, where it wasn't about mixing. It was about selection and record at a time. you know, great sound, level management, you know, there's a lot of how to manipulate sounds, how to manipulate songs to people, you know, it's a whole, I don't want to say there's a science to it, but it's more than just putting on a pair of gloves and like... putting on, you know, sparkly headphones and like woo, woo, woo and make a heart and so, you know what I mean? It's not, you know, it's just something I want to have as much fun with the people. I don't want to be in my own world. I want to be in the same, I want to be in the world together. Yeah. Has that ever been a challenge in your career? Because at various points, you know, you have been marketed as something of a superstar DJ for want of a better expression. But, you know, throughout this interview, you've talked about, you know, the culture and the importance of, you know, selection and things like that. Has that ever been a challenge to kind of bring those two worlds for people to understand what David Morales is really about? You know, you're not about necessarily superstar DJs and things like that. Well, I think because I've managed it well. is why I'm still out here. You know, so it's not a fad. You know, it's natural. It's, you know, it's natural. It's like, right, you know, it's just there. I mean, so I was explaining this to someone. They said, well, how do you become a good DJ? And it's like, it's not about trying to become something. You can teach someone the fundamentals. You understand? You can... teach someone how to beat match and all those kind of things but he has had his own ear You know what I mean? He has to hear music. He's going to hear music in his way. I can't explain to him to hear music how I hear music. He's going to have to hear it, he or she, has to hear it the way they hear it. You know, it's like you and I, somebody can give us 10 records, the same 10 records. The difference is going to be how we chain those 10 records together that will make the difference between you and I. We're going to tell two different stories.
