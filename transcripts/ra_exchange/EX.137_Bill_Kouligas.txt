Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Will Lynch, and I'm the Associate Editor of Resident Advisor. Bill Cooligus is the man behind Pan, an experimental label that was one of our favorites from last year. Pan's been running since 2008, but really hit its stride in the past year or so. It put out more than a dozen records in 2012, including breakthrough releases. by Heatsick and Lee Gamble. According to Kouligas, Pan has no single guiding principle, but it does have a distinct personality. It's bold and forward-thinking, but still down-to-earth. This is evident in the music itself, which ranges from drone and sound collage to bizarre takes on dance music, and also in the label's eye-catching artwork, all of which is handmade by Kouligas and his friend Catherine Politis. 2013 should be Pan's biggest year yet, and not just in terms of releases. The label and its artists were a cornerstone of last month's CTM festival, and Cooligus is planning a new festival of his own, which should take place in New York this spring. Chatting with Cooligus in Berlin last week, we got a feel for the perspective and work ethic that makes something like Pan possible. you A couple weeks out now, how was your CTM experience? CTM was pretty fun. I didn't manage to go to all the shows, but I got to see a lot of good things over the week. And the pun night, I thought it went really well. Everyone delivered like, you know, what they had in mind. And I think everything linked and it was pretty interesting to see all these different projects kind of being part of a greater picture together in one night. I thought it worked really well. How typical is it to do like a big pan showcase like that? I've done a lot of shows before more like one day events. Nothing in that scale though. I did a showcase at Ansaun festival in Poland last November but that was more like it was split in three days and it wasn't like just one thing. kind of like represented the label and the overall aesthetic like it did on Wednesday night at CTM. So that was probably the biggest thing? Yeah, I think so, yeah. And who played at it again? I know, I remember people saying Mark Fell was the highlighter. Yeah, Jarmoff opened the night, who is a young artist from Athens. He works with samplers and... He makes like a weird collage music with like electronic and jazz influences and more abstract sounds. And then it was Mark Feld from S&D who did a sound and light installation at the space, basically triggering kick drum sounds with strobes and he had these gigantic sky dancers in the space that looked completely odd. And yeah, basically like the sound was triggering all these strobe lights and it was pitch black so you could just see the figures in the space. It was really good actually. It was really interesting to see the whole space being alienated with this kind of like different experience. Yeah, somebody told me that it almost seemed like it was a parody of a rave or something. Well, I think that was his whole concept, like so different. I don't know, I think he was just being a little bit sarcastic about this whole dance culture that's been... heavily associated with that space. I mean, Berghain is one of the most important places for club culture, basically. So is that specifically made for that performance of Berghain? Well, he's worked with similar ideas before, but that specific project was made for that, yeah. Would you say people like Mark Fell and Pan in general, would you say you have kind of a complicated relationship with club culture, dance music? Well, I think, I mean, I've released a few records that are, let's say they're more like beat driven, like more like dance oriented, but I don't think they're necessarily straight dance records because I think they use a different language. in general than the one that's been used in the club scene. There are people that are heavily related to experimental music and they just use some elements from dance music to do their own thing, you know. Yeah, I guess it seems to me that overall the music you release is not that closely related to club culture, really. But the kind of house and techno world seems very accepting of it. I think it's just a different dialogue than the one that's been used so far, in a way. I mean, a lot of these people are... big fans of club music and you know they go out clubbing and partying and they or some others they have roots in like you know from the 90s some older people like you know Lee Gamble or Mark Feld they used to go out at raves in the late 90s and they used to make music back then too but they've stepped out did other stuff and I think recently they just got back to it and they're kind of like combined both worlds, like the more like experimental and artistic world to the club and dance music thing they used to do in the past. Yeah, it seems like maybe it's kind of a natural process that you were into. Yeah, exactly. It seems to me like that's kind of happening in music in general at the moment. I think that different genres crossover and... people are kind of opening up to different styles and I think it's interesting this combination of styles that's been happening over the recent years, over the past years. And yeah, I think it's... quite refreshing sometimes to hear like a noise guy making dance music or vice versa you know i don't think it's always successful but i think it's quite healthy that people try things out and they don't follow like a specific formula that it's been used over and over and over again. It seems like that's an outlook that you follow with the label. Well I'm interested in it. It's not only that but I like when people like try to experiment with with different styles and like different perspectives into things. And when you, um, hear music like that, or say when you're checking something out that could potentially be released on PON, what kind of reaction do you have like to something that you like? Like, is it, um, you know, sort of a simple like enjoyment of music or is it more of like, you feel kind of intellectually I think it's a combination of both because it's interesting it's important for me to like the music first of all but it's also as important to think about it and feel related or like feel intrigued by the whole concept behind it or like the approach or attitude that some specific artists have and why it's happening So I can sort of take it back a little bit. You started Pan in 2008? Yeah, December 2008 when I was still living in London. But shortly after I moved to Berlin, like two months after. So basically, I would say the label officially started in Berlin in 2009. And what kind of led up to the label starting? I mean, I play music myself too, and I was involved in the underground noise experimental scene that was happening around those years. didn't really have like a strong passion to do a label back then it was more like a fun project to do and I had some recordings that I liked from other people and the first release was a split between me and a Japanese artist And I thought, oh, you know, that could be nice and fun to do like a small run, like a special edition vinyls from that stuff. And also me and my friend Catherine Politis, who is working with me on the whole artwork and packaging. We were working on this visual project together and when we had something more solid as an idea, I thought it would be good to combine the music that I was involved in and wanted to release and the whole visual project that we had worked on at the time. So it just kind of like happened, you know. At what point did it feel like the label was kind of growing into something more than just like a fun side project? I think that it just grew naturally. Like I liked the whole process and... I was already involved in organizing shows and tours and working with other people in music and playing music, DJing and all that. So the more records came out, the more I got passionate about it. I got more involved and I thought it was really nice to continue doing it. Yeah, it seems like 2012 was kind of a breakthrough year for the label, at least in terms of how much music it put out. It was like 12 or 13 records. Yeah, 13, yeah. What was different or what created that flood of music? As I said, I don't really consider it as a breakthrough year. yeah in a way that I did the most last year that I've that I had done in the past but because the label is still very young it's only like four years that it's been out so I think that you know the more records that came out like and the more shows that we all did in the past years like the more people showed interest and like got to know about this whole thing so that's i guess that's one of the reasons that people paid more attention last year And also there were a lot of different releases that gained interest from different sides, more like some art projects that got documented on a record and some more dance-oriented records came out. So I think a combination of all these different things kind of helped. that happened in a way. I feel like the records that sort of take the lead in terms of, you know, popularity or whatever are what you kind of described as the more dance-oriented records, but what to you is an important, more art project-related release? I think that dance-oriented records got more popular just because I sense that there's a better ground in the media for this kind of music. And like the more, let's say, difficult experimental avant-garde records, they're just too hard to... get them around and have a lot of reviews and stuff. Of course, there is a different audience for that, and there's a lot of blogs and music magazines that cover this stuff too, but in the more popular culture, it's easier to promote the more, let's say, accessible-sounding records. That's why these records... Became in a way more popular than the others, but I don't think they're like better or worse or like, you know, I feel equally for for any every release I've done But what would be? For you like what what's an example of one of the more difficult releases that sort of was overlooked? I don't know. I mean, I feel quite happy that even like records like the Helm record, which is like a drone concrete collage record by a London artist and good friend of mine called Luke Younger. I mean, that record, when it came out, I wasn't sure if it's going to get the same attention as the others, but like a lot of people got really into it. And yeah, it had some really good exposure in general. How does it usually work for each release? Like, is it someone that comes to you or is it mostly people that you already knew? I think that the most people that I've worked with are like either good friends of mine or people that have been known for years. Or like, let's say the older artists that I've published music by, they're artists that I'm heavily influenced or know their work really well. And I thought it would be great to work with. So when I approached them, it was more like, hey, let's do something together because this and that. And that's how it went. it happens but the majority is like just the close friends of mine basically so people like Lee Gamble I've been only for like 8 years from London and as I said I've been playing music myself too so I've toured a lot and I've organized a lot of shows etc so like all these people were like familiar to me or like their work so with Lee for example I've been knowing him for like I don't know like seven or eight years we played many shows together in London and I asked him a long time ago he was one of the first artists I asked to do something on the label and it just took him a while to put all this together So his first release for Pan was The Diversions? Yeah. And you had a significant role in that release, is that right? Yeah, actually he made that as a one-off project for Resonance FM Radio. He got asked to submit a piece for the radio. And we were just chatting that day and he was like, oh, you know, check it out, I made this for... for resonance and I was like, this is amazing, you know, we should put it out. And he was like, no, it's just for the radio, it's just a one-off project. And I was like, no, this is great. And then, you know, we just put things down and like, we made it happen. And so you guys became friends back when you were studying design? No, I mean, I met Lee through music, through shows, and he used to DJ a lot, and we played a lot of shows in, like, mid-zeros, like 2005, 6, 7. And, yeah, that's how, actually, how we became friends. So were you DJing back then? Yeah, I've been DJing since I was 17 or 18 when I was still based in Athens, but not necessarily dance music. I was just DJing at bars and parties and gigs. Has that stuff kind of taken a backseat to the label? Well, at some point... I had to take a break from it and the label came about so I put all my efforts and time on that and now I'm going back to it. I've been recording and playing shows throughout these years. but not as much as I used to because I used to tour a lot like non-stop for months and playing anywhere in Europe and the US but now that's been quiet over the past 3-4 years but I'm getting back to it and I'm quite happy about it So I assume the label is a full-time gig. Yeah, I work on it all day long. And I also do a lot of design work and also working on music. So there's basically, I never sleep. Yeah, I mean, just the sheer workload of the amount of records you put out last year. Yeah, the thing is that it's just me who does everything pretty much. So I'm responsible for... 90% of the artwork the overall communication and like pressing dealing with the mastering recordings and all that so that takes a lot of time but I'm happy you know it's it's my passion that's what I like doing you know yeah I imagine the fact that it's just you probably makes some things possible like that wouldn't necessarily be otherwise well it's just like having control on everything you know it's a very small independent label it's nothing crazy you know so it's good to keep it real in a way and like you know just do it your own way so that's about it Yeah, it's interesting to me. I mean, of course, it is a small independent label. But at the same time, it's kind of amazing that, you know, small label with often very challenging music and pretty extravagant artwork can put out so many records and, you know, and survive. Like, I feel like it's kind of... Yeah, I mean, I feel quite lucky that, you know, people are interested and they help me continue. You know, I think it's a great thing. But on the other hand, I believe that if someone trusts and believes in what he wants and just focuses and keeps on developing and continuing an idea, and at some point it might happen, it might not. I mean, it's a slower process, basically, because you don't really commit to what the current hype or like what people like in general. So you just do your own thing and you might get somewhere. Yeah. Do you feel like you also might have gotten a little lucky with what else, you know, what's popular in general? Basically what you were saying earlier about people kind of being more open-minded, mixing up like club stuff with more challenging stuff. I think that was kind of popular in general, which might have been like an element of good timing for you. I always check what happens in music because I'm interested in everything contemporary and in everything that happens in general in all styles of music and art. I think it's also very important to be relevant to what is the current interest in general it's not about hype or like being trendy but it's good to be relevant and not just like just look only in the past or like just flirt with a whole retro idea that a lot of people do which is fine because I like a lot of old music you know I listen to a lot of mostly actually to like older stuff but I think it's also important to be part of what's happening now and also look in the future and like try and push things even further more to what they might happen yeah i think that's an interesting thing with more experimental music is when i hear something like you know, Jarmoff or something really challenging like that, I think to myself, or I often wonder, you know, is this guy consciously trying to do something new or push things forward? So it sounds like you're saying that is kind of, at least with you, that's part of your goal. Yeah, in a way, it's not like what I always have in mind, but I think it's... I believe it's just good to like refer to all this and kind of like use all these elements and like it's more of an attitude thing like you know just like not sit back and relax and like just do something that it's pleasurable and you know i mean most of these artists do have this need to like push it further more and like you know basically find their own singular voice within that world that that it has there's been so much output there so it's by doing that it's also trying to find yourself within that and also push it even more into like a different universe in a way that that could be a challenging thing as you said or like something completely new or even like a reformation of like already existing stuff Yeah, I feel like it's an interesting thing to think about. I've heard some people say that with art, no one really invents something new. It's always just a combination of influences and what's come before. I think that happens inevitably, though. Yeah, of course. But I guess it's like some people can end up being innovative when they're actually just... doing doing something naturally they're just making something that sounds good but then you could also consciously set the goal of presenting something i think it's part of a greater body of work though like once you have that in mind it just happens naturally to just continue and like being forward thinking in a way and use all these influences and inspirations that people have and like just continue doing it your own way kind of like a The most reliable way to actually do something interesting is I think it's just refreshing in a way To do it to do it like that and it seems like I remember you said to me before that basically with pan you don't have create guiding no no not at all like you know like i start with one thing and like anything could happen really i like to keep it challenging in that way I mean, I like music in general. I like a lot of different styles of music. So there's a reason that all this stuff fit in my head, you know. So why not to do it on a label? I mean, I always try to find a link between... the records and the artists themselves in a way so a lot of these people have worked together in the past or like they managed to contribute and like work together eventually maybe but also with the artwork and everything it's all part of a it's like a puzzle in my head you know You mean the artists have, like the different artists that have released on Pan have worked together before? Not all of them, but a lot of them have and might do in the future. But all I'm saying is that they all have, they're all like individual artists that just work with what they want and not like... following a certain agenda of like what this specific scene does or like you know I do dark techno or like I do dubstep or like I do I don't know electroacoustic music of this kind of style whatever and I think they just follow what they want And I'm heavily interested in this aspect because it's very, very healthy and important to basically believe in yourself and not try to put yourself in a box with some other stuff because then it just misses the point. Yeah, I mean, it kind of makes me think of... someone like heat sick remember uh at the pan showcase at bergheim played a four-hour like cassio set yeah and um i mean something like that is uh so singular it's so you know no one it's it's all him basically that's exactly what I'm saying I mean all these people love music and they love stuff that maybe belong to a certain scene like I mean for example Steve who does Hitzik he loves Chicago house and like psychedelic music from the 60s and 70s and avant-garde and all that but when he does his project he's not really trying to recreate like the I don't know like early 90s Chicago sound or something of course he has a lot of as I said influences from that but it's not that he's basically reproducing the same style so when he expands his set into four hours it's basically you know it's just opens up and it's just his own thing in a way do you feel surprised at all that um people are so accepting of that kind of thing This, I don't know, I think people are fascinated maybe. I'm not sure how welcomed are. I hope they are, but I don't know yet. Because it's still quite difficult music sometimes. I think they're interested in it and they like the fact that it's there and it happens. But I'm not sure how pleasurable it is to them. Sometimes yes, sometimes no, I don't know. In general, what do you feel like sort of the energy level is in the crowd at that kind of performance? Like, do you feel like people there are kind of... enjoying it on a simple level or are they sort of like... I mean, as we said before, with the more, let's say, musical, dancey stuff, of course there's this element of enjoyment and people do enjoy and dance and have fun like they do any other night, in a way. But it's still good to put that on a different perspective sometimes and not just have a club night or just a dry academic, let's say. art-based concert or anything like that, you know. I think it's good to link all these worlds together and try and get something out of it. But also keep it down to earth and, like, keep it human and, like, and also, like, being able to have these artists express themselves and not force them to do something because it has to. be arty and also dancey and also like whatever else that could be. I don't know if that makes sense. Yeah. I mean, I think the overall personality of the label as you know, the personality of the label is all these different personalities of these artists basically. Right. And, but I think, I guess another way of putting it would be this sort of presentation of the label for something that's putting forth such often difficult music. It, you know, impression you get from the artwork and everything. is fairly down to earth, as you put it. It doesn't seem academic or overly intellectual or anything like that. Yeah, I don't tend to at least. I'm glad you say that, but yeah, that's my goal, not to actually overdo it or something. It's just a creative process. It's not like something that I have to sell off or pretend that I do this or that. Yeah, I remember when I spoke with Lee Gamble surrounding the Diversions EP, he said basically when he was into that really, really cerebral computer music, and then he saw, I think, Tim Hecker? Florian Hecker. Florian Hecker, okay. And he just said, sort of had this realization that you can make experimental, challenging music and have it... a non-intellectual experience like there can be people standing there in the audience just kind of taking it in not standing there thinking about you know what the concept is or whatever like you can experience that sort of music in a more immediate way and i guess that's basically that's exactly what i was trying to say before it's that And things were more specific in the past, but like there's always these examples that you just put something in a different context and it has the same meaning, but it's way more refreshing and more interesting in a way than having it dry or like just, yeah, it just misses the point sometimes. Do you get the impression that there are a lot of people that feel this way or they're making this kind of music? Well, I hope that people are, you know, can relate to this and like, you know, think maybe the same way or like maybe it helps some others to find their own voice through that. I'm not saying that I'm like the one that's doing it. there's tons of labels and artists out there doing similar things so yeah I don't really know I mean I just hope that there's more people like being interested in that whole thing where do you see the label heading? next year or two uh i don't know i mean i like that it grows naturally and i don't really have like crazy goals or like that i want to be big or small or underground or mainstream or something you know i just want to continue what i've been doing so far and that's it there's more events and There's a festival happening, so that's that too. So yeah, I just want to focus on that whole curatorial aspect and just continue putting out records. What's the festival you mentioned? The festival is happening this June in New York, and it's going to last for seven days from June 18th to June 23rd. And it's basically... based on most of the roster of the label so far and a lot of local New York based artists from different styles from like dance DJs to like improv jazz musicians to experimental music stuff And it's gonna happen in different venues throughout a week. Mainly at PS1, MoMA. And there's a bunker night. And issue project room is hosting two events. And there's a lot of art shows and galleries and art centers in New York. It's pretty big. And that's a pan festival. Yeah, yeah. I'm organizing the whole thing. Wow. There's a lot of work for that. Trust me. Are there any just releases on the label that you're excited about? Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of records, even more records coming out this year. There's a new record by a Greek trio called Mohamed, which is a string trio. basically working in long drawn music forms. There's the first full length record by my friend Rassad Becker who is a sound engineer and mastering engineer at Duplates and mastering in Berlin. It is first records, pure electronic music, synthesizers and quite abstract too. I'm very excited about this. I've been waiting for it for a long time, so I'm glad it's finally happening. There's a bunch of 12" by Bass Clef. who is a London beat-oriented producer. There's a collaboration between Regis and Russell Haswell, which is coming out in April. It's an EP under the name Concrete Fence. What else is happening? Kuhe's NHK Dance Classics Volume 3, which is the final, basically. volume from those series and yeah and more new LPs from like Helm, Hitzik, Eli Kessler, Valerio Tricoli, Lee Gamble, new 12 wins and record later this year so yeah it's gonna be pretty busy Is it easier for you to commission work at this point now that the label has a reputation and everything? I'm trying to, but it's hard sometimes. It seems like the only thing holding you back is how much time you have. Yeah, time is never enough. But yeah, I mean, I'm trying to do as much as I can. You know, it's pretty exciting in general. So I'm you know, I'm psyched to be doing all that So yeah We'll see how it goes *Dramatic music* you
