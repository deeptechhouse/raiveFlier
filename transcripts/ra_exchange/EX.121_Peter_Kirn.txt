you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. There are plenty of places online to pore over the latest studio gear. A few sites look at the big picture quite like Create Digital Music. not just of music technology news, but also of the questions these developments pose to electronic music making at large. Peter Kern, a trained pianist and composer, who released a full-length called End of Train Device last year, started the blog eight years ago as a companion to a primer on digital audio he had published. As Kern explains, the popularity of the blog quickly outpaced the book. And with the proliferation of Ableton, touchscreen devices, and audio-visual performance, he's found plenty to write about. RA's Jordan Rothlein spoke to Kern about all that Create Digital Music has watched unfold so far and where music technology might be. you So Peter, most people probably who know you on RA through Create Digital Music, which is your website, but you actually have a background in music composition. Yeah, that was my training. So I was classically trained both as an undergraduate. And as a graduate student, I'm actually still finishing, you're still finishing your degree in New York. Yes, that's right. I'm still finishing my dissertation for the City University of New York Graduate Center back in New York. So we're both hiding out in Berlin, I guess, hiding from our thesis deadlines. But yeah, that's where I came from. I was a classically trained pianist, among other things. Yeah. I mean, that makes me sound like I can play the piano better than I can. But I came from a classical background and studied some piano and voice and composition. When did an interest in electronic music start creeping in? Pretty early. So, I mean, I think the first time I started... using these instruments must have been, can't have been very old, it must have been maybe 13. My first rig was a Roland sound canvas and a keyboard and some sort of MIDI interface and Cakewalk for DOS. So I was interested as a kid in experimenting with a computer to make music. It had always been something that I had wanted to do. And, yeah, I mean, that was my first exposure. I also, while I was in high school, I went to a summer program at Oberlin College with a guy named Gary Nelson. And that was eye-opening for me. It was only two weeks, but that was a pretty radical experience because in those two weeks I saw. what was it called, M, this algorithmic composition software. I saw Max for the first time. I saw software that most people don't know from a guy named Mark Coniglio who lives in Berlin called Interactor, which is also a graphical environment like Max, although... much more performance friendly. He built it with, uh, with Morton Sabotnick. And, uh, so I played with, played with all this stuff, sound hack by Tom Arab. And, um, I would say that's probably when I got addicted. was in those couple of weeks. And the ability to create new compositional structures and new sounds to me was just amazing. It's been about 1994, I guess. And the work that you're doing for your dissertation, does it involve electronic music? It does. So I'm researching, my research area is in... how to translate musical structures in three dimensions. As software is moving towards 3D modeling as an interface for music, I was interested in how we could create a common set of descriptions to navigate those musical environments. So software using different kinds of graphical interfaces can talk to one another, and that's what I'm doing. This is probably a better conversation to have once it's done, but you'll have to take my word for it. And hopefully it will still be relevant by the time that I complete it. But that's what I'm working on. Absolutely. When did you become interested in writing about things that were happening with making music electronically? You know, I think I've been a writer for a long time. Writing has always been a way that I've not only expressed myself, but thought. through ideas. I guess that I started writing, the first writing that I did was for Macworld magazine and Keyboard magazine, roughly the same time. And I still write for both of those publications. I had been writing online, I think. Some of the first writing I did was for a guy named Jason O'Grady. who was a tech journalist. He had the dubious distinction of being named in the Apple blogger lawsuit over Asteroid, over this audio interface years ago. But I was writing for that site, writing for PowerPage, writing for a site called MacMusic, and somehow it came out of all of that. This is straining my memory because it seems like a really long time ago. But that's how I got started writing, and then that led to Macworld and keyboard and meeting other people. I was also doing training at the time for a notation software called Sibelius. And I think Chris, who I know at—Chris Breen, who I met at Macworld, I think I met through the Sibelius connection, through being a— a person doing sessions and notation software. Now, when exactly did Create Digital Music come about? I think you say on your website it started eight years ago? Eight years ago. So this was the fall of 2004. And it was something that I was doing. Also through these writing connections, I wound up becoming the author of a book for Peach Pit Press. And originally that book I was suggesting they call Create Digital Music or Creating Digital Music or something like that. And so the site was just going to be a companion for that book. I had never intended to build a new sort of... destination website for music technology. It began as a companion for the book. But what I discovered was some of the weirdest stuff that I was talking about, the things that I thought were sort of only of interest to people in academia and experimental music people. strange new interfaces for music and alternative interfaces and things like that were attracting the most interest. And this was about the time that the blog revolution was happening and Gizmodo and Gadget were both exploding at that point. And so I think that got the site more attention. And somehow the book, which became Real World Digital Audio, was a lot less successful than the website. So I kept doing the website. Which is sort of odd because the book is kind of a more general primer on making music digitally. would record music digitally or compose music digitally, stuff like that? That's right. I mean, I put together this book. Jim Aiken from Keyboard Magazine was my technical editor. And the goal was to be as practical as possible, to try to give people a sense of the landscape for music production in general, how to put together all these pieces. And so in some diffused sense, hopefully that still comes across in the website. But it didn't deal with some of these other marginal, not marginal, but more experimental issues. How do you design interfaces for music? And what should they look like? And what if an electronic music instrument could be anything and not just a keyboard or something? what sorts of instruments can we create around the computer? Sure. Were there other websites around that time that were covering a similar beat? Or did it really seem like you were kind of jumping into sort of unknown territory in the blogosphere? When I got started, there were not a lot of other sites around. I mean, I think there were older sites like Harmony Central. Create Digital Music early on had a wonderful rival that started at almost the same time. I think he may have gotten a couple of months head start, and that was Music Thing. edited by Tom Whitwell, who now focuses most of his attention on a real journalistic outlet on the Times of London. But it really, for many months, what motivated me every day, I think, was knowing that Tom was going to have some cool story on Music Thing. And could I come up with something first or come up with something cooler or simply disagree with whatever he was saying? And I expect that Tom was doing something similar. So there was this kind of golden age of CDM and Music Thing. making friendly, taking friendly shots at each other, I think. I actually really miss having Music Thing kind of as a daily inspiration. went on to do a real job. Do you remember some of those early issues that you were talking about on the website? Maybe some of the things that were bringing a lot of people to the site kind of from the beginning? Well, I mean, as I think over the past eight years, there's been a pretty amazing set of events that have happened. And a lot of them have taken some of these issues that had been in academia or of interest to people doing music technology and made them compelling to the world at large. So the lemur was coming out right about the time we started. It was the first discussion of multi-touch interfaces for most people. The iPhone followed not long after that. I think the explosion of use in Ableton Live and the popularization of laptop performance was happening at about the same time. And that led to everything else that we've seen and people experimenting with building their own controllers and joysticks and grids of buttons. The Monom came out. and really made people reconsider how you could design new instruments and interfaces for music. So all of this stuff has happened, actually most of that stuff happened in the first four years or so. And it appealed to me because I had always been interested in these questions around design. So how do you design an interface? How do you design a piece of hardware, controller, gestural interface? partly because to me all of those questions were musical questions, compositional questions. So when you build an instrument like the monom, you can think of that as technology that you use to make music, or you can think of it as part of the musical idea, the way that object looks, the way that it behaves, the way you divide up music on the grid of a monom or an MPC or a machina or whatever. is a musical decision. And you're in this sort of lovely dance between you, the musician, and the engineers and creators who build this stuff. And even when you build it yourself, all this community of other people building and designing stuff and the way that you pass around ideas. And to me, that's very much an extension of compositional history, where people pass around ideas and make variations. and build a culture around a set of shared ideas about music. Yeah, and that seems to be a really big part of what is discussed on the website, is what are we going to be making music with as we kind of continue on? How do we design these devices? And that really does seem like it's a big part of the compositional process now. Have you only seen that increase as you've been with the site? Well, I think more people have access to the technology. So anybody working with technology in any intimate way begins to understand. these questions as being related. I always had to fight with people over this idea, well, let's not talk about technology. Let's talk about music. Let's not just focus on the tools. What are we doing musically? And to me, that was always, actually, I probably say that sometimes, but to me, that was always kind of a flawed construction. You know, when you pick up a violin or you pick up a piano, the technology of that instrument is hugely important to the sounds that you make. And instruments aren't all capable of making every sound. So you have this relationship with whoever designed that instrument, or in the case of piano, tuned that instrument. And I think maybe people separate those issues partly because if they don't know the technology very well, if it is a sort of foreign alien object that gets inserted into their music, then they would tend to see it as somehow separate from those musical questions. The closer you get to the... the way in which that thing was designed, the more you begin to understand the dividing line between the technology and the music is being blurred somehow. So when you go back and read about the people who were designing these instruments in the 50s and 60s, they don't make those same kinds of distinctions, and they're very frustrated. I think Moog was frustrated with the term synthesizer. With this idea that somehow these things are artificial or actually musical, that there's some kind of, you know, it's as if a UFO dropped this alien technology off and left us to make music with it, and somehow anybody doing that is cheating. If you get to know the people who designed these things, you have a different perspective. Has there really been an instrument or a device since you've been covering this stuff on the website that has really kind of been a game changer? Well, I think it's the stuff that was kind of on the list that I mentioned. The Monom, I think, was really amazing. And maybe it's worth mentioning the Monom first because it came from two designers and not from a big company. Sure. Can you kind of describe the Monom for people who might not know exactly what that device is? So the Monom is just a grid of light-up buttons. In fact, I don't think I was very complimentary when I first saw it. I think I said something like, well, this is just a big grid. of light-up buttons with no velocity sensitivity. Each button has only on and off positions, so how hard you hit them doesn't matter the way that it matters on an MPC. And it's just this big array of buttons. Originally it was 8x8, and they can be on or off, the buttons they can light up on or off. But there are some things that were important about it, the way that Brian Crabtree and Kelly Kane, his design partner, built this thing. For one thing, the lights are separate. The lights can be separately. addressed from the buttons. So you can give visual feedback and use this instrument as a kind of display at the same time that it's a controller, as it's an input. And that opens up lots of ideas for how the software of a connected computer relates to the object. And it's really beautiful. It's kind of a piece of sculpture in the version that finally shipped. Daedalus has an earlier prototype that does not look like a beautiful piece of sculpture. It looks like something that came out of someone's garage, although that has a charm of its own. But the instrument itself is really... work of art and it doesn't have any branding on it. It doesn't have a silkscreen that says Monom in big letters. And that was kind of unusual at the time. I guess it's still fairly unusual. And lastly, it talks to the computer. It works with a piece of software built in Macs that interacts with it. But an important thing that Brian did was it's not open source. hardware, but he did share the schematics and the software patches that make it run. And this community around the Monom made lots and lots and lots of modifications. There was the object as it shipped, and then there was this life that it had after it shipped, where artists began to modify it for their own ends and form communities. Communities actually got together to play the instrument and kind of practice this thing and modify the Max Patch that it talks to. And it was like having a cello playing organization. Suddenly there was this group of monom players who could get together and support each other's music and even make their instruments work better. Yeah, it would almost be like if cello players all got together and there was, you know, they had some carpenters or something around who could make some modifications to the instrument. I mean, it seems like the monom is an instrument that really... takes into account that there's no one way people are going to want to use it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, partly because it's so simple, because it's just this grid of buttons, it's not clear what it does. So people do modify it to make sense in whatever kind of music they happen to be making. And that was an important design innovation. It's really, in many ways, is the opposite of most of what happens in music technology even now. You know, if you look at most music hardware, it has a very specific design. If it's integrated with software, they try to do it in a very fixed and predictable way. partly because that's what many people want. And they're all heavily branded and they have logos all over them and they're mass manufactured and there are lots and lots of them. You ship in the music industry, we don't ship as much as people ship in other industries, but we're still talking about thousands, tens of thousands of units, hundreds of thousands if something's really, really popular. And here's this thing where, you know, Ryan this month is doing a version of the sibling of the monom, something called the ARC, which is just a series of encoders. And I think he's making 50. And that may be it. There may never be another ARC after these 50. So it's something that can also be quite rare. And that was interesting and appealing to people too. How about the iPhone and the iPad as musical devices? I know on your website you have a whole section that's sort of like a clearinghouse almost of really great iPhone and iPad apps. How have you seen that sort of format, you know, iOS format? really kind of come to life over the last number of years? Well, it's really been the big story. Yeah. So, you know, I think the iPhone and the iPad, maybe it's easiest to take the two of them together. You know, what they were able to do was to take the software that had been hidden inside a business machine. and allow the software to live kind of without other distractions. So when you use music software in the iPhone or the iPad, what a lot of people have observed is significant, is that everything else kind of disappears, and you have this sensation of touching the software directly. You're not really touching the software directly, but you don't have this feeling of an interface between you. and the software that you're using. And that's proven to be really, really influential in thinking about music software. It would be hard to overstate the significance of this thing in that way. I don't think that it has in any way replaced the need for any of the other hardware that we have, or at least any of the other instruments that we have. So it's difficult for an iPad or an iPhone to replace a guitar. It's difficult in another sense for them to replace an MPC for something that has pads that you can actually hit. And that's why we're seeing Akai make special hardware to extend the instrument. But as a category of things that runs music software. it's done something that nothing else could do, really, since the invention of fast laptops and things. Now, and I know that I've been a bit controversial on the subject of iOS devices, because I think... Because I was critical of them, I have been critical of them. I've been critical of the fact that using them is like touching a bathroom mirror, as my friend James put it, who's the designer of the MeBlip synthesizer that we make. And I was initially very, very concerned about the openness of this thing. whether it was going to lead to a whole bunch of patents, patent disputes that would shut down multi-touch innovation from other makers. I was concerned about that. I was concerned when the iPhone came out if it was going to run. any software at all. And I was concerned when the iPad came out if it was going to interoperate with other kinds of hardware. All of those issues have shifted. So I think I was partly right on the patent concerns. But that didn't stop the people that I was most concerned about. That's become a problem for the likes of Samsung. The people who actually develop new multi-touch technology and touch surfaces and screens and things seem to be able to proceed without running into these patents. And it hasn't been a problem for software developers, which I thought it might be, but they haven't really been a target, so that hasn't been an issue. And some of the concerns that I had about the ability to run software and the ability to interoperate with hardware. People didn't understand why I was sort of so critical in the beginning, but Apple responded to, didn't necessarily respond to me, but they responded to someone who was concerned about those things and added all of this. really powerful. They really extended their platform. So it's quite powerful for working with lots of different hardware and software. I'm interested just in this quote that your friend, the co-designer of the Meeple synthesizer, what he was saying about... the iPad, I think you said it's like touching a mirror. Was that sort of a broader metaphor or was that just in terms of the tactile feedback that you get from the thing? In terms of the tactile feedback that you get from it. So if you close your eyes and run your hands across an iPhone or an iPad, all you feel is the sensation of touching a piece of glass. It's what's wonderful about them because for running software, That's terrific. But it means that if you sometimes want to grab a knob or hit a pad or hit a key or bow a string, it can't replace any of those sensations. And even with all the work that's being done in tactile feedback for multi-touch displays, I think because they have to be so thin, because they can't use much power, because they have to work in mainstream. applications. I don't expect that we're going to see a whole lot of progress on this issue anytime soon. I'd love to be wrong, but I think that's much further off. Well, this kind of plays into the conversation that you were having the last time you were on the exchange a little bit, talking about pressing play and how that's a little bit of... That's what sort of some people think is all that's happening in a live electronic music set. And a device like an iPad obviously can't replace a guitar. It can't replace a cello or even really a piano or something like that. But I wonder if it might, as processing power on it gets better, replace laptop performance. It could. It has a long way to go before it starts replacing laptop performance. And the laptops do keep getting faster. So the funny thing about Apple is the machines that haven't been getting faster are the Mac Pros. When you look at the iMac, the MacBook. and even the Mac Mini, those are all really quite powerful machines. So the iPad doesn't pose much threat to them anytime soon. A great example of this is Thunderbolt. So Thunderbolt is... By virtue of being positioned as a sort of desktop class technology. And Thunderbolt just is the new sort of port, the new high speed port that you can find on a lot of Apple products, right? On all of the Apple products, actually, with the exception of the Mac Pro. So, yeah, it's this new bus. It's incredibly fast. It's much faster even than USB 3, the other competing format. It's not from Apple. It comes from Intel. And that's important that it comes from Intel. That probably means that you're not going to see it on something like the iPad, which is not an Intel machine, anytime soon. It's also something that because it's so fast, you need the... rest of the machine architecture to be able to keep up with it. The iPad is quick and the new iPhone is quite quick, but they represent where we were about 10 years ago. So they're really good at running that software from about 10 years ago, but they're not good at things like vast multi-channel audio processing. And they're also really poor at things like video. And for that reason, I think we're going to see these other machines will remain important for a long time to come. Just in terms of a device, something that really breaks from what we've had before. The iPhone and then I guess the iPad really were just kind of these tremendous leaps. It seems like a lot of devices then came out after that that seemed to mimic what they do or played into that same. Yes, they have. Yeah, yeah. The Android devices, right, among others. And now the Windows situation is starting to come into focus. Right, right. When you have something like that, it seems to change everything. And then sometimes it's hard to imagine what is the next thing that could do that. Do you have a sense of what that might be? Any guesses? You mean what's, well, yeah, I was going to say, so we've talked about kind of developments that have happened in the past eight years. You mean sort of what's going to be the next big thing? Yeah, I wonder about that. It's hard to say for the mainstream market. I mean, and sometimes it's not that interesting to talk about the mainstream market. Musicians, to me, are more interesting. And that's why I'm not a general technology writer. That's why I still focus on music, because I find it much more fun. And I also find that they tend to be further ahead of the curve. So there were musicians out there working with lemurs years before the iPad was available. The lemur is this kind of clunky-looking multi-touch display. It was really expensive. It was just a display and touch. You couldn't really run music software on it. And the musicians were the early adopters. I think there are a couple of areas where musicians may become early adopters again. And one is in this area of embedded technology. So we have this whole cluster of computing experiences that are outside what conventionally look like computers. The iPhone and the iPad are terrific examples of that. But they won't be the only examples. So obviously there's lots of excitement around the Raspberry Pi, this $25 computer board that you can go buy. And what the Raspberry Pi represents is part of something bigger, which is this class of embedded computers. It's hardware that's similar to what's inside something like the iPad, but it's very, very cheap, very light, very low power, doesn't generate a lot of heat. And what it means is instead of every time you want to run something like effects for your guitar, having to turn to a computer or even an iPad, you could build custom hardware that just does that for you. So they're kind of cool accessories for the iPad, and they're fairly flexible and things that turn your iPhone into a stomp box and stuff like that. but they're imperfect. You might still want to take your iPad out of that dock and use it like an iPad again. You might need to take a call on your phone. You might discover, as we did this month with Apple, that Apple has decided to change a connector and the next generation of stuff won't even work with it. I think we're going to see a lot of self-contained... creations that have something resembling a computer inside them and have some of the flexibility of a computer in the way that they make and process sound, but in things that are new classes of gadgets. And people are already making some cool stuff, where they take a $25 Raspberry Pi and this guy, Mark, who... lives here in Berlin, has packed it inside the controller that Korg made for their legacy collection software. So he's taken a keyboard, stuck $25 of computer gear inside, and built essentially a new keyboard that has software that he can update as easily as he can on a computer. And given what you expect out of an instrument on the road or in a studio or just want to pick up and play, I think there's a lot of potential in that area. Yeah, and you've already begun to explore that a bit. You just curated a few weeks ago a new party here in Berlin that's kind of centered around people who are making their own musical instruments, their own interfaces for making music. Yeah, yeah. So music makers. There's a new party that we began. It grew out of a party that we used to have in New York. And some other people did satellite versions in other cities. And the idea was returning to how people are creating the stuff that they use to make music. And it's people making their own instruments. It's people making music that's more live, more performative. So that instead of just playing records, if they want to create a dance track, they bring synthesizers on stage and make it on stage for you as you listen. It's also designers approaching music and how to create physical objects for distributing music and interfaces for interacting with music and all of these other possible areas. So the event is a real-world version of what I hope the site is about, which is this crossing point where music and design come together. Another place that it seems like the site and the aims of the site, the kind of ethos of the site is coming out in the real world, is this me. blip synthesizer. You were part of the team that designed it. And it really seems like kind of an attempt to take an instrument. You know, people are always making their own modifications on existing instruments and things like that. But to kind of... go back to like moment zero with that instrument and really start from scratch and just see where it goes. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that project. Sure. And it fits into this idea of computing experiences beyond the computer. Yes. So the MeBlip runs on a little tiny processor called an AVR. And, you know, in music, we, I don't mean to. I don't mean to discount the importance of the larger tech market. Because the larger tech market makes things in really, really big scale, we all benefit. We benefited in terms of the computer. We have benefited in terms of things as simple as the 555. chip, this timer chip that's in everything from greeting cards to possibly weird circuit-bent instruments you find on the internet. And we're benefiting on the MeBlip in a big way. So this is the same basic processor architecture that sits inside the Arduino. DIY board a lot of hobbyists use. The Meblip is not an Arduino, but it's a similar architecture. Imagine a $3 CPU or $2 CPU, and that's what this class of chips is all about. It's similar to the level of computational power you might have gotten from a home computer in 1981, but it's much cheaper. And the MeBlip is built around this chip. And it is a hardware synthesizer. In fact, I really had a good time teasing this thing because I was sure if I was teasing that we were coming up with something new that people would assume it was an iPad app or something. And it's the opposite. It's running on this little tiny chip, and it's really a hardware synthesizer, and it's all about having knobs and switches. There's no screen. It's about being able to play a synth the way that you used to play a synth, where to make the sound change, you flip a switch or turn a knob. And it's open source, so the code that runs on this digital chip, all of the circuits around that chip, which include both digital and analog components, and even the physical design, all of those things are open. for people to modify. Yeah, you write on the website that it can be someone's first synth. It can be a unique sounding addition to your music setup. It can be a synth you open up and modify, learning about sound creation, code, and electronics. Like it's not just an instrument. It's kind of an invitation to do something more with it. Exactly. But it's also important to say that our long-term goal for this project is that it's not a DIY project. We do intend for it to be a product, but a product that you can modify. And that's important. So a lot of open source hardware has really been about here's a project for hobbyists who want to build stuff. But it isn't always in a form that you can kind of pick up and use as a product. And we really do want MeBlip going forward to be something that people can pick up and use. And I think... With each revision of the design, we try to get closer to that as well. How has the response been to it so far? People really like synthesizers has been the response, and it was everything that we hoped that it would be, I think. People love having an instrument that they can go and play, and the modifications that people have made have been well beyond what I would have imagined. Everything from somebody building the guts of a me-blip into a cookbook with a pig that has a light-up eye for the MIDI indicator light to a guy, Sean, who has built this giant control voltage rack. So it has multiple MeBlips inside, and you can route CV, this analog voltage from a modular synthesizer, set up into it and sequence it with CV instead of MIDI. Crazy, crazy stuff that we didn't imagine. And, you know, I didn't even really need to be open source for any of those things to be possible. I think it's had more to do with the reaction from the community of synthesizer enthusiasts. So we've sold over a thousand, well over a thousand of these things. We are now at a stage where we're trying to think about making it more of a product. I mean, we sold more than a thousand of them really without trying. Sometimes, you know, early on we had shipping problems, things like that. Trying to do assembly and shipping and distribution yourself is a terrible idea. And we knew it was a terrible idea and we did it anyway out of necessity. So now we're trying to understand. we're building a distribution network and so that it's actually possible to buy this thing. And so the, the, the bar is raised for us to give back to the people using this thing to prove that you can take something like open source hardware and make it a product that scales to a reasonable number of people and keep those people happy. and allow them to make music at both ends of that spectrum, both the beginners and these enthusiasts who sometimes are engineering stuff even we can't imagine. And I mean, that's what I hope for the site as well, that somehow you don't have to... focus on the bell curve, the kind of people in the middle who seem to have fairly predictable tastes and you kind of know what they want. I'm more interested at the stuff beyond the bell curve, and I think that includes both these advanced users, people creating their own technology. But also the many people who, if they are using music tech right now, maybe aren't able to use it to the extent that they'd like. Now, Create Digital Music isn't the only site that you're running anymore. There's also Create Digital Motion. Talk to me a little bit about the work that you've done and maybe the work that you're interested in as a visual artist. Well, yeah, motion came fairly soon after music. And I had gotten interested in VJing or in live visuals. You know, once you start working in the computer, once you realize that everything is numbers, even if you begin as a musician, you begin to think, well, wait a minute, if these are numbers, they don't only have to be sounds. They could be... geometry or video or whatever I like. And so there's a strong connection between people doing music performance and people doing forms of visual performance. And that's where that site came from. I'm glad still that it's a separate site. I mean, I thought about whether that was a good idea a lot at the time. But I'm glad that we're able to devote a separate site to it. I think people are doing incredible work with... visualization with interaction design and with things like, you know, unusually innovative music videos, all of these areas that if they were just in the music site might get a little lost. But it is biased toward understanding visuals and real-time visualization from the perspective of a musician. How different are those two approaches now to making music in sort of this digital way and to making visual art in this digital way? I think they're more technologically different than they are artistically different. Now, that's really interesting. You know, I mean, visual arts are. their own medium and what is expressive there is unique. But if you're talking about visuals in time, you immediately bring some kind of musical element to them because you have events in time. And then all of the things that you can do with time and rhythm and form. in music, begin to apply to visuals. Technologically, though, it's important to distinguish. You have something that's operating at frame rate that's operating 30 frames per second or 60 frames per second instead of something operating at audio rate, which might involve values that are 44,100 times per second or more. So that's a non-trivial difference. It really affects how you compose things, how you operate things. And dealing with projectors and dealing with color and dealing with all these other areas, I think it's still important to recognize that this is not just the same medium. are a lot of artists now who are kind of, if they're not outright combining them, then that visual element has become a much larger part of the music making process, or maybe the music performance process. Who's really on the cutting, sort of the cutting edge of that right now? of doing visuals that are musical accompaniments or even vice versa? Um, of, of musical artists. Well, I'm, I'm trying to remember how much I mentioned the last, uh, the last time we sat down. Um, but, uh, um, there's a, there's a lot of interesting stuff out there. Um, I'm looking at a Plastic Man mug, so I'm thinking about the Plastic Man show, which I think is really special. And Richie Houghton was touring with these big LED screens that he's kind of enveloped inside these things. And they're just... stunning, and the visuals that they're doing, I think, are just stunning. And it's not some kind of pre-scripted spectacle. What you see is really being composed in real time as he performs. We're about to see a new version of the Iman Tobin show, the Isim. I'm quite excited about what version two of this will be. because version one was very, very ambitious. Projection mapping and lots of stuff on stage and all these visuals. But it'll be nice, just as it was with that Plastic Man show, to see what happens as they begin to refine it artistically and technically. So I think that show's really important, and there's a big team of people working on that. That's not just one artist. One of my favorite shows this year was Daedalus. I thought it was kind of the most effective thing that I saw. And he's going around with big moving mirrors on these sort of robotic, it's kind of a... big robotic array. It looks a bit like the monom. It's another big grid. So I know that Alfred Daedalus likes squares. So he has this big grid of squares behind him. And it's really hard to describe unless you see it, but there's something visceral about it. There are projectors pointed at the mirrors, and the creation is entirely abstract. But as these mirrors move around and they pump fog in and other things, There's just a blaze of light that shifts as these mirrors move around. And the thing also looks like it came off the International Space Station or something. It's just incredibly futuristic. Wow. Well, that sounds like it's not only a digital projection or something. It's not 2D. There actually is something quite literally visceral about it. It's kinetic. It's kinetic, yeah. So the problem for a lot of us... You know, I do a lot of visuals that are just projected on a rectangle. But the problem is that you have this kind of screen, and that's separated from the stage. It can't be really immersive. This is a kind of light sculpture, a kinetic light sculpture, in that you have these robotic mirrors moving around, and they're three-dimensional, and they're physical. And the use of light really focuses on the light as its own medium. So they're not trying to create an image. They're just pointing a lot of light at these mirrors and back at the audience. And so it takes on, it's not only more spectacle, it has this kind of intimacy because you feel like you're part of what's happening. You're not just looking at it the way you would look at a movie screen or something. the light starts to fill the space, especially as they add this fog. And it's utterly magical. And everybody I know who's seen it has been blown away. I think it's probably the most important piece visually this year, as far as performance goes. And it's also worth saying that a lot of times he's performing in smaller spaces. So I think there's this idea that this is only... about big festival spectacle. But I saw this piece at Gretchen, this small club here in Berlin, and it's a little room, and you can kind of walk up and see the back of the mirrors. It's the opposite of what you would get from a festival, and I think that's part of why it's effective. Yeah, it sounds like where before you would think of a spectacle as something that would accompany a big show, something you would go and see at a stadium. Now there's this potential to really have a spectacle in a smaller space that's not just meant to sell a bunch of tickets, but that can kind of be something artistic. Yeah, exactly. And I think it's about... It's about the visuals expressing something that the music alone can't express. You know, anytime you play, there's some visual element. And I was always disappointed as a kid going and watching music performances. I loved that they were live, and I loved the feeling of being in the same room as the sounds. especially with acoustic performance, it's something really unique. But I was never happy going to the orchestra. and hearing a Beethoven symphony, which is this evocative and imaginative sound, and then looking and just seeing a bunch of people in tuxedos sitting around. It just seemed like the wrong visual for what I was hearing. So I think for all of the focus, I think I may have said something like this in the last exchange, but I'll say it again. For all of the focus on kind of what performance looks like and whether you can make yourself into a spectacle while you're performing with a computer, the question that I cared about most was, what am I actually seeing? So it's fine to have some indication that there's a human being performing live, but whether, you know, when I'm playing, whether I really care if you're looking at me the whole time is one thing, you know. For a lot of us, I think you want to create something visual that has something to do with the message or the expression of the music. And not only yourself as a star or something. Now, are you still doing much of your own music? I know last year you put out an album. I did. I hope to do it again. We have a remix version of that album, which hopefully will come out soon. I'm working on kind of trying to find a special way to do it. But I'm still doing music. Lately, I've been doing more live music than anything else. And having done so much performance in software like Ableton, I also focused a little bit more on building my own performance environments and pure data. open source cousin of Mac's and creating things that way. So yeah, I'm still out and playing and increasingly trying to play audio-visual sorts of performances where I'm manipulating visuals and music at the same time. But this is important to me actually and I think it's a strange position to be in music technology journalism. or any kind of creative technology journalism because you have two jobs. They're wonderful jobs, but you have to somehow remain a practitioner of all this stuff. You can't just write about it as an outside critic. You have to be making whatever it is that you're writing about. You know, because you can't write about creative tools if you're not using them creatively. And I, looking at my colleagues over the years who have done this, I know it's a struggle. It takes a lot of time and energy, but it's a nice position to be in. So it's something of a learning process then, actually making music, performing music. doing this visual stuff. It's almost a form of research, it sounds like. Absolutely, it's a form of research, yeah. And by the same token, I think understanding how these tools are built, for me, is a form of research. You know, playing with the tools. is another way of understanding how music and visuals work and how people relate to them. So you have to be really curious about these things to get involved in them. So yeah, all of these things for me are about asking questions. And they have to be because there are two challenges or two struggles that you face. One is time management, how to have enough time just to deal with all this stuff. And if you're writing about tools, you need to use about 10 times as many tools as you really should. And the other challenge is, you know, you want to put yourself in the position of a creator, but you also want to understand that other people are not the same kind of creators that you are. So, you know, when you talk to other artists, it's great, actually. You know, they don't necessarily understand things the way that you do. They're not necessarily trying to express the same things that you are. And even if they are, they will articulate it in very different ways. So part of our job in writing about technology and writing about art from the creator's standpoint, I think, is to be sympathetic or empathetic. to understand the perspective of lots of other artists coming from lots of different backgrounds. I mean, it's impossible, but it is a fun challenge. What you were saying just before I found really interesting, that in order to write about this stuff, it's important to be engaged with it, to be making it and having a creative relationship with it as well. Do you wish that more people who are sort of just straightforwardly creative musicians or something were writing about that process? Do you think that there's something to be gained going in the other direction as well? Do you mean, is it useful if other creators write about what they're doing? Yeah, I mean... if it's important that you kind of are able to step back from your writing and be a creator is there something to be gained from being a creator and sort of stepping back from that and analyzing it, writing about it something like that? Yeah I think so I mean you know maybe not in the same way for everybody What a lot of these people do is they do write about it. And part of the reason that Create Digital Music even works as a site is that they're writing about it. So if they weren't, I wouldn't have much less to write about. Sure. Who are some of the artists that you really like reading? Artists that I like? No, it is tricky because people who are really prolific artists are spending less time writing. Well, I mean, I think about, I had a conversation, Alfred's on my mind, Daedalus, just because I had a conversation with him last week. Now, he's not necessarily writing about it, but he talks about it about as articulately as anybody I know. So it's always nice to speak to him. writers though. I mean, you know, I think there are other people who are writers who are also musicians or DJs and things and, you know, I think most of us who are writing about this stuff are also practitioners. So I would come at it more from that perspective. Most of the people I know who are artists, who I really love as artists, aren't necessarily writing about things as much. But, you know, then you also have, I mean, there are some fairly legendary people who would fit the category that you're describing. Guys like Morton Sabotnick, guys like Brian Eno have written pretty important stuff over the years about these issues. It seems like the Create Digital Music project has just sort of continued to expand over the years. Do you have any idea? We've sort of talked about maybe where the technology is going, but do you have any, anything that you would really like to do with the project yourself over the next? the next eight years? Yeah, a few things. I mean, I'm certainly trying to cover music more. My friend Matt Earp from San Francisco has been doing some more writing for us, talking about artists and going on and trying to discover more artists. And that's been really valuable. And seeing Matt do that, I think he's doing it in a way that is unique to this outlet. because we already have things like Resident Advisor and other places to go read about music and love all those places. So if we add anything to that, it better not be redundant. It better be something different. So I hope that we continue to do that. I think there's a lot more work for us to do on the motion side and the visual side. And I hope that we're about to enter a kind of important age for that medium. I keep waiting for it to happen. But I think we're slowly inching closer to visuals being a more integral part of performance in a wider range of performances. Is there a particular reason for that technologically? or is that more creatively motivated? I think both. Imagine if you had to make music and no venues had speakers and you were expected to bring your own PA. And not only that, but the PA was not going to be loud enough to be heard over the crowd necessarily. And you begin to appreciate the kind of challenge that people doing visuals face all the time. can't count on projectors being in venues. You have to own your own. They are easily blown out by lights and they tend to be ignored. So this is an area that's going to take some time before visual performance is significant. People often talk about the idea that we live in a visual culture, but in fact... It's harder for people to ignore sound than it is for them to ignore visuals. And we know that when people go out to hear music, they go out to hear music and not necessarily to see. see it. So that's both a challenge and an opportunity. It means that if you do something, you really need to make it special somehow. And that's what will make people notice. And gradually that's starting to happen. It's just, it's hard to do it cheaply. It's really hard to do it cheaply. And people who are visual performers don't have tons of money to spend on this. So they have to make up for it. Well, and it seems too that there isn't necessarily one universal setup for visuals. There's not, although that's again kind of what's exciting about it. And I think now is a really good time for this stuff. People are doing really interesting things and some of it's very low-tech. I saw this group, Sculpture from the UK, do wonderful, wonderful things with... with just a camera and projecting these rotating visual patterns. So there's amazing work at the low-tech end and then other people using robots and projection mapping and big stages. pieces and all the rest of it. So that diversity is part of what I think will be interesting about it. Music never really caught on as far as things beyond stereo. Surround is still pretty rare. And yet in visuals, there's no reason that any two performances need to be the same, even on what they're showing their visuals on. Yeah, we've talked a little bit about just before kind of new devices for making music, but maybe a good way to finish would be talking about new sounds. You know, I think... I think finally some interesting sonic techniques are becoming more accessible. The iPad's been really important, actually, that we're seeing more granular instruments and other synthesis techniques, partly because now there's a way to interact with those sonic apparatus, the apparati music. interesting musical way that makes sense visually. So I, yeah, I expect, I expect we'll see a lot more of that sort of thing. You know, it's, it's tough because most of the ways of producing new sounds are. many years old at this point. And it's not like somebody's come up with a new sound synthesis approach recently. Not really. Variations on other things, but not something genuinely new. So right now it seems to have a lot more to do with how you take those accepted synthesis methods and work with them musically. And maybe that's okay. It took many, many years for the violin to evolve into the instrument that we know now. The technology evolved first. And it was a lot, it was another few centuries of compositional experiments just discovering what you could do with that technology. And the instrument stopped changing. Maybe we'll see something similar happen with synthesizers. We've certainly seen it. it happened with the 1960s subtractive model of synthesis. And that's why I'm not concerned about making a simple two-oscillator synthesizer gadget either. You know, there's still so much to be done compositionally in terms of performance that it's okay. It's important, actually, that it doesn't change too much. So I expect that... Some of the things that some people find boring may musically turn out to be really fruitful.
