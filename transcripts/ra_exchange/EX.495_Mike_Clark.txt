I'm Ash Lauren, a DJ. writer, radio host, and RA contributor. This is the second Resident Advisor Exchange I've had the pleasure of hosting in collaboration with my blog, Underground in Black. Mike "Agent X" Clark is one of the original ambassadors of the Detroit house sound. Clark began his lifelong musical journey growing up on Detroit's West Side surrounded by jazz, funk, and disco. In the decades since, he's made classic tracks DJ'd, run a label, and coined the term beatdown, which pays homage to the urban house sound and the idea that Detroit dance music transcends techno. Beatdown, in its essence, is the idea that Detroit dance music is a forward-thinking mesh of sounds, including, but not limited to, jazz, Motown funk, gospel, and hip-hop. Clark has held many residencies in Detroit throughout his decade-spanning career, including his label Beatdown Sound's first residency at Club 1X and the more widely known Rehab at Agave. which became one of the longest-running house music nights in Detroit history. With a resume that includes working with labels such as Planet E, Underground Resistance, and Third Ear, Clark has been, and still is, dedicated to putting out quality tracks and sharing his love of music in Detroit and beyond. I recently sat down with Mike Clark in Detroit where we had an hour-long chat that touched on his early days in music and his opinions on the current state of the DJ scene. This is Ash Lauren coming to you guys live today from Detroit, Michigan with a friend of mine, Mike Clark. How are you today, Mike? I'm doing good. Thank you. Hello, everyone. And Mike, for those who are tuning in that may not know a little bit about you, do you want to just give like a brief little intro about yourself? Okay. I am one of the... I guess you could say one of the original generation of the electronic DJs was actually in the DJ contest that spawned electronic age speaking as far as the drum machine era. There was a DJ contest between Deep Space and Direct Drive that took place. I was in Direct Drive, and we had Wyne Atkins, Eddie Folks, and Derek May representing Deep Space, and it was me, Kevin Dysart, and Ray Berry representing Direct Drive. too into the situation at the DJ contest, Juan Atkins brought the 909 drum machine, plugged it up to the mixer, and at that time, no one knew what it was, because it was, you know, Juan was obviously a producer with the Cybertron stuff that he was doing previous. And us, we were just getting our turntablism on, so the whole electronic drum machine era had not yet begun. But at the contest, when he pressed play on the drum machine... and took the needle off the record and everyone witnessed that the drum machine was making the sounds, the tracks that it came out to do, that was when everything changed. And, you know, again, without getting too deep into it, that drum machine, Derek, from my understanding, sewed to Frankie Knuckles' people when he was at the warehouse, which... created the whole house hit name, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, I just read something about that, like how Derek May gifted Frankie Knuckles the 909. Like, yeah, I just kind of read about that recently. The very 909 drum machine was the drum machine that changed the world for everybody. Wow. Yeah. And, you know, it was interesting because... that actual contest, it was something that, you know, obviously it's a story that not many people know about. But it was also in light because we didn't really think about it. You know, it was a thing where. So who was all there? Like, can you remember anyone else who was like at the contest? You know, the direct drive cats. Let me see. Honestly, it's hard to say because we was in high school, but you had the Deep Space guys. I want to say it was at the Downstairs Pub or maybe, you know, I can't remember where it was even at. I think it was at the Downstairs Pub, but I just remember. the incident, the thing that happened because, one, with me knowing it was a 909 drum machine, it was because my first take of when I saw it, being a white machine, a bone white machine that had these little red dots running across it. It caught my interest because I'm like, what the hell is this machine doing with the turntables? It looks like a typewriter. And that was where my head was at with it. And Juan always says, man, I brought the 808. And I'm like, nope, it was a 909 because I know what I said. I remember it looked like a typewriter. 909 looks like a typewriter. 808 doesn't. So that's what I remember in that whole situation. So were you DJing at this point when you were at the competition or were you just kind of learning about music? No, no, I was in the contest. Oh, you were in the contest. Yeah, it was me, Kevin Dysart, and Ray Berry. Back then I was tricking hard. I was spinning for Mojo, Billy T, Lisa Lisa from WJLB. Okay. Again. you know, being part of Direct Drive, even though me, Kevin Dysart, and Ray Berry, we would sometimes practice together, you know, doing tricks and stuff like that. But I really got my expertise when I went to Chicago. I met the Hot Mix 5 guys there. I was dating this girl Karen Mack. She was my DJ partner at the time. And she had family in Chicago. We were just getting out of high school, a little bit after high school, and basically went to see her cousin. We was already trading Hot Mix 5 tapes around each other. Now, Hot Mix 5 was the... WBMX radio station club jocks that were a team that were doing a lot of DJ tricks. Farley, Steve Hurley, Mickey Mixon Oliver. I can keep going on, but you know those guys. And basically, I went to this party at the Armitage Hall, and that was when I met... Farley, Kenny Jam and Jason, and I can't remember his name right now, forgive me. But when I met these guys, it was very receptive because at the time it was none of this traveling stuff. So they was tripping that somebody already came from Detroit to see them. So at that point, they started treating me quite well, invited me to some more of these shows, swapped numbers. Eventually, they started coming to Detroit as I was coming there with them. So as that started happening, the whole Chicago-Detroit merger scene started happening. And that was when a lot of... You know, Detroiters would, I guess Detroiters would go over there because I was going over there a lot. And then they start coming here, spinning out in our spots. And, you know, just kind of going into that whole scene as the drum machine revolution started taking place, which, no, not really. You've seen the documentary, High Tech Soul. The High Tech Soul documentary touches all into the whole drum machine situation when they start getting the drum machines, selling them. to everybody, you know, and once that took place, everybody knew Mama wanted a drum machine and that, you know, everybody started getting into the whole thing of making music. Yeah, because they realized, you know, they can actually do this at home. Yeah, you know, it went from just making beats to, you know, now you get a little piece of a sampler, like I had this Casio sampler. I would take it home, say my name on it, and say... house music and jacking and all that kind of stuff. House, house, house, house, house, jacking, jacking. You know, that kind of stuff. And that was like the end thing, you know. So we went through that whole revolution of playing with samplers and just making drum tracks. And that was the culture that created the whole house techno movement. because at that point, you know, now it's cool to have a drum track with a sample in it. Now let's put a chord in it. Okay, now let's get a musician to do some real shit. Let's get somebody to sing in, you know, all that. So I learned how to make tracks, how to make music, how to play, everything in the course of creating. part of the whole electronic house of techno. It's a blessing. It's definitely a blessing. I guess we'll touch more on the past, but what are you up to currently? Are you still DJing a lot in Detroit? Do you still have projects? I know you were doing the Life Party at Northern Lights. Is that still going? Yep. I actually just had one last night. And that's been going on for a while now, right? Eight years. Eight years. We've been doing it every last Friday of the month. And it's been a good run. We had the agave, which was me, Norm, and Delano. That was a beautiful thing. To me, I would call that the last of the good parties in Detroit. Because, you know, as the evolution was changing, the whole big club party thing was dying out. And everybody else started getting so involved into the music scene itself. You started having less party people and more people being a part of the party. And that created our kind of chaos. But, you know, just going past that. watching everything form, my thing was trying to figure out, you know, what place did I put myself in because I was just always used to playing everywhere. You know, sometimes I had residencies, but a lot of times I had special guests because, you know, I had that advantage of doing stuff that most people didn't do. But, you know, just through time, as everything started to change and evolutionize and everyone else started getting more into the mix. My survival rate more or less got on giving shows and trying to at least maintain the DJ heritage that I grew up on, which is how we play versus... the universal thing so from agave did a couple gigs some things work some things hit and miss but then the same people i did agave with gave me the uh party at northern lights And that's when I called it Life Party. And it was literally, you know, meaning to celebrate life, you know, skip all this other stuff you normally do. We're going to have percussions. And, you know, if you want to play, you can play percussions live. You got a special, you got a DJ. And this is more people interactive versus, hey, watch me, I'm DJing. Okay, so you wanted to bring other people and just different elements in the mix just to keep it exciting rather than, yeah, just seeing the same thing for eight years. Yeah. As a kid, I first got introduced to the scene as a kid, so my whole thought of a party was lifestyle. I'm 12 years old going to a party with my older brother, and I'm seeing, you know. Pretty lights, everybody dressing good, music sounding great. And to me, that was just the most beautiful thing I've ever seen as far as atmosphere, everybody having a great time. And I was like, this is what I want to do for a living. I want to just be a part of this greatness. So my goal from that point on down was that very thing, to be a part of this, to conduct it, just to be in it. The DJing part did well. I was able to create a lot of different things in it. And, you know, the whole producer side kicked in in me. And that goes back into, you know, what we're talking about now. I got this one record I did in London. It's called The Heat. This is some new. Is this the one you sent me? Yeah. I was listening. OK. Yeah. I took Willie Dynamite parts. put it in there behind the track so it's like it's a conversation between some pimps talking about how you gonna run any hoes you know so the please don't come down on them so they can all you know eat well together but I tried to take the parts that made it more of the more of you for it you know kind of like it's an open mind like if you really listen to it you can apply it to you you can apply it to whatever Yeah, it doesn't actually have to be about Pimps and Hoes. Yeah, it's just about, you know, you need to tighten up, and this is some stuff that we need to do as a scene. This is some stuff we need to do. You know, like it could be the house scene itself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. As people, we need to do this. So I pulled that off, and I did that tune a couple years ago for my boys, W. Beezer and Lincoln. They flow together. Yeah, WB, his music is tight. Ah, yeah, I love that guy. I like his stuff. I'm going to tell you, I first met him, he was coming to the parties that we were giving in England. And him and Lincoln, I met them through my manager there. they invited me to their studio because they was loving the whole beat down stuff. So were you doing stuff with Third Ear? Yeah, exactly. So it was the guy who set everything up. So I remember he was playing me all these tracks. He was like, yeah, man, this is the stuff that we got going on. And he put me in his other room. He was like, yeah, I really like your beat down stuff, so I made these tracks. This guy got his beat down. What do you think? I swear to God, he pressed play. Whole world just changed. I was like, what the hell? Dude. I immediately called a guy that within the next five minutes, guy, you need to get here. He was asleep. I was like, nope, you need to come here. To check out the visa. He came there and signed him that night. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, so I think they say he was kind of like the originator of like the Peckham sound. Peckham? I don't know. Yeah, yeah. You're like, I don't know shit about Peckham. But yeah. I just know when he said beat down, he hit the most beat down and stuff. I was like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, if you're saying it's... beatdown then you know. Well, I said when he hit it, I couldn't say I took all the tracks home. Banged everybody with them. Everybody was like, who is this? I was like, man, you got to check my boy out, man. This is Beezin. Like I said, as you can tell, he came out and was a beast. Started doing his thing. That was one of the good things that I was proud. to be able to do was to help, you know, I didn't even say I helped him. I just made a phone call and made things an inch faster. He was, you know, the moment anybody hear him, he's going to blow up. So I'm not taking any of that credit. I ain't going to pretend, you know. But, yeah, the brother was talented, and I was just glad that I was able to help kick it a shoestring faster, I guess. Yeah, yeah. So in terms of releases, are you still doing vinyl releases or is most of your stuff like digital? Well, you know, for me myself, with my label, doing a lot of MP3 digitals, I was working my way towards the vinyl because, as you know, the vinyl. it's a little expensive yeah the resurgence kicked in cost a little bit um sales and production is so stupidly low we're not going to discuss it but it's just it's just hard to maintain a production status and put out records and live You know. Yeah. You know, even if you're making hit records, I mean, like, what's my name? John, was that John Legend who, who made, who went platinum, but his earnings was like $30,000, something like that. Yeah. That's the music business. And that's the pop industry. So, you know, you're supposed to be making millions off that. Yeah. So you're like, what am I about to do with some house? Thank you. Yeah. You know, I'll get my little $80 check. Thank you. I'm like, you know what? This is over with. So for me, I was really working towards tours because before producer, I've always been a DJ. And so no matter what happens, I'm always be a DJ first. So I recommitted myself. Instead of me trying to focus towards making these tracks and making a whole bunch of stuff so I can make this money to build this and take this and do that, I wanted to just see if I could make some tracks that could help propel my DJ career. Because rebranding is always, you know. I don't know, maybe my 10th time rebranding myself through my four decades of DJing. Hey, I mean, you got to, you know, I get it, though. It's like you want to, you got to stay current. You know, you got to stay innovative. And especially now, you know, there's the scene is just, you know. Yeah, but I'm with the punches and the changes because, you know, it went from something that was, you know, it was like a DJ but that was as far as it went and now you just got celebrities imitating us I mean yeah or just everyone becoming a DJ yes it's a true lifestyle you know and it's catch 22 because you know it's what DJ wouldn't be happy to know that the whole world is based on what you like but you know at the same time because of its commercialism, and I'm not going to necessarily blame it on the people. I'm going to more or less speak on the manufacturers of the product, you know, Pioneers and Sonys and people like that. They need their wrist slapped because what they did was they literally started when the DJ revolution started. They were pushing the whole DJ equipment to not only professionals but also amateurs alike at the same time, at the same speed. So you had all these people that was looking at the DJ world. as something that was not professional, but it was something to do. It was fun. And that's cool. Like they have the money to get the gear. So like, oh, okay, I'm a DJ now. Yeah. You know, so it was a very hard period because, you know, we sitting here trying to hold down clubs and just trying to maintain what we can, just what our status. and experience alone. And now there's all these other people. Yeah, you know, these guys, they'll come up to you and they want to start spinning with you and they don't even know how to spin yet or they just got the equipment. So it's just like, where's the professionalism in that? But we had to rough through it because the companies kept making it more easy. Here we got these sync buttons. You can be a professional DJ. Here's some software. Here's a video game. You know, Again, they rubbed us out. They profited. They changed essentially the entire culture. Yeah. I mean, DJ culture for any genre of music. Yeah, so for me, the history is well mixed up and screwed up and not where it should be. But, you know, there's still time to fix everything, and there's still time to recorrect a lot of the wrongs, you know. And I just really hope that, you know, we'll be able to be a part of that and at least benefit from that because the history is so important. And while the true original historians are still alive, it would be great if everyone really did get what they deserve, you know, versus being rubbed out. I mean, I mean, I even see it now. Like, it seems like. no one really wants to put in the work or do the craft or it's like, yeah, you, you know, you get some gear and then like the next day they're like, okay, I'm a DJ now. It's like, you know, what happened to spending some years like, you know, studying music or watching other people. They're like practicing, you know, everything now it's like, they need that instant satisfaction, you know? And it's, it's like with social media, you know, they Like, what? Yeah, but that's what they do. And it's like, you just recognize how life rolls. Yeah, exactly. It's the times. I mean, it's 2019. I mean, I think it'd be really interesting to see where we're going to be in 10 years. Like, I'm kind of scared. I can't even think that far ahead. I mean, it's like. The way everything is going, you know, let's just, you know, you pick a subject. Like, there's this VR. I'm heavily into virtual reality at this point. And there's a VR game where you actually have this rookie DJ being tutored by the older DJ. And that is a video game showing you how to do the records, you know, slapping hands and, you know, instant crowd going on. I'm just like, wow. So this is what's happening now. You know, we're at that point where you got video stories and I love it. I'm not going to lie. I love it. But again, because the roots, the history of what it is that everyone is celebrating has not really been properly recorded. to me that leaves that door open for people to rewrite history and to me that's what scares me oh and they they tried to that was like that i think it was like billboard there was like a article about how david getta like brought house music to america oh yeah yeah and that that was just like such a fluke down yeah it really was that just goes to show like i mean that's a huge platform just one messy article like that could you know what i mean imagine how many people read that and may actually believed it and went for it you know what i mean there was there was one point where people especially uh i remember the japanese community uh It was Japanese and certain other countries thought house music started in New York. Wow. Some people thought techno started in Germany. you know, again, it's mixed roots. You know, we learn and we, we got those inspirations from Kraftwerk, but the shit started here. Yeah. You know, we're the ones that called it. We're the ones that bought the drum machines. We're the ones that called it. Who coined the terms. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, you know, music itself is always going to be universal. So you can't sit here and pinpoint who created the sound, you know, a lot of fight about that. Some people in Detroit fight about that. But, you know, when you look at it in its most innocent sense, like I tell people, hell, you can drop, what was that record? Wishbone by Tantra. That came out in the 70s. Sounds just like a house tune. You know, it was like they took, I don't even know what drum machine it was, but that whole song was based on that. Candido. You know, you got those four on the floor tunes that came out back then that has a very ingredient. So, you know, to me, when it comes to saying who claims it, that's a non-claimery situation, but who coined it? Exactly. That's what we actually can track down. And I mean, to me, you know, being from Detroit and like knowing the history of this music, which honestly, I learned about a lot of the history of Detroit, like dance music after I moved away, you know, when I was living here, I was like hanging out on the scene. But I guess I just I didn't realize, you know, how big it was. was, you know, worldwide until later on in life once I moved away from Detroit. But I think it really is important, you know, for the stories to be told, you know what I mean, for the people who started this to, you know, to be remembered, you know, to be uplifted, celebrated, especially people of color. You know, that's just the whole motivation behind, you know, even this here interview now. It's like just to remember. our black icons in dance music, you know, who created this gift to the world. And it is kind of a shame to see, like, people actually capitalize off this music in a major way and they weren't even really there. They don't even really respect, you know? They got paid for it. Exactly. You got a lot of that stuff. And, you know, unfortunately, that's what we chalk up to be called evolution. Those who start never really gets their true credit. It's those who saw it and was able to get the public to like it. Because it's already kind of laid out. You know what I mean? It's already laid out of how to do it. You know, like it's probably not as, you don't have to be as innovative now. Yeah, the platform's already laid out for you. All you got to do is just repeat process. Do a quick twist. How to be a DJ. Yeah. Get Instagram. Exactly. Get your followers popping. I would like to, you know, I think another thing that would be. it too is uh you know like how they got uh what was that on netflix get out yeah started hip-hop culture get out with the movie yeah oh no but the hip-hop evolution on netflix yeah yeah I want about this. Yeah. There's enough characters. Exactly. Well, it's actually crazy because I was watching that show like the other night and they were talking about like Mos Def and Talib Kweli and how it just really resonated with me because I, you know, I was listening to them a lot, but it was saying like how when they came out, their whole MO and their whole. vibe was like kind of preserving the culture, you know, and that's kind of my vibe with this music. Like, you know, to me, it's bigger than like being a DJ. It's literally about preserving culture, educating people, you know, getting more people involved who actually care about music, you know what I mean? And just... yeah like keeping the shit black keeping it Detroit you know it's it's important you know we we are still here you know but I think it's like you know we got to be proactive just to make sure that we do stay here because if we sit back and get lazy you know You know how it goes. You hit it right on the button. The culture watchers, they watch it. They wait. All you got to do is make that one mistake and be like, oh, who? Gone. Here you go. We were here first. Exactly. You start painting Roman pictures and I got to keep going. Again, like you said, You don't blame anyone for that because it's not a racist thing. It's not even so much racial. It's more or less preserving cultures. Exactly, just celebrating. Because like we said, the music is for everyone. It is for everyone. That's one of my favorite things about dance music is that it's just the most diverse environment in terms of race, age. I got you to see the world, the beauty of it. Like, you know yourself, you've traveled. You can go somewhere where they can't speak a drop of English, but the conversation is so there. Y'all talking. It's through the music. And that's the power, the magic, the beauty of the music itself, speaking. And just all the relationships made. You know, I'm sure, like, you know, you have friends around the world. Like, I have friends that live in the States. friends in London. They're like, how do you know these people? I'm like, music. Seriously, it connects you around the world. We really are blessed through all the bullshit that goes on in the politics to be able to travel, make money, and just interact with some of the most literally amazing people. cool people you know like life lifelong friendships and connections blessings you know it's just businesses uh relationships so many different things have spawned through this you know from global perspective you know my myself you know Dated women from around the world. Got a chance to experience traveling around the world. And not just doing tourist stuff. You're like a cultured man now. You know what I mean? It's like you probably got stories and experiences that a lot of people will never have. And I came off 7 Mile just trying to make sure I get off the neighborhood. Before I knew it, I'm someplace else having a party in some other country. It's mind-boggling, but again, it goes to the whole roots of the power of the music and the spirituality that comes from it. It holds true. You can go to another world, another country, and give it. them the gift of music and they'll be receptive to it and they'll embrace it and they'll put it into their culture data and before you know it you've now exchanged exactly exactly so We're going to go back a little bit. So we talked a little bit about this earlier, but my first introduction to dance music in Detroit was probably like, you know, Ghetto Tech on the radio Friday night, you know, live from Legends. But like one of the first like DJs that I saw out and play and could name was you, Mike Clark. So I was talking to someone about this. I think it was maybe like Brett Dancer. And I was just like, and I heard about, learned about all these, you know, the Belvedere theory and all that later. But I'm like, when I was living in Detroit, I'm like, Mike Clark was the man. That was like the only person I would ever hear about. And he was like, no, you're right. He was like, Mike Clark. He was like, he said you had a loft would go there. He said he would come down from Chicago. That was the after part. That was the after part. Yeah, that was, like, I was spent at Motor, and we would have special guests, like, you know, it would be anywhere from Steve Hurley, Tommy Moose, out of New York, Greenville. It could just be anybody, whoever would come down. So, what, would people just stay with you? when they were passing through the city or like after the club they would come over? Like laying on the ground, a couple of my boys, you know, they would come through. My apartment, my loft, it was right off the water. So you had like a nice scene where you could see Canada. And it was right, you know, if you go past the post office, of course. But, you know, it was right in the heart. So it was 3,500 square foot long. So, you know, cats want to come in. Prices was cheaper than to amazingly cheap. Oh, I could imagine. It's Detroit cheap. It's like an artist building. I think when the documentary I was saying, yeah, pretty much YG was right out, was right down the hall. Whenever people want to come through to check out the music experience, you had House of Techno. son yeah that is so awesome like all right i'll be back i'm gonna go get my hip hop fix real quick yg to call me up yg to qd they call me up yo man he's house here they want to meet you or cast be like y'all heard so what's that before he was doing house yeah no it was yeah yeah before he's doing houses when everybody's doing hip hop yeah you know i haven't over so everybody can meet each other but that was the beauty of it because people from all around the world would come to our buildings yeah and just see the different sounds of Detroit you know what I mean that's amazing it was it was it was definitely a wonderful time during that point because It was a lot of inner synergy right here. Yeah. Right here. Matter of fact, when the first festival, you know, festival number one, Carl Craig, I was helping him. Part of the thing, I was in charge of hiring the people at the after parties, you know, all the bars and clubs. And I remember the very first day. Through my window, I could hear, what's the Pepe Braddock tune? Burnt. Deep Burnt. They were playing it. I could hear it from a mile away through my window. Oh, wow. I opened up the window, and the whole air was filled with deep burn. Oh, my God. So I'm like, I'm just excited because, remind you, this is Festival One. So this is. before any of these festivals was thought of. - So this was huge to hear that track blasted from Hart Plaza. - A mile away, I'm hearing house music a mile away, hearing one of my favorite tunes being put in the air. Like I gotta walk through the Cobo Arena tunnel to get to Hart Plaza. And as I'm walking through the tunnel, through the freeway. I remember this guy, he was walking past, he had a microphone. He was obviously there to interview. And he just probably just saw the look on my face as I'm just walking towards the music, like a zombie. He's like, what is this guy's got going on? Yeah, and I remember he was like, sir, what are you thinking? What do you think about the very first festival and hearing this track and stuff like that? And I was just like, you know, like, just listen. You know, I don't know if you can understand where I'm coming from, but this here is history in the making to be able to hear what we call underground music that was so socially unacceptable for the longest. Yeah. And now I'm hearing it at Heart Plaza, put up in the air a mile away, and no one's stopping it. Like a huge legal, like, event, you know what I mean? I almost had a tear in my eye. Because it was that important. That special. And it was that special, you know, because it was... You never you never imagined it because we made it happen We did we had to imagine what it would be like to be a heart plaza doing shit that we do in the basement at the clubs Yeah, that people wouldn't just be like oh whatever they yeah and around like it was actually a real tangible thing at that point It was so powerful. I got taken from us immediately Look at it now. Yeah. And it's blown up, you know, to such a high level, you know. So I just. You said you were on the committee, too. So when did that start? The EMF committee? Yep. The DMF. Yep. I was part of the original. I think the first two years. And then maybe the second year, there was a situation that happened with Carl. and Carol Marvin and everybody else. You know, they wanted me to be a part of it, but I couldn't because at the time I was label mate with Carl, so I couldn't just sell him out because that would make me look like, you know. Yeah, exactly. I don't do that to my people, you know. And Carl was, you know, I thank him for so many things. You know, he brought. He saw through to make this thing happen. When he put me on his label, he got me some gigs, did some tours. So I'm thankful for him for giving me that opportunity because most people don't do that kind of stuff. So, you know, naturally, when that was... took him from him and they were trying to boycott him, I was first one in line. Oh, hell no. You know, you can't just do that. There was a lot of people that was hating on him and I was like, nah, you know, no matter what y'all think, this is what this brother did, you know. Exactly. I'm not going to sit here and join forces with y'all just because y'all trying to take over. Just so I can still be down, you know I don't really want people talking about me and it's true. You know, people talk shit about you. Can't escape that. But it's one thing if you truly did some fucked up shit versus they just talking shit. Exactly. And for me, I'm always be true to myself. I'll always be true to my people. And I'll always do what I want. Think is best. What I think is best for everybody. Because. We're in that revolutionary state where everything that we do affects the generations to come. We are the first, second generation of the electronic people, so what we do affects us. So we have to be conscious of what we do. Because if we don't, UIC was going out. It's so far past us. If we don't say nothing, we could just die and become stone. Well, let me ask you this. Okay, so, I mean, that's interesting that you said that. Like, you know, it could go any, like, the music could go anywhere. So it's important, like, that the originators are here and they're, like, you know, vocal and telling the stories. How do you feel about the older generations embracing the newer generation? I guess I would consider myself someone that's a part of the new generation. And from what I see, sometimes I'll see other people in my realm or my age range that are doing music. They're like, oh, well, all the OGs, they think that we don't really care about music. you know, we only care about social media or, you know, our tracks aren't good or we don't play vinyl or this and that. Like, do you feel like there's a disconnect between the generations or is there, I mean, is that a? I mean, I definitely see it, you know, maybe not through everyone, but sometimes, you know, we may feel attacked and it's like, I feel like there should be more of a mentorship or togetherness. You know, of course we need to show the fucking respect, which is, I think some younger people don't show that respect. Well, here's the thing, you know, just touching on that very situation. And this is my personal opinion. The whole problem with that scene is just the structure. We don't have structure. if we had structure, then you wouldn't have old versus new versus this versus that. Yeah, like sometimes it feels even competitive, which is like, oh, it shouldn't be like that. We should be embracing each other. Well, like I said, that's the professionalism of the ethics. You got people who they'll feel stepped on because some new person came on. Well, and it's people's livelihood. So in a sense, I understand that because you're like, if you're, you know, making your money and some young person comes in and like steals your resident, no, I don't say steal, but you know, they start. You're bringing in new people. I got my old people. My 10 years of service is no longer needed. And that's the story of it. I think that the structure is messed up and that's what causes it. Let's just say from a, I ain't going to say fictional, let's say from a realistic standpoint, if we had real structuring in the DJ game, you had it where... If you did so many years of professional DJing, playing at clubs, earned X amount of money, when you retire, you'll always have some form of benefit where you won't be stuck on the streets. You'll always have a house or something. You know, those kind of things. Going into the old versus new. I come from... martial arts schools, kung fu, taekwondo, different things. So in our schools coming up in the ranks, it was based on what you knew, your experience. You could be eight years old. If you are yellow belt, red belt, blue belt, whatever belt. And this grown-up is a white belt. You're going to teach this grown-up your craft. So no matter what age this person is, you're going to respect this little boy because he's going to teach you. Exactly. So you're going to learn from this person, and you're going to do your best because this person is teaching you how to do this to your best ability. So in other words, everyone has something to offer. Everyone should be respected. And if anything, there should be a form of structure, you know, a form where if you've been doing it this long, then this is your earnings, your rankings, whatever. If you've been doing it this long, this is your earnings and your rankings. Everything else is variables. But when you have a form of structure, it eliminates a lot of stuff because. Everything is based on the merits of who you are, not where you came from or your age group or none of that. It's just based on skill. Yeah, you know, you've been spending, you done did this, you done been there, so this is who you are. You got the skills. and the uh um the earnings as well as the experience of an international so therefore that is who you are you are international dj this is your points this is your rank so that gives you the right to be able to speak on or be a part of because this is your experience When you got people that create this out of the blue and they go by what they know in the local scene and they create that same facade from a global level. then you kind of miss using the power of what you got because you got people thinking you're more experienced than what you are. And they'll follow you and you'll lead them into a bad situation because now you're misleading folks. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of that. There's a lot. Because it's like, I mean, just to go back to the social media thing, like you can kind of portray whatever type of image you want. Like I've literally seen people portray images. I'm like, I know fucking real life and they're not but people go for it because they got You know, they got the pictures. You know, they may have had, you know. You remember Sasha Baron Cohen, right? Mm-mm. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy who does Sasha, he's that comedian. Okay. He had a parody where he was doing, he was being a DJ. He called himself Super Greg. He was like, Super Greg, number one. Now, mind you, he's an actor, so. He does these weird things. So he was this dude acting like an Israeli DJ with Adidas outfit with fucked up teeth, couldn't scratch for his shit. But he was acting like a superstar. Yeah, yeah. If you get a chance to look up Super Greg, it is Sacha Baron Conan. I don't think he even says it to anybody, but he's like, you know, he's a famous actor. And we used to watch that because it was so funny how a lot of people do that. Like, yo, and I'm going to get this stuff and I want you to show me how to scratch and I want to do your show next week. Yeah. Shit like that. And it's just like, okay, well, first of all, you don't even know DJ language and it's not cutting or just... discouraging anyone but again how the hell can you think you're going to wake up in the morning decide to become a profession and a month later you're like you know you barely learned equipment and just learning equipment only means you know how to use the equipment that still doesn't make you a professional just spinning in front of people don't make you a professional knowing how to think knowing how to make this crowd run, being able to allow yourself to embrace with everybody out there. People just get the equipment and take a picture, and then that's just where, you know, people are visual. So motherfuckers who don't really know about music or the scene, they just see you with the equipment, and they're automatically sold. Like, oh, wow, you're doing it. But, I mean, yeah, I definitely think, I also think people... You know, there's like a romance, like they romanticize the whole DJ life. You know, it's like, oh, like you're traveling, like you're doing this. Like they don't realize that it's actually real work or like that there's people put in years of dedication in their life. I'm still trying to find a good booking agency. so I can go touring. Exactly. A while ago, I didn't have to worry about that stuff. But nowadays, you apparently got to have an agency. I just joined this one agency. I think I'm saying it right. It's Common Agency. Okay. I'm doing a lot of freebies, but these type of things that people work and get going, these are the things that we look for. It's hard, but that's just the nature of the beast, you know. And again, for me, with it being a situation where we're not having structure. a person who's been experienced to be spending you know a couple decades shouldn't have to look for agency that should be you know all that kind of stuff should just be there you know if you're new to the game you're starting to learn everything you're running through everything okay now you're looking for people they get to know you but you know if you are a professional then there should already be stuff there for you to keep the game going professionally. And I'm always a bitch about that. And keeping the sound real, you know what I mean? Keeping it authentic because, I mean, I feel like, I mean, yeah, even just the sound, you know, overall has changed, you know? Like, I mean, even for me, I find myself always just kind of liking, like, you know, I play new shit, but just a lot of the old shit, like it's... I feel like people try to recreate that essence, you know, and it's just. You definitely caught it. I remember when I saw you play. Man, I love watching it at the Shari Varee party. You threw down. Oh, I was like, oh, Detroit, this is my chance. Yeah, you threw down. I was like this, damn. Me and Jelena was like. Yeah, check her out. But I was there, you know what I mean? And a lot of people think I'm younger, you know, like I'm 34. But obviously I started listening to House and hanging out in Detroit when I was 14. So there'll be people, you know, maybe like in their 20s and like they just get so inspired. They're like, oh, I'm ready. Like I want to DJ full time. next month and I'm like okay I know like my career and my success like inspires other people but I try to remind motherfuckers I'm like I paid my dues even when I first got my gear it was three years before I even got a gig or even tried like I wasn't really posting pictures. I wasn't trying to just be a DJ overnight. I just truly love music. I felt like there was a void. You wanted to do it right. Yeah, I'm like, there needs to be more black women. There needs to be more black people. There needs to be more motherfuckers from Detroit. It definitely just seems like people get so excited about the DJ thing now and they don't really want to put in the work. or even study the music. I'm like, dude, I was flying to Europe just to go to festivals to hear music before I was DJing. Like, I truly like commitment. And I think... That's what it's all about. Yeah, that's what it... You're actually, you'd be like the perfect model for people who want to become a DJ. Yeah, like put in work, go support, go see people. Like literally, I... And then the success really came too because I had already built... those relationships with, you know what I mean? I'm like Delano, he remembers me from back then. I've known him almost half my life now. So obviously, exactly. And it's like, people are willing to give you great opportunities when they know, you know, you're really about it. But unfortunately I do agree that there are sometimes opportunities presented to some. Where it's like, you know, put in a little work. Maybe it wasn't time for that. And then there are people who are deserving or who've been doing it. There's so many people out here. And that's going to always be the sad part because not everybody's going to get what they just do. There's always going to be someone out here who's been in the game for a long time. Oh, of course. I was going to be a bad motherfucker that just never made it for some reason. Yeah, they just didn't meet that right person to give them that opportunity. Yeah, exactly. You know, for me, I'm blessed. I would never complain. You know, for one, I'm in a unique position. You know, being one of the early guys, I was there at the beginning. I've seen the beginning of it. to travel. I was a part of that. I helped pave the ways, even though it didn't seem like it. But you realize when you're playing out and the people of that country look at you a certain way. You're not just playing just for yourself. You're representing your city. And in my case, you know, I'm representing everything from Underground Resistance to Happy Records to Detroit DJ. You know, just America as a whole. Like, seriously, like you got a lot on your back. Right. So, you know, my thing was I always tried to keep it casual, you know, make it look good, make it look fun, make sure they are entertained. You know, I might not be able to pull a rabbit out of my hat and throw some flame at you, but I can make that music sound so natural and good because I work at that. I work at the spirituality of the blend. I look at some people in the audience and pick them to be my muse as I play. So that way my spirit connects with theirs and their way we are connected. And to me, that's the best way to be able to, you know, get these parties going and get these people all involved where we all are dancing, bobbing our hairs at the same time and congregating, so to speak. You know, and those are the elements. And you can't do that within a year of getting to know your equipment. Exactly. Like you can't even dig that deep into electronic music in a year. You know what I mean? It's deeper than just watching a couple of documentaries. You try to learn how to blend. Yeah. exactly you're trying to learn how to beat match you know exactly you got time to crowd read yet or things that most folks don't understand and then my thing is like I mean on CDJs I mean I feel like any Anyone can beatmatch on CDJs within like a, you know what I mean? You got the numbers in front of you. Between the numbers and the sync button, it's like mathematician, it's math, baby. So yeah, I mean, I don't know. I do feel like, you know, I love that. so many people are interested in music and DJing now, but there's definitely a part of me that also feels like, you know, we don't want it to get oversaturated, you know, and it seems like it kind of is, but I guess that's just motivation to just keep pushing the quote-unquote real shit, you know what I mean? Because that's what's going to separate you or me from, you know, the next. superstar DJ or whatever, it's like, all right, well, you know, they'll probably get the, you know, the most of the money or whatever, but at least we got the respect, I guess, you know. I guess that's kind of what counts in a way. Yeah, exactly. You know, just that, just being able to. you know, get that far in it. You know, I'm just hoping that for the most part, the new generations that's coming out, you know, hopefully they'll be able to re-correct a lot of imbalances that's going on at the beginning. I would say during the entrepreneurial stages of our field. All right. Well, another thing I want to touch on, Mike Clark, like you are synonymous with the whole beat down movement. Talk about that. Like, you know, whatever you want to say about it or explain it or who was a part of it. I know. the beatdown crew was you, Norm, and Delano. Yeah, it was, well, it was, that was the name of the beatdown brothers. So just, you know, I guess to be clear on the whole beatdown movement, it was not necessarily a movement that I created. I just coined a phrase that was representing what we were doing at the time. I wanted to take that and use it because at the time we had a few things that was going on. Detroit sound at that was limited to the more techno vision. And the reason I say that is because when we had the whole Underground Resistance, Submerge, Happy Records Camp. It was prevalent on what was selling. The musical side that we were creating wasn't selling at all, where the more techno-oriented situations was flying off the handle. So you had that void that needed to be filled. And that became my mission, because for me, I'm a logical person. I'm a Capricorn. I didn't understand why is it that Detroit, home of Motown, home of funk, plays where we got the baddest musicians in the world, are not known for anything really musically being made electronically for Detroit. You know, like Louis Vega, he hired the Clark Sisters, Ant Fittler, Kenny Dixon, they doing their thing, but you got a lot of people that make tracks. and not enough people really making music. Piranha Head and a couple other folks, it was throwing down. But not naming because there's no reason to name anyone. I'm just making a point. And the point is we have some of the baddest musicians here. How come we don't have some of the baddest musical pieces coming out? Detroit house music wise. Yeah. You know. Because everyone is like, they just think of techno. You know. It's that whole facade, you know. I mean, in terms of electronic music, yeah, you don't really think how. You're like, oh, Detroit techno people automatically. All the time. Yeah. I've had people tell me, you know, can you sound more like these people over here? Because you're not, you know, sounding. Oh, they wanted you to like fit into that mold of of, you know, this is what we sound like. This is... my sound. I have this heritage that I have to give to you. So when you stop me from giving you my heritage and tell me I need to sound like these people, I'm not hating on you, but I'm just slightly offended. And there's different sounds coming out of Detroit. I mean, even for me, I was there at Agave. And that was really cool for you to say that was one of the last real things because I was there. But my memories of electronic music in Detroit are definitely more... house oriented, you know, especially what I was hearing at Agave. That wasn't really a techno night at all. It was super housey, super like vocally and soulful. And that's the true Detroit. I mean, you know, it was packed. It was full of people. Wasn't nobody saying, what's this? That was true Detroit. As me as a kid, like you came up 12 years old. I was 12 years old when I got into it. As a kid, it was a lot of music and vocal tracks, you know, D-Train, Martin Circus, all these different songs, but there was music. There was keyboards, solos, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And to me, that was the one thing that, you know, I think that we needed. I made this track called Believe. It was kind of like a gospel house tune. I was glad that it... did well because I used my old happy house piano chords, which is a sound that me and Mike Banks and a couple of people created from back in the day. And, you know, it was the beginning. So, you know, 30 years later, bring it back. Did that sound, that came, and then with the help of my new partner, his name is Eli, he's a badass keyboardist. I mean, you know, his music speaks for itself. The record's steady going. He was part of Platters, Dramatics. He performs at Las Vegas, so he comes from that end of the musical spectrum. He's a Detroit true artist. Old school, does all those crooning type songs and all that. He's one of my neighbors, and he also plays at my church. So I wanted to try using him for House Records, even though he don't know a damn thing about house. I just figured, you know, with his talent, if I direct the track the right way, you know, we see what we can come up with. And it was perfect. It was perfect. I did very little. I just kind of guided him at one time. he got it going. I just stood back and let him do his thing. And, you know, the song could, you know, maybe be mastered a little bit better and all the above, but you can't deny the techniques on the song. Exactly. You know, the music is very musically oriented. So I want to do more stuff like that. And I swear, I hope no one says you're trying to sound like you're coming out of New York or no shit like that. Oh, no. is not this is a raw ass detroit musician exactly we don't know shit about house music that's just doing him so if anybody goes there you're hearing it right now you're wrong cool so we just have like a few more minutes here i just want to say this is actually like a really great conversation so thank you so much i'm glad you have me for hanging out I guess I'm trying to think of like a last question. I guess we talked about this a little bit earlier. You know, we've talked a lot today about, you know, the old Detroit and how it was. And, you know, what is, you know, what do you think of the new Detroit? You know, that's a term I hear. a lot, the new Detroit. How are you, how do you feel about the scene? I guess just the overall energy of the city, but also about the scene too. Are you feeling it? Are you excited for what's next? Are you weary? You know, Leary is the answer because, you know, living downtown for 17 years. I pretty much got priced out. And then I moved midtown where I own an apartment building. And I kind of got priced out of there too. So on that end, I'm not feeling it. You have the new people here. Detroit, we've always been inviting. So on that end, I'm glad we got new people here. Those new people, not speaking on all of them, but there's a few, and I'm pretty sure when I say this, a lot of people can relate. They're not as friendly. A lot of them treat us almost as if we're not from here. You know, as I told you earlier in that story, I'm spinning that old Oslo's. I step out to get some air because it's hot as shit down there. And while I'm sitting there, this girl comes out of her apartment with her dog. And she walks her dog down this woodwork, stops and looks at me. And, you know, immediately looks at me like some homeless person saying, excuse me, are you lost? Do you need any help? And when I looked at her and she said that, I'm thinking to myself, are these the people that we have in our city now where they're going to look down? at the very people who's always been here and having the nerve to ask you if you're lost when you've been on these blocks for yeah i don't know if she was being real or condescending yeah you know it really felt condescending like are you really trying to help me are you trying to be like a smart ass thank you you know and i was like you know and it's not trying to go racial it's just you have these new group of people that they come in and enjoying the They enjoying everything except the people and the... and the festivities and energy itself. They're coming in, looking at the property, creating their own energy, creating their own thing, and it almost feels like they're snubbing us out. And it's like you don't want that to take away from the essence of the real Detroit, the Detroit that we know, that you grew up with. Exactly. The Detroit I know from when I lived here, but it's been 12 years. So I see the type of folks you're talking about. Yeah. And then, you know, at the same time, you got some, you know, I got some friends that moved from the burbs and out of town that moved here that someone moved in my neighborhood. So, you know, I like that we have a new, more energetic. diverse city. It's lively, it's exciting again. Yeah, you know, it's an exciting city. I get to run downtown and not know anything. Like, what is this? What is this restaurant? You know, it's like being out of town, but you're home. Right. So, you know, on that end, I love it. You know, new venues. Sometimes I got new gigs. I'm still blessed to maintain a residency out here on a monthly level. Northern Lights has been around for a minute. That's actually amazing for me to see that place still stay. Cheers to Mike Salaka. Cheers to Keger. Keger was the one. Just so a lot of people, if you guys ever follow me, know about the Agave legend and all that kind of stuff. This shout goes out to Short Round and Kegger because Short Round was the one who originally was supposed to do Agave, but he chose to give it to me because he wanted to find another venue. And Kegger is the one who hired Short Round, so it's an inner circle. You know, these are my brothers. I've been knowing Kegger. Kegger originally started at Motor. So that's my brother from Motor. He was a manager up there. In short round, that's just my brother, period. If anybody knows the both of us, they know that's my brother all day long. So when they pitched the whole idea of me doing a Sunday at Agave. It was at the exact same time we had started doing the the beatdown brothers thing me and Norman Delano We had this club over here that I was spent I was resident that I had them spend it with me at it We didn't do that. Well, you know, it's huge Donny the biggest gig we had there was I brought current Abrams there with a Teresa Hill and Todd Johnson helped me to pull that one off and That was the biggest one there. But other than that, it was a lot of hitting misses on some stuff. So when this opportunity came, it was weird because I remember negotiating Norm and Delano to play with me because normally it's just me with my own residencies. But I was really trying to push the beat down sound as well as us as beat down brothers. So I figured at home, if I could set up a residency and we get this right here going, that would be the beginning of something big. And that was what I wanted to do. you know, Norm and Delano were my guys who did it. With the sound itself, when that started blowing up, I was able to put that in terms of records, you know. In my eyes, something that was slow enough to put enough rhythm in it to keep your groove, but it was basic enough to... be familiar with everyone, but you can always put your heart in it. So when you hear it, even though as simple as it can be, it caught the essence of your most soulful, as funky as moments, you know? So it's nothing, no newer than what anybody else made, but I just coined it as that because us as Detroit and back then, you probably remember, you couldn't really associate Detroit with house music or deep house because it went, it was slashed straight over to Chicago. And no matter how, looked at it we were never given that term house music in Detroit so I was like beatdown yeah we're doing beatdown We just house music. Exactly. And it worked. It sold. It did good. We licensed it. I got tours. It had its run. Now everybody's doing their own thing now. Yeah, I saw Delano actually at the airport. Oh, really? Delano's been blowing up. Yeah, and then I think he's back because he's playing somewhere tomorrow. But, yeah, I was heading in. He looked like he was heading somewhere. Yeah, he's, you know, it was like. Like I guess I was probably one of the first ones to start really touring because I started doing stuff with, you know, I'm part of the original, so, you know. You do this shit. You were there. So I started traveling, and then at some point I wanted to come home to bring some stuff back. The Techno Boys, they was doing their thing with their people. I'm representing the house, and none of the house people was really out there like that. I looked up, I'm traveling, and the only people I'm hanging out with is my fellow house music heads from New York, California, from wherever, but not Detroit. I would see my techno people, but none of my house people. So I was like, this is kind of... Well, that's weird, because there's like... I mean, maybe he came later, but like Patrice Scott or like Alton Miller. Because I'm like... I'm thinking all these great Detroit house, but okay, but they were later on. You know, you're talking like early 90s. You're talking about when it was just starting to kick off. Yeah, okay. It was still just more of a techno sound. Right. Or so people thought. Well, you know, the sound, the whole traveling part was so new. It just kind of manifested into itself, you know. When I did my first gig, I filled in for Juan, Santiago Chile. It was Santiago Chile. Laura Gavor, who was me and his manager, she called me up and asked me, did I have time to do a gig? Are you busy tonight? Are you busy tomorrow? Nope. do a gig tonight? Can you hang out a couple days? Laura, why are you asking me these questions about tomorrow and the next day about a gig? Well, the gig's in South America. I want to know, can you fly? Do you go there to do it? And that was my very first overseas gig. Oh my God, that's amazing. It was crazy. interesting for it to be South America because I guess you always just think like oh like Europe you know because that's where the sound is yeah because I was picking us up you know especially at that point you know yeah but okay they was on it in Chile Santiago Chile that was my first one and it has always been kind of that that weird road ever since but you know again my frame of mind it was there was no celebrity I'm DJing to be a rock star it was not that kind of thing because it wasn't about that frame of mind frame of mind then was I'm about to DJ so I can show these folks how we do it in Detroit that's how we spin in Detroit and like we said that's I think more of the problem today is more of this desire to be the star yeah and it's like I mean honestly if you think about it DJs really like we're not even really supposed to be watched we're just playing music you know what I mean so the fact that it's like we're up there I'm not playing a guitar I'm not really playing you know it's like I'm literally just like pressing buttons or pulling out records or whatever and I get the pretty face thing or the model S look or whatever you're trying to capture on there but like you said we're not supposed to be on Spotify. Yeah, it's about the music. But sometimes it seems like it's about the person. They want to see you so bad. It makes me feel so uncomfortable when I'm trying to spin and everyone is staring at my nostrils. I mean, I'm just trying to spin. I'm over trying to catch your vibe, but you're, like, staring at me like you're trying to catch my vibe. I'm just like, no. Or you may just be tired and not really in that mode and you're kind of just like, I just want to play tracks, you know? And then I feel like when you have people just watching, engaging you, you feel like you got to like, you know, just be, because sometimes I'll dance and be into it. But if I'm tired, I'm like, fuck, I don't really want to do that. I kind of just play music. But if you have that pressure from the people. You know, you don't want to look bored because they're quick to be like, oh, you know, music was good, but there's no energy in the set. Like, I'm not up here. This ain't a dance contest for me. Thank you. I'm playing tracks. It's so wild that they go from you once was a wall. You were once environment. you was the person who when you were djing they would come in and just say hi and turn in here you were probably up in a corner somewhere and like didn't even nobody where they heard your voice or whatever yeah we went from that to being right in the middle center stage being uh recorded live all the time yeah you know magazine also pressure too yeah like i I liked it when they liked us for our studio skills. Like, you know, you was famous if you could do studio skills and, you know, do all kinds of stuff. But, you know, now it almost has nothing to do with studio skills. It has nothing to do with your sets. It just has everything to do with who you're associated with and or how you look. And, you know, that's cool. But again, let's have some structure to this shit. You know, because there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of talented people. And for me, I'm always pushed for the talent of the DJ game over the look in a profession because the profession itself has proven that it's not about the professional. You know, it's about. whatever you tried to make the trend. And, you know, obviously we're not, you know, part Detroit. The name is part of the trend, but as far as the DJs themselves, if we were a part of the trend, you could name a lot of Detroit DJs from a, you know, standpoint, but you really can't, you know, like you said, when you look at these magazines and you look at all these different companies. They only got a finger full of Detroit DJs, but we are the original. When you have all these different shows, how much the Detroit sound, there's a high possibility a lot of the DJs aren't really from there. Some of you might get one or two. So you got those unstructured situations going on. Then when you look at the scene itself, again, yes, we do have a techno scene, but we have a much... bigger or we used to have a much bigger stronger soulful scene that needs to be embraced and to me if that happens then I can neutralize the Detroit sound with Motown jazz and funk and stuff that we've always been synonymous with Yeah, exactly. Bring the balance back. Exactly, because we are, I mean. I want a T-shirt, bring the balance back. I mean, when you think about Detroit or even just DJs from Detroit, you know, it's always like, you know, they play everything. You know what I mean? You never really know what to expect in a Detroit set. You know, it's a music city and people are educated and knowledgeable. So, yeah, in closing, I just want to say, you know, thank you for, you know, all the contributions you have made, you know, all the records you've put out. You know, I've definitely was really excited to interview you. And I was like, this is one of the voices that I feel like more people should know about. You know what I mean? Like you were like the ambassador of Detroit, like literally, you know, I always say I'm like. Mike Clark, when I started finding out about DJs in Detroit, you were the main one. I used to remember I'd see you at Oslo, religiously, you know, going to Agave back then. So it's really cool to just sit down here with you and, you know, be able to hear a bit of your story, you know, not all of it, because I know we'd be here all night. You're getting shy out of me. So, yeah, do you want to give any, like, last-minute shout-outs or, you know, just let us know about any other projects you have coming up? Oh, yeah.
