Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is on Melt Festival. Big festivals often struggle to create an authentic atmosphere, but Germany's Melt does it with ease. In the last 20 years, they've booked some of the biggest names in music. But they've always been ahead of the curve when it comes to club culture, often spotting rising talent years before they become staples on the circuit. I recently spoke with Melt's... Booker Stefan Lehmkuhl about the challenges of remaining a leading name in the festival calendar and how the events landscape has evolved over the last two decades. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange on Melt Festival is up next. I swam into your spell, on the ride of God we fell. You were plush and I lay bare, you had me howling. Cold, I fell into your skin, on the night you laid me on. Under your sin, you heard me howlin', howlin'. Melt Festival has been running for 20 years now, and I think it's probably safe to say that's one of Europe's favourites. And it gets a pretty solid crossover between people who are into electronic music and then people who are coming at it from more larger artists, and it provides this kind of like crossing over point for these worlds somewhat. It started from pretty humble origins with some open airs outside of Berlin. Was it ever the intention to grow into something so big from those early days? So I wasn't involved from day one, but from what I know from the people who started it back in 1997, I don't think they had it in mind, but I do think they were planning to start something new in the festival calendar. And I mean, back in those days, the festival calendar wasn't by far as big as it is now. So I guess the possibilities also was... quite open but it wasn't definitely it definitely wasn't ever a festival that was kind of built by scratch it was kind of an organic thing that kind of grew from year to year into something else i guess it's pretty unusual for a festival nowadays to start as a diy project basically What were those early editions like? So again, I can only tell from what I heard because I wasn't there, which is funny. I mean, I got involved in 2004, actually. But it was a proper, I think events like that still happen. You know, it was a proper one day rave outside of Berlin. Like they still happen. I think it was about one and a half hours north of Berlin. Now we are like one and a half hours south of Berlin. And it was by a lake and it was a you know, one stage techno thing with a lot of Berlin local artists. And I think like people like maybe Luke Slater or someone was a special guest, but it's mainly, you know, Ben E. Klock, for example, was I think one of the first names and people like Dixon and Alan Alien, who was, of course, already very active in Berlin, were playing there. And it was a small open air one day rave with about, I think, 2000 people. What's the connection between the festival and Berlin's Melting Point record store? So the people who founded it were like kind of a family business was like two brothers and sisters and the I think brother-in-law so it was four five later five people one of them running the Melting Point record store and the other guys running the Pfefferbank club which is now the Bussi here in Berlin and Pfefferbank back in the days was a really proper house club with, you know, people like Kiki or Phonique. Martini Brothers and Klee as resident DJs, really good running club with same bouncer that is now the main Borkheim bouncer. Yeah, they all started it together. And I think the name Melt is influenced by the Melting Point record store. So what was the process of finding locations back in those days? Because as you said, you became involved in 2003, right? And was this when the first edition happened at Ferropolis or was that earlier on? I mean, the family I was just talking about, I already knew them a bit longer than 2003. So we were kind of at a business relationship, but we also got friends. So one of the main guys was actually driving past Ferropolis, the name of the venue. when he was driving through that, I guess, holidays or something. So he was actually just crossing it and saw these cranes somewhere and he never passed that area before and he saw the cranes. And then so accidentally, basically, and he drove by and had to look what that crazy skyline there is. and then he realized it was a huge construction area and stuff was happening. There was no lake around it like these days. It was like a huge hole that was done by the coal mining industry when it was destroying the landscape there. And it was, you know, Ferropolis is a Bauhaus University project. It's close to Dessau, and Dessau is like the Bauhaus city, and there's the Bauhaus University for architecture and stuff. And they, together with the land, Saxony Unhold, the land decided that they will kind of re-nature that area. So there were like the cranes from back in the days from the mining times and the hole around it. So the plan was to re-nature it and build it into kind of a mix of an open air museum for, you know. brown coal mining history and also at the same time make it an events arena. But when he drove by, it was like a big construction site. And then he asked the people what's happening here. So they told him and then he was like, oh, can I do a party here? So he was basically the first accidentally kind of discovering it and also then the first ever to make a party. And the first party that I met was, I think, at... 1999, if I don't lie, there. And it was on the spot where now we have the big wheel stage. So it was like the last crane. And behind that crane, one day Melt again there with, I think, 2,000 people. So was it around this time that it became clear that Melt was growing into something more than just a... a rave outside of Berlin? When did it become clear that something bigger was taking place? I think what they started to think was, I mean, there was this time, I think, you know, I remember it as like, when was the year when Seven Nation Army from White Stripes came out? Early 2000s. Early 2000s. It was one of those songs that was... played those days there was a love parade in Berlin. It was huge and every second truck played Seven Nation Army. And I think one of the thoughts one to start to mix to add other genres than electronic music was you know we or they or a lot of people you know. like electronic music, but they also are influenced by, I don't know, the Cure, you know, indie bands. And, you know, they have a, they heard other music when they were younger, Depeche Mode, whatever. And White Stripes was, Seven Nation Army, I think, was one of these songs that was played on techno parties or on all sorts of parties. And everyone knew that song. So I always take it as an example that. that song, I don't know, somehow, I guess, gave the idea to say, oh, why is it only techno? But in the beginning, I think it was 2001. No, they didn't really mix it. They added a second day and they did a band day. and Electro Day. And they did that for two days. And then the name Melt, in terms of everything's melting, started to make proper sense. I wouldn't even say, I don't know if it was the idea from day one. I don't think it was. But I think the people who did it were definitely not only techno. in their homes. So they started to book some German indie rock bands and some international acts. I think Zoot Woman and stuff were, you know, some of these dancey bands that were around back in the days. They started to do these two days. Always with a bit, you know, limited success. I mean, it was always, it had a good name. It had a bigger name than it was, I think. But I think they never had more than... three four thousand people and also they had a lot of bad luck with the weather I think back then it was happening in June I think and June can be very rainy in Germany they always managed to put up great shows and it had a great reputation People were starting talking about it, had a great vibe. The location was amazing. People who came there were like, wow, that's amazing. But again, the location was a construction area. There was no lake. It was totally different than it is now. But yeah, 2003, they had to take a break because actually they think it's okay to say, yeah, they have bad luck with the weather. There weren't quite enough people. So they lost money and they got nervous about, oh shit, how long can we continue to do this? And when they told me that I was... working at Intro magazine, which is a music magazine, and we did also produce, which is also still around, the Festival Guide magazine, and my position was basically to do the corporations, the media corporations with festivals. When they cancelled, at the same time, we were thinking to do our own festival. It was supposed to be introducing festival. We still do introducing shows, which is kind of introducing new music. promoting the magazine. So I'd never been to Ferropolis and I'd never been to the festival, but I knew the guys. who did it and not only from setting them advertisers for the festival but also kind of having a common social network so you know we as magazine then said why don't we you know it's such a great location the concept mixing electronic music and bands fits our magazine perfectly we are planning to do something so why don't we save meld and you know do it together so that's what we did in 2004 around that time you're talking about the the combination of non-dance music with dance music acts Were there many other festivals around in the early 2000s or even before that which had been doing this? Or was this sort of something that Melt maybe had a part in helping to popularize? I would say so. I can't think of any event that ever did it. That was definitely our USP, what you would say now, you know, like it's no one else did it. And I think some. people also found that a bit weird but I think overall people found that really interesting I found it very natural because I was more I was going to a lot of festivals also because of my job of working at this festival magazine I didn't like all the festivals because you either had the rock festivals you had a hip-hop festival you had a reggae festival you had a dark wave festival you had no festivals who mixed it up at all and I found that really boring First thing I did when we said we get involved in 2004 was let's not do one day rock and one day techno. Let's just mix it completely up. Let's have the live acts on the main stage and then later on a big DJ on the main stage, but at the same time dance floors and completely mix it up. And let's just open it up to all sorts of music. I mean, we added, I don't know, bailey funk, some hip hop. I mean, it was like the rule number one was mainly like what we would consider good music, you know, kind of quality music for people who are into music. And that was the rule number one, but it didn't really matter. fits what kind of genre it was. And so, yeah, but we were definitely, I think, maybe even worldwide, I think we were the first ones to do it. And I think we were the only ones doing that for quite a long time. Interesting. What was the transition for you personally like coming from a music media background, essentially? to moving towards working in a festival with a lot of moving parts and a lot of logistics to think about. What was that transition like for you? Exciting, but also very painful at times. I mean, I was always kind of also working in events, like since I can think, I was always working in concert venues and stuff, and I always knew that is kind of where I want to... go. But at the music magazine, my other job was also to do the events that promoted the magazine. So we were promoting a lot of shows already in Cologne, where the magazine those days was still located. But I moved to Berlin for the festival actually in 2003. But we also already promoted a lot of concerts and shows in Berlin. So at the old Maria Club mainly. So the booking part of things, which is still until now my key position, was more familiar to me. But the production side of things outside of the indoor venue was pretty new. So we had the guys who did it there already. They were a bit more experienced, but we were all not professionals to be fair. In the beginning, we did a lot of miscalculations, you know, had great ideas that turned out to be too expensive. And obviously, yeah, in the beginning, I mean, everyone had to do everything themselves. I mean, I was even, you know, carrying drinks to the back. I mean, it was just four days of not sleeping and not enough people. panic attacks on site. I was sleeping there for two weeks almost before the festival and oh my god it was a nightmare but it was you know when it then happened and when you then realize okay it's not perfect but the people have a good time and there's a good vibe, and we lost money. But it was always a great vibe. You always kind of had this feeling something special going on here. People will talk about it. There will be more people next year. At some point it will work. So there was definitely kind of a belief that it will work. Some of the ones, you know, some of the founders, because, you know, if you have this financial risk ahead of you and if you see, okay, now this is going to be the cost and then you had pre-sales and everything and you could just saw, okay, this is very unlikely we hit the point. Basically, even before the first festival, they pretty much pulled out and we were the magazine. We had some savings, not many. And I must say the amount we lost looking at it now. if you talk to professional promoters about it, it's not much, you know. But those times for all of us, it was a huge amount. And so that makes you very nervous. And that's a very challenging process to really go through it and then believe in it and stuff. But then it helps to just do it and see, okay, does it have the potential or not? we were very convinced that it has the potential. But I also completely understood everyone who said, yeah, there might be the potential, but I can't deal with those sleepless nights anymore. How many years did it take until the balance sheet started looking like, oh, this is something that's sustainable? I think it was the third year that we got involved. I mean, 2006. I think that was the first time also where we think we broke even. So we didn't lose money. And it was every year, 2,000, 3,000 people more came. So you definitely saw, okay, there's kind of a word of mouth effect. People are excited about it. So I think 2006 we had for the first time around 7,000, 8,000 people. And it was also the first time that the venue didn't look completely empty. I mean, like we didn't use most, like it has much more space, but we did. use all the areas so I think 2006 was the first year where it really looked busy and stuff and yeah it started to feel big and then yeah every year you know it was every year I don't know two three thousand people more until the point when it reached yeah 20 20 000 people so I've read that over half the people that come to melt come from outside Germany. At what point do you think that started happening, that people were coming from outside the country and have heard of this thing and thought that it was a good enough idea to travel to come to it? Definitely the Dutch were there at first, and I think they were there pretty early. There was a good guy who helped us to... promoted in the Netherlands. I think that was the first and only country that we started to promote outside because I think you also Dutch are known for traveling to Germany or to all over the place and travel to festivals still. And they were there very early, I think, you know, 2006, I think we already had, I don't know, 500 or a thousand Dutch people out of 5,000 or 6,000 guests, something like that. And so they continued to come in big numbers. And then UK came as well. We didn't do much promotion, actually, outside of Germany. But it was more the word of mouth effect, I guess. But it was also more a natural process. We didn't really, we never really forced it really hard. It just happened. And suddenly it was. 50%, but luckily it was always the right mix of people. It was always actually added to the vibe a lot, I think, ever since. It wasn't always 50%. I think in the beginning it was like 25%. and the numbers were growing, and it kind of stopped at 50% for a good while now, which I think is good because, you know, before Melt happened, I used to go to Benny Kassim Festival a lot, but I couldn't go then because ever since it's on the same weekend, it's still on the same weekend, and that changed into you. UK festival, you know, but it was when I was there the first time it was a Spanish festival. And now if you go, it's a British festival with some Spanish people, but that's not the same at Melt. Having the electronic and the non-electronic parts together. Do you get the sense that people would stick to what they're used to and there'd be people who'd stay at the sleepless for three days and then there's people who go to the main stages for three days? Or do you think there's more of a crossover these days of people enjoying both parts of what the festival offers? I hope they enjoy both parts, but I'm sure... I think there were always a lot of people who maybe even mainly come for the party and for the dance aspect. But I think they like to see two or three live acts per day when they know it, they want to see it. Great. I would go to the concert in my city. Now I can see it at a rave or something. But I think earlier, I don't know, 10 years ago, there were also a big amount of people who think potentially mainly came because of the bands. So I think there were kind of two people who, you know, harmonied pretty well with each other, maybe one half more for the bands and still then being open to go after the concerts to... to the sleepless floor, to the techno floors and dance with their friends who like techno, but maybe those people who wouldn't really go to the clubs in their home cities, but rather to go to the concerts. So I think that mixed up really nice. In the last years, maybe that got a little bit less. I have the feeling it's more, it's a lot about the dance floors. The dance floors are packed all the times. the bands are busy as well, especially the headliners. But you can see, okay, they're on the dance floors and they're like, oh, I want to see whoever Phoenix playing and then 10,000 people move over. But the dance floors are still busy. You know, it's the dance floors are never getting empty. So because they don't stop and then the live acts have changes and stuff. And obviously, I mean, the indie. The proper indie scene, I mean, like the bands who had like fantastic shows, you know, like, I don't know, Block Party or The Rapture or Chick Chick Chick or these kind of things. They died out a little bit over the last years. I mean, the proper indie rock scene is my feeling got a bit smaller over the last years. You know, there was a time where there were a lot of bands coming out that are... perfect for metal. You know, Block Party, I think, is a great example because it's like, it's a rock band, but it's such an energetic, dancey rock band. It's kind of a party rock band. You can properly dance to it and they kind of bring a cool party vibe to everything or the rapture or something. You know, it's perfect for a concept like metal. Over the last years, these kind of bands and music kind of got a bit less, I think. So what do you think has moved into the place of those bands as these kind of like in between big stage, not quite dance music, but still like main stage material acts? On the one hand side, the electronic life acts, I don't know, you know, like Disclosure or someone or Brutimental or these kind of things that maybe have a bit of a... urban aspect to them also. I mean, I think in the moment, what could also work really well at Melt is, you know, some of the new hip hop, I mean, not the gangster rap kind of 100% hip hop, hip hop things, but the, you know, the cooler stuff like, you know, I mean, I couldn't get them for this year, but you know, someone like Frank Ocean or Solange, who are unfortunately on this year, not on this year's lineup. just because it didn't work out. But they could work perfectly now. Someone like Frank Ocean could now be what Block Party was, even though it's a much more mellow sound. But I think people would totally enjoy it. I guess we should maybe talk a little bit more about the sleepless four, because that's arguably one of the most well-known aspects of Melt. So is this... three days of non-stop dance music there. Does it ever shut down? No, it never stops. And last year we even added a fourth day. I mean, it was normally like, normally we're starting on Saturday morning, 7am when the arena, like the main festival arena closes at 7am in the morning normally. And then, so after Friday night, Saturday morning as kind of an after hour floor. the sleepless floor started and then it went on until the Monday morning without a break. And last year we decided to do the pre-party on the sleepless floor. Normally it was in a tent and it was with bands. Last year we wanted to try an electronic pre-party. So we decided to move it to the sleepless floor just to try it out. And then we said, okay. If we open it on Thursday, why should we close it on Friday? So it's there. It's ready by Thursday. It's a great flaw normally. It's a nice vibe there. So let's just try and see how it works. And in fact, it did work. I mean, it's like it has opened 90 hours and there's not a single hour that is empty. I mean, there are times that are a bit less busy. Maybe sometimes we're just 200, 300 people there. But then in the average, I think there are always, I don't know, at least 1,000, sometimes 4,000. Actually, I think we did it since 2004 and it was in cooperation with Beat Street, which was a... quite legendary after hour in Berlin and there was like when you know there wasn't a Berghain or there weren't much the Sunday or the whole after hour bigger bigger party after hour kind of thing wasn't that big but there was like this Beat Street thing in Berlin just kind of a secret after hour party with big names like Riccardo Villalobos and Richie Horton and everyone and So we teamed up with them and said, I'm not sure if it was called Sleepless Floor. I think it was just the Beat Street after hour. And then it worked so well. So we decided to some point it was called Sleepless Floor. I think in the beginning it was even the Red Bull Sleepless Floor because it fit. together well they go hand in hand the bookings are pretty interesting for a festival of melt size I'm talking about the sleepless four here and that You guys are really aware of what's going on in that gap between like when someone's still legitimately underground and when they're about to, you know, get media coverage and start playing festivals and things like that. A lot of these artists are playing like the sleepless for the year before they get on a larger circuit and stuff like that. What's behind you guys being aware of these new artists kind of like before the other big European players are? The early days of The Sleepiest Flower was always also the idea not only about the after hour, but it was also one idea to push or like to feature. rather unknown artists from in the beginning, mainly from the area, you know, a lot from, we had a lot of club corporations with Muna Club, for example, which is still around in Thüringen. A lot of those these days, Kater Blau DJs or, you know, these. Parties that are still around in Berlin, I don't know, these 48-hour parties, a lot of those guys from, I don't know, Dirty Düring and Nick Höppner and M-Pro and Mutlu and those people from Berlin and East Germany were playing there. So at some point we made it more international, but the aspect was always, okay, yeah, push someone and give people a platform also there. Like not only kind of really kind of hard party floor in a way, but... still also use that opportunity to have that many slots on a floor to really have a look, okay, who are the ones, yeah, where you can say in a year's time that they started at the CPS floor and next year they come back to one of the big dance floors. And that is still the idea behind it, I would say. So yeah, I mean, it's a mix of, we always like to have corporations with. with either clubs to say, okay, bring us the people that you think are cool or that you feature in your club or labels and magazines. You know, now we do Resident Advisor showcase there, talk to you guys, what's hot. Groove Magazine did a lot of slots there in the past. It's me booking stuff, but it's also my colleague Gideon who's booking mainly the techno stages. Because I'm 38 now. I used to go out a bit more than I do now. I can't listen to all the DJs, but Gideon still does. He just really knows what he's doing. You mentioned earlier about how like these kind of indie dance bands have had their time and have moved on and something else has come in its place. I wonder if there's anything else that comes to mind for you as a booker where over the past 14, 15 years or whatever that you've seen this kind of like sub-trends come and go. I was curious if you have like a perspective on any of those things. Yeah, lots of things coming. I mean, we were also even trying out smaller things that never really happened. I mean, for a while I had a fable for global bass music, whatever, influenced by Bailey Funk or, you know, African dance culture. So we tried a lot of, you know, Brazilian artists and worked together with people like Daniel Haxman or so to man recordings just to find, you know, cool. people from from all over the world early dubstep there was a phase of a lot of dubstep that that kind of disappeared in the moment a little bit but you know there were years where you know people like rusco or so like had great shows at meld in the moment i'm not sure if i would book it but i would book it again if something similar comes up then We started a lot with drum and bass. You know, when we started, there was always a drum and bass element. There wasn't a proper drum and bass floor, but there was, the people loved to listen to drum and bass. Last year, I tried it again a little bit. I was like, oh, maybe we should bring it back. Didn't work as well as I thought, but you know, it's like... the thing in the moment for at least not for Melt even though the scene is still there. We had a lot of EDM acts before it was even EDM. There was no word about EDM but for really small fees we had acts like it's kind of funny to say now but we had Kelvin Harris DJing there we had Deadmau5 DJing without a mask we had Nero, Knife Party Zed You know, all without a huge show, no LED walls, no confetti, no CO2, you know. But when it started to turn into this, which was basically a year or two after, we stopped booking it, you know. But in the year when we had it, it was worth trying it out and actually worked. And it wasn't uncool. But, you know, now, of course, it would be, couldn't book Kevin Harris to melt, but he did play. And it was great. But there cool house set that he played, you know, that wasn't quite EDM. So yeah, we saw a lot of trends or genres come and go, I guess. And another thing I'm interested in is whether on your end as a booker and dealing with, you know, agents and negotiating fees and stuff like that. Has that gotten more difficult over time? Do you feel like acts which might have been playing for X hundred euro a few years ago are like asking for higher fees and things like this? Do you have a perspective on that at all? It's terrible. No, it's absolutely happening. I mean, Artists grow. I mean, it's quite a natural thing that, I mean, as we are quite good in having artists early and for the first time they play for smaller fees because they're not worth fees. And then maybe a year after they are really worth a lot of money and then you pay 20 times as much. But that's just the natural thing. I mean, that's fair enough, of course. But overall the development of the fees because of there are so many festivals now mainly and festivals are the marketplace. where no matter if bands or DJs make most of their money, I mean, they just make more money than with club shows. Normally the fees are higher at festivals now. It wasn't always like that. I think 10, 15 years ago it wasn't necessarily the case that a festival fee would be higher than a concert or a club fee. But now it's naturally higher. So many more territories that have festivals now. It started kind of in Europe, this whole festival culture now. DJs have so many more markets to choose from. I mean, the United States haven't really been there 10 years ago when it comes to proper festivals or DJ gigs. Now they could even go to Russia, India, wherever. It's like every year there's kind of a new market and the new markets go in very high. They don't know. what it costs, they ask the agent, the artist agent, so how much is it? And then they say something and then they pay it because they think that's the way to do it. So, of course, we do kind of suffer from it. I mean, luckily... Melt is one of those festivals, I think, where artists generally say it's not this money show. It's kind of we want to play. It's fun. We might even stay as long as possible. I mean... Also changing a little bit, I don't know, five, ten years ago it was much more common that people hang out the whole day there. Maybe some even stay the whole weekend, bring friends. That's getting a bit less because, you know, even the smaller DJs sometimes play five festivals in one weekend or even more. The big DJs sometimes play three shows in one day because the festivals go from 10 a.m. to 24 hours basically. And then the really big ones go into their private jet and then go on to the next show and the promoters have to pay for the private jet. So it's getting more expensive. And I think sometimes it's getting a bit... too fast there were also some disappointments especially with acts also that you maybe even think as a festival you kind of pushed you had them two three times and then when they start to really kind of sell tickets or so then they ask for money where I sometimes even say you know what fuck off don't come anymore Fair enough. Do you think this is a symptom of, you're talking about this European festival culture and you've obviously seen it grow into a kind of crazy circuit over the past 10 years or so. But who are these festivals which are able to like, you know, just throw whatever money at an artist? versus like a festival for Melt, which started from an open air and kind of grew naturally. What is like the difference between like who's behind and how these festivals have been funded and stuff like that and how it's like altering the general festival environment in general? Not so easy to answer, I guess. I mean, it's a bit... Depending on the territory and the market, I don't know, I think it's more the higher fees also come from the new markets, like I just said. I think the markets and the promoters that started running festivals quite a bit later, they went in higher because they didn't really know. what the average fee of an artist is or something so yeah they basically ask how much is it and then they pay what what they ask for also sometimes they have different i mean sometimes they even can't some of the promoters don't really mind because it's uh Their advantage is there are new markets. They have an advantage that they could ask, for example, for higher sponsorship fees than we can in Germany, for example. I mean, we do work with sponsors. We need them to cover especially those artist costs, to be honest, also, and keep the ticket prices as low as possible, even though it's not even that low. But the advantage of those new markets is, you know, they have also no sponsorship history. So they can also go in really high with the sponsors and say it costs this and that. Our disadvantage is like we had sponsors 10 years ago and they're like, oh, why do we have to pay every year more? You know, sometimes like if I compare the fees that we get to fees what people in... Spain or especially the really new markets, South America, Brazil or something, get. It's crazy. It's a huge difference. Some festivals are funded by the region where they are happening, for example. There are lots of festivals when I see, okay, they do have a 20,000 capacity. And then I look at their lineups and I was like, and then I look at the ticket price. This can't be real. How do they do this? But if you then really look into it, they have some reasons why they can do it. Whether it's like they get a lot of money from the city or the mayor is involved or they have very low costs with the location or whatever. It's like a lot of reasons how you... can afford to pay the big fees. Or there's a big corporation that says, we just want to get involved into this and we want to start a new festival and we go in really aggressive and we are okay to invest, I don't know, two million loss in the first year to just build the festival up. build it up organically you know like every year it grew but these days people want to promote a festival or corporations want to promote a festival and then they want to go from zero to 20,000 to 50,000 within two years. And then they are also willing to invest a lot of money in the first year, maybe someone has the money. - Do you think in this environment, it's more difficult for a festival to grow in the way that Melt has in this kind of like steady organic way than it was say 15 years ago? I think it's harder today. It's not impossible if you have the right idea or hit the right scene or push the right buttons. I mean, even in Germany... There's so many new festivals that have a completely different approach, that don't really do promotion, don't have sponsors, don't really publish their lineup, but maybe don't really have the ambition to be a proper music festival. Maybe it's more about the experience. And there is music and there are DJs playing, but people don't really care who's playing. That's more of these concept festivals or so. And some of them are really successful, really fast and really organic without big corporations behind them. So I think that's totally possible. But I think you have to have a more special idea now because everything's already there. And now it's a European and a worldwide market. People are traveling. The airfares are cheap. So it's not about if you go, if you live in Germany, it's not necessarily about do I go to a festival close to Berlin or do I go to a festival in Amsterdam or do I go to a festival in Czech Republic or in Brazil. It's everything's possible. I would do the same. This is kind of connected to what you mentioned before, but a really surprising amount of festivals, at least from my perspective, is a non-European person. funded by like cultural agencies and cities and stuff like that. But was that the case also like 10, 20 years ago? Is that something new where these state affiliated bodies are starting to become interested in these like electronic music events and stuff like that? I think it's rather new because... Now they take cultural or even party tourism serious. I think 10 years ago, even in Berlin or so. politics or the politicians, the authorities didn't really appreciate it as a tourism factor. I think now there are enough numbers and enough studies that every mayor or every tourism person working for some region knows events and culture. pulls people and people are mobile, they travel, yeah, they totally know and see that. And I think there's a much bigger awareness and a much bigger open mind to help promoters who seem to do something good for the region or whatever. I mean, we never were lucky enough to benefit from that, even though we are in a region that benefits a lot from our festival. I mean, it's a debt. It's a dead area, but it's a beautiful area. It's actually a tourist tourism area, but it's not very known, especially not for young people. I mean, it's maybe older people who go to. Lutherstadt Wittenberg to know the history about Martin Luther or go to Bauhaus for the architecture or something. But no young person would naturally go to that area in the dark east of Germany. So I think we helped the area a lot to be more popular or to be more known, but we never got a cent for it. And they don't have the cent, to be fair. Interesting. So this area where Melt happens, you guys have been quite consistent in pushing agendas to do with diversity and representation over the years in various forms. How has that played out in the area where the festival happens? Yeah, good question, actually, because it's not the biggest match. We don't have that many people from the area, which is many. I mean, there are not so many young people living in that area. I think the young people in that area move to bigger cities quite early unless they stay there. But yeah, it's not the area known for its... most open, multicultural, gay-friendly whatsoever vibe. I mean, it's actually close. It's in the region where the right-wing party AFD last year gained the highest results in all Germany, I think with fucking 35%, something really terrible. It's not quite the vibe that the area kind of embraces what we do there, but it's great. Luckily, no one ever protests against us or something, but we always thought even though we don't have that many visitors from the area. And because we are who we are and we are coming from the music scene and from the club scene, I mean, I'm gay myself. It was very, very clear from the very beginning that we make it very clear. If you have the wrong thinking and our thinking, then you're not welcome here. And we didn't scream it out, but it was always on our tickets. It was always on our website. from year one to say, you know, everyone is welcome as long as you tolerate everyone who's there. And if you don't, then you will be kicked out or we don't even let you in. And also we, like very early, we, I think in the very first years when the Pfefferbank Club that was related to the festival, you know, there was this Labrador Bar, one of the really early, really cool kind of gay parties. they had a flaw there, you know, with a kind of rather queer lineup. And, you know, every year, like we had a... I mean, of course, people like Scissor Sisters or Peaches or the queer artists played, but it was not just to book them. It was always also to have the diversity. And I think general diversity also when it comes to gender equality and stuff, we really are very aware of it. I think this year, I think we have around 35% female artists or something, which is... which we didn't always have, but it also kind of the awareness, you know, we are people, I think, who are open for the discussions and from scratch we would like to do it right. And if we can, we even force it a little bit because we support it and we find it right. But we don't shout it out too often. I think, you know, we don't shout it out louder. Hey, we are the... we're the good guys i think it's just like but from what we do we would like to acknowledge the people yeah everyone's welcome here i think we also have a pretty high um percentage of gay visitors which is also i think quite unusual for for festivals outside the big cities and um i find that a very positive thing and i'm happy that people seem to recognize that it's a safe place for them. Given that we are in this festival landscape now where people can fly wherever they want really easily and there's so many festivals going on, what do you think it is about Melt that has kept it kind of consistently in this category that... a lot of festivals wished they had this kind of value associated with them, but Melt's got that. You know what I mean? It's a difficult question, but what do you think contributed to that? Good question. I don't know, maybe because we didn't force it too much or so. I mean, it's not that often people ask me, what's the target group of Melt? And then I'm like, I don't know, it's just the people who are there. It's like, we didn't do this festival to say, these are the people that we want to have. This is how we will achieve that. So there was not a master plan or something. Maybe people acknowledge that also, that it doesn't feel so created or so. It rather feels a bit natural. And I think also, yeah, we didn't. I mean, yeah, we always, I did always, you know, we're not like, like Berghain or so that never really talks about us or like, of course you can, like we even have TV broadcastings at the festival and we love to show pictures because it looks fine and people should see it to say, yeah, they want to come. It's not really that we have a myth or something. It's not really that we didn't talk about it, but... hope it's just authenticity. There is not a concept how he did it. That's the answer to the question. You make me feel You make me feel so high You make me feel so high You make me feel so high You make me feel so high.
