Thank you. you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. This is our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. So this week, I guess, is Mumdance. He's been a key player in the wave of sort of experimental grind and soundscape-y stuff that's been getting some decent attention for the last couple of years. He's been working incredibly hard to get his message out there, and as you'll hear in my first question, he's got an insane amount of projects off the ground recently. He's also got a really interesting career arc. He used to make quite noisy kind of electro related stuff Then after taking a break for a couple of years he reemerged almost as a new artist He actually lives just up the road from our London office. So we chatted like good neighbors a month or so ago as always you can Find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The RA Exchange with Mum Dance is up next. So in the last few months, you have released a fabric mix, an album with Logos. You performed a collaborative live project with Shape, Noise & Logos called The Sprawl. You went to the Rebel Music Academy in Tokyo. you had a single out on excel with novelist and you started a label called different circles so uh mate what's what's been going on like i mean i i think at the moment more than anything i'm just inspired by music i think things come in waves you can fall in and out of love with music and at the moment i'm i'm in love with music and i'm very excited about just music in general listening to it exploring it and I think that's just reflected in my output yeah I mean do you feel as though you're in a is this like a purple patch you've felt before or is this like the most excited you've kind of ever been I think that it's hard to overanalyze these things and I think if you start to overanalyze them and sort of think about it too much then you it's the beginning of the end, you know, like, cause you see, it's very easy to sort of psych yourself out. I'm just taking it as it comes, you know, and just enjoying myself. And I think that's the, that's the key to it. If you're enjoying yourself, then that's going to be reflected in the product that you're putting out. Yeah. So. tell us a bit about how that's kind of manifested itself have you just been generally like enjoying your time in the studio with stuff been coming really easily I guess it goes through waves because I think when I'm making music it takes me a few sort of weeks to gear up to it you know like I can't just get in the studio and just make something I'll have to sort of sit and think about it for a few days, you know what I mean? Put it off for a few days, watch Jeremy Kyle for a bit. and then might fire up the sampler after like a week or something. But then it just, over time I sort of get into it and then every day we get more and more productive. And just, it just, so I tend to sort of do it in bursts. So, and then I'll go away and think about it for a bit and concentrate. Because the thing is with DJing as well, it's kind of like a... push and pull sort of thing. If you're focusing on making music, it's very hard to keep up to date with the music that's been putting out because you're so sort of in your zone. So I tend to do sort of binges of studio than binges of listening. music and sort of making sure I've got a ton of dubs you know I mean to play in the clubs and also making my own music to play in the clubs you know I mean because I think that's another thing with everything being on the internet straight away you need to hold back music I learned this off pinch actually because like I before I was actually I'd always just play music I wouldn't care if it went on YouTube the next day but Pinch has taught me sort of how valuable it is just to hold things back on Dub and just to have things for the club. because it's a very important environment for club music. That's why it's called club music, you know? So the idea being that you're kind of giving yourself exclusive music, and you're also building excitement and interest around those tracks. Yeah, I mean, it's weird because when I was young, I had my work in a record shop. I was big into drum and bass and stuff. tunes will build over months you know you go to these drum bass raves and you you recognize a tune then you pick up that tune's been being hammered loads and then you get to know the tune then you get to know the tune when it's coming in you could hear it in the mix and stuff and you get excited about it and now things move so much quicker you know and obviously with the internet and stuff like that there's more music out there flying around so you and there's a lot of different crews you know pushing their own sounds so it's a lot of different factors but I mean I'm going off on a tangent but basically Pinch sort of taught me that it's good to hold back dubs because it creates sort of excitement around it and that's reflected in the rave and that's just something I completely forgot about so hold tight pinch yeah yeah no I understand do you find that people have less patience these days like when they're waiting for releases you know we're in a sort of age of like now now now instant accessibility it's interesting I think There's a couple of tunes at the moment which I've just been playing in the clubs. One is actually a Pinch remix of the Rico version of Take Time, which Pinch made. And that's like strictly for the clubs, you know. People know it. You know, I've only played it like three times. People are coming and asking me for it. when I go to different cities, different countries even, they're like, oh, you're going to play that one by a pinch. I'm like, how do you know that? You know what I mean? It's not like, do you know what I mean? So I think there's, I guess good music always finds its way, but I think that what has maybe been lost a bit was that sort of sense of excitement. Like when I used to go clubbing, I used to enjoy queuing up because I wasn't It's all like a build-up, you know, and once you got in the club, you were just ready to sort of go wild, you know, and I think with all this sort of instant access to stuff, I think maybe it kills a bit of the sort of excitement that would... come with things before you know yeah and i understand so um your most recent project i don't know what order they all came in but your fabric mix came out this week yeah it's how many what did you first think when you were asked to do the fabric mix what was like the first thought that went through your head well i mean i actually went and asked them because i was like i've wanted to do a fabric mix for a very long time like I bought those CDs since I was about 15. I bought the second one, I can't remember. I think it was the second or the DJ Hype one anyway. I've been consistently buying them all the way through as I was growing up. You know, they're an important part of my life and it's something which I, well, it's been a lifetime ambition of mine to do a fabric CD. I've always wanted a little silver Timber my name on. That's like, that's one of the things that's that's like I can die a happy DJ now, you know what I mean? I've been playing at Fabric now for about six, seven years, so I was just like, as I was saying, I was feeling good about music, and I know they'd always kind of like said they're going to do it, you know, but I was just like, I feel like now is the right time to do this. We went and had a little chat about it. And then it just went on from there. So, yeah, I was very excited. So I guess you already had an idea of how you might approach it in your mind. Yeah, I mean, I wanted it to be classics and exclusives, basically. The trouble with these fabric mixes sometimes is just with the internet, again, moving things around. you tend to get money when you release CDs, you buy it and then all the music's already been released, you know. Some DJs have been lazy, you know. And I didn't want it to be like that. I wanted it to be music that isn't available anywhere else because that makes it something which makes it worthwhile having, you know. And I wanted mine to be... a mix that people would return to and I think that's why I sort of spaced it out and tried to make it a bit more of a journey than just banging out club tunes for an hour. It was an interesting and maybe unexpected end to the mix because you strung together a few like... Would you describe them as hardcore tracks? Yeah, yeah, hardcore. It's like sort of proto-jungle, early hardcore sort of... 93, 94. I call it Golden Era Hardcore, but that's just because it's my favourite time of hardcore. But I mean, hardcore's had a lot of different... It's got a long heritage, hardcore, you know? So with the mix, I wanted the mix to sort of reflect my past and present and sort of... peer into the future what was interesting me and sort of the sort of routes I was taking like I'm looking to take in the future so hardcore was the first type of music that really caught my ear literally when I was about 12 or 13 years old, like standard thing, going around your mate's older brother's house. He had a hardcore tape playing. I was just like, what is this? You know what I mean? I'd never heard anything like it in my life. Before that, I think I had a copied tape which had Doggy Style by Snoop on one side and Warren GG Funk on the other side. And I was hammering that tape. And I just heard this whole thing. I was just like, what is this music? And he lent me a tape pack, actually. And then after that, I was just obsessed by it, basically. And then I had a paper round. Did my paper round and bought some really dodgy, like, CanBeat DX180 belt drive decks, Intimidation Apex mixer. Took me ages to save up for it. And then all my money was... going on records, you know, like it took, I think I got paid like 20 quid or something, maybe even 13 pounds a week for doing my paper round. And I used to, it just used to be enough for me to get a bus into Brighton and buy two records. So that was how I used to, me and my mate used to go into Brighton every week and just... Everyone hated us at the record shops because we were like these little kids, you know. We used to go in there and nick all the flyers and stuff. So my walls are like plastered with flyers. I actually don't really like record shops because of my experiences when I was younger because it was so stressful going into a record shop, like buying hardcore. these guys like looking down at you you know i mean and just being like and like we've been there for ages like listening to all the records because the money was very precious to us you know and it kind of like it was so stressful because you know they can be quite precious at record some people you know like they yeah they used to be so rude to us back in the day you know so they're sort of looking at you like oh these kids they're just going to spend three hours and then they're going to buy two records or something But, I mean, it was good fun. I mean, it taught me a lot about music. So, yeah, it's good to set me on my path, I guess. Were they looking down on you for your selections or because of your age? I think it was probably both, to be honest. I don't think I was buying the most discerning music back then. But, I mean... a couple of the things I bought, I put on that fabric mix that I bought when I was that young, you know? Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like the one I ended with, which was Ramos and Supreme, The Journey. That was like one of the first vinyls I ever bought. Oh, really? Did you play it off that record as well? I didn't. I, cause I was away for them in, um, for the majority of the time when I was putting together this fabric mix. So I couldn't go back. That's what I actually wanted to do. But to be honest, my copy of it is really scratched, but I got it off Ramos. I wanted to finish with another one, but it's hard because a lot of the hardcore ones I wanted to get, I wanted to get this one called Only Love by DJ Morph, which was always a favourite. But it's got a sample. We got in touch with the producer ago you know what I mean like it's got if I put it on a thing now I don't make working music anymore if I put it on a compilation now it's got this dodgy sampling and I get pulled up for it it's just not worth his time you know so there was a lot of music I couldn't put on the CD that I wanted to but um I'm still very happy with the selection you know Yeah, no, I understand. As an artist, do you think it's like important to you to pull something from the past into what you're doing in the present? Is this something that like, you know, weighs on your mind? I mean, I think I'm quite a sort of nostalgic person anyway. I like listening to old music. I like remembering old times. I think that's just something that just is reflected. in what I do and I think also there's kind of a sense of trying to build a bit of a narrative and I think that comes into play as well I mean it's fun to remember you know what I mean yeah sure sure it's fun to remember and it's like I always get that feeling when the seasons change you know and you suddenly like you might smell some like the weather's different you know and it reminds you of like last year and stuff and it's that same sort of nice feeling that you get when you hear these music and just I don't know it's one it's one I mean there's a lot of different reasons why I enjoy music nostalgia is one of them I enjoy music as well because I like being on the dance floor and having your face blown off by some weird arrangement and just being like this isn't even music you know I mean there's lots of different ways to enjoy music and I think nostalgia and sort of that is one of them I mean there's there's ways of doing nostalgia You can do bad, there's bad ways of doing the soldier as well, you know. So the Fabric Mix actually followed another commercial mix CD that you'd done the year before with Pinch. Why did you guys decide that it was like the mix CD was the best format to get your music out there, like rather than an album? Like how did that kind of like come together or what was the thought process? Well, I think Pinch likes CDs. He likes to listen to CDs in his car. I like to listen to mixed CDs in my car, you know, and I think it's simple as that. And I think it's also, it's just, I don't know. I still, I like, I still like CDs, you know, and I think it's cool. I think there's a sense because mixes are just chucked out all the time, you know, and I think that's good. I think it's good that you have mixes that are chucked out all the time. It keeps you up to But also, I think if you're paying for a mix, I think you want to know that there's been a lot of thought and a specific sort of, there's been a lot of time put into it, you know. If you're going to buy something, then you want to know that it's a quality product, you know. And I think just doing a mix. I mean, Pinch and I did do a free mix, which went out on the internet, but I think doing it in a mixed CD format, I mean, all the tracks on that mix are original tunes that were unreleased, you know, so I think it's a different way of doing things. Was there a thought that maybe you would release the music as an album, or did it feel like the mixed CD was perhaps the better format? I mean, Pinch is just the same as me, excited about music. And I think he just wanted to sort of, I don't think there was really even that much thought put behind it. We were just like, we want to do. That's the best way music's presented. It's dance music, you know, so I think there's a lot to be said for mixes, you know, because Logos and I have just put out the album Proto, and it's a collection of dance music tracks, but you don't always want to be listening to, like, a minute intro of just hi-hats, you know? You want to listen to it in the form that you would hear it. in a club how it's supposed to be heard so it just made sense to do it like that and also it wasn't just our music a lot of it was but it was it was kind of like a collection of music that was exciting us and also sort of like it felt like something new was happening I think we just wanted to express that as well. Yeah, no, I see. I wanted to ask actually, because it felt like even without reading into the album, it did have this air of you guys kind of like making a statement, if you like. There was a definite sense of like, this is how we see it or see things at the moment. Like, how would you personally define that? Or how would you sort of like convey that message? I mean, it's hard. I'm finding more and more that it really my job to make calls on these things I think it's up to the everything music means different things to different people and I think that all we're doing is from my perspective is there's this whole batch of producers who are like-minded there's this exciting sort of sound at the moment which we're both into and we wanted to to do a mix just to sort of document it, I guess. Yeah, I see. And I think there was no sort of deep... thing apart from we were just like into the music we're like yes let's do a mix let's do it yeah yeah i mean i guess it's this idea that all you're doing is i mean you're bringing it together and then whatever follows in the wake of that is kind of left to not to chance but you know what i mean it's like if if something happens as a result of this yeah kind of take it that's it but i think i mean it's taj because i'm i've i've found um Like for example with Proto I had a few reviews and they didn't say anything bad about the music but they sort of tore apart the press release. You know what I mean? And I was just like I didn't even know. It came across as a negative review even though they didn't say anything bad about the music. And I'm just like you can't cuss me for my press release. You know what I mean? I didn't even write the press release. So it's difficult, but I mean, I can only try my best, I guess. Yeah, no, of course. I ask because it's like, you know, to talk about your work with Logos as well, you've used this term weightless to sort of like describe what you guys do, or I guess what we're talking about more broadly here. Is that term kind of like vague enough where it can sort of encapsulate what you're doing without having to get into the sort of like nitty gritty? Yeah, because I mean, the reason we called it weightless is just it's not down to a specific sort of style. Like a lot of people have misinterpreted it and calling it weightless grime. It's not weightless grime. It's just weightless. Like it's a feeling. It could be ambient, new age. It could be like there's a track on Proto called Cold, which is the final track, and it's a very aggressive tune. It's weightless. It's got no drums in it and it kind of has that feeling of stasis, of weightlessness. And I think that's what we were sort of trying to convey. The weightless thing came from... just because on my rinse charge I was just playing all these sort of a lot of them were GRM sort of music concrete music concrete I don't I never say that right you know what I mean yeah the GRM stuff because I'm really into that stuff you know it like I really like the sort of idea the ideas that they're pushing how they're trying to sort of mask like what the sound was, you know, so you didn't know what the sound was and I think it's just quite interesting because it kind of runs parallels to when you're like, as I mentioned before, when you're on a dance floor and then you just hear this stuff and you're just like, I don't know what this is. So I was listening to a lot of that and then I just thought I'd just play it because I was also playing a lot of different styles on my Rinse show. And it made for a nice segue between styles and kind of, I used to call them palette cleansers. Yeah, yeah, sure. And then I just ended up playing more and more of it just because I was listening to more and more of it. That's a simple reason. people are just like what is this i was just like weightless because it makes it that's what it sounds like and then um i mean james has wanted to logos has wanted to do a sort of ep of sort of ambient devil mixes for a long time you know um sort of the ambient sort of more sort of sound design versions coming from that sort of side of things and so we just thought it apt to start with something like that you know and so we'd already had a few tracks that we were just playing in the clubs anyway that we had in mind and then a couple more we we sort of briefed the producers and said oh we'd like you to be a part of this can you make something in this kind of vein you know So, yeah, I was really happy with the way the weightless thing turned out. Yeah, I mean, I guess in a way you're highlighting qualities in the music that are already present, but you're just re-emphasising it. It's almost like inverting the whole idea of club music or dancehall music. Yeah, it's more like... The thing is that the weightless stuff is all made with club sensibilities. So... A lot of them are arranged like grime instrumentals or like drum and bass tunes in the sense that they have breakdowns and build-ups and drops. But they just don't have drums. They've got loads of sub-bass, they've got loads of sub-pressure, but they just don't tear your face off with drums. They still tear your face off, some of them, but it's just a different way of doing it. And also it's just, it's the idea of peaks and troughs, As I say, I've said this before in interviews, but I mean, I'm from a time when DJ sets were always described as journeys. You know what I mean? Cheesy as that sounds, but that's just always what I've read, listened to. You know, people trying to sort of create a narrative with their DJ sets. ever since rave music, when they were knocking, when the hour sets came in and they were just people doing hour sets and they just had to bang out a load of anthems for an hour, then go to their next show. I'm not really from techno, so I couldn't really, obviously the techno and house and stuff, it still exists. But from my side of things, you know, like the way I grew up. it was always sort of one hour sets, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, out. Sure. So for me, it was quite nice to sort of try and bring that back and you need songs to do that, you know, you need the low points to build the high points. Yeah. So just as people release drum tracks. like the people who release all these club tool stuff at the moment you know i mean and they're good that they've got their their place but the weightless think bits have got their place as well to sort of take things down because that's that's what it was as well like i was using like new age tunes as breakdowns went on rinse because everything was so intense it needed a bit of time to sort of take a breather and through doing that the high points are higher. Do you know what I mean? It's a pretty simple, you know, when you break it down like that, it's pretty simple. But I don't think people really think too much about dynamics or enough people don't think about dynamics in that way. You were talking about the sort of club journey. Has this approach like thrown people off? Have you had sort of like hairy moments? or you know I mean some DJs you see some DJs and they'll go and they've got a set for a festival they've got a set for this they've got a set for that And that's fine, you know what I mean? But I've just tried to consistently play. The thing is, from the start of my career, I've always played, I've been booked for a lot of different parties. Like, I get booked for Grime Nights. I used to get booked for, like, Bugged Out as well, you know? Like, I mean, on one New Year's Eve, I did, like, a Grime Night in Manchester, then I came down and did Bugged Out with And that was about six years, seven years ago. No, it's probably six years. Anyway, so traditionally, I've always felt quite out of my depth with a crowd, you know, because I'm just like, shit, this is a so-and-so night. I haven't got the selection for that. So I think more and more, it's just sort of realizing that you just have to be yourself and you just have to sort of do your thing, which can be hard sometimes. You might lose people, but eventually that's the way you sort of convey your message, I guess. And I think now I'm very lucky in the sense that over the past year and stuff, I can play pretty weird stuff like to massive rooms. You know what I mean? And that's, that's a blessing to me. You know what I mean? I can just bang out like. like a drone thing, like shape noise, you know what I mean? Play shape noise to a massive room and people will stand, stand sort of looking at gas, but they won't go, you know? So yeah. Yeah. I guess it gets easier over the years. Once your message has been put out there and people get warmed up to the idea of what you're actually doing, that they'd come into the gig with maybe slightly different expectations than they had a couple of years ago. That's it. Definitely. I mean, people are starting to come and see me with an open mind and that's exactly what I want people to come open-minded but also it's hard in the sense that sometimes like I'm not sort of like you get these sort of champions of scenes and people sort of really take them under their wing and they have a loyal fan base as I'm sort of like the mother-in-law or like of scenes you know I mean like people don't really know what to do with me you know I mean like I sort of I'm more in the cracks. And I mean, I think there's as many people that like me as don't like me. And I think sometimes that's quite stressful, but equally it's good to do something. I just, I don't know, really. You can't second guess these things. I'll just try and do myself and just, that's it. Yeah, no, I understand. So I guess we mentioned Logos James a few times, kind of one of your closest collaborators. Like what's the common ground between you guys? You seem to share like very sort of like similar creative artistic kind of ideas. So I met Logos, I think I was just listening to Dusk and Blackdown show and he played a song by Logos called... cloud bursting okay which I heard it and I was just like this sounds like a tune I would have made and I was just like that's crazy and literally the next day because I don't know I'm a firm believer if something feels right you just got to do it straight away because otherwise it'll get forgotten about like how many times people just like oh yeah we'll do this like next time I see you do it and never happens so I've tried to sort of base my activities around being quite impulsive. You know what I mean? And like, if something feels right, so I was just like, right, got in touch with him the next day and I was just like, oh yeah. And then in a week. He come down to my house, because I was in Brighton at the time, and he come down from London, and we did a session. I think in the first day we wrote in reverse and move your body in one session. And it was just like... that was a good session, you know, like, yeah. So, um, and we just share a lot of common ground in our music tastes and our sort of skillset compliments each other quite well. when making music, you know, and we get on well, you know what I mean? More than anything, that's like the most important thing when you're doing a collaboration is you have to like the person that you're making music with otherwise it's not going to work. Like you'll find, I mean, I do a lot of collaborations and the battle when you're doing a collaboration is building a rapport with the person that you're working with. If you understand each other, then you can make... music a lot easier if you're sort of battling against each other and there's egos or something like that you're not going to get anything good because you're going to have to compromise whereas i find when i make music with james logos and when i make his music with pinch we don't compromise, you know, we, we meet, we don't go like, you can have that snare. If I can have that kick drum, we go, I go, I don't like that snare. And he goes, well, I like it. I don't like it. Okay, well, let's find one we both like, you know what I mean? Sure. Yeah. Then the music is a sum of our parts rather than sort of like a trade off. Yeah, so I think that's a very healthy way of making music. And in the spirit of what you were saying with, like, you know, striking while the iron's hot kind of thing, is this how it came together with Novelist as well? Yeah, exactly that as well. Yeah, with Novelist, where did I see it? I saw it on Just Jam. Because basically I live just up the road from where they do Just Jam. So what I generally do is I sort of turn the laptop on. just have a look at it, who was playing and stuff like that and then just go down the road and have a couple of beers down at Just Jam, hold tight to Tim O'Barry, you know what I mean? They're lovely guys. It's nice to hang out with them. And Novel Ears wasn't on the line-up then but I was in the Tim O'Barry studios and then he just jumped on. I was just struck with the way he sort of commanded the room straight away and I was struck by his delivery. I think that he's very good at keeping on point, on beat, you know what I mean? And he's got... it's got that sort of old school flavour, you know what I mean? Which is what I really was into. So a couple of days later, I saw him again at Slack set at NTS Radio, because obviously they're near each other. I was just, I went to see Slack play, just having a couple of beers outside and I saw Novelist there and I was just like, oh yeah, we should get in the studio. And then we got in the studio like a few days later and then we wrote Take Time took about three hours to put together, really. Obviously we had to mix it, but the tune was done in three hours. And that was the first song we met, and the second song we ever wrote together was One Sec. so it's pretty do you know what I mean so it's pretty like healthy studio time like yeah I know I see and then you wound up getting signed to Excel as well I know that was I mean this year I've literally I can die a happy DJ now I don't have like having an Excel X record with my name on in the old classic sort of house bag you know what I mean and having a silver tin with my name on I'm done you know what I mean I'm happy now like the two things because my earliest memories of saying that my earliest memories of electronic music are probably me and my friend Matt we used to listen to Experience Prodigy Experience on our walkmans on sharing a headphone each walking around the playground at primary school in year six you know what i mean and so that excel logo has been sort of deeply ingrained in my sort of like psyche like all the way through you know a lot of the hardcore like sweet harmony and stuff like that you know i mean it's throughout my sort of musical upbringing that that excel sort of um logo has been very prevalent yeah and i understand and do you think you'll release more music with them or is there a plan in place i mean at the moment i'm just the thing is it's hard at the moment because i feel i've put out so much music lately and i actually don't have any more music that hasn't come out apart from the stuff that's sort of like geared towards the clubs which are more tools than anything so i need to make more music before i decide anything you know like i haven't got any music in the in the vaults At the moment, what I've been doing, I've just been hoarding new gear, basically. I haven't really been focusing on making music. I've more been buying stuff. Because some people like buying records. That's their thing, and my thing is buying old hardware and stuff like that. And that's my obsession, I think. So lately, I've just been really focusing on... this sort of gear, which is going to lead my next wave, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. I was going to describe it like that. Did you wind up collaborating with anybody at the, um, Red Bull Music Academy? How did that go down? Yeah, we did. I did a lot of collaboration. the music and me is really hard for me because just before I went to the music and me I had to mix down the whole of proto and the XLEP in nine days and it was stressful very very stressful because I was like in I was doing like 12 hour days maybe longer than that you know and And when you're doing mix downs, it's something which when you've got like the deadline was of going to Asia for two months, I wouldn't be able to like do anything was I had to get it done. So it's quite hard to sometimes do all creative jobs are hard to do to a deadline, you know. So I just got that out of the way and then I was just like, oh no, I've got to go to Japan and make more music. You know what I mean? But when I got there, it was just a pleasure to do. I think it was, more than anything, what I took from the Rebel Music Academy was seeing it's such a sort of... like, what's the word? Just one-off situation. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, it would never happen in any other sort of walk of life where all these people from around the world... in that sort of number will come together and literally they're from all over the world you know yeah I mean we did a piece actually it was sort of like highlighting some of the you know the different Farfung places that the participants were from it's quite staggering I know it's crazy and so I think more than anything it was just nice to sort of be in the studio with people from different walks of life, different upbringings, different social backgrounds, different musical backgrounds, and just sort of talk about music and see their approaches, see what their influences were, you know, and just sort of like be around different people. Because that's why sort of throughout my career, I've always tried to travel and sort of experience music firsthand, because I find... you can't really have an opinion on something unless you've experienced it firsthand, you know, otherwise you're just going on hearsay, you know, like, so whenever I've sort of been excited by something, I've tried my best to go and get out there and sort of immerse myself in it, you know, so also with collaborations, you know, as I say, you always take something good from a collaboration, you know, whether it's just a different way of looking at it. or it's a different way of using something, just different approaches, you know, and it's just inspiring, you know, it was very inspiring to be on that, on the Red Bull Music Academy, just because there were so many sort of... characters and sort of sort of individuals there that were just doing things in a completely different way that I would do something so it was a very positive experience do you have any highlights from the lectures uh the lectures who's I really like the Ben UFO one actually that sort of struck a chord with me who else is good Robert Hood one was good yeah yeah um yeah there's I mean there's a there's a uh Ryoji Ikeda is my favorite one actually But that didn't get filmed or anything. He did it, but that was very inspiring just to see his thought processes behind what he does was very inspiring. Yeah, it was good. It was quite funny. He's getting a bit stroppy towards the end. It was quite funny. It's just quite funny seeing that. Yeah, no, I really enjoyed that. And they're all good. I mean, it was hard because, I mean, like, the sort of... The Japanese sort of jet lag is a very special kind of jet lag. You know what I mean? Like when you go to, when you go to like Australia or something, cause it's almost like 12 hours difference. It's kind of like just doing an all nighter or something, but this is kind of like, I don't know what it is, like eight hours or something. It's just like an awkward thing where you just like, I don't know. I was just, I was, my head was like nodding for like the first few days, you know what I mean? And like falling asleep in the studios, like all over the place, you know, it took me a long time to sort of... get myself in order you know yeah no no i see i wanted to pick up on what you were saying about kind of immersing yourself in you know different scenes and um countries and experiences because you have traveled quite a lot haven't you there was like different projects that you participated in um i'd read about a trip to cairo you've taken you've been to sao paulo and mexico can you give us a flavor of like you know some of these trips and kind of what you've like taken away from them yeah definitely i mean When I went to Brazil, that was a really good experience. I went out there to work with Bondeirol and I did a track for their album. And I also worked with this band called Bandeirol, who are this type of music called Technobrega, which... I think it directly translates as cheesy techno. And it's a very, very interesting scene, which I haven't come across before, you know. And it was nice to sort of like seeing the two sides of the very sort of testosterone driven funk karaoke and then seeing Technobrego, which is all about heartbreak and love songs. You know what I mean? There's kind of like polar opposites. And it was a really special experience, actually, because I went to work with Band of War and they took me to this tropical island called Ilia Bella, which translates as beautiful island. And we're sitting on this island, set up a studio by the beach. The sun was setting, you know what I mean? Just on this tropical island. They made like... one of those melon cocktails, you know, it's actually inside a melon, you know what I mean? And I was just like, I can't believe I'm here. your music you know it's crazy so that was a very special experience and then there was Cairo's that was that more recently yeah Cairo's last year that was in collaboration with the British Council who I think are an amazing organization everything I've ever taken part of with the British Council has been spot on and I think they're a very very important organization So this one was Rince and the British Council and we went out to Cairo and we were working with... These artists who work within a sort of area of music called Maharagana, which translates as festival, or electro-shabby, which is kind of a slightly different strain, which is more about using sort of shabby music samples and recontextualising them into sort of like, I guess, like a sort of dance, more dancey sort of... appropriate in a more dancey sort of way. That was an amazing experience as well because I mean there's a lot of parallels. with Maharagana and grime. And also, I guess you could draw the parallels with like Kuduru as well. It's street music. It's very, very passionate music. It's quite aggressive music. And there's a lot of spirit in it, you know? And it was very, very, like it opened my mind to a lot of interesting things that I never thought about. Also, just like, for example, these guys who are working with like Sadat, Kanaka, Alafifty, Diesel and stuff like that, they work. they work on feeling so they'll do a rap when it's finished they'll just stop and I'm like that should go in 16 bars like worried about 32 16 bars and stuff like that and like I'm just like what and then I was halfway through I was just like why am I worried about it being in 16s and stuff and it's just like that's like a constraint that's a constraint that works in clubland but I'm not in clubland now you know and I was just like they're doing it wrong and I was like yeah so it's quite nice just to work with them and also because there's a big language barrier none of them spoke English so we're kind of working through translators which is a very surreal experience and also all the translators were kind of volunteers and weren't sort of taught schooled in sort of specific quite technical music language so to sort of like translate when we're talking about reverb or compression or do you know I mean weird things that are sort of production orientated they were looking blankly at me like and then they were just trying to say to them then the other people look but i mean it added this sort of like cajun sort of randomness into it you know what i mean and it's kind of like playing Chinese whispers or something. But I like that fact and I think we got a result from it that wouldn't have happened had it been any other way. So I was very happy with the outcome. And I think it's something that I want to continue working with them. I'm doing a Maharagnath set in a couple of weeks actually. in Holland. But yeah, I mean, there's a lot of, I feel like we built some good relationships and it was more than anything, again, they're really nice guys and they're fiercely talented guys and I want to continue working with them and I think it's not just like a trip that was sort of started and then it's finished and it all fizzles out but for me like it's difficult because the language barrier is so immense you know that I mean they tried to speak on Facebook. There's only so far that Google Translate will take you, you know, and it's very difficult because, you know, like when you just, yeah, it's just very difficult. So we need, there's always going to have to be a third party sort of involved. But I actually spoke to someone from the British Council today and they said they'd help sort of mediate it. So hopefully, which is very kind of them, so hopefully we'll be able to get some stuff done in the coming months. So before this kind of like flurry of activity that you've had over the last couple of years, you'd actually taken quite a big break from music. How long was it exactly? How long did it end up being? It's probably about two years. I mean, it was one of the times where I think it was weird because when I came through with music, I was lucky, basically. Long and short of it, I was lucky. Diplo shone a light on me and it was just a time when Diplo was very hot and through that I got a light shone on me and I was putting it at the deep end I feel I'd only done one I mean I've always made music but I was always more like, I was a promoter more than anything. Traditionally, when I grew up, I started putting on nights when I was 17. And then I got work as an events manager. I was always putting on raves. That's what I did. And I was, as I say, made music in my bedroom. And what I did was I did a remix. I did a bootleg of a remix that Diplo did of the Black Lips. And I Myspaced it to him. I got Jammer on it. Jammer did a little 16 bar on it. And because it was actually this photographer called Jamie James Medina. He put us together. He used to document a lot of the... early grime scene and we're friends and he was just like you should do this with he had heard my music and he's just like you and Jammer work really well together so me and Jammer did that in the studio and then I literally took like 45 minutes or something like that and then to get the recording of Jammer and then I arranged it and that and then MySpace did it to Diplo and then two days later he got back to me he put it on his blog Annie Mack was playing it Sindum was playing it on Kiss like and then he asked me to remix Santa Gold like a week later and then Gucci Man you know what I mean and it's just like and then I ended up doing like 15 remixes that year you know like and I wasn't ready for it I wasn't good enough at production I was learning on my feet like my where you'd usually where someone would learn production and it'd just be their sort of scrawlings on their on logic in their bedroom that no one would hear mine were going out publicly you know what i mean so it's quite a stressful situation for me you know it's like a i guess a baptism of fire but i'm quite glad that it happened but essentially it just burnt me out and I with remixes I was using I did I said 15 remixes just like an album's other stuff and I used up a lot of my ideas that I might have been better using on original music and also it was hard as well I think house music was coming in in the UK the whole sort of 4-4 sound and there's always a change in the guards and I think when I sort of came through was on the sort of down peaks and troughs isn't it so as sort of like the sound the mad decent sound sort of maybe taking a dip and sort of maybe well getting more Americanised it was an American label but you know I mean he was focusing more on his American activities House music started coming in and it was sort of like, I didn't really identify with it. You know, I mean, I like house. I've got nothing against it, but it doesn't really stir my soul. And I'm certainly not going to sort of change my name and then start making house, you know, like, because people aren't stupid, you know, like, and it's not. Yeah, it was a combination. things like one i didn't have any ideas i didn't really know where to go and two i wasn't in fashion anymore and no one wanted to book me do you know what i mean so it's a it's a difficult thing and it's just actually it's a natural sort of like undulation yeah yeah it's like yeah it's peaks and troughs that's all i can say it's like the career path you're very lucky If you can get a career path in music that steadily rises, because if you imagine like a line graph with the amount of effort you put in on one side and the amount of time on the other side, if you put in loads of effort, you think you just go directly upwards. But then there's this like random factor of cool, which comes in and just fucks everything up royally. You know what I mean? So you can work your ass off. And then, like, as soon as fashion and cool thing comes in, you're just, you're just screwed. Because, like, if no one cares about it or if you're not cool, that's it. And it's a sad thing. So, but, so, yeah, so basically just went home, back to my parents. Whatever DJ gigs I did still get, I spent on. spent the money on hardware, studio gear, old studio gear. I'd started working for my dad for a bit, you know, like that's what I had to do because I had no money because I wasn't really ready for a career in music and it wasn't really something that I sort of like. I didn't really see myself going down that path. So I don't think I was ready for it. So yeah, I just get a job again. And I'm not afraid to say that because you just have to do what you have to do. You know what I mean? And it was kind of like the opposite because I was used to like working, like staying up all night. And then the job, when I was working for my dad, I had to get up at five in the morning, travel up to London, go yeah it's quite it's not good for morale you know i mean so there was sort of that side to deal with and as it was yeah it wasn't the it was kind of a dark time in my life i guess just because it's more like i'm glad it happened though because i know that i won't let it happen again i know where i'm going now and i've seen the cycles there you go cyclical it's all cyclical I've seen the cycles and also like I don't know I feel like when I came through originally I was lucky and I think I didn't like you see when a DJ comes through he has to play loads of really bad gigs at bars you know I mean whereas I came through I got a little good gig straight away but then as I was on my downward sort of cycle, I had to play all those bad gigs then, you know what I mean? And then all the gigs dried up. So that was kind of like, my career path has been a very strange career path. So I think I did all my sort of groundwork and sort of stuff like, I did two years of popping off, then two, three years of like going back to the drawing board and starting from scratch essentially. I'm really glad it happened because I feel like I feel a lot more confident with what I'm doing now. And I feel like it's me, you know, and I feel like even though I don't really like mum dance as a name, in fact, I kind of hate it. I'm kind of glad that I stuck with it because I feel like people respect me more for sticking to my guns rather than trying to hide my past. I'm not ashamed of my past. I think some of the music I made hasn't aged particularly well, if you could put it, but it's who I am and it's the course and path that I've taken. And I think that people do, also it's just growing up and maturing, you know? So I think... that's what it is I feel like I'm sort of come of age I guess this is this is my second wave yeah it's a coming of age tale yeah um but do you remember when things did start to fall into place for you you know because we're talking about like a back to the drawing board and a kind of process of rejuvenation if you like what was that feeling like you know when did when did things start to click well I didn't really see it like that it was more like I was just making a load of I think that the key to it is just sorting it out in your head. And the key is if you're trying to follow and sort of fit into a pre-existing set of ideas, then you're always going to follow. And I feel like if you're making music for yourself and you're not really worried about what you're doing and you're not trying to... fit into anything then it's kind of like liberating and you can sort of you're sort of setting yourself free you're just making music you enjoy it's kind of just not trying to second guess anything essentially just doing what I enjoy doing making the sounds I enjoy making and I think I literally did that for like three years two three years I can't remember exactly about two years and At the end of it, I was like, oh, I've got about like 12 tunes that are all right now, you know, like, and then just, I put them together into, and that became Twists and Turns, which is kind of like sort of my sort of, because with Mad Decent, I saw my SoundCloud, there's different circles, the mixtape, which was kind of my first album, it was 17 tunes in 30 minutes on a mix. and that I see that as kind of my first album this is kind of my second album but it's still not an album you know it's a mixtape I still got my first solo album still to come I think it's very easy to rush into these things and I feel like now I feel like I'm in the zone and now I'm ready to make my album you know I mean this is kind of like the next project yeah I think so, yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, I think what I was doing more than anything is trying to focus on Tombra is a big thing. You know, like you can have ideas, but... it's kind of like the feeling of the sounds, which is very sort of intriguing to me, which is why I decided to go to use old hardware, because that's just the sound that sounded right to my ears. You know, they've got a certain feeling to them, which is the music I grew up with, you know, and I think. So that's why I wanted to sort of replicate that so it sounded right to my ears, just simply that. And I think also when I was doing all the stuff in Mad Decent, it was very much focused on exotic sounds from around the world and sort of drawing influence from what was going on on the other side of the world. Whereas with Twists and Turns, what I decided to do was... rather than looking the other side of the world, turn on itself and just look to the things closest to me, which is the music of my upbringing, which is like rave, sort of like hardcore, you know, jungle and sort of shoegaze. But just to sort of, you know, bring things into the here and now, I'd read what I think is a recent interview with you where you talked about this idea that we're in a place at the moment where people are feeling more creatively free. You know, audiences are more accepting and producers are able to like push boundaries a little bit more. Do you have like a theory on why that might be? Like, why is now the time for this? And you kind of likened it to a sort of like 93, 94. sort of hardcore into jungle periods. But what is it about now that's like letting people feel this way? Well, I think that there's just no overruling sound. I think, like I said before, say when things were jungle, it was all about experimentation. These producers are literally pushing the boundaries of sound. Like I think if you listen to the Doc Scott. RA Exchange, he talks about it a lot there, how he'd go down to the cutting house and he'd be cutting stuff and they'd just be like sharing, like how did you do that? You know what I mean? Like they were just pushing this technology to its absolute limits and I think that's what they were focused on with Jungle and when hardcore was sort of changing into Jungle they were just focused on taking things in new directions and then as a scene becomes more sort of known it it moves from entropy to redundancy and it becomes a sort of set of ideas which people are trying to fit into so there's there's like it becomes like drum and bass so for example with drum and bass it becomes about loudness you're trying to you're trying to make the loudest or the you're trying to do the best within this set of ideas that manifests itself through being the loudest or being the dirtiest or being like pushing it to an extreme. within an idea set or idiom. Whereas in these times between, you're not trying to fit into anything. You're just trying to push things outwards, you know, like sort of, to me, there's probably people that disagree with me, but to me, it feels like we're in that sort of stage now where people are just doing things they aren't trying to fit into like. They're not trying to fit into dubstep. You know what I mean? They're not trying to fit into anything. They're just trying to... I think as well what it is, is there's a lot of different pockets and crews and they're all sort of like working within their sort of crews and they're all influencing each other and these sort of different pockets of sounds are popping up all over the world. And I think that's kind of like... takes things off to different angles, you know, as well. So there's a lot of factors. Do you think it therefore makes it harder to form kind of like scenes and communities? You know, if people are all going off in their different directions, like you don't have this one unifying thing, does that make it harder to rally around something? I think there's a definite lack of unity within electronic music at the moment. And again, for a number of factors, mainly because a lot of people have got a lot of different ideas. It's reaching a lot more wider audience and a lot more sort of a diasporic audience around the world. Yeah, a lot of different pockets of people. It's not based around geography so much anymore. It's based around an internet connection. And also people are on a lot of different levels when they're in the clubs these days. You know what I mean? Whereas back in the day, people might have been on the same level. You know what I mean? If you know what I'm saying. So yeah, there's a lot of different factors which mean that there's not sort of like this. That's what I'm saying. I'm from the sort of one love sort of unity. I like the unity in this game. I grew up on hardcore. So to that there'd be squabbling within a scene. You know what I mean? And that's why, yeah, I think it's stupid. I think it's, I'm all about, I think it's, people are strong when they stick together and it's all about pushing things forwards and encouraging people rather than trying to be worried. Things would be a lot better if people were happy for each other and encouraged each other rather than trying to sort of. outdo each other but I think there's also a lot to be said for healthy competition within the scene because I think it's always good to be like ah how did he do that you know I mean I'm going to do one better than that you know like Yeah. I'm thinking like, you know, maybe we'll get to a place where scenes are linked not so much by the sounds, but like more by people's attitudes in a way. I think if you do see any communities at the moment, it seems to be, you know, although there might be quite disparate sounds being brought to it, there does seem that the commonality actually seems to be an attitude or something. I mean, do you think there might be any like, you know, could that point the way forward? I think it's more about this is what I'm when it comes back to the fabric mix I'm trying to sort of build something which has a feeling running throughout it and a narrative even though it's drawing from a lot of different places you know and I think maybe things will be formed I guess I don't know it's a hard one you know like I think there's definitely a lot to be said about sort of crews. I like that. I do, even though there's maybe not so much unity, it is exciting when you, you're going to see, when you know what you're going, you're going to see this, this sound, a DJ from a certain crew and you know that he's bringing, it might be like the footwork guys, you know what I mean? Bring, bring there something like that. Or I think a lot of people are very guarded. with their sounds, rightly so, in some respects. But I think, I don't know, I'm all for positivity, I think. You know what I mean? More than anything, that's it, yeah. Bye.
