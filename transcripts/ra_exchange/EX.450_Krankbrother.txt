Thank you. you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Aaron Coulthate and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. When Danny and Kieran Clancy began putting on Crankbrother parties, they did so with no long-term vision. It was simply about getting some friends down to Corsica Studios for a dance. Ten years on, they're among the key players in London's electronic music scene. Later this month, they'll launch Retextured, a four-day festival of techno and experimental music that embraces London's brutalist architecture, with a line-up that includes the likes of Nina Kravitz, Shackleton and Lucretia Dalt. It marks a new era for Crankbrother. one that began to crystallise when the duo sold their restaurant in East London to focus their energies on music. This coincided with a decision to book more experimental acts like Midori Takata, Tangerine Dream and William Basinski. to sit alongside their parties with big DJs like the Black Madonna and Helena Half. It's a move they say reflects their own changing tastes in music. When they stopped by our London office, Danny and Kieran were still a few weeks out from the first night of Retextured. Our chat touched not only on the intensity of putting together a festival, but also wider talking points that'll be of interest to anyone putting on parties for a hobby or for a living. Things like corporate investment, ever-rising DJ fees, and the delicate business of working with local councils. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net. and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The Exchange with Crankbrother is up next. So you're starting your own festival this year, launching it in about a month's time. It's called Retextured. How much work has gone into this thing already? It's been a lot of work and a long, long time in the making because it's something that Kira and I have wanted to do for many years and not really had the confidence in whether we thought London would be the right place. place to do it and uh i think there was a moment um last may where we had uh william basinski playing in union chapel uh to maybe like 700 people and it's an unlicensed church so there's no alcohol and and there was a moment where kieran and i were sat there and there's 700 people there watching him play a crazy ambient piece about the cosmos And it kind of just reassured us that the scene was there in London to do something more abstract and something more interesting and push the boundaries a little bit. just on account of William Zinsky having 700 people there, because, I mean, I love him, but I think he still is pretty niche in wider circles. So that was kind of the starting point for the festival. And then from there, it just kind of evolved pretty quickly once we kind of had the idea of... of where we want to go musically. Then it was adding in the light and the production element. Something we felt strongly across 10 years is that often the lighting and visual guys don't get much of a look in or the praise that they should do. They're some of the industry's unsung heroes. Whereas, you know, everyone likes the photo of the DJ with his hands up, whereas actually there's a lot of other people. in the industry that put a lot of art into the events. So we wanted to put some light on them and celebrate them. And then the last thing is also to celebrate some of London's architecture, like particularly the Brutalist buildings and the industrial buildings, and explore the relationship. between sound and light within those buildings. So we're using six different venues, and four of them are bruised-less buildings, two of them are very industrial, so they've got a very strong aesthetic, which lends itself to the type of music programming we've done, which is ambient, drone, techno, and everything in between. And I think it's just going to be really interesting to... to take the club experience to a slightly different place to what we've been doing for the previous 10 years. Initially, when we were thinking about the show, we'd have loved to have found sort of, you know, just like a massive 5,000 to 6,000 capacity industrial kind of brutalist building that we had a 6am licence on. but you know there just isn't such a place within London so you know we sort of then started talking about could we do this across several venues but all across one weekend and then the just ball started rolling in terms of the programming and it actually has allowed us to go far more interesting exciting in terms of of the way we program each event because you have very up-and-coming artists that are kind of headlining the shows. Whereas if we had this all on one festival stage, you just can't really give as much attention to the smaller up-and-coming artists. You kind of just by nature, the fact that you've only got a couple of stages, you kind of have to have just massive artists that sell loads of tickets. So you can sort of see the way we've curated the artist program. It's kind of, it's quite... We like to think it's fairly democratic, really. There's a lot of artists at a similar level on there and not many of the traditional kind of festival headliners that you're seeing a lot in London just sort of over and over again. various different events. You mentioned that you've got six venues that you're using in different council areas across London. What kind of logistical challenges does that present versus just having one big venue? I mean, a lot. I mean, you know, it means you need six production managers, six event managers. You need six of everything, whereas if it's in one space, you can consolidate it. And as you say, we're working with lots of different local authorities. But most of it is predominantly East. Everyone's been very supportive so far. They weren't the only six buildings we looked at. We did look at other buildings who weren't so supportive or the local authorities who didn't quite understand what we were trying to do. So, I mean, hopefully once we're out year one, we might be able to expand the venues that we're using. I mean, I'm not gonna lie, it's definitely made it harder for us not having it in one venue. But we also were quite adamant that we didn't want that to be a prohibitive reason for not doing a festival like this in London, you know. So, you know, I think we're going to get through it and learn a lot from kind of doing six different venues. And I'm glad we've got 10 years of experience or two. events before we would ever approach doing something like this. I think the issue with, I mean, there are big buildings out there, you know, like Printworks, Tobacco Docks, it's possible to license a massive capacity venue, but they're sort of tending to license them on pub hours now so that you know you just really can't get anything later than 10 30 11 o'clock um and that's the we've that's the problem we've encountered with with councils they don't want to give anything later than 11 o'clock and we we when we looked at the kind of benefit between the two we just thought we'd rather actually have proper club shows that go on till four o'clock six o'clock in the morning than just find a massive venue and have to close at 10 o'clock. It just didn't seem to fit the profile of the music we were trying to push to be there at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Some of it's pretty... hardcore industrial techno and drone and I don't know, it's not really Saturday afternoon stuff. No, I think you approach music a different way at a different time of day or night that you're listening to it and I think it's much nicer to listen to Surgeon at 5am than 5pm. It's hard to argue with that. In terms of, you've kind of touched on already perhaps some of the things that will separate Retextured from the other festivals currently happening in London. When you decided, right, we're going to do a festival, and you looked at the other events that are already kind of in the calendar, what kind of discussions did you have in terms of how you were going to, I guess, fill a gap in the market or create something that was unique? I think first and foremost was the program musically. A lot of... The programming in London and the UK and even in Europe is the same headliners rolled out on the same top of the bill on a million festivals. And we wanted to make sure that that wasn't this. So whilst we've got some big apps, we've got a lot of smaller apps. And, you know, we always bill alphabetically. We're not hanging our hat on. and one artist you know and and we tried to make the the builds really varied and interesting so and mix up the set times as well so you know you're getting different set times when you might not expect so like a really underexposed artist might get you know a thousand people watching them which they wouldn't usually get it was also you know being able to push a bit more a bit more live electronic music. Often when we look at festivals across Europe, there's just so little live electronic music compared to... When you see something like the big indie festivals, there's obviously tons, but it's so DJ-led, really, across most of the festivals. So it was just giving an opportunity for some of the live artists. Traditionally, you see live electronic music in London instead of the Barbican and the South Bank Centre, and you don't tend to get it outside there that much. Yeah, I mean, there's a good point what Kieran says there is that there's lots of artists that have been playing the Barbican in South Bank, which is seated. And it's nice to see Alvin Oto maybe standing once, you know, artists of that ilk and actually more in a more club environment. because a large part of his music is quite clubby. So that was another big consideration for us. Feels like, you know, last year you guys made quite a noticeable change, I guess, away from focusing purely on club shows to embracing more live electronic music. So what other kind of... economic challenges of you know putting on Tangerine Dream or Montori Takata somewhere like the Union Chapel versus you know throwing a party with five or six DJs at Corsica Studios. We've had to sort of find a point of difference as a promoter I think you know we've been we're sort of 10 years in now we're still a super small team there's only three of us in the office and then we work with a lot of kind of sort of self-employed people that we that we've used over the last 10 years but we're a super small team and when you're competing against like you know big corporate owned promoters now when in massive venues we've you know we really sort of looked at where we want the last the next five years to go the beginning of 2018 and said what's going to be our point of difference as a small independent promoter And in that conversation was like, let's only book stuff that we really, really believe in. Let's be completely true to our values. Let's not just book the sort of ticket smasher guaranteed artists and let's just try and be sort of what we believe is kind of totally. authentic and credible in our approach. Retextured was all about that kind of ethos, really. Yeah, I think we always, we wanted to be considered, you know, not just promoters, but also curators. It's why we've always called ourselves, you know, our event has always been Crankbrother Presents. We don't, you know, sit behind labels or... or things it's yeah it's very much what we believe in and what we're trying to introduce people to and celebrate that that music is out there and and bring it to in a live format to the to the city so yeah that was that was the kind of point of difference we wanted to make and as promoters whose bread and butter has been um in putting on club shows for for a decade or so How do you feel about the relationship between festivals, say in London, and club shows? Is there an uneasy relationship there? I mean, there doesn't have to be. I think if everyone is quite open book and talks to one another, I think we like to do that wherever possible. I mean, undoubtedly, it's made it harder for nightclubs with the amount of festivals and the amount of fees that are kind of going. I mean, I think equally, I think nothing more than property prices has made it difficult to own a nightclub. At this point, you know, you look at small venues closing, you know, festivals obviously create a challenge and the massive indoor venues you've got at the moment, Printworks, Tobacco Docks, you know, they make it super challenging to own a kind of 500. capacity club but it's the it's the it's the landlords that have created yeah the biggest problems you know five yearly rent reviews and it's just when you have venue you know in berlin that you have such cheap rent that it's quite a realistic business model to have a venue open two nights a week for six hours i mean you're talking about being open for maybe 20 hours a week out of all the hours in the week and that you can actually do that but in london it's just I mean, any light club really here doubles up as a corporate venue. During the week. They do photo shoots, they do everything. Depressingly, I think that's still the number one challenge really for a club. It's just the property price in London. Do you think that explains the dearth of mid-sized venues in London at the moment? It feels like maybe you either go big with like a Printworks or Tobacco Dock or it's, you know, small and very intimate and maybe less risk. Yeah, I think that's 100% what it is. And, you know, I think... Print works, you know, a big part of their business model is that during the week they can have loads of kind of big corporate shows that you wouldn't even be aware of. And they have, you know, live music shows during the week. But, you know, I think a big part of their model is to put in, you know, like a big car show. And they have all kinds of stuff in there which makes it work as a venue. But you just, when you're 500, 600 capacity, you can't You just don't really have that as an option, so you've got to make it work across Friday and Saturday night, and it's just... We've looted it. We've looted opening a nightclub, and people always ask us what, but it just... It doesn't, I look at it and every time we've considered it, it just, it looks very difficult. I mean, we owned a restaurant before for five years and that was another case in point of just, we were open 18 hours a day and the just rent was so expensive that, you know, you just got to fill almost every hour to make it viable. and then even after that, the blood, sweat and tears you put in it, the landlord still came to us and they double your rent. And their reaction if you say, well, I can't afford that as an independent business, is like, well, we'll find someone that will. And I think that's the real issue in London at the moment. But as kind of each area gentrifies and rolls on, the original independents and creators move out and then the more corporate moves in, it just seems to keep rolling at the moment. So, yeah, you mentioned property prices and gentrification as the number one. issue facing club owners and promoters in London. Where do DJ fees stand? I was actually rereading Angus Finlayson's piece that he wrote for us a couple of years ago called The Promoter's Dilemma. And one of the key themes in that piece was that DJ fees were pricing out a lot of promoters. Does that chime with your experience? I mean, sometimes I think we've always been pretty good at... just not paying the fee when we don't think it's fair. And it would be great if all the promoters sat on the same page and did that. I think, you know, when you've been in it for long enough, you know, when someone quotes a silly fee, I just don't think there's any long-termism in it. I mean, particularly, I always enjoy working with some of the older agents who've been around for a long time and they've seen how artists... peak and dip so they don't you know just try and like every year whack a couple of thousand on and and you know it's all good you because they see that there's longevity and anyone who wants to be in this career for a long time there's got to be fairness and relationships built and DJs or live artists they just don't keep going up they might have an album they might drop off for a couple of years and I think an intelligent agent will respect and understand that It's definitely got pretty silly at the kind of top top end the last kind of five years or so i mean i think that those kind of 200 acts that you see across the headline stages you know and all the major european festivals those djs are earning more and more every year and the fees are getting are increasing but i mean i think what's a bit of a shame is that like the sort of mid-tier or lower tier djs that might be trying to do kind of like gig every two weekends or in the summer a gig every week like their fees aren't particularly increasing and there's such a reliance from there's such a reliance on sort of booking these big acts to sort of shift through your tickets yeah it's almost people put the big act and they put all their budget on that and then they put a tiny bit of budget for the freshest newest thing coming through and then all the tears in the middle are kind of forgotten about, which can have really detrimental... There is quite a lot of unfairness in there in DJ fees, I'd definitely say. I mean, sometimes I look at our own P&Ls and I look what the headline is getting and what the opener is getting and it's not, yeah, it's not fair. Does it help to maybe build longer-term relationships with artists? Does that build like an element of trust? keep the fees reasonable yeah we definitely have we definitely have that with with several artists and and their management in particular that you know they they know that we're going to promote their shows for the next couple of years and there's there's a bit of a bit of a give and take and so you know yeah definitely some agents more than others take a really considered view but i mean there are some agents out there that don't take that view and they just want to be paid 20% more each year and they'll go to whichever promoter will sort of But just on a personal level, when you've been doing it for 10 years and you're promoting the shows and going to the same shows, you want to have the relationship with the DJ. You want to go out for dinner with them beforehand and have a nice chat and know a bit more about them and understand them because otherwise it can get quite tiring. And so for us, we really try and... build that relationship with artists and and book the same artists regularly and if we have bad experiences with booking agents or artists we usually feed back on that and don't book them again. I mean, one thing I have actually raised this with an agent in the past is that there's only one group of people that pay for increased EJ fees and it's the customers, you know? So if you just expect the fees to go up every year, all that happens is the ticket prices go up every year. And is it reasonable for someone that's like 22, living in London, where rents are increasing every year, wages are stagnant, there's a completely uncertain economic outlook, is it reasonable that ticket prices have to be 25%, 30% more than they were two years ago? That is ultimately who pays for it. Promoters and venues definitely take on more risk, but ultimately... it's customers that have to pay more. So I do try and relay that sometimes, that ultimately it's the fans that pay the price. Will the bubble burst? I mean, yeah, I hope so. I think certain acts will fall off. I mean, there's obviously big corporations buying up small operators, so that hasn't helped in London. big money into it and so the kind of small independent model that Keira and I run is becoming rarer and lots of the smaller independent promoters have found it hard to compete as well and have fallen away so I mean will the bubble burst? I mean I hope so and I definitely hope it's going to slow down but I don't see like a catastrophic burst happening I think there might be a slow down and then but but at the moment for me like the appetite for like festivals and and live is very strong in london the uk people want to that experience and they want and they want to go out there and and people seem to be i mean that's a positive thing for the same people want to They want to go to events and they probably don't go out in the same way that we did when we were younger, which was like every Friday and Saturday we'd be in the club. That was just what we did. They seem to want, yeah, we're noticing they seem to want the big show now. So they might not, you know, they might have four or five weeks where they don't go out and they kind of. they're more health conscious and they want to get better sleep and exercise. But then when they do go out, they want to go out big. So they want to see, you know, six, eight headliners. So as a result, that's slightly driving the fees as well. Because we, I mean, when we first, I mean, we've grown up in London our whole lives and have been like, seen many different stages of the London clubbing scene. But for us, we never knew who was playing most of the time. We were just going to a club because we liked the club, we liked the community. There'd be people there that you'd see every week, you'd hang out with. I know there's some small communities in London still that exist, but that across the capital doesn't happen as much as it used to. I mean, it's been well documented, all the different factors that are playing into it, like social media and things like that, of what people want as an experience. So I think those things all drive the fees as well. There's many different parts playing into it. We can't just scapegoat greedy agents. I want to pick up on your own sort of histories with... the London party scene soon. But before that, I wanted to sort of discuss a bit more what you were saying about corporate investment in promoters. And it's sort of an observable trend, I guess, also with festivals in Europe, with private investment firms buying significant stakes in festivals. Is this something that worries you as a small, lean, independent operation? I mean, maybe worries and excites me in the same capacity. Like I can see very negative things and very positive things out of it. I mean... think it excites me how vibrant the live scene is it you know excites me whether I don't necessarily agree with it that more people have to tour because they don't make as much money from their records anymore but you know so that there's a downside for the artist but the upside for you know for the supporters you get you know people tour a lot more than they used to So, you know, and I think, so the live scene for me is really healthy and fresh at the moment, which is great. Like, I mean, when I was growing up, there was like one festival to go to, you go to Glastonbury, you know, and now there's just like every year, there's just more and more and more and more. like interesting stuff that's popping up. So, you know, if you're a music fan, I think it's pretty exciting time to engage in, in, in the live scene. But I just hope that lots of people maintain, like maintain independence. So they don't get compromised in, in their programming and their production and their values because. The moment you kind of look at these big corporations and these big kind of deals where that festival act's playing across five. different you know festivals and it just doesn't help diversity of programming at all because they're doing these large deals for different artists and it's across yeah multiple cities and venues you know so it can become you know really difficult for sort of local independent promoters to actually have a chance of booking certain acts could you shine some light on how those kind of um those deals work well you might have you know one of the big festivals to sort of make an offer for a headline show in London but say you know as well as that we'll give you headline shows in every major UK city and then we'll put you on a few festivals in Europe as well that we own so you know are you really going to go and play for you know, Crankbrothers new festival when I'm essentially going to give you four festivals and six venues, none of which you're really big enough to be doing, but because you've got the weight of us behind you and our marketing spend and our just like kind of, you know, our size, you know, that you just don't really have an option. So it is, you know, that there's definitely a monopoly sort of a bit of a... monopoly element to it that is it definitely is challenging to be an independent promoter it's also something we're really really proud of because we can just make decisions ourselves you know our business decisions and our creative decisions are usually just us like walking down the street having you know on the way to have lunch and we'll make some decision that might result in an amazing show or or a great concept so we're not really beholden to anyone which we really really enjoy but yeah definitely is challenging yeah but I mean from challenge from those challenges you know good things tend to come and I think you know when Kieran talks about our point of difference And we want to, you know, we really kind of looked at it last year and we were just like, I want to push new music, you know, and we want to push new artists and new labels and new things that we're interested in because we don't feel that lots of people are doing that. So amazing promoters in the UK and outside the UK that really focus on that. And, you know, I mean, like Debt Mantle is a great example. Like, you know, every year they go more left and it sells quicker, which is amazing for them because people are trusting in their curation and their brand. And it's amazing for all the artists that they're bringing through places like a tonal, but it's like a tonal as well. And I think, you know, I'd just like to see more of that, really, because it's amazing at the moment. They've really won the trust of kind of, you know, European festival guys, you know, Depp Mantel. They were far more, you know, headline-based about five years ago. If you look at Depp Mantel kind of 2014, it doesn't look super cutting edge, but you look at this year's lineup and you just think. They've sort of won the trust of their community now and people just know that it's going to be an immaculate musical programme, which is quite an inspiring place to be, I think. Yeah, I think, yeah. Any time you can go to a festival and not be so bothered about who's billing and just wander around and listen to great music and, you know, and have your... mind blown in various ways can only be a positive thing rather than like, oh, look who it is again. Yeah, that's really something that we're striving for. So that all said, if someone knocked on your door in 12 months time with some hedge fund millions and wanted to get involved with Crankbrother, would that in any way be tempting? for you or is it just that's not of interest it's not something we really thought of you know it's just kieran and i at the moment and our assistant and um the only way we'd ever i guess take any funding on as an independent is is if we wanted to do something you know something significant that I could that we could use funds for if you know if we wanted to take a festival and try and do something that you know that I mean one of the downsides were having an independent business is we don't have access to funds so like the funds that we have are just the funds that we make everything's self-financed so you know even doing like retextured is you know it's very it's tough like there's 14 shows there's a lot of bills to pay and and you know so that's one element that you know i can see why why independents go for it you know it's it's not it and it's not easy being a promoter as as it's well documented so a lot of time if you've got a bit of financial support it can it can really assist you in some of your decisions but it's just making sure that those decisions that assistance helps your decisions in a positive way so taking it back a decade um tell me a bit about how you got into throwing parties and what that first year or so was like for you we we sort of it it sort of happened very slowly really we would We're doing nowhere near the amount of shows that we're doing now, obviously. But we both had normal jobs and we started doing kind of parties probably three or four times a year for friends. 100 people, 150 people. Down in Corsica Studios, actually. Corsica Studios. We were living in Elephant Castle and Corsica Studios was half art gallery, half club then. They just had that little main room bit. Yeah. But it was tiny, wasn't it? Yeah, and it was chaos. You know, it was just like, yeah, anyone could come. It was like... Anyone who could DJ could DJ. We'd have a mate playing drum and bass and the next guy would play a bit of techno. But it was maybe after like two years. there was never any intention of doing it full time or anything. I think like often like the things that happen organically can be the best is that just maybe after a couple of years, we're like, this is pretty fun actually. And, and maybe we should try doing it in some other venues and, and try doing some different stuff and, and, and, and actually booking some. artists not just having our mates play because there was probably even sort of fight we always kind of thought it would fizzle out after four or five years I mean it was only I never really thought it would be what we did sort of forever you know because it just felt so intangible it's not really you know I don't think many people when they're growing up like what do you want to be when you grow up a promoter they might say I want to be a DJ or like I want to I love want to be involved dance music but they probably don't think of being a promoter so like we were really into it because we were both DJing and we loved and it was like it was basically a way for us to actually have a gig you know that's what so many promoters you speak to why did you start promoting because I want to have a gig so you basically you'd have to put on a party and then people listen to your DJ you know so that like you know you generally like so many promoters you speak to that there I mean so many DJs I speak to now they started out as promoters because they wanted you know they wanted to like build a bit of a scene around around that around them and their community and then and then it kind of kicked on for them but it just happened very organically really yeah Yeah, which was really nice. There was no master plan at all. Still isn't. And what was the club scene like generally for you guys in 2009, 2010? It felt very different to the way it feels now. There was loads of warehouse space. in East London, really easy to get. I mean, everything was on what's called a temporary event notice, which is kind of a temporary license for 500 people. And it was really quite easy to get on venues that were never meant to be nightclubs, you know. So as long as it had, you know, a couple of fire exits and... and some power, you could basically do an event there. It was kind of the era of the TBA East London warehouse. Exactly. It was great. Mother Over and Secret Sundays and then us a little bit after those guys, you know, just doing kind of, you know, just throwing a pair of speakers and a red park hand into the warehouse. Yeah, it felt super positive as well though because it was on the back of like... you know the loads of clubs closing baglies all the kings cross ones you know so suddenly like loads of places where that we'd cut our teeth in that we loved were just gone you know the kings cross three clubs at once gone um and places so and then you know like a few promoters started popping up doing warehouse parties and and people were excited about it and and it was yeah for me it was like really one of my favourite times of clubbing in London, which, you know, we've now been going to clubs in London for 20 years. So I can now think, I'm now old enough to look at different periods of clubbing in London and think what, some of the most exciting well i mean they were pretty loose as well like the parties just the that everyone was doing like you know you wouldn't get away with that stuff now like and there was an amateurism to like all of the promoters parties which was pretty refreshing and like they were pretty raw and just like minimal production and like the power used to go out like five times and yeah i remember that was a thing at our events so often like the music would cut out and you'd get it back on then it would cut out again you know that hasn't happened in years yeah it's a point where it would always cut out a few times so it wasn't even frowned upon but it was a kind of you almost miss it sometimes because the vibe when it comes back on is really yeah that cheer yeah it's pretty special and i mean and just some of that like uh There was so much space then. I think that was what was really interesting. There were just like all these old buildings in South and East London that had been sat there, not being used for much. And then people realised that they could make a few quid on them on the weekend by renting them out. It was generally well. wasn't it, that some bloke would usually find a warehouse that was being developed in like four or five years' time. So this is like kind of 10 years ago, so like 2009, I think. There were loads of buildings that were earmarked to be developed in five years, so some bloke would kind of find it and he'd pay minimal rent on it and he'd just put in like kind of 15 or 20 raves a year. So like every other Saturday or something. I think he'd have a different promoter putting kind of 600, 700. But he wouldn't really do much else with that venue. It would just be, there were loads of them in Hackney Wick and all down Curtin Road, Great Eastern Street. What were your favourite sort of scrappy... semi-legal venues back then there's this guy called ranks who's he's still kicking about in shoreditch he's a bit of a legend and he's he's he's he had like two or three yeah he had a nice photographic studio which was pretty awesome i i also like for five years had a venue called factory seven that was really which was like it was a really interesting building it was an old stables that you know still had all the rings and and cobbled cobblestones from where the horses used to be kept just on the edge of the city of London and then you know it was actually basically being used for a city boys car park when when I came across it and you know it was just full of Porsches and And we managed to persuade the landlord to give us the lease on it. And they were going to redevelop it in four or five years. So it's exactly that story. Exactly that story. The kid was just telling me it was meaning me. But we did some great shows in there. Great shows in there. And it was just amazing. It was just a really raw space, but it had loads of history. And you could, I mean, the sound was just, you could. you could pound it out it was kind of one neighbour it was one neighbour that didn't like it and then he's probably still still around it's a skyscraper now isn't it it's a skyscraper yeah it's sad well I mean actually sadly but also quite good is when they there was always a rumour that Shakespeare's original first theatre was was built nearby which is why Curtain Road is called Curtin Road and you know part of the big development plans was they were gonna uh the you know the the developer had to pay and build a Shakespeare Theatre nearby as part of this huge development when they knocked down our beloved warehouse and they started to take up the floor they found out that Shakespeare's Theatre was not actually on Curtin Road and they found it underneath our warehouse So they then had to change all of their development plans. So our beloved warehouse spot has not been built on and they're now uncovering and it's still got all the original flooring, all the seating from Shakespeare's first theatre. So I was quite pleased at that. I was like, yeah, there you go. We've been raving on top of Shakespeare's first theatre for the last five years. Is it becoming like a visitor's centre? It's becoming a visitor's centre, yeah, and they're going to have all the original dress circle and everything. You could maybe throw some parties in there. Yeah, that would be good, wouldn't it? That would be good. I mean, that is always the nice thing about London. You know, there's so much history there. It's interesting. And with the experience in... that you guys have had as DJs, promoters, partygoers for a couple of decades, all told now, what are the essential ingredients for a good party? We've always just thought the venue is the most important thing for any event, whether it's indoor or outdoor. And that's what, like, in 10 years of doing parties, when we first started doing them, we always used to say, we'll never do a show in a bad venue. And that goes down to you've got to have great sound quality, you've got to have decent acoustics, but just an interesting venue. We've never really used the kind of standard club locations. Every now and again when I go to one, when I actually go to a purpose-built nightclub, I love it. I love how... so well put together they are but i i we always love just going to events and interesting venues you know it keeps it interesting for us as well obviously purpose built club have you know weeks and months to tweak systems to get everything working and operating perfectly whereas we have like day before we go in and you know we make our plans and and then you try and execute it and like and you know the sound the lights the flow the bars everything try and make it work as well as possible which is i mean it's challenging but nothing beats the location does it you know when you think about like you know robot heart burning man or i don't know barbarellas in uh in croatia or uh you know, Panorama Bar, like it's all about, for me it's all about the building or the sort of location that you're in. That's what kind of creates the atmosphere. I think it's probably what's been like the most important thing to us gaining a following was the fact that we were always keen on finding new venues and using them. We did loads of brief parties, street parties. And we've just done like, we've used venues that lots of people couldn't or wouldn't. And as a result, you kind of have those magical moments that don't occur sometimes when you're in a basement with four walls. I mean, they do often, but... you know there's something very special sometimes about being outdoor we do lots of outdoor shows and there's something very special about being outdoors in London and and still listening to that sort of music and and it's great you mentioned outdoor shows I guess the street parties that you guys um have thrown in Shoreditch have become a bit of a flagship event for Crankbrother can you tell me a little bit about um those are put together it feels like it must be a bit of a challenge working with hackney council on something like that as they don't have the best rep in nightlife circles well i mean actually you know i think hackney have you know they're getting quite tricky now in the last couple of years but i mean i think they've done i think they have actually done a lot for nightlife in the last 10 years they they did license a lot of venues and they gave out a lot of A lot of late night licences. I think the issue is now they've started to listen to local residents too much and they've started to tighten the screw massively but you know they've been we've worked very very closely with Hackney Council obviously for these street parties and we've done I think we've done seven years now I think there'll be the eighth I thought maybe the seventh year is 2019 that we've done the street parties and it's a it's a massive challenge um every year I kind of say to Dan this is the this is the last year we're going to get this over the line with the council you know it's um A couple of years ago, this massive Montcalm hotel opened really nearby, and they don't like the street parties, believe it or not. They've got a rooftop with 300 people sitting around a swimming pool, and there's an outdoor restaurant, and the sound bleed up there is horrific. I mean, literally, you can hear every part of the music. So, you know, they just weren't there until like 18 months ago. And now they complain constantly. But, you know, you have to be able to convince the council that we're a culturally important event that's been going for several years. And I think that's the thing now that stands to us that we've done seven years of these. events and we've never you know we've never had any anti-social behavior we've never had sort of tons and tons of complaints you know there's there's lots of different things that that make it possible i mean it but it's a it's a hell of a lot of work it's as soon as i've kind of got the two street parties out of the way I start working on the next year again sort of almost immediately so I sort of end up spending the first half of the year kind of licensing everything and then the next half of the year sort of delivering them so it's um but they yeah that nothing beats them really that I mean they're pretty amazing like that I still every time we're like that it's at capacity and We have the headliner coming, and I just think, I can't believe we're doing this. I'm always worried the police are going to turn up and shut it down. And they do normally turn up and say, what the hell is this? And I say, well, we've got a license. But they've never heard anything about it. There seems to be no real communication going back and forth. They've been at all the licensing meetings, but when it actually gets down to it, Like the guys on the beat that day, they know nothing about it and they just can't really believe, like I can't, that it's possible. You mentioned having to kind of fight your corner for the cultural importance of the events that you put on. Do you think there's a changing view in London among local authorities and law enforcement about the cultural importance of electronic music events? Certain boroughs are fantastic for it, but you have to hammer it home to them. It's really important that the cultural significance of these events is recognised. Otherwise, if you just have like a nanny state situation like that, I mean, the way things are going in Australia at the moment, it's just licensing has become a nightmare and everything's getting shut down. And you just think, and they just don't have any view that they're culturally important events. over there and if it you know certain boroughs we work with are absolutely fantastic we're doing quite a lot in this venue and Walthamstow at the moment and London Borough of Waltham Forest they remind me of what Hackney were like 10 years ago they're desperate to do events and you know everything I suggest they're like yeah that's a great idea you know, I had to get a two-hour extension for Retextured on this big venue and they've never done an event until 4am in the venue before, but, you know, they signed it off because they were like, this is great, you know, we've got Nina Kravitz playing in Walthamstow, who thought that was possible? It's just, I suppose, you know, Hackney were quite progressive when we first started working with them 10 years ago, but... you know that then a lot of venues and and nightclubs and and legal raves like we were just talking about you know opened and at the same time that they're having lots of their funding slashed so there's even you know there's even a part of me that you know sympathizes with some of the ones that are more progressive because it's very difficult for them you know to actually be complete supportive I think the needs it's hard for the the guys that deal in the licensing department to to really make the decisions like something needs to come more from, you know, from Sadiq or from the London nightlife mayor rather than, you know, from the little guys at Hackney Council because they're just getting inundated with the requests and stuff and they're getting hammered by the local residents and there needs to be policy in place that actually recognises the cultural significance of this. So it's not about, you know... the battle between the promoters, the residents, the licensing. There's actually something higher up that says, like, yeah, this is one of the things that created what we're in now is happening in East London is electronic music. It's one of the first and foremost things that's important to this borough, probably more than, like, any other borough in London, I'd almost say. Like, East London... It's had points where it's been like the clagging capital of Europe or the world. And it's been so important. And recently, just to ignore that history, it's just really saddening. at somewhere like Berlin and where they really understand you know the economic impact of having a positive clubbing scene and they support it and rather than just you know hammering the nightclubs that you know that the recent news article that they actually funded venues to have you know sound treatment in so it didn't disturb the neighbors like There is a happy point, like, you know, promoters, clubs, we don't want to piss off the residents. And the residents would far rather find an amiable way to work with us. And we've worked with residents loads before. You know, there's part and parcel of it. And there is usually a solution point to get to with some, not always all of them, but lots of them. But there needs to be support from the right places. And I think like a lot needs to come from the mayor and the night knife mayor for me, a lot more than is happening at the moment. Do you think the establishment of Nightmare has been successful? I think it's a step in the right direction. To be honest, I don't know. awful lot about what plans were in place with her but I mean I think I was excited when the position was advertised and when they went you know I think it the fact that it's even being engaged with this is a step in the right direction I mean I one one thing I would say is that you know it is a concern that you know more could be done and more focus could could be concentrated on actually cultural significance of nightlife. We're certainly not in the worst situation compared to a lot of European capitals. I mean, Dublin, I've tried to do street parties in Dublin just because we're Irish originally and we went to college there and stuff. I mean, they just pretty much laugh at me when I try and do street parties. They're like, hang on. Why would we allow you to do that? And when I speak to Dublin, we know quite a few Dublin promoters and they just have nightmares. You can't get anything licensed over there that's not in a nightclub. You know, you've got, they just do the same nightclubs over and over again. It's historical licenses. You can't really get anything past 2am. So, you know, it's a challenge in London, but it's... it's not the worst you know and like somewhere like Berlin I think Barcelona actually is quite progressive thinking as well like that you know that they're sort of more the gold standard but So, yeah, it's a challenge, but we're not in the worst situation. I try and keep a bit of perspective sometimes because there is a bit of progressivism in London. I mean, London's such a large city that, like, impacts of things can disappear. Like, you know, when you go to Sonar in Barcelona, you can see the impact of that festival. you know it's everywhere every single person you meet across that week is going there whether it's like the person in the shop it's like your waiter that's serving you like they're all going to sonar for something and everyone's talking about sonar the taxi driver is like it takes over the city and London is so vast that nothing ever takes over the city, whether it be a music event, a sports event. And that certainly makes it harder because I think in a smaller city... like the cultural importance of dance music and East London would really have resonated further in a smaller city. But in West London, half of them don't even know what Hackney is. So they don't give a shit, you know? So I think that needs to always be, you know, remembered. you know the nightmare is a new thing it needs to be felt out it needs to be engaged in all uh areas of of live music um and and and nightlife economy and i think you know it's not just about there's more to nightlife economy than just clubbing as well of course so I think it's a step in the right direction. And I think, you know, I'd like to see that there'd be some more legislative power that they actually have to enforce things and more active conversations before decisions are made, like with Hackney, where I don't think there was enough engagement with the nightlife mayor before that happened, you know, and then it just suddenly happened. It was done. decided you know and i think that was a real shame there's a there's a lot of power at kind of like local council level and i think that's what people don't quite realize is that people look at it like it's a london issue but you know there's most of the power is kind of delegated on a council by council basis so it's you know Sadiq Khan can come out and make quite sweeping statements about about you know aspirational statements about how they can affect change but essentially pretty much all the power on licensing which is really what we're talking about in terms of getting more festivals through getting better hours for nightclubs getting better hours for like late night bars That's all decided at local council level. It's not something that's centrally decided in any way. So it's a challenging job for the Knights Arts because you've essentially got to get into every single different... different borough from the outside looking at crank brothers progression over the past 10 years seems to be like quite steady um sort of sensible growth to the reach the point where you are now i'm going to assume though there's been some bumps in the road along the way how many kind of nightmarish promoter scenarios have you uh dealt with i mean a lot the probably the the most challenging time was when we had our restaurant at the same time as promoting because you know we had you know a big restaurant and and bar with you know 30 odd full-time staff and and that was sucking up most of our hours every week you know like the one thing we've all always been really interested and enjoyed his food, you know, as well as music. So I'm very passionate about it. And, and we put everything into that. And, and, and sometimes Crankbrother played second seat and, and that was quite tough to like, you know, balance it as well as actually having some life. Yeah. We ran Crankbrother. We had like a, our office was behind the kitchen in our restaurant for like five years. So like we. and it was only ever us on Crankbrother, it was just us two. So, you know, we'd be like trying to organize a massive event and then like the head chef would come in and start asking us a load of questions about the menu and then he'd go and then we'd like be back on the... phone to the venue it was just how long were you juggling those two things for like five and a half years yeah like including the was probably longer actually because we spent about two years kind of preparing towards opening the restaurant you know getting the license for that and finding the finding the building and then we had it for five years so it's probably like seven years or something yeah At what point did you decide enough is enough? Well, so about like last Christmas, we decided to sell the restaurant. And well, maybe it was put a midway through 2017, actually, and then to actually kind of sell it. We sold it to a pub group. And, you know, we've got like 18 venues. So it was just sort of another venue for them. And yeah, so we sold it and just decided to put everything into Crankbrother at the beginning of 2018. And it's been, it makes a lot more sense now. Yeah, it's really nice to be doing one thing. Yeah. And just do one thing really well. And I think there's been periods in our lives probably where we've just tried to take too much on and overstretched ourselves. something falls into like that is great let's do it and that is one of the good things about being in london there's opportunities and stuff happening but it's really nice to be able to do one thing really constantly do it well and we've kind of been we're very very sort of hands-on so like i mean i think we only used a production manager for the first time in 2018 so like i've produced every single show that we've done i've never never actually got in like a professional manager that's done hundreds of festivals i've always just done it myself i didn't even know people did it particularly i've just always done it you know and then done we've just always done the event management ourselves and done all the compliance documents ourselves and you know booked everything single supplier like we've just always yeah it's just we've just always done but things get missed the old time you turn up did you book the medic or did you book the yeah where's the bar? That was probably overstretched. We had an event shut down by the police about five years ago because of an issue with the licence, which was probably part of that we were just fairly disorganised. I mean, that was probably the worst thing that's ever happened. Yeah, I'd say that's probably the worst moment in 10 years. Like 1,000 people in the venue just starting to boot off Notting Hill Carnival. Please close it down because licensing issues. I mean, literally going onto the stage with a mic and being like, sorry, you've got to go home. And then we had to refund all the ticket holders. We had to call Gerd Janssen and Kink and be like, no, don't come. It's like, you know, don't get in your cab. The party's been shut down. When you went up on the stage to kind of announce the end of the party to the crowd, what was going through your mind I'm pretty sure I made Luke Solomon do it who was DJing at the time I was too spineless I think that was one of those moments where you just want the kind of ground to swallow you up and then but you know it's the way you kind of bounce back from those things and we looked at that and we refunded everyone the next day yeah we just said we need to just refund absolutely everyone and then a few people like probably 50 people emailed and says I want you to refund my cabs and we actually refunded a lot of people's travel you know we took a massive financial hit and it was a we lost 20 grand you know fucking ruined us for ages we were in a big mess financially for like six months a year like we you know we were at the bottom of our overdraft and but we just took a call like let's just actually do the decent thing promoters actually sound you know that like that's quite a long history of promoters not not uh you know not kind of fronting up and funding people when they have a disaster so we just did that and that that's the way you can kind of like get your get out of a disastrous situation with your with your reputation intact you know and you guys have also sort of there was a booking agency that you had at some point Yeah, yeah, I've tried that for a bit. Obviously, you've mentioned the restaurant, you've DJed, you've had a label, you've made music. Where does all of these kind of other activities, where do they all sort of sit for you now? Have you really sort of got tunnel vision and focusing on putting on events? Yeah, I mean, I think that really is the main focus at the moment is just putting on events. You know, we're still DJing at our own shows and predominantly warming up, which we both love, and setting the kind of tone for the party. And then we've just got way more shows on, like, generally. So, you know, it's hard to even take shows. gigs because we've got shows on. I think we've got another 15 shows now between now and the end of March. And as we said, we're a super small team. Well, it's just three of us in the office, including us two. yeah, it's all hands on deck just to, to deliver really good, good events basically. Yeah. Promoting is, is the main thing. I think there's just, there comes a point where I just, we looked at our lives. Kieran had two kids as well, which also had more complications. We were like, Jesus, our lives are really complicated. Like, why have we just, why have we done this to ourselves? Like you don't, I can't, I'm just seeing all these like, you And then even though I'm doing what I love, but, you know, I've just taken too much stuff on. I'm being pulled in too many different directions. And then it's so we just like we stripped back what we were doing. And there was quite a bit of soul searching when we sold the restaurant. We were like, you know, where does our passion really lie? Like, what do we want to commit to? Like, is it music or is it food? And there's an overlap in that, you know you know they're very different industries and and to do both well is is not possible so there was quite a lot of self-search when we decided you know like you know we really believe in Crankbrother and we believe you know this is an opportunity now we sell the restaurant to take it in a different direction and that's when we started booking some live that's when we started thinking about new festival concepts that's when we you know started even just i think personally like promoting and producing the shows a lot better because we had the hours like we both gained like 50 60 hours a week back which is you know a lot and i'd like to finish by asking um what advice you would offer to someone who was maybe thinking about starting their own party in london or elsewhere in 2019 I think the most important thing is grassroots. Like, don't come in, try and book a DJ that you think is going to sell tickets or that you've seen on lots of other people's bills. Yeah, don't come in and try and compete with big promoters straight away. You kind of need to do it based around your own community. And that's definitely what we did. You have to launch it. through your own sort of community and be booking artists that you sort of know or they're from your locality and, you know, maybe do it started in your local club and sort of build something out organically. Have some good residents that people are just as happy to see those residents as they are anyone and they just come in there to engage with other people in their community. that's what they like about it. That's what we started doing when we were young clubbers. We used to go to Fabric and places. It was the same people we'd bump into every week. I never saw them outside of Fabric or Bagley's or places like that, but you had a relationship with them. through those clubs and I think and do it with a full time job and do it on the side for at least a few years you know because it was it was at least kind of three four years until we you know actually start and actually quit our jobs and do it full time you know it's not it's not it's not something that you can I think you know most businesses unless you're raising loads of money and doing a kind of proper entrepreneurial business raise I think it you really need to look at it as something that you do on the side as a kind of a as a kind of a vocation idea initially and then and then see how it develops i think yeah you've just got to stay true to to what you're we get asked that question a lot like you know the amount of times i get you know someone yelling in my ear in the dj booth like you know how do you think i should you know and how do you think i should start what do you think i should do what club do you think i should use like who should i use for branding like Use your friends for everything. Engage in your natural pool of talent around you so everyone's committed to it. That's what we did. I think that's what lots of our contemporaries have did that really affected. Their mate was doing the artwork, their mate was DJing, their other mate was running the door. That's what's great about it. I mean, I kind of miss those days sometimes of like having everyone, it was like a real collective energy. And I think, you know, worst case, if it doesn't, if it doesn't pay off or it doesn't, it doesn't happen. And you do two or three years of great parties with And it doesn't lead to anything. But you're not putting all in your eggs in one basket and overanalyzing and thinking like, I want to be a promoter. I'm going to put this, I'm going to go for this target market. And just, you've got to feel your way out. There's a lot of like, there's a lot of learning to be done on the journey to like, to getting there and being like being able to pull off big shows with like big visions. And you've got And the best way to do that is with your friends around you, really. Thank you. you
