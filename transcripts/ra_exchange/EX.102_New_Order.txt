Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. New Order is... well, they're New Order, aren't they? a legendary synth-pop group that has influenced countless of electronic music bands, DJs, and producers. Blue Monday, their most beloved hit, remains the best-selling independent 12-inch single of all time in the UK. It's been a highly successful and at times tumultuous road, but the group is on tour yet again with a slightly different lineup than before. Peter Hook, the group's famed bassist, is out. Tom Chapman, the new bassist, is in. Second guitarist Phil Cunningham remains, but Gillian Gilbert, the group's original second guitarist, is back in as well. Stephen Morris and, of course, singer Bernard Sommer remain. Caught up with them in Barcelona as part of our live exchange series at this year's Sonar Festival to talk about the band's lengthy history. ♪ ♪ Quick note before we begin, as the group's voices may not be as second nature to many of our listeners as the lyrics to, say, "Age of Consent," I'll pop in and introduce each member briefly the first time that they speak. All right, well, welcome to ResidentWiser's live exchange at Sonar Pro. joined by a group you may probably already know. New Order, thank you for joining us, guys. - Thanks for having us. - I guess, first question I wanted to ask you is when was the last time you guys were in Barcelona? Do you remember? Stephen Morris. Oh, yeah, sorry. I seem to have got the group memory. The last time we met, I have got the group memory. Last time was in... Summercase, was it? 2006, I think it was, when we played Summercase with Iggy. Iggy was on, and it was on the sea near the front. It was good. I enjoyed it. We thought we'd leave it a few years before we came back. Do you have a good relationship with Spain? I mean, has Spain been a country that's really warmed to your music over the years? It seems to, yeah. I mean, the reception we got the other night was fantastic. What's one there? Bernard Sumner. Yeah, I think that's true of all that I'm in it. American countries, you know, South America, we have a great connection with them. I think, yeah, we always have a great gig here. We had one bad one once in Valencia in the ball ring. Tell me about that. Let's not talk about it. We got off to a rocky start, but these days we're, we have a much better time, yeah. But you have quite a new lineup. Is every, how is everything cohering? Is it, is it going pretty well with everyone and fitting all of these pieces together? Yeah, yeah, I think we're gelling together very well, you know. This is Tom, our new bass player. Phil, our new guitarist that's only been with the band since 2001, yet is still considered new. Phil Cunningham. Still the new guitarist. A mere decade, a mere decade, that's all. Yeah, it's only a decade. Yeah, it's working really well. We're really enjoying it. We did the... first couple of gigs in November 2011 and they were benefit gigs for a guy called Michael Schamberg who produced all the early New Order videos and he's American and he's very ill in America he's got a congenital brain disorder and We did two benefits for him. We did Brussels and we did Paris. And then we did another show in London. And we thought that we were going to stop there and see how it went. But then we got a request to play in South America to do a small tour there. So we thought, well, we enjoyed the first gigs and then went over to South America. It was absolutely fantastic. And that kind of spurred us on, really, rather than to stop and pause, to continue. And so now we're doing a world tour that ends in November. I thought it wasn't sold to us like that, was it? No, it's a snowball tour. It started off as, I just got to South America. You say it ends in November, but you never know, do you? You never know. There could be the Christmas gig in Iceland, yeah. I'm going away at Christmas. You're going away? Well, I won't happen, will I? No. Is it important to you guys, I mean, when you have that momentum of the band on a touring situation, is it important to you to keep it going almost? Because you know you're on to something good and you don't want to take a long break and then do more shows. The funny thing, it's not funny, it's just a matter of circumstances really, that usually what happens is you go into the studio, you do a record, and then you go out and you've got to promote the record. So it's kind of like this thing, it's like, I've got to go and promote the record. Salesman. Yeah, you're pushing something and this is just like, well, we're just doing it because we like doing it. It might sound a bit of a cliche, but it is a bit of a liberating thing. It's not like you've got anything to sell and you're worried about anything. We're just doing it simply because we like it. Honest. Of course. What's it been like playing bass in the band with a bassist who's so identified with the band? I mean, it must be tough to find your own place. They're quite big shoes to fill, aren't they? Tom Chapman. Yeah, they are, but it's been fine. It's all about the music and the bass lines have been fine. For me, it's all about... the songs really more than the actual bass lines and it's really making music with four people that I enjoy spending time with and that's the important thing so yeah it was daunting at first but I think I'm doing a good job so I think the music is sounding good everything's good They're quiet, you see, so I think they're agreeing with me. I don't agree with that. Oh, shit. He isn't doing a good job. He's doing a good job. Tom's fitting really well. I mean, basically, Peter Hort left the band because he was unhappy with the band. So I hope he's got what he wants and he's happy now. Are you hearing the way that he plays some of the songs a little bit different, like a little bit of his own personality in a way? Tom? Well, yeah. I mean, otherwise you'd get a parrot, wouldn't you? I mean, Tom's a great bass player. What he does is he does his own thing. He doesn't, like, copy. Obviously, you've got to play the same notes. But apart from that, he does it. How does the phrase go? He puts his own stamp on it, which is good. Yeah. Yeah, I guess I asked. if you can hear a difference in it because it is the same. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is different. Yeah, of course it's different. You don't have a record to sell right now. Will there be a record to sell ever again? Are you guys thinking about making new music at this point? Yeah, but it's at the back of our minds, I think, because this year is all about, obviously it's all about playing live. We just, we haven't, I think. the only time that we've got, we were working out when we've got a couple of days in which we could rehearse new numbers because we don't want to play exactly the same set all the time. So we need a couple of days rehearsal to work out a new old song. Like, just before we came out here, we had two days and we worked out how to play isolation and things like those, you know, on consecutive days. And we were working out just when we had time to rehearse again and it's not... for like a month so we're kind of too busy really to think about writing some new stuff but I think that we'll have to because but it won't be until next year the thing is if you don't I can't remember who said it it wasn't me But if you don't do it, then you're just an antique. You're a bit of a curiosity. If you don't do new music, what are you doing? You're just regurgitating old stuff. So, yeah, it's part of... doing music, you've got to do new stuff. Does it feel like with bringing out some of these old records, though, that it's almost like a new song in a way that you haven't played in a long time? It is. I mean, when the idea to do the gigs for Michael came up, we sort of sat down and listened to... We started with movement. No, we didn't start with movement. We didn't bother with movement. Yeah, we didn't do that. We started with power, corruption and lies and we just listened to the old stuff and said, oh, that'd be a good one. That'd be a good one. And basically, every track that we'd ever done, we thought it'd be good to do. But then we thought, well, we have to do them a bit differently. And, you know, it's good. What's the one that's changed the most in terms of playing it live in your mind? 586? True Faith has changed a lot. How so? We just kind of went back to the drawing board with it and tried to freshen it up a bit. But yeah, for us as much as for the other people coming to see us because it just makes it more interesting. Yeah, in a way that feels like, I mean we've changed 586, Temptations changed quite a lot. and True Faith has changed quite a lot and that feels it's kind of more for us than the audience really to keep it feeling fresh and vibrant because we don't want to get into a situation where we're like, right, here we go again, you know. So we've done quite a radical remix of those songs and it just feels like you've got new songs in the set, you know. So it just keeps it really exciting, yeah. It must have been interesting for you coming back to the band after a number of years to be playing these songs again as well. It's about 12 years, I think. Yeah, but... Did they feel different? Yeah, they did at first because I'd actually forgotten quite a lot. of the parts and things because if not so but once you start playing them what was the hardest one to remember regret I think yeah and have you been enjoying getting back out on the road I have yeah too much I think Steve stops her enjoying himself We call him the fun place. Yeah, it was good how we started small, though, because I wasn't too sure whether I really wanted to go away touring again, because, you know, I've obviously got children now. What was the moment at which you were like, yeah, OK, I like this. I like this. About the second gig. Yeah. It was just really good to be back together again and having Phil and Tom. And I think it'll be good in the future when we do write something because I've got to know everybody again. You know, they've got to know me because Phil just came in the band, I think, when I sort of took my leave. Slipped in, yeah, did all my parts. One in, one out. Yeah, but now I'm back. So Phil, you joined 10 years ago, 12 years ago? That's right. What was it like to be joining a band like this with so much history already? It was quite daunting at first to be honest but I don't know you just get used to it and you just end up being a bunch of musicians in a band and you know touring the world and enjoying it. It's not a bad job. It's good work if you can get it. Well Phil had hero worshipped me since he was a boy. He still does, actually. I think he's very disillusioned with his hero. How long did it take to get disillusioned with your hero? A couple of weeks, probably. It's longer than you might expect. You mentioned Michael, who you did the charity benefit gigs for, and I wonder, he's an American who's doing videos for you. How did you meet him? How did you get in contact with him back then? Ah, Michael Schomburg. We first met him... In the early 80s, when we obviously went to New York, and he was laboring under the pretense that he was going to be Factory America, because Factory was kind of... You've met a lot of factories. There's a lot of factories. There's Factory Australia. The oddest one was Factory Zimbabwe, which no one's entirely sure what happened to. It may still be going. Well, I remember something about Factory Zimbabwe. We actually bought the guy a house. No, it's Factory Australia. And Zimbabwe. Did he get a house? No, we bought a recording studio in Zimbabwe. Yeah, that was, yeah. We bought the guy in Australia a house. So Michael got two benefit gigs. It's fair. Yeah. Nothing if not democratic. So there's a guy in Zimbabwe and he's putting up flyers, he's spreading the word. I don't know what he's doing. But the idea was, because Factory itself was kind of like... a small thing that came from nothing. It was basically Alan Erasmus would go round and try and start up these other factories without telling anyone. But anyway, I digress. Michael Schamberg was at the time Factory America, although he decided to call himself in very Michael Schamberg fashion of. Factory America, don't know why. And it didn't work out very well. He wasn't really cut out for the business of running a record label. He was an artistic person with... There were a lot of people involved in Factory. There were, yeah, which is probably why what happened to Factory happened. Michael was very involved in arts films and knew a lot of directors and he got a lot of directors working for us that later became very famous like Catherine Bigelow, Jonathan Demme, loads of... What was his style? appealed to you about his work that you might want to get involved in? Well, to be honest, I don't think at the time I appreciated what he was doing because there was a lot of pressure on us to cut the mustard and be successful and, you know, make people like us. But then people like Michael could do whatever the fuck they wanted. And given a completely free reign to make whatever, well we were actually, to be fair. But you could make whatever kind of arty video, sometimes rather impenetrable, what they were about. And they were nothing like the sort of things that you saw on MTV, so we very rarely got played on MTV. Now to me that made our job. That meant we had to do more promotion. You said there was a lot of pressure on you to make people like you. Who was putting that pressure on you? Yourselves? The people. So we do. I mean, well, you imagine that we started off as a small cult band and then we went to America and we played to like 500 people. And then we came back and we played to 2,000 people. And then we came back and we played to 4,000 people. Then we came back and we played to 25, 28, 30,000 people every night. So the pressure came from... God, all these people have come to see us. Bloody hell, it's, you know, all of a sudden we're not doing our own thing in a tiny little punk club. We're on, you know, playing the Enormo Dome in San Francisco or something. And it kind of go, I never expected to end up here. I never thought it was going to be like this, you know. So the pressure came both from you and from... came from being successful. Yeah, it was, particularly America, because in America we were kind of associated with a large label called Warner Brothers. And we had this thing that we do in our pictures on the sleeves. we're not terribly good at acting and stuff like that so there was naturally a reluctance to appear in videos and yeah michael understood this and he could go away and make an arty video which was great did some great ones uh like truth faith philip de coufley fantastic But when we... An example was when we did... what was it called, World of Price of Love, and the American said, yeah, okay, yeah, all right, yeah, the band have got to be in the video, the band have got to be, and Michael would go, okay, yeah, okay, the band will be in the video, and we're in it for like a split second, and the American, oh, God, we can't, we can't, this will never get on MTV, and then they had to go and make another video, and it You would try, you know, you've got to play the game, but there's a natural reluctance to do all this stuff because it just felt a bit awkward, really. But then you had that amazing... I had an amazing video where the Buddhist people were playing charades. Keith Allen, Lily Allen's father, made that video. I was baffled by that when I was watching it this morning. I was trying to figure out... Well, off screen, I had a really bad argument with one of the Buddhist monks. and he was actually from Clacton. What's it like being a... He wasn't a Buddhist monk at all. He was a... An actor. Now we nearly came to fisticuffs because he was... Just going back to Michael, the thing was at the time, I was going to say, was that I didn't really appreciate what he was doing. But then, just recently, about eight months ago, Sky Arts... which is a very good program, satellite channel, showed all New Orders videos, one F. and I didn't know it was on and I just flicked through the channel and thought, oh, it's one of our videos and then they showed every one and then I really, I could see it from a distance, you know, at the time it was too close and couldn't appreciate it but because of the years that have gone by and because of where I am now, I could appreciate what Michael had done and it... It was fascinating. I found them absolutely fascinating. Not every single one, but I mean, there's a video for a song, Run, that was, who was in that? Who was the director of that? Blimey, that was, well, Michael kind of directed it, but he got Robert Breer. Was it Robert Breer, the guy who did the photographs of Rolling Stones? Not Robert Breer. What was it? Did the photographs of Rolling Stones. He did Cocksucker Blues. Anyway, got in to take photographs of us to put in the video. But for some reason, he could only take photographs. very early in the morning when the light was of a specific height in the sky, which didn't coincide with the times that we got out of bed, particularly Bernard. Well, we were on tour in America and he came out to Los Angeles to watch us play. He said, listen, I've got to go back to New York tomorrow. I need to take your photographs. We're like, all right, yeah, we'll do it now. No, no, I need to do it at 8 o'clock in the morning. Well, in those days, we didn't go to bed till 7.30 in the morning. So we were in a complete... Oh, it was horrible. But I really like that video. There's something, a lot of fun in the video. And at the time I just thought... I thought, I didn't quite get it, you know, but now I think it's absolutely fantastic. It's nothing like a pop video, nothing like one. I think that's what's so great about it. So I think Michael had an amazing insight to steer clear of... you know, sort of mainstream commercialism. Because in the long run, it's paid off. Was that the most surprising video when you re-watched it? It was for me because I didn't connect with it at the time and I really connected with it when... I saw it again. Have you guys got a favourite? My favourite? My favourite's probably True Faith because it was when you first saw it it was like what the hell's this? 1963's a good one. 1963's a good one. What's your favourite? I like Blue Monday with the dogs. Gillian does dog training as a hobby. Is it because of that? Yeah, it is because of that. Yeah, I don't like dogs and I don't like the Blue Monday one. Is that the reason you don't like them? There's a video from 1963 and it's made by one of the ring... coats and I didn't know that at the time I met her recently at an awards ceremony and after meeting her I thought I'd revisit that video and it's It features Jane Horrocks, an English actress, and I think that's really good. What about you guys? Favourite videos? I quite like Crystal, actually. I think that was a really good idea, getting those kids to pose as a band. Yeah, Crystal's the one for me as well. I think it really works, the young band. Why didn't you want to be in the video at the time? We don't like being in videos. You have to get up too early in the morning for one thing. And it's boring just having the band in, you know. I think, you know, going back to Sleeves, why we never have a photograph of the band. We did once, just to break the mould. It was a great sleeve. I think they picked the wrong photograph for the front. But we just... It's a bit boring, you know. It's nice if you... I mean... It was great when records were this big and that made the sleeve really important and it was almost as important as the music and it was great. You used to go to a record shop and buy a vinyl LP as they were known then and the sleeve was this big and for my money you got two pieces of artwork. If the band weren't on the sleeve you got the music. and you got a piece of artwork which was a sleeve that you could put up on your wall. You have to get up pretty early in the morning to make a video as well, that's the other thing, isn't it, Brendan? I know it is, yeah. And you guys were going, you were in New York and you were going to sleep at 7.30. What were you doing? Were you recording? Were you going out to clubs? What were you up to? Just being there. We couldn't possibly talk about We would go to clubs and partying and too much, too much. Whole new order tours in those days were like just massive parties. They ended up being massive parties and it was great. It was great, but it got too great. Sonar is an electronic music sort of centric festival, and I wanted to touch on the electronic music in New York that was going on at the time that really influenced you. Danceteria was a club that was quite big. Was that somewhere where you were going or were there other places? Danceteria a lot because Ruth Polsky was doing our tours at the time, kind of run it. There was Haraj, she did that, and then she moved on to Danceteria, so we got in free. So we went to Danceteria quite a lot. Free drinks. Free drinks ticket. Free drinks was... Yeah. That was in the early... It was a great incitement to go anywhere, really. That was in the early days, and there was the Peppermint Lounge. later on was that there was the Funhouse which was a Puerto Rican club which was a pretty heavy club and there was Paradise Garage AMPM I liked Area that was my favourite the one with the sharks it was like before Damien they had the big shark and they went in but I think the thing about the clubs was it was so different to what clubs were like in England because in England they had a specific dress code and they just played straight ahead disco, pop disco stuff, whereas you go... Yeah, or funk. a club in New York, they mixed stuff up. Was that some of the inspiration for La Hacienda in terms of programming and things? Wanted to be a New York club in a way? Yeah. They were more left field and more open-minded. I remember, you know, you'd kind of, in New York early on, you'd sugar hill racers. records, lots of stuff off their label. There was an album called Kids FM, Master Mixes Volume 1, 2, Sharon Redd. And then they'd play The Clash and then they'd play Soft Sail and it was very eclectic, which we found refreshing after England. Were there any DJs in particular that really, or was it just... the whole experience, the club itself. Well, there was Jellybean Benitez, who was big at the time. Who else? Mark Kamens. Kamens was, yeah. It was kind of the very beginning of, like, DJs as DJs. I mean, the first DJ kind of celebrity was kind of like Grandmaster Flash, really. He did that sort of thing about that time. Apart from Caymans, they were just the people who spun records at a club. You didn't really know them. where they were and it's not like it is now where being a DJ is what it is. I remember reading an interview, I think it was you that was saying that when the Hacienda opened on the first night you almost couldn't get in. You had to like convince the... Yeah, that's like, that happened more than once. I should have known it was like a message. I had to pay again. Yeah, of course I had to pay again. I had to pay for bloody drinks and everything. I can only put it down to Gillian's sister Kim, who bears a striking resemblance to Gillian, who used to turn up and say, "Oh, I'm Gillian," and whoever was with her at the time would be me, and she'd get in before us, and when we turned up, it's like, "You're already in." No, I'm not. And then nobody knew who I was anyway, so that's why I had to pay again. I never got the money back. Should have called me, I would have put you on the guest list. Would you? What was, I mean, obviously so much has been written about that club. I guess I'd be interested to know what do you think is the most thing that doesn't get talked about that was really important to you about what that club did or meant in the city or the country even? Well, I think it was a focal point for the city and that's why we opened it really. Previous to the Hacienda, Factory Records did have another club, Night, which we played there as Joy Division. It was called the... It was the Russell Club. It was the Russell Club in Moss Side. Is it Moss Side or Hume? Hume. Hume. Yeah, the Russell Club. Every Friday, initially, the factory had a club night there, so there was that club connection. And that was way back, wasn't it? Way back. Yeah, that was when Joy Division... The thing was, when they first said, we've got to do a club, and they said, yeah, it'd be a good idea. And we said, yeah, we've got to do a club, that'd be great. I honestly thought they meant a club like the factory because it was just like, it was a club where you just went to. It was a dark... It was a night. It was a night, yeah. But it was kind of like this dark place and everything and it was quite, you know... There was a beach club as well, wasn't there? Yeah, there was a beach club but all these things were kind of like dark little places. So I thought it would be like that and then Tony came, oh, we've found an ideal place for this club. It's building on Whitworth Street, International Marine. I'd never been in there. They sold boats. I'd never been in the market for a boat, so I'd never been in. But I assumed that it was going to be like the Russell Club, you know, a little dark place. And then they took us. And it was massive. It was huge. And it's like, right, okay, so we've just got the cellar, have we? No, no, this is it. It's like, this is it. It's like daylight. You can't have a club in here. But eventually it became a club largely through clubbing changing. When it first started, nobody went because it was ahead of its time. It was broad daylight in summer at like 10 o'clock and nobody wanted to go there. They all wanted to go to dark places. It was only... when raves started taking off in warehouses, which curiously enough looked like the Hacienda, that you go, oh yeah, I get it now. That's what the Hacienda is about. It was kind of when culture came round to us. We didn't plan to be. ahead of its time. It just happened that it was. It was just luck, really. Was clubbing culture for you guys also pretty important? Were you going out and was dance music, you know, a big part of your upbringing? I've led a very sheltered life in Macclesfield, so not for me, no. He's a small-town boy. Never went to any clubs at all. No clubs as well for me. No clubs. Why don't we open one? It was for me. I lived as a child. I lived, well, a teenager. I lived about 15 minutes from Manchester City Centre. So if we went out anywhere, you know. We went out at Manchester City Centre, so I used to go to clubs. I used to get refused entrance, though, because I looked too young. And I don't get that problem nowadays. What about you? Were you able to even get in? Oh, yes, I got the training, yeah. We used to go and see bands more than going to clubs. I'd rather go and see a band. You were in a punk band early on anyway. Slightly punk band, yeah. We were called the Inadequates. And we were. Well, I was anyway. What sort of bands were you seeing back then? I went to see the Buzzcocks. I really liked the Buzzcocks, the magazine. Then we were first bands. Then I started getting into Joy Division and factory bands. So, yeah. What about David Essex? Why did you have to mention that? I was 12. You're like Bill Mills. Yeah, I went to see Bebop Deluxe with my science teacher. Got a trip together. No, it was all the class, not just him. And hired a minibus and that was my first concert, Bebop Deluxe. Seminal moment. Bill Nelson was fantastic, yeah. Manchester, it didn't have a club, I guess, at this point. was... Pips. Pips. Okay. Pips was the... It was number one in Europe. That was the thing it said on the door. Number one. Yeah, number one in... It wasn't number one in Manchester. It was number one in Manchester. It was quite good because it had lots of different rooms. The room at the time, everyone was a Roxy room and you used to see all these glummed up women going in and people waiting outside and you couldn't get in. not looking quite as glamorous. But memorably we went there, didn't we? To get the Ideal for Living EP. We did play there, but we went with the clutching, the pressing of the Ideal for Living EP. First Joy Division EP that Ian Curtis had paid for the recording with his 21st birthday money, I think. And the guy at the record studio went, look, I'll give you a really good deal. You can record at my studio. I'll get it pressed for you and, you know, everything. So we did this all in one deal. And we got it and I took it to Pips, the club, give it to the DJ. played it and everyone walked off the dance floor and it just sounded absolutely awful the pressing was it sounded like there was a sock over the record you know it just sounded awful and it was it was totally what they weren't listening to as well at that time because it was it was a bit bit punky really and they were listening to like Roxy Music and David Bowie but Yeah, it was a very despairing moment. Almost gave up on the spot. Didn't get to the end, did it? No, I didn't get... That's enough for that. Sorry about that. This is David Bowie. It brings up a good point I was reading about when you went to New York clubs and other clubs, it really impacted on you, the sonics of records and hearing how those things worked in a slightly different way. Yeah, even though there was a club in Manchester, I was working with a producing... and doing a bit of synthesizer with a group called 52nd Street who were kind of funk black guys. In fact, our bass roadie, Tom's bass roadie, Derek, was in 52nd Street. and I used to go to places I wouldn't normally go with them, and there was a club in Manchester called Legends that I remember it had thousands of lasers all over the place. I think you could get blinded going in there. But they had an incredible sound system, and so did the Paradise Garage had an incredible sound system, which had just come in at the club. and you could hear all the sub bass of records, all the very, very low bottom end and I just had a crappy record player at home and I was like, whoa, what's this frequency? I've never heard it before and that was part of the inspiration in Blue Monday because we worked on those sub, very low frequencies. We recorded Blue Monday at Pink Floyd's studio in Britannia Row in Islington in London. And they had a similar speaker arrangement, which was... And we just mixed everything on the big speakers and concentrated on the bottom end, which was really important to us. So, you know, if you hear Blue Monday in a club... I just listen to the sub-bass on it. It's very subtle, but I think that's, you know, it's a good production thing we learnt from going out to those clubs. Paradise Garage was just that. two walls of hidden speakers, like the wall was about this big, with speakers behind him. And the same all around the club, and the DJ had like a joystick, and he could pan the sound just around the club. So at one point in the night, all the lights would start twirling, and he'd whip the sound right around the club with his joystick. It was amazing. You mentioned 52nd Street and you did work with them, right? In the studio? Yeah, that's right. They were quite a different band to what I guess you guys had been working with or sort of Factory in general had been even releasing, right? Yeah, well, there wasn't really any sort of policy about... There wasn't any label thing. It was just, like, people who went up to Tony and said, can we do a record, Tony? All right, OK. Bernard, you did the first one, didn't you? And then I ended up doing the second one. And... I took it out just recently. I can't afford. And I did another one with him that he never released because it was so good. So ahead of its time. It never actually came out. Yeah, Tony Henry wants to bring it out. Yeah, no, you didn't really think about that. It was just, it was interesting. because I did the first thing which was actually with Michael Chambers' partner Miranda We did an album with her, which was like one thing. Then 52nd Street was like a completely different. I mean, both of us, after New Order, we became jointly factory house producers. So you just got whatever. And it was interesting because the types of music, they weren't. It wasn't what you'd normally do. It was a bit of a challenge. I just think it was an important part of our... knowledge base, learning about music that we worked with other musicians because New Order was a very closed shop. There was only, you know, us and we never worked with anyone else. At that stage we didn't have a producer neither because Martin had gone. And so we had to learn fresh stuff from somewhere and fresh influence. so that was the reason I wanted to work with other people was to find out how they did it, how they made music, what sort of music they were listening to, you know, and just give you an perspective. Were they the first group that you'd worked with in that capacity? No, it was Section 25. I can't remember now. Mike Pickering's band, Quando Quando. Were you a pretty hands-on producer? Marcel King, who was... Marcel King was a... Yeah, it's... Reach for Love was a really good song, but Marcel was the... He was kind of a difficult person to work with because he was a heavy drug addict and he'd come in, he used to sleep, he slept in his car, he lived in his car and slept in it so at the end of the day he'd go and sleep in his car but he was a really heavy heroin addict so every time that he came in the studio. he'd either be in a great mood or a really bad mood. I think you can guess why. So it was really difficult, but he was wonderfully talented. Really had a lot of natural talent, and yeah, he was good. Another great band on Factory that I don't get much of a mention, I think it was ESG. I thought they were from New York. They were the one that Michael's signing. Well, yeah, ESG are quite legendary. They did loads of stuff. They played the opening night of the Ascienda. I nearly missed them. They were, yeah, they were great. They were like one of the bands that we saw were in New York and thought, fantastic. But yeah, ESG went on to do lots of, oh God, I can't remember. It's amazing how your mind goes blank. Were you a very hands-on producer in the studio when you were working with other bands? Did you learn from Martin some tricks to do it that way? What I learnt from Martin really was his sense of experimentation. Martin was a real sonic experimenter. Although some of his methods kind of drove you up the wall, you know. Again, he was pretty mad, Martin. And, you know, he'd try his best to get us out of the studio once we'd recorded the act. the album or whatever, he'd turn the air conditioning down. Him and the engineer would come in with big thick coats on and then they'd turn the air conditioning down so low you couldn't stand being in there. You could see your breath in the studio because he wanted you out of the way. But we wouldn't have that. We were too headstrong. But he was a great catalyst for you to experiment and not just to put a live track down, but to experiment and do new stuff. So learn that from Martin. Engineering, I used to do some engineering, but I learned that from operating synthesizers because if you learn how to operate a complicated synthesizer, then you know it's quite similar to a mixing desk. And sometimes you had to do that because the engineer wouldn't want to do it. worked the length of hours that we worked because we used to go in I think we had one session once that lasted 36 hours which was the mix of the perfect kiss we started it and finished it 36 hours later we had a flat in London. We went back to the flat, packed up all our gear, drove up to Manchester and then flew to Australia the next day for a tour. So I think we had a little chemical aid on that one. Caffeine, caffeine, you know, coffee. you
