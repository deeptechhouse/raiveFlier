I'd like to welcome you in the house of my neighbor, you. You Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Audiences outside Germany may only be vaguely familiar with Hans Nieswandt, but that's been largely through his own choice. Despite having a number one hit in Italy with Whirlpool Productions, Yves Svant has always preferred to remain in the background. He first made his name as an editor at Spex Magazine, the German equivalent to the NME or Melody Maker, and has since published three books in German about DJ culture. He also has become an ambassador for techno through his work with the Goethe-Institut, bringing German artists together with musicians in far-flung countries to collaborate. Basically, there's lots to talk about with Nischwand. So we did just that last weekend in Berlin. Looking over your biography, it seems like you have the typical punk background in a way. You grew up, you were in a couple of bands, and you had a fanzine. for a while. Was your fanzine about punk rock and new wave and all of this stuff? You are correct. Yeah, yeah. This is... Well, I was a very small little hippie. for about two years but I'm at an age where I consciously experienced the punk explosion. Like I remember 1977 I was 13 and I remember reading music magazines about like when the Sex Pistols record came out and So it was a very big decision as a teenager to cut my hair. One of the biggest decisions really I made in my life. You said you were reading music magazines. What music magazines were particularly interesting to you? Well, I was living in a very small town. Well, not such a small town, like 50,000 people. Small compared to... Berlin or anything, but it was not a village. It was a small industrial town at the Lake Constance, which is south of Germany between Austria, Switzerland and Germany. That's where I went to school and lived. And there was obviously not a really exciting... club scene or concert scene there was nothing it was very provincial and southern german so radio was very important first especially swiss radio they had great shows they had a show called Sounds on DRS3 from 8 to 10 in the evening. And I taped that a lot every evening. And they were converging with a music magazine from Hamburg called Sounds. And they pretty much played what the magazine would write about. And this magazine-- had been started in the late 60s and that Magazine also made that transition, like there were these young punks coming in and fighting with the hippies about magazine space. They did the same thing that happened in England with the NME, when Julie Birchall and Tony Parsons came in and Julie Birchall would put wire fence and broken... around her desk to protect it from the hippies. And so that kind of development happened in Germany too and I pretty much went along with it. And what sort of music was particularly appealing to you? Were there certain bands more than others that really touched you? You mentioned the Sex Pistols. Who's that? No, the Sex Pistols was not my main... The thing was that because I was reading, at that point I was reading really quality music magazines, also I had found out that at the train station of that city, Friedrichshafen was the name of the city, you could buy the Melody Maker and the NME. So I started reading English music magazines at around 15, 16. And I never really stopped reading English press. Anyway, so the Sex Pistols, they were not sophisticated. Sophisticated enough for me. I was rather going for stuff like the Buskogs. and the more highbrow punk. And then also, I think, especially since I read Simon Reynolds' Rip It Up book, that punk really, it was just like an explosion and also the birth of a principle, maybe. But then the whole post-punk thing. All these different things that happened also, you know, combined with disco and funk. And that was when I was around 18, 19. And I really got more into clubbing. You know, it was much more interesting to go to... places where you could dance with girls and dress up stylishly. The whole style thing of 1982 was just as much influential to me as punk. When did you make your way up to Hamburg? I finished school in 1984, and in the summer and the next winter, I moved to Hamburg to study American literature, as a matter of fact. But actually, I had... I hadn't been looking for a place where I could study this stuff the best. I wanted to go to Hamburg, because Hamburg at that time had to me the most appealing music scene. And what I wanted to do was become a music writer, like a music journalist, because I was reading music magazines all the time. Plus I had been playing in bands, I had DJed at that point already. I DJed first for money in 1983. I can proudly say 200 Deutsche Marks at that time. But I didn't think that I could make it as a musician or I wasn't even thinking about making it as a DJ. That was no... That was an unknown concept then really to become a DJ in the way we are all DJs nowadays. So I went there to study and I wanted to become a journalist, which I managed to be like one year later. Were there certain, obviously me speaking English, I know Julie Burchill. Tony Parsons, were there certain German music journalists that were also like stars in your eyes that you were like wow if I could only be like X? Well totally, totally. There was a well the Sounds magazine as I mentioned from Hamburg was like a like a bible to me and especially Dietrich Dietrichsen who is still like publishing great books and is still a very good intellectual mind and cultural critic there was a guy called Kid P Later he was known as Andreas Banaski, who was also a very influential writer. Dietrich's brother, Adolf Dietrichsen, but he was writing under... PUNK FRANCE Shock. So that's when I started to... to read Spex Magazine very intensively and months later most great writers from Sounds went over to Spex. So Dietrich became editor at Spex Magazine and a few years later I ended up being editor at Spex Magazine. What was Dietrich's style? I mean what was like so special? about what he was doing to you? Was there something you can put your finger on? Well, it was just very witty. Well, one thing is sometimes he would write about bands that you would not touch, like Duran Duran. And it would not, of course, it would not be like all praise and, you know, it was, but it was a good... Well, it was just his viewpoint. Well, also, he was very... influential not only to me but I think more in the most influential which I see a bit critical is that he he made pop writing a very intellectual discipline using a lot of Latin words and you know stuff like it's like like life like that a lot of people got turned off in the first place so you know sounds and specs were for uh uh uh how would you say in in english pretentious no no i mean like college people or you know like uh university people But Dietrich always had a really great side of humor. Up to now, whenever I read something, there are like ten great thoughts and three great jokes, which I miss with a lot of writers nowadays. You know, humor makes you realize a lot of things in a very comfortable and friendly way. I think it was the same way in the States in a way with a lot of writers. It was kind of like, why are you intellectualizing pop music? It's just music you dance to. That's it. Yeah, but it's not. I found that out when I was, well, I always loved music writing, but when I started to release records myself, I realized that as an artist, you must not be able to explain your work. you know it's great if you can but and remember when we did those records with whirlpool production with eric d. clark and justus künke there was not much uh it was very in you know we worked with intuition and uh chaotic and not uh not really in a rational designed type or laid out type of way and I remember that Dietrich he wrote when we did the second I don't know the first album he did a big feature about us in Specs magazine and I was really thankful for him you know to that he explained what we were doing actually it's interesting because I would think that if you were bringing your sort of music critic background, you would have to be like thinking all the time. You just turned it off when you went into the studio with them. It's like DJing. It's funny how these things are connected, but then separated from each other. Like... Up to now, sitting at my computer and programming tracks is much more like an exercise in meditation than in thinking. It's more like staying in a contemplative state. It's very different to writing. Most of the time I find it quite horrible and not very enjoyable at all. That's exactly what Philip Sherburn said when I interviewed him recently. Philip Sherburn. He said it's... I said, after you wrote your first review, you were like, I love this. This is great. He's like, no. It was terrible. I was just relieved to get it done almost. No, it's more like a burden you have to carry. If you can do it and if you get asked, please can you write about that or write a book. When I was younger, I think it was easier because I was much more, how do you say, ambitious. I wanted to be out there and read my stuff printed. And I had more energy probably too. But then looking back at my writing when I was younger, sometimes I'm a bit... not horrified, but a lot of it is quite arrogant. Like, you know, speaking from a very high level or down to people who don't understand, making a lot of generalizations, like saying stuff like... everybody knows instead of explaining things you know and and I thought this is very much the sound of somebody totally on a mission so when how did you end up at specs you're doing a magazine you're fancying your freelance writing replaces Well, I was lucky that I had done a fanzine before at my hometown. So when I went to Hamburg, I could go around to magazines. And also a very important connection in my life, I have to say, is the brother of Dietrich Dietrichsen, Detlef Dietrichsen. He was music editor at a city magazine called Tango in Hamburg. So I started to write record reviews for him. Then the film editor asked me to write film reviews and a few months later he went to Berlin to work for a newspaper and proposed me as his follow-up. So I was suddenly editor of a magazine and it was great. Because I was a movie editor. I went to see new movies three times a week in the morning. And what I also could do is I could ask all my favorite... specs writers to write movie reviews for me which and in turn i started in 86 i just looked it up recently in 1986 i started freelancing for specs magazine so i uh So I did that for a couple of years and then the city magazine, it was sold to a different company, which is now Prinz. Prinz is a... big German city magazine now that has issues in all the cities and they had centralized editorials so the movie pages were done from Munich or Bochum I can't remember I was appalled and I quit of course and then you know I was just freelancing and playing with a band in Hamburg and then Dietrich called me if I would want to come to Cologne and become specs editor and that was in a way it was like I was at the end of my dreams you know I had reached my goal. Funniest thing is that one day after And he offered me that. Another guy who had been working at Spex, Dirk Scheuring, a great writer also, and he was a DJ partner for a few years, a great underrated man nowadays, Dirk Scheuring. He came up to Hamburg and offered me to become editor at Miss Vogue. which was like it was Condé Nast it was Vogue but it was for 16 to 20 year old girls then in Munich and he had been hired by them so A lot of times I thought, well, if Dietrich wouldn't have offered me specs, I would have gone to Munich and everything would have been different. I would be in New York now and work with models. Tell me about your time at Spex. You worked there for a couple of years before you went off to do music. Yeah, well I stayed for Spex editor from 1990 to 93 and it was a very interesting time for music of course. Well the thing was that I I think they had asked me to come down to Cologne because I was very well in the movie section. And also, you know, literature, they wanted to move the magazine more into a cultural magazine. or, you know, strengthen that with getting me over. But by that time, I had totally fallen for acid house and wanted to... Well, I didn't... Well, I DJed in Hamburg on a small scale and played interesting stuff from New Jersey, Garage House, which was not a big thing in Hamburg. Some people were interested, but the Acid House was the big thing and then also techno and industrial coming on very strong. But there were so many great clubs in Hamburg that I didn't really care so much about mixing and doing the DJ thing on a larger scale. But when I came to Cologne, there was not so much going on as in Hamburg. And also... Specs magazine was paying alright but it was not a full position how do you say it was not yeah it was like a third of a full-time job which is not enough money if you are a music journalist you know and you have to go to restaurants and buy import records especially us underground house imports which very soon became my main focus of writing, which irritated part of the... publishing of the publishers but up to now I think it was a very important right decision to really stress and to what my ambition was really was to break up house music for the alternative set in Germany you know all these people who were into... To introduce it to them, you mean. Yeah, and also to make club culture to open up to let's say to... You see, I had been, because I was a music writer, I was going to London and New York and the West Coast all the time, especially London and New York. And, you know, cities with a very strong black cultural element in the clubs, in the music. And that was, you know, just... extremely inspiring and desirable for me to bring, to kind of import that and mix that up with the post-punk correctness. Because disco culture up to that, up to the very late 80s in Germany was just a commercial. thing you know it was it was like the i i was all my life ever since i became a punk let's say i was frustrated with the hostility towards disco didn't make sense to me and years later when I read John Savage's book English Dreaming I realized so much more how punk like the English punk at least had been born out of gay disco fashion culture really and But there was also that hostility in Germany, very much so, between punks and disco. The disco world or being a DJ was just not a cultural figure that was desirable when you were more left-wing. And I really wanted to change that. And, you know, not me alone. but I was in a position at Specs Magazine where I could have a lot of effect on that. Why did you decide to make music then? Was it simply because you felt like you could almost do better to combine these ideas that you had in your mind of what was interesting in a musical way and just present it in that format? Well, one thing is I had by that time, by the time I was... where I was really pushing Spex Magazine, I was also really pushing the DJ thing, or the DJ thing started to snowball. I had started a weekly, a monthly night in Cologne called Whirlpool in a small club called Rose Club where like earlier in the evening Well, Not by that point, not by '92 when I started it, but Nirvana had played there and the Flaming Lips and big grunge bands when they were really small. But still, even at that time, Shudder to Think would play and then later the Whirlpool Night would start, Deep House music from New York and Detroit. you know people started to invite me to Mannheim or other cities to play there and we were also a little DJ team so it started to interfere Was it all three of you at that point? It was Eric and Jesus that were part of the night the resident DJ so to speak First few times I did alone and then Eric came to town, he was living in Paris and a friend of mine who was studying in Paris, he had brought him over to show him Cologne and I think I was like the second person he met in Cologne and we showed him around, took him record shopping and we... the same records or started a fight about the same record and I invited him to play with me and that was just you know that was great that was the magic magical moment and just as he was not a DJ then he but he was he was one of the main guests at the whirlpool night and also He is really responsible for me. He asked me if I would want to make music with him. You're the DJ, you have the records. Also, I'm a collector or I'm a vinyl maniac. And I have all these old records. By the late 80s... Hip-hop and also house music had started to become so, you know, because the samplers, they had become more powerful and you could sample, you know, whole breaks and stuff and you could take the sampler as a key to the musical archive, you know, speaking all pathetically. But that was really my thing ever since. And Justus, he offered that. You bring the records, I have the mixer and the sampler and the computer. And he was doing music with two other guys. And Eric had just... you know, he has just landed from planet Eric, from planet Clark. And he, so he also became, so for about a week, we were five. then it was very clear that Eric Eustace and me were the most we were the dynamic ones and and we started to to to jam you know and have sessions every day and and being just really extremely creative. And it had to do with the chemistry of us meeting, the freshness of our friendship, but also it was the same, that's where the punk connection comes in. It felt like a revolution had just happened and every week the new records that were coming out, especially from the States then, were incredible. And, you know, it was this kind of... like the debris of the revolution coming down so what did your first record sound like well the the the first record the thing is the first the very first whirlpool record fly high and with a b-side gimme i don't feel so connected really because it was a tracks that eustace and his other buddies already had laid out. And I didn't really feel like, you know, involving. But after that, well, the first real Whirlpool jam for me that I took a big part in directing, let's say, or producing was... a remix we did for a band called Milch. Milk. Gott is doof. Gott is stupid. And... At that point, as a production team or as music heads, we were very much in tune with each other and our main hero was DJ Pierre. Kerry Chandler also, but mainly DJ Pierre's wild pitch mixes. We called it shocking. There was also a track called Northern Lights by Crispin Glover. Not the actor, but I think he's actually from the UK. That was kind of, you know... Justus once said that "Disco and house" to put it in a nutshell, to him it's desire. You know, the feeling of desire that kind of... pushes you or rather pulls you. And I think the wild pitch mixes with all the strings and the feeling of getting taken higher. higher and most of the time having vocals telling you exactly that that that was what I would say was our main inspiration let's talk about the hit what was what were the circumstances behind making it and did you kind of know that you had something when it was finished From disco to disco. From disco to disco. Well, yeah, I take a longer expression. We had done a first album on Ladomad called Brian De Palma, which is, I would say, artistically probably our best. And that had gotten really good reviews. And so we got signed to Motor Music, a major label. It was a kind of licensing thing. Anyway, we had much more budget. excessive but a good budget and we had a nice little basement studio in cologne by that time and we had done a song called uh the cold song which was a vocal song like a like a pop like a pop song really um that Eric had written lyrics for and done the melody and he was doing lead vocals and we were doing background vocals. That was just part of our sense of experimenting and just doing what we feel like. But when we had done that, we felt that we should go to a different studio to record the vocals properly. We couldn't do that at our basement. So we were looking for a studio in Cologne to make it uncomplicated. And first we asked the legendary Connie Plank. studios but they were busy and they said well you know try the can studio that just also close to cologne which is the studio of the legendary crowd rock band can and they were they were open for business so So we went there and as soon as we had visited that place and set up our stuff, we decided that we want to mix the whole record all over there, mix all the songs there. It's a fantastic place. Now it's a museum. Now they took it down and built it up somewhere else as a museum. But it's like a time capsule of hippie-dom. It used to be like a village movie theater. And it's... all been high ceiling and all decked out with hippie carpets and Holger Juckai's collection of exotic percussion. and loads of synthesizers and stuff. So anyway, we went there, we recorded, we mixed all our stuff again and added more vocals here and there. And then we had done, then we were finished with the album and we had two days more. So we decided to do... to do one more thing that we developed right here on the spot. And Eric had to go to town to DJ. So he used to send me, stayed at the studio and created a loop, like a disco loop. you know, with some samples which I'm not going to mention. So later that night, Eric came back. and we started to play the Fender Rhodes to that and so we got that very typical melody thing that sounds like an elevator. Well, I think the thing is I keep going into elevators when the door opens they play the first two notes of "From Disco to Disco". So I added, I played the bass, it's a live bass, it's a live, like an octave bass, you know, dum dum dum dum, but I'm not so good at playing bass, so I had to record it in two tracks. One just going boom boom boom, the other, oh, humper. And I think then we went to sleep and the next day we decided that We wanted to see if we can create some vocal shit that we could sample ourselves and then put it wild pitch style, loop it up and put it on top of a track of that instrumental and so this way create the last track for the album. and well it was the last day of recording really and Eric had because Eric is a wise man he had a bottle of champagne in the fridge you know to celebrate the finish finishing of our album and remember that he said we got a we got a fat album under our belt let's you know let's drink champagne and and record those vocals so uh we were uh we were in a very festive mood yeah you know we wanted we wanted you know wasted we were just really you know it was just perfect and we joined around the microphone and everybody got you know, some percussion stuff and you know, there's all these little things like I'm saying, put that chair away because it was in the way and then I had this thing, it was like a shaman stick, you know, like a big stick with rattling stuff on it and from the exotic percussion. collection of Holger Zuckai and on the recording it sounds like a glass with ice you know like a cocktail glass but it's actually a shaman stick Somebody else sing it. It's easy. Yeah. From the school. It's all right. I think that's even a practice thing. I think we have to think of something else first. Yes, you know the track comes on and Eric is kind of like trying to settle in also with the key or the range and just from the top of his mind he goes from disco to disco. Before we had started, we had already put in the girl sample, the girl choir that goes "love" and you know, no matter how off key Eric was going or no matter what he was trying, they would stoically go. do their laugh thing and that made us laugh tremendously yeah and so so this was the way we recorded it and and then we decided when we were listening back to it we decided that it's just much more interesting and much more fun to to leave it as a sort of documentary you know like the making of like the making of and the work is the same thing. And well, then, well, we loved it. Everybody from our friends loved it. But the record company was very skeptical. They didn't want to release it. And we were really like, come on, you know, just put it on the album. It will not hurt anybody and it will not ruin our... Nimbus or like our integrity or anything so so they agreed to put it on the album and the rest is history you know that because it was part of the Polygram group they sent it to all their sister companies in the other territories and in In Italy they had a listening session on that album and the single, it never came out in Germany as a single before it had international success. In Germany it was all about the Cold Song. The Cold Song which reached number 80 in the German top 100. And during that Italian Milano listening session, there was this guy who said, this is the hit. This is it. You know, this we have to do. And he said, they will make it a hit. We never heard about that the first time. This was the story I got later on when we went there to Italy. But for me, it was a winter evening, like January or so, 97, I think. And we had done a tour before that had, you know, that... The band was not in such a tremendous shape. We had done a tour for that album that had been good, but by that time we were a few years together and we were all three very strong characters. It's not easy. It's like three on the cover of our first album. is a painting of us. It's a car with a really big steering wheel with three people steering at the same time. A very good metaphor and you know it doesn't work forever. So we were in a... Like everybody was doing his own thing by that time in a way. I had become a father. You know, Justus was doing a lot with Kai Althoff by that time with Subtle Tease. And Eric was doing his solo album Per Dance Floor. So in January 1997, Charlotte Goldermann from the label called me and said that we are number 40 or so in the Italian charts. But it looks very good. And then every week we got one, we jumped 10 places higher. And then she called me and said, you know, you're number one in Italy. You're fucking number one in the Italian charts. And by that time I was 33. I had been, you know, a very serious music magazine editor. I was not a kid, you know, and I had a kid. And I just thought that's the most hilarious thing that, you know, when I was 18 at Lake Constance, I was dreaming of being number one pop star. In Italy? Yeah. You know, I really take it as a very nice surprise that life threw at me to be able to tell my grandkids that granddaddy was number... You know, it's the... I don't have a university degree. That's the best thing in terms of measurability also that I achieved. Did you try to follow it up? Because you said that everyone was sort of on a different path at that moment that you heard this news and I wonder if you got back together and were like, okay. I guess we can try to do something. Well, at that point I would say that everybody had different ideas of how to deal with the fact that we were now really big. Also, it changed a lot when we started doing videos. the image of the group became you know before we were we were dj producers and i always what what what i loved very much about djing all my life was the idea that you are hunched back in the dark corner and it's not about your what what what you look like or what you do or you know what you what what What's there to look at? The show is on the dance floor and you are just the projector or something. And I always love the anonymity of a US underground house, 12 inches, with some written facts, shoutouts, mixed names. project names changing all the time and that changed a lot when we started doing videos and and it totally changed when we were had a hit and obviously Eric is a very let's say flamboyant and extrovert He knows how to dress and he knows how to freak out makeup artists and you know it's great. In Italy I was so thankful for Eric you know to be able to hide. behind him. You know, it's funny because Justus and me, we... I think a lot of people think we are brothers. We have both glasses, you know, both like intellectual white guys and... And then, so a lot of misconception also, you know, I think there was... I think... A lot of people thought that, you know, Justus and me, we are like the brains and Eric is like our singer. So nobody realized that Justus and me, we are also no brains or Eric is a brain, you know, that kind of... Well, yeah, we never managed to make a follow-up. In Italy, they were asking for it very... Very much of course, but we only had a loosely similar track called "If Time Were a Beat" and that sank. that round with no trace and that was it in Italy. We never toured there, we only did television there. But it was worth it. It was some of the weirdest experiences doing Italian music television shows. And we got great offers to play like tourist discos. But we had realized that it would always be like five minute shows. Then we had to go to do our next album like the follow up album so basically we went straight from Italy to Jamaica and that was also a very difficult situation I just talked to Justus today in the morning about that that we should have gone there after production for holidays and not to make production there because one thing is to make house music for Germany or you know for for the people who... you know, we didn't go there to make reggae. That was not at all our idea. We just wanted to go away. And it was a fantastic place. It was like paradise. But then, in a way, I think we... It was all about getting psycho in paradise. Like Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness. No, no, not it. It was... No, but you know, I think we should not have worked there. You ended up with an album, though. Yeah, well, let's maybe shorten that point. We did that album for Motor, then we put the group on Ice, then we got asked by Warner Brothers to do another album, which was the last album we did together, and that we recorded purely at the Cannes studio again. And I think that is an underrated album. It's a... but it's an album that almost... it's like a late Beatles album. It has mostly solo productions in a way. We were not running very single albums. synchronized in a way at that time. Where were you? I mean, sorry, when was this? That was in 2000. In 1999 I had released my first solo album on LADOMAD. Also Justus by the time I think had done his first solo record and that was... well at that point we put Whirlpool Productions on ice for a long time. And that was really when, after that, Justus really started to become a solo, a big solo artist. And I started to write books. Your first book was published in 2002, correct? Yeah. Reading about it, I haven't read it. I don't know if it's been translated into English or not. But in reading about it, it seems like it's... almost what a more sober version of what Berlin calling the movie was in a way like the like talking about DJ culture and sort of the some of the ridiculousness that can happen I haven't read the book so tell me I'm completely well yeah it's it's not a lot about drugs That's the main difference I would say to Berlin Calling because that's just not me. That's not my perspective. I'm no saint or anything. But then, you know, my stories are not really so much about... getting fucked up myself but a lot about other shit gets fucked up. Well, that has numerous reasons. One thing is as a music writer all this, by that point I had done loads and loads of DJ trips, not only in Germany but also with Goethe Institute, they had sent me, but by now they send me all around the globe. And by that time I had already been to South Africa and Brazil and places like that. But my main thing was, until today, taking the train in Germany and traveling to play in some German city. And it always felt like doing empirical research in a way about... DJ situations, you know, about DJ box situations, about bar situations, about toilet situations, about request situations, about groupie situations, about travel, you know, all this kind of things. And I was very aware that this is not just happening to me. This is happening to all of us. So, but I'm, you know, I had been asked to write the book. So I thought, well, now I'm in the nice position to write it up. So especially with the first book or with big parts of the first book, I thought I'm doing this for all the DJs. The other thing is that I would say most of the gigs I played in my life I did quite well because otherwise I would not sit here and still be playing and talking about it. But let's assume I'm a great DJ or I'm a good DJ. Let's assume it. It's not very decent to write about that. It's really stupid to write about how great you played and how much people loved it. That's not just a story. It's a great state and everybody who's there in that moment feels it, but it's not really something I know how to write about. So I specialized on things that went wrong. you know, or the annoying aspects like requests, you know, people take requests or wanting to rap or nobody's bringing you a drink you have to go to the bar and the bar is crowded and the records needle skips or it hangs you mentioned the Goethe Institute by 2000 by the time you wrote your first book it already sent you a couple places how did you get involved with them and what do you do for them just explain to people who don't know Well, that started, that really started when I was still at Spex Magazine because, as I mentioned earlier, I had been pushing techno, house music, electronic music, also electronic music from Germany by that time. a lot in Specs Magazine. So there was one director, one, you don't say director, well, the head of the institute in Brasilia, not the country. about the city of the capital of Brazil, Brasilia. He had been to Berlin like in 92 or 91. And he had been to the Tresor Club and he had been to the Love Parade. And he was, by that time, he was maybe like early 40s, in his early 40s. And he had realized the cultural importance and significance of... that culture. So he had decided to bring over techno from Germany to Brazil. Since Goethe-Institut is not considering itself something like a tour agency or a concert agency, usually they don't just send you on tour, on DJ tour or anything. It's always about workshops or at least lectures or anything but most of the time it's all about doing something with local artists so it's great it's if you if you if you are into that and i'm well into that it's it's one of the best thing that you as a traveling musician, you can do. I'm still getting asked, like I would say, like once a year, I make, once or twice a year, I make an expedition somewhere. You wrote a book in 06, sort of charting some of those travels. Was that all about the Goethe-Institut sort of things that you were doing? Or was that something different? Well, that was the center of the book. That was my second book called Disco Ramallah, the capital of the Palestine autonomy areas. That was probably one of my strangest DJs. expeditions going to the Middle East and playing in Bethlehem. Originally I was supposed to play at Gaza City but that got cancelled on a very short note because Israel tanks were facing the location. It was very weird also because I was two weeks in the area playing in Bethlehem, almost playing in Ramallah, that got cancelled four hours before. playing in Beirut, Cairo and Alexandria. I remember especially playing in Cairo, the smell of this year's revolution was in the air, I swear to God. It was in the air, I was seeing all the people already, I was... I was totally sensing, not just sensing, hearing, talking to everybody. I saw the new modern Egypt that's hopefully breaking out much clearer now, seven years ago. Where were you playing when you went to these places? I mean, you said you were going to play in Bethlehem. Was that in a nightclub or was it a special thing set up? No, there is no nightclubs in Bethlehem. It was a cultural center backed by the European Protestant Church. Not a cultural center. It was more like a study center also, you know, where you... It was called Bethlehem International Center. And they had like a concert room. And there they had set up... The thing is, we couldn't rent... Beforehand, we couldn't rent turntables in... a West Bank. So I had brought a whole flight case with two turntables, mixer and two CD players and it looked just like a coffin. And I also called it a coffin and I felt like Django. You know the movie Django? The guy who has a coffin with a machine gun and I had the coffin with the turntables. And I was traveling with it through the whole Middle East, most of the times in an open Jeep. It was fantastic. It was a fantastic trip, you know, crossing Israel army checkpoints with a DJ coffin. Musicians all over the world are just so lovely. I love them so much. The way they... are like kids, as soon as they meet they start to play together. And I would say the Palestinian musicians, they really were not into talking about their problems, only about their musical problems. Only about how they cannot get the mix in sync or tight and stuff like that. You know, I have friends from both sides and it really it's really and and I know a lot of DJ friends I have have friends on we all know how Stupid that is, you know, I play I was playing in Beirut Beirut is is a really cool city you know there is a great dj scene there's a great party scene and i i i swear there's a lot of djs in beirut and tel aviv playing exactly the same records but the idea that beirut and tel aviv djs could go back and forth is so unthinkable um And that was the only thing I was... When I was traveling there, I was like, please people, why can't you just put your focus on tourism instead of religion? And you would all be so much better off. Everybody would be so much better off. And there was this guy in Ramallah. He was setting up the sound system for the workshop. And he told me that he was older, he was maybe like in his 40s. And he used to be a DJ in the 70s and the 80s and he told me how he would go to Tel Aviv all the time to buy records. And now he hasn't been out of Ramallah for six years and he says to go to Tel Aviv is a dream. And I thought, why got it worse? Why couldn't he just keep on going there and buy records? It would be good to see this wall fall also in the future at one point in the same positive way as it happened in Germany. I wanted to ask you a little bit about Cologne. You made it your home. How has it changed over the years? You've been there for a long, long time. I feel like it used to be a huge center in the music industry. I was telling that actually yesterday to a cab driver. It was a hip-hop cab driver here in Berlin. And we started talking and I told him that I'm from Cologne. I think Cologne is the one German city that had the biggest brain drain because of Berlin. I think Hamburg and Munich, which, well, Cologne is the fourth biggest city. Berlin is the biggest. Hamburg and Munich are in between. Hamburg and Munich also a lot of talent left the city for Berlin but not as heavily. Cologne lost, well when I moved to Cologne, Cologne was a globally important art city, art buyers, the art Cologne was really important. the most important German art galleries were all in Cologne and that changed a lot. There is still a... quality art scene in Cologne, especially on the institutions because the museum Ludwig cannot leave Cologne, it's the Cologne Art Museum. How can they do it? So all these kinds of institutions, they still keeping up the Cologne art massive, but it's changed so much then, a lot of fairs. Like, um... For our world, first of all, the Popcom moved to Berlin without ever making the same impact here in Berlin that it made in Cologne. At its height, the Popcom was up there with New Music Seminar and Medium. big important market meeting way too big for my taste and I think that popcorn the late cologne popcorn was terrible because it really blocked the city out. But then Cologne was too small, Berlin maybe too big. A lot of people make a big point of staying in Cologne, of course. A lot of time that people come to Cologne, like, you know, DJs or guests, they meet me and they say, well, at least you are still in Cologne. And I feel so like the last idiot who didn't manage to get out. Well, my daughter is 16 now. She will be finished with school in two years and she doesn't want to stay in Cologne. I had two great job offers for Berlin in the last six years. The first one I would have taken but couldn't take because she was too small. The second one I didn't want to take but she wanted me to take it so we would go to Berlin. So now I, because in a way looking back at all these things I did, I think I was quite lucky. I can be quite happy about my life. I never really had to do a lot of shit jobs after the age of 20 to make a living. I really love what I do and I really love the spectrum, writing, producing, performing. consulting, being a father, you know, that's... Yeah, so, because I believe in luck, I believe that the next job offer I get in Berlin will suit me and my daughter and my girlfriend also, maybe. She will get a job first in Berlin and then... I don't know. You'll see where it takes you. I really see. I never really decided to go anywhere except Hamburg. That was a decision that I wanted really to go there. after that I just you know waited what got thrown at me I used to hear you talk about the end It sometimes seems to me as if I haven't got a friend Dreams alone can take me so far I know where you are.
