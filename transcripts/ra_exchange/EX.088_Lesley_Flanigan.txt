oh Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artist labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. The first in our series of exchanges from the 2012 CommuniKey Festival is with Leslie Flanagan. Feedback is what makes Flanagan tick. The New York City-based artist layers feedback alongside her own voice via her self-made speakers in her powerful performances. As she tells it, she hopes to take the listener from noise to sound to music and then back again. We talk about how she came to her unique way of making music and in the process reveal why she thinks it's okay as an audience member to fall asleep when she's performing. Welcome to the first of the live RA exchanges at Communikey. I'm joined by Leslie Flanagan. Thank you for taking the time out. Thank you. I guess I wanted to start with, you didn't have to travel very far for this because you're visiting, doing a visiting thing in Denver? Oh, no, no. Or was that earlier this year? I did have to travel, not as far as you, but I did have to travel from New York. But Communique and the University of Colorado in Boulder, I guess for the last three or four years, have done a joint visiting artist and, like, visiting artist for the university and then performing artist for the festival. a joint invitation. So I've been kind of working part-time at the university and then part-time with Communikey. What have you been working on at the university? Oh, working on, yeah, okay. Well, let's see, lectures, studio visits. I did a workshop with the students where I taught them all how to build a little amplifier with, basically I told them how to make feedback using a contact mic and a speaker, you know, that's my specialty. But it was really great because they're visual arts students and a lot of them haven't worked with electronics. My background originally was in visual art and sculpture primarily. So it's real exciting for me to be able to kind of introduce to their visual conceptual brains how electronic sound is something that can be touched and played with. as much as any sculptural material. So they're not working with sound so much in what they're doing? No, but they're interested in it. I mean, in general, there's an interest in electronics, right? That's the whole DIY thing, circuit bending thing right now. People want to take things apart and touch that which they... cannot see in their laptops and other electronic music devices. Were there people doing that when you were starting out that you knew of specifically? I'm sure there were people doing it, but did it feel as prevalent as it does now to you? I mean, well, there are definitely people doing it. Probably my first introduction to it was the Bent Festival, which happens in New York. Actually, at the time that I got involved in that, it was also happening in Minneapolis, in Los Angeles. But it was started in New York by the guys who run the tank. I think just once I started actually playing with these speaker feedback, I was basically circuit bending my own work. I found myself in New York, obviously, kind of finding these little scenes, these little pockets of noisemakers. And then a lot of people obviously start introducing me to the work of other people. But yeah, I really came to it on my own, like really naive. How did you find yourself at Bent Festival? You were doing the sculpture thing. Well, I saw a call for works. But no, I'm actually, you know, I'm really good friends with, well, let me think this through a bit. It kind of all goes back to grad school, because in graduate school is when I first started working with electronics. And I had no intention of building musical instruments and doing musical performances with feedback or anything like that. I was learning about technology and about building my own circuits and how to integrate laptop software with, you know, hardware, electronics. And I was in this kind of techie program. And when I first started then building these instruments, and of course, I always laugh about this. When left to my own devices, I will go build something. So when I first was playing with these little amplifiers and speakers, I was like, oh my god, I have to build an instrument. And there were other guys in the program with me who were involved in music and Tristan Parrich and Kunal Gupta who were both involved in loud objects. And then there was Zach Layton who was involved at Issue Project Room. and Luc Dubois, who's involved in, he's one of the co-authors of Jitter, and is always involved in a lot of live video synthesis. And not my year, but the year after me was Mike Rosenthal, who is the founding director of The Tank, and he brought in all of the Tiptoons guys. I think shortly after that came Jeremiah Johnson. I mean, it was just somehow like this community was sort of all coming into this grad program and using it as an excuse to mess around with things. Why was that grad program such a flashpoint? Like, was there a professor there that seemed to draw people to it? No, it's in New York. It's way overpriced. But if you get a scholarship, then that helps. It's just a place where, you know, unlike going to get your MFA or something like that, you're really like, you have to deal with a certain academia, like dogma, like this is how things are done. And this whole program was very much about throwing all that up in the air. And, you know, the program. reinvents itself every year depending on what's going on. I think actually when I was in the program, the hot exploration was in cellular technology, which I didn't care about. But that was what a lot of people were playing around with. And I think Nokia gave us a bunch of cell phones. And they were like, here, go at it. And a lot of big things came out of that. Like, you know, Dodgeball was invented at ITP, or at least the founder of Dodgeball was at, or, yeah, Dodgeball and Foursquare. He went on to do Foursquare. I don't know, there are, like, other things, too. But because of all that, I'm totally, like, becoming the spokesmodel for ITP, which I don't mean to be. I have my problems with this school too. But it was a playground for playing with technology. And you could come from any background. You could be a dancer or a musician or an artist. You could also be a computer programmer or a mathematician or a biologist or a writer. I mean, you could just come from any background. And the one thing we all have in common is we're all using computers. We're all using technology. When the program was founded in 1979, that technology was telecommunications, which is why it's called the Interactive Telecommunications Program. to us now. But anyways, yeah, so how do we all end up there? You know, we sort of all knew someone who had been in the program and done some cool stuff and we were all trying to get out of whatever lives we were in and trying to, you know, have a new start or just be. inspired again and it was a good place to go for a couple years and just throw all the cards up in the air. You said cellular technology was the thing, but you didn't care about it very much. Did you realize? Phones are plastic and unattractive to me. Speakers are cool. They're real. I never like technology. I mean, the "technology" I work with is like old technology. It's analog technology. But it still has to look good. Well, yeah. I am an artist. Well, and I mean, with that, ultimately with my work... So, I mean, I stumbled upon my work by exploring technology. Did you have any idea of where you wanted to go when you went to the program? No, no, not at all. I really had no idea. So what was the breakthrough? What was the moment where you're like, I'm onto something here with what you were doing or you found something? I don't know if there's exactly a, well, okay. There was a breakthrough moment when I first was playing with the little contact mics on the speakers and I spent probably a good like. oh, I don't know, five hours just filming myself playing with this circuit and driving everyone else in the room crazy. And then within that week, I built the first instrument. And I just loved it. I loved the material of it all. And it brought me back to sculpture because I had been out of sculpture for a good four or five years at that point. And it also brought me back to voice in a way. I mean, it brought me back to music. It was finally the sound that got me really excited. Like a little bit of a detour here. I always loved electronic music and did my own electronic music, but I always found myself really frustrated with the sounds I was working with. I wanted to get real, dirty, dark electronic sound. and all of these samples and keyboards and like anything that I had other than maybe playing with like a Nord lead or something like that like which I never had the money to buy so I didn't buy it I just played with it in the Guitar Center or something like that but yeah like I just could never quite get the sounds that I really wanted I wanted them to sound real And suddenly these little feedback noises, and this was like maybe a good year or two after I was really caring about finding those sounds, they just kind of emerged. And feedback is not anything new or that special. But working with these little speakers and little contact mics and my ability to use my hands to really shape that sound and control that sound to some degree was a visceral experience. And it was tangible and it was visible. And that was incredibly inspirational for me. And so while I didn't know exactly at that time, I wasn't like, ah, that's it. I'm going to become a speaker feedback performer. That was not what went through my brain. I just wanted to get as many sounds as I could. And once you start collecting those sounds, it's like anything that you get involved in. You know, you just... I just kind of ran with it. And that's perfect because it's because I had no expectations and because I wasn't trying to be anyone other than who I was at that time. that I think these things just were very honest. A very honest connection happened. And things have changed. When I was first playing with these things, I did have a lot more technology. I actually did have a laptop, and I was using Max MSP, and I had my own sampler that I had built, and I was controlling the speakers on and off with the computer. I just had all these little fancy technology performance things. And then I just started stripping them away because what really became meaningful to me was that connection between one microphone, one speaker, my hands, at most a loop pedal and a mixer. I wanted the laptop off the stage altogether to really make that very clear. make it very clear to my audience as well as to me and just the overall concept that I cared about is that electronic sound is first and foremost a physical thing. So you thought about your audience when you were thinking about paring things down like that? Yeah, and I think a lot of that comes from my art background. You're taught in art school to care about context and that every little detail in the visual space is going to affect how people perceive the work. I've been very, I try my best to really attend to those details. And not in a spectacle way, not in a way to create anything that isn't honest. It's just, I'm very excited about the ideas behind my work. And I think that... I don't want a heady performance, but it's so great when you're left just thinking about the performance beyond just what you felt and enjoyed in the moment, I think. Just to go back a little bit, can you describe, for people who may not know, a speaker, contact mic, what this actually looks like and what it actually is? Well, I like to work with raw speaker cons, and I take them out of pre-existing devices. That's kind of a meaningful thing for me, personally, is that I like to use found speakers. as opposed to ordering a bunch of the same kind of speaker. And a contact mic is a piezo disc, and the best way to describe it, it's a thin little metal disc that one might use to amplify an acoustic instrument. So like if you have an acoustic guitar, you can buy these contact mics, which allow you to press them on the body of the guitar, and the guitar vibrates like that actually. gets picked up by this thin little microphone disc. So the way my instruments work is I have a raw speaker cone, and it's embedded in a wooden box that I build. And then I have a contact mic that hovers by way of a thin wire over the top of the speaker. that wire then leads it down into the amplifier that I've also built, which is connected to the speaker. So inherently I turn it on and a feedback loop occurs. And it's a physical feedback loop, right? So it's not just about the, you know, it has to do with the position of the contact. mic in relation to the speaker but also my hands actually on the wire and moving it around or on the box like the whole system is very much alive with feedback and um but it's there's you know this is a they're nine volt batteries that are powering it so there's there's a certain amount of control that i have it's not gonna how much control At this point, a remarkable amount of control. Now that doesn't mean that I know exactly when I turn it on what the sound will be, exactly what pitch it will be. But I know the general range of sounds that come out of each speaker instrument that I have. I know which ones are low. I know which ones have high squeals. I know which ones are soft. I know which ones are loud. I know which ones are my noisemakers. which ones I can always rely on to give me the same tone no matter what, for some reason that is unknown to me. And so I've got these kind of established relationships with each of these noise. boxes, these sound makers. And I know if I'm not getting quite the sound that I want initially out of one speaker, if I kind of shift the box around or move the contact mic, kind of press on it a bit, at some point I'll get the sound that I want out of it. So all of my performances have this kind of, you know, this moment of actually building the tone that I want. And then when I'm happy with that, then going in and using another microphone, my vocal microphone, which is in a loop pedal, to start sampling those sounds. And that's when things start to patternize and really become more of a musical experience. So I really like to think of it as this noise to sound to music kind of path that my performances follow. And then, of course, music back to noise, back to sound, back to noise, back to music, kind of jumping between those. kind of aesthetic qualities. So the first 10 minutes of a performance is kind of you feeling out everything. Oh, not even 10 minutes. I mean, it can be just, you know, a couple seconds depending on what I want to do. You know, when I think about a performance, and I'm getting better at this, you know, this is a process. Like when I look at older performances of mine, I sometimes just cringe. Because I'm like, oh, Leslie, why didn't you just chill out there and let that moment last longer? And I get all nervous and start moving things around, and it's just like, stop. Have you gotten more patient over the years? I think so. If I'm comfortable, I'm more patient. I'm patient if I get uncomfortable for any reason. I'm very sensitive to my surroundings. But I do think I've gotten more aware of how I work and I know when to step back and listen. As far as my own development as an artist, I've found myself becoming much more interested in what's possible with even less. Why do you think that is? A lot of people would be like, what can I add to this to make it bells and whistles? you've gone the other way? I mean, it's a combination of things. I mean, there's everything to just being kind of mesmerized by performances or by works of, you know, people like... Phil Niblock or, um, Morton Feldman and just seeing like, wow, like these people have really, like they've done these really long pieces and they're, they're gorgeous. And I might even fall asleep during them, but what does that mean that I fall asleep and I wake up and I'm happy? I don't know. You know, it's, I think it's just kind of an interest in how long you can really like listen. And that, that's something else too. Like when you really allow yourself time to just, you almost, it's like an out-of-body experience. You leave your body and just fall into listening to a sound. It's just a very interesting experience. So you wouldn't mind if someone fell asleep during your performance? No, as long as they were happy about it. I don't want anyone to be bored in the bad way. But bored in the sleepy, this is beautiful way, could be very nice. But I don't know if boredom is the right word to use with that. That has a negative connotation. But I just know for myself, I have definitely fallen asleep during performances and have not considered that to be a bad thing. And in fact, that was a very... freeing moment to realize that's not bad. Not bad at all. I like falling asleep, kind of, at performances and then waking up and just being confused. Yeah, that moment. a little bit of drool coming out. But so there's that aspect of it, just kind of being curious about it. And then there's also just, I think it pushes me as an artist. Like I'm interested in, you know, the best work I've probably made or best experiences for me as an artist is when I have certain limitations. have to dig out of those limitations something really awesome. And so I am the type of artist who will kind of set up boundaries for myself within which to work. And if I'm given just too many options, I'll get lost. And if I get lost, the music gets lost, the audience gets lost, the experience gets lost. And it might not necessarily be bad, but... it's not as rich as it could be. And, you know, we talked about the fact that I was in Berlin earlier in the fall, and I brought just one speaker over there with me. And part of that was, do I really want to deal with shipping over to Berlin? No. And part of it was also like, well, this will be interesting. Let's see what kind of performances I can make happen with one speaker. What happened? It was great. I really got to know this speaker intimately. me and my relationships with speakers I'm gonna be worried about my online presence but but it really yeah I think I think there's also something really beautiful about seeing a stage. We're so used to seeing an artist with a laptop on stage, and that's simple, right? But we all know that a laptop, we can't see what's going on. It's not simple. There's tons of software. Who knows what that software is? There's just a lot still going on. But when you see me on stage with one speaker and one microphone, that's it. And then to really make a lot happen out of just those simple tools is just... I mean, I think it's pretty awesome. And I think it must be really compelling as an audience member to watch that as well as it is for me to dig into it all. They're also kind of like, you can do it. Well, it's not that. difficult. I mean, a lot of noises come out of these things, I think. And I did bring a speaker that has a pretty wide range. What was Berlin like? You live in New York. Yes, I do live in New York. It's quite different cities in terms of the way that they feel, I think. Yeah, yes and no. I mean, Berlin is equally as International as New York, that's for sure. Like it was, you know, I thought I was going to learn German going over there. I was there for two months, so not that long. But I was like, yeah, I'm going to learn German and converse with everyone. No, English. Everyone spoke English. It was not a problem. And it's a beautiful city. I felt incredibly relaxed there. And you can go to all these shows and they're all free. And everyone's an artist, or at least it seemed that way. And a lot of people complained about being an artist and not being able to make money in Berlin, and yet they live in these beautiful apartments because it doesn't cost that much to live there. Although I know the price has gone up quite a bit, and Berlin now is not quite maybe the crazy new artist territory it was 10 years ago or something like that. A big difference between people in, say, Berlin and people in maybe New York is that, again, it goes back to this kind of relaxed thing. I think everyone was very relaxed in Berlin, and in New York, you just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, because you have to. You have to pay to live there, and you have to kind of fight for your right to be there. But I like that energy, and I think, you know, earlier you were like, what do you like better? My first answer was New York. But that's not really true, because I really loved being in Berlin. I think it just depends on what you need, and a big reason why I went to Berlin was to work on new recordings, on a new album, and I felt like I needed to get out of... the space that I live in and the stars kind of aligned to make this trip possible and I had some other shows in Europe and it just, like I really got to pluck myself out of my comfort zone in New York to find a new comfort zone in Berlin. What were you trying to do with the new album? It hasn't been released yet. No, it hasn't. In a way, there's like two of them. I have to figure out what I'm doing with them. Because I actually found myself on two different paths. There's one where I was really pushing the voice combination with... the speaker feedback and just how far I could really, really push that sound. And in a way it's probably more of a sequel to amplifications, the album, um, that I came out with, um, a few years ago. like really pushing those ideas. And then the other side of this was really pushing the noise aspect, like really just these speakers and their sounds and, you know, everything from like really digging into the drone aspects and then also just... really digging into the noise. They make a lot of noise. And letting that become a musical experience also. And I don't know, they might not even be really separate. This is where, again, me as sensitive artist kind of gets in the way. Or I wouldn't say gets in the way, I'm just thinking about these things because it's like... well, what does it mean that I have these two different paths or that I even see them as two different paths? And, you know, the way I was listening to that when I was listening to these tracks and these recordings and that experience when I was in Berlin versus how I listen back to it now, like my head is cleared a bit so I can really hear what it's maybe meant to be. And yeah, anyways, I guess I allow myself a little bit of time to feel what's right for them. In the amplifications, there's... one track that had lyrics like discernible lyrics actually there's two two with discernible discernible lyrics um does the new stuff the voice stuff that you're working on also have some of them do and some of them don't how do you i mean i find it interesting you know you're using your voice so much as just an instrument and then there are these songs where they have lyrics that you can make out and then there's this next level of meaning yeah you know how do you how do you write lyrically well does that happen for you the way it happens is how it probably happens for a lot of a lot of artists i'm sure you've had this experience where you know you're you're just kind of singing and i don't know somehow words just kind of happen and why I don't know certain vowel sounds and consonant sounds just sort of stick together and something in your body starts making a word out of them you know it's like language just emerging and happening And sometimes it just, it clicks and it just means something. And sometimes like I'll listen back and I'll be like, oh, I really like this like line that I had no idea I had sung. what does that mean? And it kind of inspires other lyrics or, you know, actually for the tracks that were on amplifications, I mean, those genuinely really just kind of came out. I maybe coaxed them a little bit after the fact, but not too much. I assume, though, afterwards you were like, okay, I can live with that being said. Yeah, yeah. And those were very honest lyrics for me. And I guess the way that I kind of felt about it, you know, I don't think that music needs lyrics to have an emotive feeling. to mean something. And in fact, one of my favorite musical acts was Cocteau Twins. And when I listened to them in high school, I remember just, I'd make up my own lyrics. I doubt very much Elizabeth Frazier was saying anything that I thought she should be saying. And that was great. I don't know. There's a lot of freedom in that. Did you listen to a lot of 4AD stuff when you were... Yeah. Yes, I absolutely did. What were some other formative sort of musical influences on you? Well, formative? Well, Cocteau Twins, definitely. I love trip-hop. I'm trying to think. Old jazz music. Oh, my mom really played a lot of the Billie Holiday, Nina Simone type stuff. But I wouldn't even say, I mean, my kind of interest almost in that music was more just like the sound of the recording. And that definitely is something that I've enjoyed pushing a bit in some of my work and my performances and stuff like that. At what point, though, were you like, wow, the way that that recording sounds as opposed to, oh, that's a nice tune. I mean, I think there's a jump there when you become really into music, when you kind of get to the point where you're like, I'm really into the way that it was recorded as opposed to this sort of surface level. Are you talking about with my work or when listening? Yeah, with your own listening almost. Oh, I don't know. There's a few different ways I guess I could answer that. I mean, the first thing for me was when I was just kind of out of curiosity singing through the speakers that I had built. And of course, the sound was really crappy. But it made me think a lot about how any old recordings that, again, like old recordings, that old record player sound or something like that, when it's real and not just an effect that's put on to make it sound that way, you get this feeling of age and time and, again, like this tangible material that is the recording of sound. and a lot of that sound is just based on the technology of the time. The microphones they were using, the recording devices they were using, the speakers they were using. And so when you listen to a Billie Holiday song or something like that, it has this old kind of crackly sound. That's her with her speaker, with her microphone, with the recording technology. Nowadays we'd be trying to get rid of all of that stuff as much as possible to have the cleanest production sound. And so anyways, going back to then my work, when I started singing through these speakers and again, kind of a different sound of voice through different speakers, I think I just really loved accepting that like. duet of you know the that sound being this this old crackly sound but it's really just because of the speaker and I'm singing through I don't know if I answered your question at all do you think about I don't think I did I think I forgot the question I'm sorry. Do you think about how your music is going to sound 10 years from now? Do you think about its timelessness or where it sits? No, I don't. I think I might freak out if I thought about that. And I think a big part of my work is about it being present. My performances are present. If you come see a performance of mine, no two performances are exactly alike. It must be quite daunting when you're putting together an album then. I think about it differently. When I'm performing, I'm thinking about... You know, it's me performing with my voice, my speakers, my performance space, the room that I'm in, the audience that I'm with, and that's the moment that I'm shaping and that I'm working with. When I'm working with recording, then I'm dealing with the recording space, the fact that I have headphones on. What does it sound like, you know, coming just in two spaces very intimately right into my head. and then thinking about what that means to then give that recording space to an audience to listen to on their own. And when I first was recording, yeah, I think I had a little bit of concern about that baggage of like, well, you record an album and you tour that album and you better do those songs, do those pieces. And it took a bit for me to let go of that and just be okay. Like this is a project and it's very much about... I don't think anyone's going to demand that you play the hits or anything like that. No, no, and no one has. But I'm just telling you that I thought about it. Sure, sure. And that I had to come up with my own relationship to what that means. We talked a lot about the music. You went to school originally for sculpture. How did you end up going to school for sculpture? Well, you know, I've always sung and I've always been involved in music, but I think I've always had very much this, did I want to go to school to be a voice major? No, I really didn't want anyone telling me how to sing. I was interested in voice lessons because I liked the challenge of what I could physically make happen with my voice. But I was singing in a rock band. I didn't want to sing opera. I didn't really like opera. But I was interested in training with it. But what I did love was working with my hands and building. thought about going to school it just made more sense I guess I felt like I could be in an academic world with visual art and I could enjoy the kind of critique process and analyzing the critique process oh well no not then I enjoy it more now because now I know how to say I don't know I don't care but um at the time I felt really like stressed about it But I do like analyzing things. I do like thinking too hard about things. Hence the song title. But yeah, I think I just felt like I could do, as far as being a creative person, I could do more creative academic work in school as a sculptor than I could as a musician. I don't think I could have handled music theory classes and any instrumental classes or this is how you're supposed to sing and voice recitals. would have just gone mad. What medium were you working with sculpture-wise? Wood. I mean, that was what I was interested in. But I actually worked with found furniture. I would take furniture, and then I'd cut them up and rearrange them and kind of tell these stories. But again, I loved the history of where these furniture pieces came from. It's the same thing with the speaker cones. Exactly the same thing. I know that's a very me thing. Yeah, I like things with history. I like people with history too. People who tell me their history. I like that. So why wood, though? Wood seems to be one of your favorite materials. I think it was just, unlike metal, it was something warm, something alive, or at least once alive. I felt like it was something that I could cut, I could carve, I could drill into, I could get a lot of it. I think because I was interested in furniture. was just a natural, like most of them were wood. Other than I had this sofa that I cut in half for a project and I had to get a sawzall because there's actually a lot of metal inside of sofas. I just cut straight through it in foam and stuff. Yeah, I think for some reason wood just felt very human to me. And I didn't have to get too caught up in... additional process, meaning like with sculpture or with ceramics, for example, which I also really loved. But you, you know, there's the kiln and the firing and you fire it correctly and you slip properly. There's just a lot of technique that went into it. and obviously a lot of technique with like welding and stuff like that. But with wood, I guess I just didn't, I mean, I wasn't like doing fine cabinetry or anything. like that you know I just felt like I could just go in and cut and glue and drill could really get in there with my hands. Were you still doing were you still singing in a band or anything? Yeah I was. What kind of band was it? Oh we were trying to I don't want to say the name. It was small. It wasn't a big deal. But we were very interested. We loved electronic music, loved trip-hop, loved intelligent drum and bass kind of sound. And we also loved acoustic instruments, though. And so we were trying to do that hybrid, bring together electronic music with the live music. And so I remember always thinking, you need to have a live drummer. There's nothing like a live kick, nothing like a live bass. I did a lot of analyzing that, like really wanted to create this band that just fully synthesized electronic and acoustic sound. And so, you know, we would play with a laptop on stage, which had, like, we, you know, rendered out all these WAV files and Cubase, you know, all of our, you know, crazy IDM, like, drum tracks, and then with the live drummer playing over that. And I actually, I really enjoyed it all, but I think as a group... I think there's just too much emphasis on production and dealing with software and recording and finding just the right gear to make it happen. And I think I just found it exhausting on that level. It must have been exhilarating when you went to school and then you found that you could make it. Why do you think I got so excited over this little speaker feedback thing? I was like, oh my God, that was everything I ever wanted. And it's right here and I can do it on my own. And when I record with them, I can use really crappy microphones because I love the sound of crappy microphones and what that can do. And, you know, just letting the electronic, letting things be what they are. within reason. I guess the last thing I wanted to ask you about is you had this quote I read that you said you love your voice and you hate your voice at the same time. Can you explain that? Well, the first thing that comes to mind when I think of hating my voice is any time that I've had conflict with someone and I can hear, I can feel this tightening up in my throat and my voice kind of takes on a new sound and it hurts. And I hate it when it... cracks and I just I hate it when I sound weak or ignorant or something like that. And that's just speaking voice that I'm talking about. But the same thing happens when singing. For some reason you're just really tired and you have a lazy voice. Like, I know I can hit that note, but I can't hit it today without it screeching and just sounding awful, and it's just out of tune. And then there are those times where, you know, you walk into this beautiful reverberant space and you barely just have any sound coming out and it just fills the whole room and it's like, it's just perfect. Everything fits and it works. The same way that, you know, you just happen to be telling a story and you're very confident and articulate and there's no ums or, you know, whats and likes. It's actually just a very clear story. So voice, you know, is a very emotive tool and it's just... Whether you like it or not, it's going to give away what's going on inside. And so, yeah, I have loved and hated my voice for different reasons, both speaking and singing voice. And when I started working with these speakers and the way I talked about them was that they are each... They had character of voice. Because basically by letting these speakers just generate feedback, I was turning them into instruments themselves. They weren't amplifying any other instrument or any other voice. They were just themselves. And kind of using whatever history they have and whatever electricity I'm giving, and it's just spitting out what they sound like. And the fact that I loved so much all of the idiosyncrasies, like the things, you know, I loved the really warm, perfect tones, but then I also really loved the scratchy sounds. And when I started singing with them, it gave me liberty to also sing with scratchy tones and sing atonally and kind of make up my own pitch systems while I was performing. So it's just a very free experience. And not without a certain amount of diligence or thought in it all. Like I'm thinking, I'm very focused with it all, but also just feeling like the good, the bad, and the ugly once you start. layering it all together becomes a very beautiful and very real sound. And so in a lot of ways... These speaker feedback instruments really brought me back to voice and understanding my voice in a way that was very meaningful for me. Cool. Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate it. you you
