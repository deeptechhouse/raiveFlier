*Dog barking* Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Max Cooper. Cooper received a PhD in computational biology. but he ended up fusing his passion for science into his new life as a producer. He shot to prominence with a series of 12 inches on Trauman Fields, but he's recently come full circle with a project called Emergence. Cooper's fascinated by how small forces interact to create complex phenomena, and he took apart the... process of translating this into music with Holly Dicker in RA's London office. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Max Cooper is up next. Thank you. 🎵 So at its most basic, Your current project, Emergence, is about your three interests coming together, which are science, music and visual art. So I wanted to know really how these three evolved, starting mainly with, well, I guess my first question is, which one came first? I mean, it was science that came first. as far as I remember. Well, I think science was the first thing where I sort of started applying myself to it and finding it really interesting. Music and art was always there in the background. My mum was a music teacher. I went to Steiner School, which is a sort of more like arts-based curriculum for education, so I was very much from a very young age. always encouraged to do lots of different arts and express myself in that way. So... And music was always there in the background. Every day I'd come home and in the background my mum would be teaching piano, so that was always just going on. I guess subconsciously, science and, sorry, the music and the art side was there, but the science thing was, I guess I started finding interesting books that I would get lost in and thinking these ideas were really interesting. And just, you know, it was something that I thought... I'd probably, you know, do as a job, which I sort of then pursued throughout school and, you know, as that went on. And are we talking about science fiction books or sort of academic textbooks? No, no, it was more like popular science, you know, books written by researchers. So, you know, physics and math books and some, you know, philosophy stuff and that just... interesting, unusual ideas and were things that grabbed me. Were you a bit of a nerdy, nerdy child? Not really, no. I still was very much into like normal laddy stuff, you know, sports and being naughty, that sort of thing. Yeah, it wasn't, it wasn't totally like, I wasn't the traditional sort of nerd. But I think also my school was like quite small. They didn't really have that sort of... clique sort of dynamic between different because there's only like 20 people in each year so it really was like there wasn't enough people to have a sort of sort of these different groups and I found it quite strange when I went to a bigger school for like sixth year when there was suddenly this dynamic of all this you know these different sort of groups and you know politics school politics and that whole thing I never hadn't really ever experienced before and I hated it you know it was it was something that I didn't And it's still something I'm not into, you know. I just try and judge people by their own merits and try and ignore any of this politics of social situations. Human politics. Yeah. You mentioned your mum was a music teacher. What was your dad doing? I mean, where did the science, the love of science come from? Yeah, he's, well, he's retired now. He was an engineer. So he was very much like, he was quite a logical sort of old school dad type of. person you know that sort of but then my mum encouraged me she would give me these sort of these books and you know these things to read and they both encouraged that side. Did you learn the piano as well as a child? No no I should have done I wish I had you know I've had to sort of self-teach myself to play the piano very badly and just in the you know for years and years of writing music. I wish I'd learnt it. But again, going back to, I think, probably wouldn't have been the coolest thing, you know, when I was a kid, you know, I didn't want my mum teaching me piano. It was more like I wanted to go and, you know, do laddie. Yeah, exactly. Do. Do things that young boys do, they don't want to have their mum teaching them piano, even though it would have been a great thing now. Okay. So when did your music passion start to form? You started DJing, but when did that... So I guess there was definitely another family connection. My sister was really into, she's five years older, she was really into electronic music and clubs and she used to have all the old classic synth pop stuff on tapes and that was some of the early music that really grabbed me, the sort of Depeche Mode and New Order and that whole sort of golden era of the burst of electronic music. That always appealed to me. And when I started, I think my first gig, what I went out to, I think it was a Prodigy gig when I was about 16 or something. And then soon after that, I started going to clubs and that's when the obsession began, when I realised how much fun clubs were and electronic music in that environment. And then I started DJing very much. following the standard path of, you know, getting into clubs and then wanting to DJ and then, you know. What sort of records were you picking up at this time? Were you collecting records? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I went through all sorts of different phases. I pretty much tried DJing everything, almost. It was like, you know, there was sort of early stages of, like, trance music and stuff and rev, and then there was, like, you know, I got into the drum and bass, and then there was even a hip-hop phase where I was, like, playing hip-hop clubs, which... Seems unusual from what I do now, but I took influences from all those things and I still think they influence what I do now in my music. I very much have a love for a lot of different genres of music and I try to bring that together as much as I can. Well, I mean, you're still sort of including drum and bass into mixes that you're making now. Yeah. Was it... you were mixing all sorts of different things or were you going through phases? Like, did you have your drum and bass phase? Yeah, I definitely, I had phases. Yeah. But then I would also always, whatever phase I was in, I was always introducing other things. And one of the early problems I had DJing was that promoters would complain. I'd give them my mix tape or whatever, or later on my mix CD. And they would say, yeah, it was really good, but we don't know where to put you. Because I didn't just play one thing. And that made it difficult for people to... figure out how to put me into a lineup or that they would worry that I would play something really weird if they put me you know there was always that issue. They didn't know what to do with you and you're a bit volatile and they couldn't judge what you would play so. Yeah I mean that's the problem so much music is electronic music in particular so sort of boxed in you know like people are expected to play such a narrow range of sort of things just. sort of stifles creativity in a bit you know it's hard if you have to work within a small box if you make the box too big it becomes difficult you know but I certainly felt that I didn't want to pigeonhole myself in that way too much and it's the same with my productions I've made an effort you know there's been times in the past where I felt like I was being pigeonholed into a certain scene or something and that's when I've actually pushed back and just released something that's really different and everyone's like what's this shit it pisses people off but at the same time it pushes the the walls out a bit you know so my my creative space is yeah I can maintain enough so that I can actually experiment a bit and just so that I don't get too stuck you know I don't want to because it gets boring for me as much as anything else if I'm too stuck in one thing. So what sort of gigs did you end up playing in this early phase? All sorts. I did my time of dreadful gigs. I loved the whole idea of DJing. I found it really exciting. After the first few times I did it, I was like... well this is amazing i need to do more of this so at that point i was you know experimenting with the different things and you know making different mixtapes and giving to all the sorts of you know different places just to see where i you know i i would take all sorts of different types of gigs it was similar actually with when i started getting into music production as well i really tried my hand at a lot of different things and i was sort of trying to find I think it was almost like I was trying to find who I was. I feel a bit like with music that the best music comes whenever you're able to take a little bit of yourself and put it out there into the world. You're trying to extract yourself out musically and you can do that much better when you find who you are and find your musical identity. So there was always that process of... just experimenting, I suppose. Yeah. Speaking of experimenting, I wanted to just pick up quickly on the scratch DJ turntablism phase. How long were you in this phase for and what led you to sort of... That was actually my... one of my earlier obsessions. I've always worked hard. You know, that was one of the, something since I was a kid, you know, I was, I worked hard at science or whatever. I think I, at some point when I was really young, I sort of thought, I realised, okay, if I want to do something with my life. then I have to work hard at something. So it was like, okay, I need to find things that I'm happy to work hard at. So that was, you know, at one point when I started DJing, I was like, okay, I can work hard, you know, I want to do this. I can work hard. I can, you know, listen to music, but there's a limit to how many records I can buy. I can't have that much money. You know, it's not like I could spend you know hours and hours and hours practicing and learning something which would then aid my you know getting gigs and pushing that career thing forward so that was one of the early things which I set my mind to and then at some point later down the line I realized that actually I had to write music really to make a career out of it. I would need to focus on production. But yeah, the turntables and thing was fun though. I keep thinking I want to at some point bring it back in. The problem is it's so, all the classic hip hop samples are so sort of cheesy and sort of, you know, I can't use them, but I'm toying with some different ways of being able to use the... techniques but for MIDI controls and for the audio visual stuff and I can bring I can still do a lot of the turntabler stuff and it's just I'm just trying to figure out how I can do it in a more interesting way basically rather than the classic hip hop sort of thing. Did you do any competitions or something with this? Yeah, I did one DJ competition where I was doing all of the juggling, beat juggling and all that stuff and it was pretty fun. But no, I think, you know, before I pushed on that route, well, I realized that the turntablism thing was sort of on the way down and really all the new people coming through were producers. That was probably, I don't know, 2004, 2005, something like around that sort of time. Because the turntablism thing, I think, had its peak. probably in the 90s maybe. Things changed and I realised that was happening so I sort of changed direction as well. Yeah. Into productions, I suppose. Yeah. Yeah, it's funny. The production thing, it started just because I wanted to, you know, I was really into DJing and I wanted to do more of it. And I thought, oh, that's a good route. But then as soon as I started delving into the production, I started realising that there were so many connections to the science work I was doing and how that it was such, you know, I could apply myself in a much more... complete way. Turntablism is a very particular sort of application. It's a bit like playing an instrument. You have to just repetitively do the same thing over and over and drill it into your subconscious. I mean, you have to... practice. Yeah, exactly. You have to practice loads. Whereas production requires a lot of practice to train your ears, but there's also a whole side to production which is more about learning different techniques for experimentation and just wider. It's much more related to other academic sort of work. So when I realized that, I realized how fun it was and how rewarding it was. Then pretty quickly the whole turntable and some things sort of fell by the wayside and I was applying myself to music production for years, obsessing about that. But you were sort of doing this on the side, as it were, whilst studying for a PhD. I was spending too much time making music and not enough time doing my PhD. Is that how it worked? Yeah, well, the good thing about doing your own research is that it's all about the results. It's not like you have to work a certain time for it, like nine to five or whatever. It's like if you're making good results and you can publish them and that's the key thing. And luckily for me, I had a great supervisor and had a really interesting project and there was all sorts of interesting results that were coming. And that side was, you know, so I had the flexibility then to spend more time. I'm writing music and the PhD still was ticking along really nicely. So that went really well and it was very enjoyable. Did you go to get a postgraduate degree first? Yeah, so I did undergrad and then I did my master's and then I did PhD. What led you to that first decision of, OK, I'm going to go and take science at university? I think after I did all sciences for A-levels and that was again... at that point that's the assumption was that I would be a scientist of some sort or you know music was I was doing spending I was working really hard at it but I never would say yeah I'm going to do this as a career just because I knew that was pretty unrealistic I thought it was always just like I'm going to work hard at this and I'm going to assume that I'll be a scientist but I'm also going to work hard at this other thing and if that works out then great and if it doesn't then that's I didn't put all my eggs in one basket, basically, until I'd taken both of them to the point where I literally couldn't go any further without putting all my eggs in one basket. And that's when I decided, OK, I'm going to do music now. And then that was, whatever, seven, eight years ago or something. OK. And what was the research project? Yeah. So the idea is that inside every living cell there's... a computer algorithm and that defines how the cell functions, how it responds to inputs. And that obviously has arisen through evolution and through chance and mutation. So the question was, how can these sort of things, these complex algorithms arise from simpler building blocks? How can they learn to, how they can evolve to do these complex tasks? So I was simulating that because it's something that happens over millions of years or billions of years. So it's not something you can test in the lab very easily, so that's why it's good for computer simulations. It's also very tied to this whole learning algorithms that are used by Google Translate and a lot of new technologies where you can basically set a very complex task to a computer system and provide some sort of network that can then rewire itself to solve a complex problem. complex task and that's exactly what the cells were doing. There's these networks of interactions of genes which evolved to these gene expression patterns which control the cell. So that's what I was simulating and experimenting with just to learn more about it and just to make predictions which then could feed into experiments. People could test those predictions and just better understand how life works and how evolution works. Yeah, I mean in terms of sort of these chaotic computer systems, it sort of reminds me how you create music yourself by, I read somewhere that you sort of build these chaotic systems using Ableton. So that's, that's the... Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's that, there's definitely that. I guess the link is that you're building a system which figures out how to solve a problem and you don't actually know how it's done it. So that's one of the interesting things. When I was doing my research, I would make the system and then it would evolve to solve the problem I set it. But I wouldn't actually know how it did it. And then I would sort of be trying to then untangle. There's this network of all these things regulating one another and then trying to figure out what was going on thing, solve this problem. So it is a learning algorithm. It teaches itself and evolution and life does that. We're using those sort of techniques a lot now as well. And I also think those techniques are really important for you know for music production i touch on them very much with setting up the as you as you mentioned like in ableton i set up lots of parameters one regulating the other and lots of you know random you know randomizers on certain parameters or randomizers sometimes on hundreds of parameters so that the whole like that you get this sort of seething mess of you know changing um you know whether it's synthesis or whether it's effects you just get this really detailed caloric sort of audio system and I set the boundaries so it's not it's only chaotic or it's only messy within a within the realms that I want but it's messy enough to create lots of interesting effects and then I'll you know I'll record those and then I'll start a long process of editing and you know picking up the good bits and it's linked to to I guess you're well spotted there's that there's definitely that link to the to the research I think that that technique can be applied, you know, issued a lot more. I'm only scratching the surface really. I mean, there's some people that use it to a much greater degree. There's a guy called Rob Clouth who's writing an album for Mesh, the label I released the last album on. He builds, you know, he writes his own software from scratch and uses a lot of these techniques and the results are, you know, the music speaks for itself. if you want to have music that sounds different to everyone else, then you need techniques that are different. And if your techniques are radically different and you're building your own systems, then the music will also be radically different. So it's something I'm experimenting with more at the moment. I'm working with some software developers and actually starting from the ground up a bit more to try and find some new musical realms. Because that's the whole thing I mentioned earlier about being into this golden era of synth pop. And that was... It was pioneering then, wasn't it? Yeah, it was like the synthesizer was something new. So whenever people were like... using synthesizers and then they you know this music was totally new because they were using a totally new thing it's almost that simple you know if you want to do something really new musically one way of doing that is just to find a new technique and that's sort of what i'm i've been pushing towards over the years but um i'm so there's certainly people that do it so much more effect than than i do but um i feel like it's these learning algorithms and using the computer as an extension of the mind and trying to building systems where you can actually put your aesthetic and something about you into the computer system. That's the areas where I feel like there's going to be the most potential. for new forms of artistic expression. So it's pretty exciting. I mean, there's a lot of interesting things in that world happening, and that's why I've started this label called Mesh to actually start collaborating with these people and thinking about these ideas and how music can relate to these wider areas of science or research and just, again, the collaborators with the visual artists and just... the arts in general, I feel like it's all really oriented around what computers can bring and what these types of new programming approaches can bring. So I want to drag that right back to the beginning of your sort of music production process, where it began. So it sounds like it's become very complex. I wondered if it has. always been complex or I've always loved complexity like I've always been drawn to it you know in visually or in terms of music it's just that I don't know what it is. I like the idea that you can delve in as much as you want. And the more you delve in, the more you find. It's like there's all these hidden things in there. And that's what life's like. That's, again, very much ties to my interests in nature and biology and that sort of background. The more you delve in, there's these intricate machines and then you delve into that and then there's another intricate machine within that intricate machine and it goes down and down systems musically I'm always in of that as well but one thing i would add about that is that i also try and make a simple building block or the tracks a lot of them need to work in a club as well you know they'll have a strong kick drum on a snare and they'll have like you know a simple chord structure and there's these you can sort of listen on that level you know if you're in a club you lose most of the detail in a club so you know i have to build the tracks that work they have these sort of punchy simple elements which you know are the the backbone and then and then again slightly more complex element that's layered on and then a slightly more and a slightly more and it's just that basically the better the system is you have to listen the more you'll find And that's the way I sort of, that's what I strive for musically. It should sound good on your iPhone or it should sound good if you've got like a 7.1 surround sound system or something, you know. When you first started turning to production, what were you listening to or what were you, what music was inspiring you to make music at that point and what kind of music were you making? So when I first started writing music. Yeah, so we're talking about, what, 2004-ish? Yeah, I first started, yeah, exactly. That was towards, yeah, around then. That was probably, yeah, 2003, 2004. What was I listening to at that time? I was a resident of this techno night in Nottingham called Firefly, which was started in 99 by a good friend of mine. And they used to have, it was always like, you know, Dave Clark and Ben Sims and, you know, Surgeon and all that stuff. So I was very much, that was the first proper, you know, night that I had a residency at. So were you playing some banging technique back then? A little bit, but actually I was more, I used to play warm up all the time and I used to play more like. broken sort of beat stuff and a bit of techno but not the really I was never into the really aggressive stuff but I was the person that played the less aggressive stuff earlier and then it sort of warm up the room yeah exactly I did warm up I was for many years playing warm up sets so that was sort of that was the scene I was immersed in to some extent so I was certainly listening to that stuff but then I was also listening to a lot of like I loved Grand Central Records that sort of like almost like trip-hop sort of thing and M, Cold Water Music that sort of chilled you know down-tempo-y sort of broken beat sort of stuff and also like Electronica I was really into like the more like ambient side of Electronica and some of the glitchy stuff as well like Venetian Snares there was that classic Venetian Snares album whose name I can never pronounce it. I don't want to pronounce it. It's impossible. I was really interested in that sort of fusion between electronic, the glitch sounds, electronic music and classical because I was always into ambient and classical as well. So there was all these things going on. there are things which I guess over the years I've tried to bring through. And then at what point did music stop being a hobby? So you mentioned before that you sort of reached a point where you, you had to make a decision really. Yeah. Uh, what was that point? Um, that was the point where. It was more that I was forced into it, really. I'd sort of done a postdoc for a year or so, a short postdoc at UCL here after Nottingham. I did most of my studies at Nottingham University, and I came to UCL. I was given a small grant in order to spend a year putting in applications for doing my own research. I wanted to continue my own thing. I didn't want to work for someone else. I was like, OK, I'm really interested in this. And the PhD had gone really well. And it was there was all these interesting ideas I wanted to explore. So I thought, OK, I want to do my own thing. So the way to do that is to put in grant applications to try and get funding to. So I spent I didn't get it, no. I mean, if I had got it, I probably wouldn't be here now. So that was, it wasn't necessarily a bad thing. It was just, you know, that was the point where I was like, okay, I've spent, I've just spent a lot of effort, you know, and I didn't get my funding. And do I really want to go and work for someone else doing something, you know, something else and not having control over my own, you know, okay I'm gonna why don't I try you know the music thing it was I was already quite deep into the production side of stuff by then starting to get a few releases and I thought maybe I'll just try this for a year or something so I was like okay no I'm gonna try this full time and then I managed to scrape by for a couple of years basically until things started picking up so there was a it was a tough it was a tough transition phase but luckily for me there was a Labour government in power And they helped me with my rent. Okay. Thank you. Which probably wouldn't be the case now. So I had a business and I was like, okay, this is my business. And I was doing it properly. And the government at that point were probably, I don't know what the rules are. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be so supportive now. that allowed me to spend a couple of years being very poor but being able to survive just to push the music thing, push it and then after a few, two or three years it started to like, okay, I can actually sort of pay my rent now and this is good and then just building, building from there. So you mentioned earlier about... developing your personality and finding yourself with your music. I guess this is the period where, well, an intensive period where you could really discover how to put yourself into your music. I wondered whether the concepts were sort of in place at this point or were you making sort of... Just club music. So that's it. I mean, it started off very much, you know, I just want to make club music. I want to make club music. But one of the early labels I started working with called Shram Shalplatin from Cologne. The label boss there, Riley Reinhold, he was one of the early people to take me on and to help push me along by letting me remix the bigger artists on there and stuff. And he encouraged me. He was like, you should think about how you can link your science to your music and how you can tie concepts together. He encouraged that. And that was the early stages and we started to experiment with that and also starting to work with video artists and think, okay, how can we link these ideas together with visuals? And so that was the early. early stages of a long process which is still ongoing you know the longer it goes on the more I'm finding you know able to link the two well the three interests together more and more tightly but yeah that's when it began. What was the first sort of project that you worked on where these these things really started coming together? I'd probably have to look at my discography to find out. The thing is, I've done so many releases. Yeah. I think... The early releases on Trim, the Stochastic Series and the other series releases, that was the early start. I was thinking about ways of linking them and bringing it into the music, but it was sort of really, compared to how I do it now, it was quite still more club focused and I was experimenting with bringing random sounds in, Stochastic Series for example, because the idea was to mix. stochasticities, randomness and how I could bring that into the music. But it was very, by the standards I apply now, it wasn't particularly adventurous. suppose it was still very much club music and I was just starting to experiment with you know bringing these things in um with the first album human I brought it in much more strongly and then again with this more recent album it's a whole you know again it's even more as I mentioned it's like an ongoing thing I'm learning more experimenting with different ways of fusing things together and it's just yeah it's an ongoing process which will continue until eventually I'll have my like big tune button you know it's like the system will be built and all you need to do is just like press the big tune button and then it spits it out you know and then like is that the aim yeah yeah that's it That's the ultimate aim, you know. Because some people think that I'm using, you know, I don't know, that science is like, I've made some system. Basically that, you know, I take the piss when I'm going to a big tune button. But I think there's that misunderstanding sometimes that the science is sort of making the music or something. It's certainly not like that, you know. At the moment, it's very much the science is informing the visuals. and can often inform the creative process. It gives me interesting ideas. To try something I wouldn't otherwise try. And so I'm trying to think about how can I map musical forms to these visual forms or these science ideas or whatever it is. And that makes me try lots of things which I wouldn't do otherwise. I'm also, yeah, there's some project I'm working on at the moment which is a bit more explicit where we're actually building software to put... fractal structures into musical structures. Again, that's the direction I'm going more and more into. How far can I push that? But certainly, I still haven't got anywhere near my big tune button yet. Again, sort of pulling it back to your early setup, was it quite... Simple? What software were you using? I didn't have any money, so it was like my crappy old laptop. I had to get a lunchbox and put it in the freezer because the laptop would always overheat. So I'd put the lunchbox full of ice and the laptop would sit on top of it. to stop it overheating and then my speakers and that was it. For years I did everything just digitally because that's what I could afford. In recent years I've started to slowly build up a collection of synthesizers and go more analog. add that sort of side to my sound but certainly early on it was really basic one of the things I probably where I invested my money most or my time and my effort most as well was acoustics so trying to actually get the room sounding decent which is really important and the video music video work I would invest into like paying video artists to start that was something I was always really interested in and sort of wanted to push isn't it was just something else I saw that I was passionate about but also something that could set me apart from other people so what was the big first video piece that you worked with or commissioned first one was Harmonic Siri I think it was the first one by Andy Whiskers effects it was like this sort of abstract like a roof scene turning into this mad symmetrical sort of trip it was pretty it was pretty fun I mean it didn't have at that point it wasn't really I wasn't saying I want a video like this and that it was more like here's this tune and this is what I'm doing and like what can you think of and over the years it's become much more now actually with the most recent album for example the whole thing was it starts off as a video visual story and I know what the chapters are and I'm making music for this chapter and I send the briefs to the video artists and say I want this and this and I find people who can you know so it's very much more like I direct visually but early on it was more just like finding someone you know that you like that yeah a friend who you know could do something and then that's what we can do and just experimenting yeah Was it always as a video format, an accompaniment to recorded material or did videos feature in your live performances early on? No, no, I didn't. I didn't bring the videos into live performances for a while. I guess I was definitely influenced a lot. by the whole Warp Records thing. I used to have this Warp Vision DVD, because Warp were very much one of the early labels to really push the visual thing as well. Cunningham, you know, Aphex Twin collaborations being some of the sort of seminal, you know, audiovisual or music video sort of pieces that really set the standards and still do. Do you have a favourite one? My favourite one is probably the Bjork. is full of love I think it's called you know Cunningham the robots and that's just I mean musically and visually it's just an absolute masterpiece and it's still and it still looks unbelievable it's not you know to yeah to pull that off I don't know what year it was made but yeah that's one of my all-time favorite sort of audiovisual pieces And what about sort of audiovisual performances? Have there been any influential ones that you can think of? Performances, live performances? Yeah, AV performances. Yeah. I guess Hexstatic were doing stuff a lot back then, like the earlier days definitely. And Cold Cut as well, they were doing live audiovisual things, which I was really into. And then I'm trying to think what more recently. To be honest, I'm as much influenced by film. Koi and a Squatzy was one of my major influences early on. The Philip Glass score. and this Ron Frick sort of epic human civilization and these big topics portrayed without characters. It was those early non-traditional narrative films like Coin and Squatty with the Philip Glass score. It's a story of, I guess, life and nature in motion and, you know, systems. It's like looks at big, you know, natural systems and how they evolve and how they function and then human systems. And it very much treats, you know, civilization and human systems as an abstracted entity. And it shows them in that by sometimes by speeding people up. So they're moving through the city really fast and the city, the whole city, the dynamics of the city turns into this like it's like an ant's nest or something. And it objectifies, you know, humans and society and life in that way. And by doing that, it shows us for what we really are rather than being so lost. And, you know, we usually totally lost it within our human constructs. And it sort of brings us out of that And it's just a really beautiful, and also shows the beauty of natural systems. So that film in particular was a big influence on me and continues to be. And then moving more recently, Ron Frick's done, he did Baraka and Samsara. And again, it's the same non-traditional narrative. There's not characters or anything like that. there's music and visual and it tells a story and that's very much how I've approached the Emergence project and how I'm approaching my future projects going forward so those were as much an influence on me as any live shows you know Has this human element theme always been prevalent in your work? Or what are some of the main themes? Yeah, I think the main theme is that sort of human feeling and sort of the emotive approach. I feel things strongly and that's the only tool I've ever used to write music. really it's just I don't have training in music or anything it's more I just sit down and intuition and I say I just play around like how does this make me feel like what feeling am I trying to portray you know is it I've got maybe I've got an abstract concept that I'm thinking of toying with and what sort of feelings does that have or maybe it's a scene you know in what sort of feelings does that scene have and I'm just trying to then it's then just match up the what's coming out of the result is that all my music, you know, obviously it's not a very accurate medium of translation. So some of the feeling I put in won't come across to the listener, but hopefully that's, there's that core, usually core driven. you know I love chords and chords make me feel things I don't know why it's just they just do so I think that's the core of you know my music and then it's that complemented with the ideas and and a lot of the time the ideas like tying back to what we were talking about earlier a lot of the time the the sort of science-y ideas or these more abstracted forms can take on the more detailing and the structure and these sort of these so you've got that core of feeling and then that's dressed up with this like you know whatever it is this glitchy detailing and or you know sort of different types of shapes I always think there's lots of ways of mapping visual scenes into music I'm actually doing a project at the moment with a sculptor where where you're mapping different types of sculptures into different musical forms and trying to think up, develop a language where you can translate between the two. So there's visual mappings, this is sort of like audio mapping. Yeah. I mean, you could say you've got something with lots of smooth curves and beautiful flat surfaces. You can make that musically, you know, you can make lots of smooth transitions and soft rounded noises and things. Or you can make things really jaggedy and sharp or you can make things dark or you can make them light. And there's lots of ways of mapping sound to visual scenes. And that's something which I've always been, yeah, which has always been an interest, hence the music video stuff. I think another really strong thing that's been there throughout is spatial awareness. Can you tell me where this came from? you know, unwrap the psychoacoustics. Yeah, that's always been, I mean, there's a few links. I mean, psychoacoustics is a sort of, you know, area of psychology and an area of science. So there's that sort of link in terms of my interests in psychology and science and how that can link to music. Psychoacoustics is one way of doing that. But then I think more importantly to me, it's just I always want... to sort of wrap be wrapped up inside the music you know i always i have a lot of chords which are like and a lot of low frequencies that i use are really constant and they sort of these rumbling sort of soft warm sounds that go on too long basically and it's always an attempt to just you know wrap the listener up inside this abstracted space using psychoacoustics or or real surround sound systems, which is more the physical way of doing it. Using those types of approaches allows me to wrap people up and create this abstracted space which people can explore. So I think... It's almost just a way of making the effect stronger. It's like how I can make the message more powerful. And obviously I love VR and that whole world because it adds a whole extra layer to that. You can make the experience even more immersive with those modern systems, which is something I'm toying with a lot and doing some projects with. But the psychoacoustics thing just naturally appeals to me. From early on, I was always listening to music and getting frustrated. I was like, how do they do that? When I listen to this piece, why does it feel so... Why does it surround me? And why doesn't my music sound like that? So I started learning about the different ways of doing that and then I'm still learning and trying to bring them in. When did you... start writing sort of these surround sound pieces or as I've seen them referred to as audio sculptures. Yeah, so the audio sculptures is a particular project where I literally set out to make abstract special structures of audio. So they weren't pieces of music, basically. It would just be like a weird sound that had a certain shape. And I did that with this thing called 4D Sound System, which is... basically loads of speakers all over the room there's 16 pillars and there's three speakers within each pillar and the roof is raised and there's subs under the floor so there's probably 60 or so speakers all through the space and that allows you to make sounds appear to come from anywhere. They can come from above you, below, they can fly past, and therefore you can make three-dimensional structures with sound. So the audio sculptures thing literally was audio sculptures. More widely, you know, I've done lots of different types of surround sound shows, sometimes where it's just speakers on the edge of the room, and this Dolby Atmos thing I mentioned where it's using cinema, you know, because cinemas are set up. for interesting surround sound effects using techniques used in film for music. So there's a few different things I've experimented with. And how would you approach writing? I guess it would depend on what set-up, but how would you approach writing a sort of three-dimensional? piece of music? Well, that was the thing. Originally, I started off with a piece of my own music for the 4D Sancho and for the Sran Sancho. And then I had to think about, OK, if this piece of music was a physical structure, what would it be? For some pieces, it was very easy because I already had that in mind, what sort of physical structure they might be, because I was already thinking. language. So then it was just a matter of trying to map that physical structure into this real 3D system. But for the auto sculptures thing, I started from the other direction and I was like, okay, I'm going to start with the shape first and I'm going to say I want to build this structure. How can I do that with sand and building the sand after? And that was more effective because obviously I was starting primarily with the physical experience as the starting point. What does that actually mean? So say, for example, one of the ones I did was like rain. I want to have like the experience of thousands of raindrops. They're all falling all around you. I thought that would suit the piece of music. Then it was just like, OK, here's my system. I've got every sound has three coordinates for X, Y and Z in the space. And then I can set up movements. And I want that every sound can fall from, they're going to fall from above the roof and they're going to come because you're setting these sort of imaginary spaces. You can have them falling from really high up. They're going to fall from really high up and then they come down and then they're going to make a little sound when they hit the ground. And you can set up that for one and then I'm going to duplicate that. somewhere else and maybe make it fall slightly differently and then you do that a hundred times or a thousand times and you've got all these thousands of little sounds that are falling and then you've built your sort of rain. The thing is you don't actually hear a rain drop until it hits the ground usually do you so that's a bit of a cheat but anyway it gives you more of this interesting sort of but that's an example anyway. And do you can you factor in sort of the person in this world and experiencing it. Yeah, so one of the really difficult things with making music in that way is that... You have to make it sound okay from everywhere. I mean, it's almost impossible to do that. That's one of the really tough things. It's like you can make something that sounds really interesting, but if you stand in the corner of the room, it might sound a bit rubbish. So then the good thing about 4D sound is that you encourage people to walk around, to actually interact with the music and walk through the sounds and find different ones and find which bits they like and don't like. But for the Dolby Atmos thing, for example, then people are in a cinema, so they can't walk around. So then the challenge is, okay, I want it. to sound as spatial as possible and interesting, but it has to sound okay from every point. And usually it's the corners, the far edges of the room, which are the most problematic because they're sat close to one or other particular speakers. So if something's, you know, obviously those speakers will be louder. So then, you know, if things are, so it unbalances the space. To some degree, you have to accept that it's not going to sound perfect everywhere, but you have to think about... yeah trying to make it as best you can and generally there's a trade-off the more spatial it is the more it'll sound bad from certain points of the space and you know again with that in mind I would set up some parts of the set where I know it's going to sound pretty good from everywhere but they're not going to be as spatial and then some parts which are really spatialized and I just accept that if someone's sat in a bad seat and it's not going to sound so good but hopefully they won't mind too I really like how you applied this technique to a mix, which was the Science Eat Museum mix, where you mapped a journey through the British Museum. Yeah, that was another, that was interesting. So I was set a task of making a mix which was about a place. That was a whole different, yeah, I mean, that's another example. I totally forgot about that. That's another way, just another interesting example of how thinking about things spatially or, you know, outside, you know, how even just thinking about things outside of music and then applying it to music can lead to interesting results. So I thought, okay, I need to... think of a space somewhere in London that I can visit and where do I like and I love the British Museum the structure has got that old buildings and then that modern roof structure and I thought okay that and also it sounds amazing in there you know because the sounds there's this big open space but it's well it's open in the sense that it's very big but it's actually closed you know all sides of the sounds bounce around you get these long echoes and really interesting and there's also lots of people in there like they're eating lunch and their kids are screaming and there's all these things sort of life going on in the background so i just started recording sounds in there and that was the you know the starting point and then i started thinking about all the exhibits and all these ancient artifacts and things and i thought maybe i can you know try and find some ancient music from the same areas, parts of the world of the artefacts and then as you go through the mix you find these different, I'm using modern electronic music but then I'll layer over some ancient Chinese instrumentation and then you find that part of the mix as you're finding that part of the museum and going around. So yeah, that was a really fun project. Yeah, I really enjoyed that. I think this is a good point to ask about. your binaural field recordings and your method because i guess that's you applied it there yeah and do a lot you use it a lot yeah i love yeah yeah so again so this is psychoacoustics yeah we're talking about we mentioned psychoacoustics earlier so basically it's like when you listen to sound your brain takes all sorts of signals from the sun coming into our ears and those signals tell your brain whether suns are coming from behind or in front or whether they're moving or you know whether the you know what type of space you're in in terms of what the walls are like and you know there's also how big the space is your brain processes all information subconsciously and it gives you a feeling for the space around you from what you hear. If you haven't, if you don't believe me, then if you go on YouTube and type like binaural hairdresser, there's like this, you can experience like, and close your eyes, put some decent headphones on and you get to. experience it's really freaky like a lot of people you don't realize how much information about their environment it comes from you know what you're hearing yeah but that that's that you know youtube video is a great way of experiencing you know this freaky like you think your hair is getting chopped and like i'm going to check that out it's really fun but you have to have headphones you have to have headphones it's a good trick for actually you know if you've got friends over or something you know you try a few drinks and you're You want to freak out your friends, okay? So get good headphones and force them to close their eyes. Promise they're going to close their eyes and make them listen through. It's fun. That's a good demonstration to check yourself. But the point is that there's all this information that your brain takes from hearing without us being aware of it. And it's just, you know... psychoacoustics is the explanation of that but then it can be used in music so one way of using it is to actually go out into real spaces and record the sounds but you have to record it from inside your ears so the binaural microphones are microphones which sit right inside your ear canals tiny little microphones so that if a sound's coming from behind it'll go through a bit of your skull and it'll go through your ear and that will then affect how that that filtering of your physical structure of your head will get recorded into the audio. So that when someone listens back to it, it has those signals in which tell their brain, oh, that's coming from behind, and it gives much more of this full three-dimensional special feeling. So that's one way of doing it, which I use a lot of that. Often when I'm traveling, I'll just go around recording random sounds, and then I'll... take them out and sometimes I'll have whole you know like in that science museum thing when the intro is this whole sequence of that courtyard in the British Museum sometimes I'll use you know layer that underneath just to give a subtle sort of speciality Or sometimes I'll actually just take individual sounds, you know, like little, I don't know what it might be, I might have a sound of someone throwing, you know, like closing a bin lid or something, I don't know what it is, and I might use that as a drum sound for percussion. And the fact that I've used a binaural sample will give it an interesting... speciality actually there was a track on the album called cyclic on the emergence album where i used a lot of sounds for the percussion from a building site i was in my studio one day and there was this racket going on and i was like what's going on out there and i went to find out it was this building site where they're putting these huge metal pillars in for building a wall or something and there's a huge machine that smashed these bits of metal together and they made this mad sound so spent ages in there recording these sounds and then percussion from them and actually this this project I'm doing with a sculptor as well relies on that those techniques I'm sort of clanging he makes these big metallic sculptures and I'm like clanging them and smashing them and doing all things with them and then damaging his work exactly his priceless work exactly and uh and then using those sounds to then build, use it for percussion especially. That's recorded binaural sound. The other side of things is simulated. You can actually get simple bits of software which will emulate the binaural panning effect. So you can just take whatever sound in your music software and just put it in. this plug-in on and you can say with the plug-in you know process this sound like it's coming from behind me like by 78 degrees or something and then it'll calculate how to you know change the sound to make it give the illusion that it's coming from that position and that's quite quite a strong effect and you're using that I use that a lot yeah so in especially in the recent album and the recent productions a lot of if there's a sound in there which is clearly synthesized but has a very strange, like really pronounced sort of speciality, it really sounds like it's there, as in I'm looking to the right of my head sort of thing, it really sounds like it feels like it's in a certain position, but it's clearly not a real sound, then it's probably using this type of simulated binaural effect. Okay. So before we finally jump into Emergence, I just wanted to ask, are you still sort of doing, quotation marks, normal DJ sets or is it all very live and hybrid and experimental? Yeah, I do certainly do normal DJ sets. I still love clubs and parties. So if I'm booked to play in a techno club. I know that's what it is, then I'll play techno or whatever. I have that side to me, but I also very much enjoy doing these more like... surround sound or other visual shows and a lot of them are more like playing like nine o'clock and you know sometimes they're sit down shows things like that I really enjoy that side of the work as well and I'm pushing more and more in that direction club thing is still a lot of fun as well so I definitely you know I like variety I like to be able to do different things because you recently did this the all night long tour yeah maybe you can tell us a bit more about that concept yeah although it probably is what it says yeah that just it ties into this whole thing about the fact that I don't want to just play one thing one genre I love you know my post classical and my ambient music and my glitch stuff and my down tempo and you know house and techno and drum bass and all these different things and that allows me to play all of the things in one night you know because I'm really bad at playing short sets like because I always want to do too many different things and sometimes I try and cram too much in so my worst sets are always like one hour like I hate playing one hour sets at festivals it does my head in the all night thing just gives me six hours or seven or eight hours and then I can really spend that you know I can spend the first hour playing ambient music and everyone sort of sits on the floor and chills out and This is nice. And then by the end, it's like, you know, like 180 BPM sort of like jungle and stuff. And it's just, it just, and there's a smooth transition. It's not like it goes from ambient to jungle. but you know it's all about people standing up and sitting down exactly exactly it's all about just having enough time to work between these different things and explore ideas like that and that's just just yeah I mean everyone likes playing long sets don't they yes apparently I think they do You've got more to work with. Yeah, you've got a much bigger canvas to work with. What sort of jungle would you be playing? What I've been playing a lot, like the classical, I know like old like Mickey Finn and stuff and they sort of like, oh, I've got a whole pile of these old like 90s like trauma bass records. Were you playing? Jungle records, they're really fun. Yeah, it's all the old stuff pretty much like the 90s sort of stuff. So do you still have a huge record collection and you play vinyl as well? Yeah, I don't take my records with me to gigs because they're too heavy. and they get lost. So I've spent a bit of time recording old records onto digital format so that I can play that stuff. Okay, so finally we're going to try and talk about emergence in as clear a way as possible because there's quite a lot of context to it. So maybe you can tell us where the seed for the idea came from. Because it's been quite a number of years in the making, right? Yeah. The seed came from my decision to do a live visual show. I'd been spending a lot of time working with visual artists and eventually I thought, OK, I want to figure out how I can play the visuals myself and actually I'm really interested in this. I want to be able to perform with visuals and music and actually control the visuals myself as well. So that was sort of the seed. The other thing, the other core part of that would have been, you know, my science interests and thinking, how can I use my science interests to tell a wide-ranging story? And also linking back to those, you know, Koinosquatzi and Baraka, these sort of dose films, which... I loved and it was very much I was like I wanted to tell a story visually I didn't want it to be just this stuff looks cool you know I wanted there to be meaning and and develop you know development throughout and messages and you know and be able to present something more than just, you know, stuff on the surface. So what started first? So you basically wanted to make an AV set? Yeah. Did you have the music in mind first? Did you have the theory first? So the first thing was the idea, Emergence. Okay. So it came very quickly, actually. I was just thinking, I can't remember where it came from. but it was something, it just seemed like an obvious choice of how I could present lots of different science ideas and how I could make a storyline. So the idea of emergence being that in science, you know, you have all these really simple reductive structures, you know, people sort of write these few letters on a... blackboard or something and say oh this explains the universe you know and it's like three different symbols and some weird thing you don't know what it says but it's really simple you know and it's that how can something so simple explain the whole the complexity of the world we live in and everything it seems ridiculous but the reason it can is because you know emergence so the idea that you have really simple building blocks and those simple building blocks can And, you know, iteratively through time, you know, they can interact with one another and they can give rise to other things and slightly more complex things. And, you know, that can build and build and build. And something really unexpected and beautiful can come from something really simple. That's the idea of emergence. It also sort of points the finger at like a little bit of our. maybe human stupidity a little bit, which is nice because it's a bit like if we were cleverer, then it would be obvious that something really interesting would happen from these simple building blocks, but we can't see that because we're humans. And it's also interesting because it goes a bit beyond the sort of dry side of science. It's a bit mystical almost. It's a bit like it somehow implies that, you know, these things that you can have something really simple and something really amazing can come from that. And we don't necessarily know why or we can't really understand why. And that goes beyond a bit beyond science. You know, it's like. You could say consciousness perhaps is emergent. It's like this amazing thing that no one really understands very well, but we can understand these simple building blocks that give rise to it and how the brain works and stuff, but then we can't still understand the whole thing. That's interesting because it sort of points the finger at science not being able to explain everything perhaps, and there's that sort of more arty sort of... it opens the door for these other interests and other things to come in. And that was another reason why I thought it was an interesting topic to look at. Because I didn't want it to be really dry. It's not supposed to be a science lecture or anything like that. That's not what I do. I find these ideas interesting, but I also find other things interesting. So it's just, and it seemed to envelop. and incorporated lots of angles which I could play with. How did this project begin? How did you start writing it? Were you making the music or did you have visuals already in place? So it began by the concept and then the other good thing about the concept was I realised there were some videos I already had been working on which would fit into that story because I was already working on a lot of stuff which was... you know, related to nature and, you know, life and those videos and that work fitted perfectly already into this wider, you know, emergent story. So I already had some stuff, you know, as soon as I come up with it, that would fit and that would fit, you know, and that's great. So I've already got some stuff. And then it was just a matter of thinking about, you know, every chapter. So there's 25 chapters at the moment. Every chapter is a different sort of science- and a different part of that storyline. The storyline which starts off with natural laws, looking at really basic fundamental structures of nature which existed before. the physical universe and then going into the big bang and stars and then planets and later on early life and then evolution and humans and then society and the digital age and the future. It goes through this sort of timeline, this universe timeline, one thing emerging from the other. So did you have to plot this? timeline and the chapters or first was it all like a lot of i mean that story that general timeline is the sort of the popular creation story of science really so it's i didn't have to rethink about too much about that it was more just like just thinking about which bits did I want to pick out to actually focus on and what would make a nice visual story and how I could present it in a bit more... I wanted to present it differently from how it is elsewhere because that story is often told in different formats and I put a big focus on this pre-matter section as in I wanted to get done... most sort of emergence type of creation stories would start off with a big bang. Whereas I put a lot of the stories pre-Big Bang. So I wanted to really delve down into what was... Because you can't just have a Big Bang from nothing, right? It's like nothing. If there really was nothing before, then it would have been nothing after. There clearly was, you know, what was in place were natural laws. You know, there was systems, things were already happening. There was stuff that was already there. But it wasn't what we sort of would... stuff you know it wasn't physical stuff you know it was like it was what underlies what's more fundamental than you know matter and time and these physical things we're aware of and that's what I delved into a lot as a you know for the story to make it different from those told elsewhere. And did you do a lot of research or did you have a lot of this knowledge already? I read around a little bit, but no, it was mainly stuff that was already in there, I suppose. But one of the interesting things was that by delving down certain ideas, even when I started working with visual artists and they started delivering some of the things I was asking for, then I would have more insight or I learnt a lot. from the actual interaction with the visual artists, which is really interesting because it was almost like I was learning things about science by doing art, which was a nice way, you know, backwards way of doing things. Going back to, I guess, the core of your question, you know, I had all these different ideas in mind. Then I would just go and find, you know, I was trying to find visual artists that could deliver, you know, whose styles would fit. different chapters that I wanted to tell. And then I would start chatting to them about it and sending them briefs and we'd go back and forth. And then sometimes I would have music written for a particular part. I'd written a track, I think this would work for this part of the story and I would send them the track. Sometimes they would start sending me some sketches and visual stuff and some draft video sequences and then I would actually score, I was actually writing the music to fit the visual. Can you maybe give us an example of a track that was built from a visual? Yeah, so one of the obvious ones was the part of the story about the human machine. So this was sort of like the emergence of the human. And at every point in this emergent story, the idea is that we look at the systems and subsystems which are giving rise to that. emergent property. So say the emergent thing is the human. Then we're looking at the subsystems that give rise to the human. So there's like the organs and the circulation and the lungs and the brain and it's all this sort of infographic sort of depiction of how a human works and how these different little mechanical things can give rise to this emergent property of the human. So that one it was a really nice hand. drawn sort of comic-y feel to it and had all these moving parts and I and then I started building near this sort of loopy sort of this melody which sort of intertwined with itself in this like I never had a start or you know I never had an ending it was like these because the the melodies were several melodies were different loop lengths so there wasn't really a natural point where they would all overlap to finish so it would give this like feeling of this ongoing sort of these systems like churning away churning away and also it was quite like friendly sort of because he was like nice colorful hand-drawn feeling so musically it was sort of fairly friendly, if there's a way to put it. So that was an example of where I was scoring to the visual. I really like what I think is the process that you use on Order and Chaos, doesn't it start with, you recorded Rain? Yeah, that's a good example of where... the sort of science idea informed or drove the creative process to make me create a piece of music that I never would have done otherwise and which was really interesting. With that one I was trying to, it's really the process of emergence, you know, it's like how you can have something, a natural system that's churning away and then from that you get structure coming. Interesting. structure and the way I did it was yeah I had it was really heavy rain one day and I was recording the rain drops hitting the window with my binaural mic again and then so obviously the sound of all these big raindrops is just random you know there is hitting the window all these random timings but they're quite well you know each raindrop is quite well defined sort of you know in terms of the audio you can hear a little click you know it's quite and then it's special and they're suddenly they're hitting all around you which is a nice effect and then I was like okay I want to create track from this in an emergent manner I want to create an emergent rhythm Also, the track's called Order From Chaos, which is the same thing. So I just basically took the audio file and then marked the position of every raindrop and then took a drum grid. So like a live drummer would play. The drums weren't in the track, though, but just the grid. The live drummer would play and you would also map the position of the drum hits in time. And then I would take those positions, the positional information only, not the actual drums. And then for the raindrops, whichever drum hit they were closest to. I could slowly push them towards that. So you're forcing the raindrops, these randomness, into this sort of gridded structure. But then the emphasis of what hits where is from the rain. So there's this, you know, which raindrops are louder is defined by the rain. So you get this interesting rhythm comes, you know, slowly emerges out of chaos of the rain. That rhythm was the percussion which I then added. and the percussion around that and built the whole track around that process. Is there a composition off of the project that you really enjoyed making the most? Or you have a favourite? Because I feel like there was lots of different, all sorts of different processes involved. maybe making each piece of music was totally different. Yeah, I tried to sort of have themes of chord structures and melodies and the idea of these sort of layers of detailing. So I tried to, you know, there were those core themes of the feeling and the layered, you know. sort of big structures and then smaller ones and smaller ones and smaller ones that nested sort of detailing. I tried to keep those core principles, but then for each track I would, yeah, I'd be using some different techniques to try and make them interesting. I don't know if I had a favourite. Maybe... One that was fun was a track called Waves. I was using this fun sort of randomising thing called Obscurium. It was like this piece of software which has a really complex modulation of synthesis, basically. And it was able to spit out... loads of these quite electro-y sort of, you know, it certainly isn't one of the more, it's one of the less serious tracks on there. It's sort of a fun, more fun sort of retro. I use these big retro synth sounds and stuff and it's almost a little bit. disco-y or something and it came from this interesting obscurium plugin. That was fun and it was just fun because literally it's a... fun sort of track so I was feeling that you know I was enjoying the process of making it you know and being able to and then the visually as well Kevin McLaughlin like he came up with this great idea of this sort of really strong like retro looking visual way of creating waveforms you know visually and that really fit well with this sort of retro synth effect I'd gone for so that was definitely one of the fun ones. And was there one that was particularly challenging or you really challenged yourself? Yeah, they were all challenging. I spent a long time. You get these people that make a track in a day. Some electronic music producers, they work really quickly. It takes me a long time to make every piece of music. So they were all challenging. Probably the ones... which were the most challenging were maybe cyclic and actually not for very interesting reasons. A lot of the time whenever a track's really challenging, it's because you get bogged down in the mix and you can't quite get the structure right and it's like more these technical sort of pains. Okay. Yeah. Okay, so this clearly was a long process. So was it all based in the studio, it's all created, and at that point then you took it out live, or was it a matter of you were testing bits along the way? Yeah, no, it was on the early versions of the live show, didn't have many of the album tracks in, as in the album, you know, the first time I did the visual show was like two... three years ago and then over the years I've been sort of developing you know what track would fit well where there and it's been this very organic process it wasn't it wasn't certainly wasn't like I'd wrote all the tracks first and then did the show and it was very much like I used to use a lot of old tracks and I still do use some old tracks in the show so I started off you know with basic visuals and and you know old tracks and some new bits but probably none of the album tracks at that point and then I started putting album tracks in so you're in the place of old tracks like I want a track that will do this job in in the set and okay I need to write a track like that and that became one of the album tracks and things like that so it was messy process yeah but but good because I was able to keep and it's still developing that's the thing ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪ Follow me ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Bye.
