you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd O'Byrnes, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. The second live exchange we have for you from the 2012 CommuniKey Festival is with David Last, a Colorado-based producer is the one local that... that we talked to at the event, but he's new to Boulder. Last spent many years in the New York City Electronic Music Underground, releasing on labels like DJ Olive's The Agriculture and Staub Gold. You may not know Last very well, but you will want to after listening to this conversation, I bet, because we talked stand-up comedy, bookbinding, and much more in this wide-ranging conversation. you Welcome to the second live RA Exchange at Communikey. I'm Todd Elburn, the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor, and I'm joined for this one by David Last. Thank you for taking the time out. Yeah, my pleasure. I don't know where to start with you. One of your parents is a stand-up comic, though. And I felt like that was worthy of mention. Oh, yeah, for sure. Well, it was a pretty pivotal thing. My parents got divorced and the same time my dad, I think basically the same time, became a stand-up comedian. I don't know if they're related. It seems like they are related. They're pretty much related. But yeah. His wife was, your mother was not interested in him being a stand-up comedy. Well, I'm not so sure it was that simple. I think there were other factors. But I think that it was, you know, just a big change. And they were both originally academics. So I grew up in a place with, you know, two English teachers. So had, you know, standard art books on the shelves. a large record collection and that ended up being pretty important because I ended up listening to a fairly wide variety of things as a kid and seeing kind of vinyl as a magical object that unleashed like any number of different worlds, you know, depending on what you chose, you know. So I used to spend a lot of time, you know, very carefully take the vinyl out, you know, and put the magic fragile object on the turntable, you know, and then, you know, with paper and pens and sitting in earphones and just like drawing. hear tones that would suggest stories and draw pictures. Do you still have some of these pictures? Yeah, I think I did keep some of them. I went through just about everything I own because I just recently left New York City after 16 years. And going through everything you own is a really intense process and one that I had kind of forgotten. how intense it was, but there are a few things. I had a picture I drew of my brother going to Cub Scouts or something, and I was like, wow. Seems like a very mundane picture. Well, there was a monster behind him, and he had a fish in a bag in his right hand. A fish in a bag. Yeah, like a goldfish in a bag. Sure. You know. And you were listening to what when you drew that? Maybe psychedelic Beatles records. I think that was my favorite. I was into soundtrack music and I was into also anything where I couldn't visualize what the hell the instrument was. Particularly weird, backward stuff. Psychedelic Beatles records and all that. Because ordinarily, I'd listen to a record and think, oh, there's a guy with a banjo or whatever. some things was just very evocative of other stuff. So I got interested in sound as music, music as sound, and a more sculptural approach to sound from a pretty early age. Did you find certain genres were thematically similar in terms of what you were drawing? Yeah, I mean, I think film soundtracks were a biggie because, of course, they're really meant to evoke a specific mood for a specific scene. And even though you're divorced from the plot of the film or whatever, you still get the emotion that the director's trying to impart or the composer's imparting. So I got... Pretty into that, starting with the soundtrack to 2001, which I realized is basically just needle drops on classical, but then going into other stuff. I think the first one I actually bought was the soundtrack to Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I really liked a lot of the themes. John Williams? John Williams theme, yeah. And later on, I got into Miklos Roja and a lot of other people and checked out some of that stuff. I've done a bit of work in scoring and that kind of stuff, so it's nice. You moved around a little bit as a kid, but you were first in Texas? Well, born in Wisconsin and then grew up in Austin. This is when my parents split up and my dad became a stand-up. My mom went to get her Ph.D. at the university. in Austin. So we moved into a neighborhood in Austin that the realtor told my mom is not the neighborhood you want to live in. She's like, I don't know what you're talking about. What do you mean by that? And they're like, just, you know, it's, you don't want to. And she realized, oh, there's Mexican people here. But I had a freaking blast living in that apartment complex. It was called Village Green, and I met a bunch of wonderful friends. And I got introduced to a lot of interesting music as well. I think my parents had Stevie Wonder records, but I hadn't heard funk and soul and everything. I remember pretty clearly hearing stuff on the radio and being like, wow, that's super sick. I remember being on a swing in a park and some fucking Camaro or something pulls up. Can I swear on this? Definitely do. There's a fucking Camaro. Fucking dope-ass car, dude. And they were playing Genius of Love at high volume, you know, the Tom Tom Club track. And I remember going like... How long were you there for? Let's see, four years. But when you're a kid, four years is like forever. Enormous, yeah. I mean, I was like first grade through fifth grade. So that's basically like when you're forming your proto-adult personality and all that crap. So, yeah, I have good things to say about that experience. And going back to Wisconsin was a shock because I was like, oh, white people. again. But there are a lot of white people in Wisconsin. Oh, yeah. Oh, sure. There's a ton. They're pretty nice, though. I like them. But in reading your biography, I read that when you were in Wisconsin, that was the moment that you were getting into hip-hop and electro. Yeah, it's true, actually. I have a friend there that actually is now in New York City. He goes by the name of CX Kidtronic. At the time, he was called Christopher Davis. And he had a cousin that lived in New York City that was recording electro hip-hop radio mixes. from KISS or something and sending them to us. So we used to get all excited about it and sit down and check out cassette. Just beautiful shit. It was like Boogie Down Bronx and all of that early stuff. Because I'm super old. So I was like a teenager when that stuff was happening. Like, oh, here's a new thing from UTFO. But we were all excited about it. And we actually had a group. I had matching funds from my parents. And I bought an SH-101, a red one. the hand grip like a keytar, you know. And so we had like an electro hip hop group and break dancers and everything. And we, you know, play like little parties in the basement and, you know, like talent show or whatever. It was actually, it's not bad. Why the SH-101? Because it was the sickest thing ever. And it was, it was like fairly affordable. It was like, you know, plastic thing. It wasn't like... here's your huge polysynth with wooden end panels and patchable or whatever. Who did you see with one though that sort of like, I want to be like that guy? I didn't actually, but I had played a lot on Juno 60. A friend of mine is a piano player. He ended up being the final piano player in the Jazz Messengers with Art Blakey because he's like a badass. and was asked to join Miles Davis' group, and he's like, sorry, Miles, I'm going with the Jazz Messengers. But I had played his Juno 60, and so I was aware of, like, Roland synth sounding really sick, and I was in a music store, and just fell in love. I was just like, you know. I came home and just went on and on to my parents about it. So you were making music as opposed to breakdancing? I was not on the breakdancing side of things, yeah. There were some proper body-popping kids. I have a photo of it I can show you later. But you did have a track suit. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It was like proper, like, fat, res-y bass sounds, and I was, like, playing bass lines, and CX was, like, on a Synthsonics drum kit. It's a little Mattel, like, toy drum machine, and it still sounded dope, like, if you EQ'd it right. and pretty much just totally killing it all the time. Were you writing all original songs? No, well, we did a few, but we started off playing Give Me Tonight by Shannon and a couple of other things. That was like our showstopper, our best number. And CX will still, like, if we're meeting a friend, like, he'll still talk about, like, man, he took this sick keyboard solo. And I'm like, I wasn't really that sick, man. I was, like, 13. But... What was the group's name? Midnight Mission. So how did you get from Wisconsin to New York? Was there a stop in between? No, it was just a no-brainer. Like, I went to college. in Madison. I took a year and drank abroad in England and then got done and went straight over to New York. Did you only drink or was there actually stuff that you did there? I don't really remember but I think mostly it was drinking. There was some walking to another bar. Were you in London? I mean there's quite a music scene there. No, I was in Winchester. It's in the south. Alright, fair enough. And actually I ended up hanging out with Spaniards most of the time just because they were there when I was there before the English kids and I ended up with a bunch of Spanish friends. Nothing against the English, but it was just like I ended up with Spanish friends. Except for pull down the hole. who is like a punk rock kid, you know, listening to wire, but like very polite, you know, make you a cup of tea and put on something really nasty. So when you got back to New York, you were still in university. No, I was, I was done. And I think I worked. in a record store for a year and sold like 8 trillion copies of what was it, Belly or something and then moved out to New York after that. It was like 1991 or something. By the time I graduated it was 1994 and then moved out to New York in early 96. Ended up kind of in the middle of the Ilbian scene and all that stuff at the time. There was cool art exhibitions going on. I think my favorite stuff was DJ Olive, who became a friend of mine and just really made great stuff and made great ambient music and super sick beat music. It certainly seemed like the Ilbian stuff. It seemed like this revolution, but once they put that awful name on it and everything... Whose fault was that name, anyway? Not me. Okay, I'm glad, because I was going to have to punch you in the nuts. Glad we averted that disaster. Wouldn't be the first time on the exchange. Did it seem like there was something really happening at that moment in New York? Yeah, it was cool. Well, it seemed like also a transitional time because when I got there, there was like the remnants of the 70s and 80s New York were kind of still present but kind of leaving the building. Like every once in a while I'd hear people go, man, New York is not what it used to be. I'm just, you know, like it was cool. Like you used to be able to afford to live here and do your stuff. And now it's just like, I don't know, it's like for bankers. And I'm kind of thinking to just go to like upstate or whatever. So you'd hear somebody kind of shuffle off into the sunset like that. I think I just did the exact same The more they change, the more they stay the same. It's gotten more and more expensive, and now I found myself saying that exact same stuff. I realized I was telling a friend, yeah, it's just really expensive. When I showed up, I could work two days a week and just type some shit, and that was cool. But now, man, I don't know. I mean, you totally avoided the cliche by not moving upstate. Yeah, I moved to Colorado. It's kind of bucking the trend a little bit. But what was going on musically otherwise in the city around that time when you got there? Oh, some really great stuff. I think tonic was a huge thing in the history of downtown music in general. and it's particularly in that time. There's like Knitting Factory and Tonic are kind of like two pretty major historic things. And my friend Brian, who does Bunker and all that, he was throwing his parties at Tonic. And I had known him from, he had done a really great party on Sunday. Smith Street on Sundays for a long time at Halcyon when I was over there. And then when you moved over there, checked out that party. And there was always great music going on. It was like, you know, avant-garde klezmer punk. And then in the basement, you know, like house music or whatever. And tonic. Yeah, tonic. Yeah, because they had two floors. The basement was like... the dirty club, they had big wine barrels and you can hang with your friends in total darkness. What else was going on? You said these clubs were legendary for those who weren't around at that time or don't know about it. What was so legendary feeling about it? It was shielded from the pressure of money, of finance. It was like a space where you could just go hear some good, weird shit in a safe environment that was like, you know, your stuff might get stolen, but generally you're not going to get jacked or whatever. It was like pretty decent. decent space and the music was always great and because they weren't particularly under a huge amount of financial pressure you were pretty much sure you were going to check out something pretty amazing. I remember going to see Bunker shows and it being $5 and my mind being slightly blown by the fact that there was anything in New York I could do for $5 that was that much fun. And that space, too, was like a small little dank basement, but somehow the vibe was just amazing, you know, everybody dancing together or whatever. Or if it was like Phenomena, it was like DJ Olive's night with Toshio Kajiwara, and they would have Christian Mark layer somebody in, and it would just be like mind-bending, great, like, textural weirdness, and you could just hang out with your friends in the dark and listen and chat. I mean, it's one of those things that I can't really explain why it was awesome, but gee, it was awesome. I think, obviously, it was also that it was small enough that you could have an electronic music event and not have to worry. too much about how many people you got in the door. So it's a huge load off of your mind, I guess, as a promoter or something like that. It gives you the freedom to bring in almost anyone you would want. Take some chances. I think for a while, Brian was trying to do bills where he was booking the upstairs and the downstairs, and he was doing kind of crazy psych rock. with people on social registry and that kind of stuff, and upstairs and downstairs was dance music. And it seems like the crowds never really gelled. It never really seemed like the people that went in to see Gang Gang Dance would be like, oh, yeah, house music, or whatever. It seems like it was, in a way, kind of separated. But it was still an amazing scene. anybody that was interested in both things it was just ideal. What were you doing? You were already making music by that point in a pretty serious way. Yeah, yeah. I think at that point I had even started to release with the agriculture label. This is DJ Olive's label, correct? Yep, DJ Olive's label. And Brian actually was their label manager at that point, and that was still when he was doing the party back on Smith Street. And I think I gave him a disc or something that had this weird piece. Actually, at CX Kidtronic, my childhood friend, his voice all looped and crazy and weird, you know, this kind of, like, strange, chugging. and he said this would mix really well with techno and he goes I want to get this on vinyl let's see if we can get a release with agriculture so he brought it to DJ Olive and released a couple of vinyls in 2004 and then record, I think, end of 2004. Agriculture seems to have a pretty specific sound, which is that it doesn't really have a specific sound, exactly. Yeah, yeah. I mean, no vocals generally, or at least not vocals with lyrics. Not like singing, usually. more like textural voices or that kind of thing. It was really more of a vibe. Like DJ Olive just knew kind of what he didn't want. He was like, basically, don't be too pop. But I had kind of been absorbing his sound a lot through just seeing him play almost every time he played because I was into his stuff. I think the thing we connected on was dub music because that was like a huge thing when I was a kid. I discovered... kind of simultaneously, craft work and dub music. In Texas, I had a friend that had a 7-inch of the robots, and I remember, like, went over to his house and had a sleepover and playing, like, side A, you know, the robots, just, like, over and over for, like, an hour, not even switching to the other side, just like, what the fuck is that? I've never heard this. What the fuck is that? going on you know like sound that like if you think about the sound design in the beginning of that those like little weird bleepy noises it's like totally you know had never heard a thing like that ever so eventually after an hour we flipped it to side b and listened to that too but i was i was hooked i was like this is like a shit ever really And then kind of simultaneously heard Sly and Robbie through my uncle, who used to be like a college radio DJ. And he was always kind of like giving suggestions and stuff. And he's like, oh, you might like this. And I picked up a vinyl. I went into the record store to pick up. I wanted to find a Sly and Robbie vinyl. And first of all, I was super surprised because I'm like 12 asking for a Sly and Robbie. and Robbie vinyl, but I brought it home, and it's actually still to this day one of my favorite albums of all time. At the time, it was just called Reggae Greats. I think you can download it now. Finally, it's available as a dub experience or something like that. It's like at that turning point when reggae was... going into Digidub and they were starting to use Lindrums and all that stuff except for this particular one. All of the backing tracks, they're band tracks and I think a lot of them were recorded with Black Uhuru. They're like dubs of their Black Uhuru productions with Sly and Robbie and I think Scientist is on it as well. digital effects were coming in and they were getting really into like the weirder more like sci-fi stuff because it was after Star Wars and all that so All the sounds were crazy pitch-shifted delays. It's absolutely a gorgeous record and still worth a listen. It holds up. I play it for people and they lose their mind. They're like, I didn't know this existed. What the hell? That kind of thing. So the major inspiration, those two things that basically set off my whole taste for everything. It seemed like when I met Gregor, when I met Olive, we had... dub in common and it seemed like developing a challenge to develop a record that was like super organic but also like super electronic and I had been interested in that in the first place because when you listen to a lot of electronic music it's all squared off it's your little you know 16th note squares like your TR-909 gives you your one two three four five six seven eight But I like the way real drummers, I play drums sometimes, I like the way real drummers have a kind of a feel that has a kind of a surging type of a feeling that can uplift in a different way. Of course, straight up banging electronic music with 1, 2, 3, 4 is amazing, but I also am really into that kind of looser. feel. So I got into making recordings of myself tapping on my computer. Like I would record for like an hour and just play anything I could think of. And then I would cut it up into a little loop. in Recycle, and I could use that then as a quantize. So I would snap every sound in the entire song to a grid, but it wasn't snapped to 1, 2, 3, 4. It was snapped to like... kind of a thing. So the pieces of music on that record end up... The reason why it's called The Push-Pull, it's the name of the first record, is that... It has that rubbery type of rhythmic feel. A lot of people, when it came out, it got pretty well reviewed. Pitchfork liked it a lot, and people were saying, I don't know what it is about this record. It's different. It's like, well, that's what it is. It's got a human heartbeat with all the beeps and boops and everything. Did you... When you first released that record, I mean, do you go back and listen to it and think to yourself, yeah, I got that right? Yeah, I hadn't heard it for a really long time, and I was... preparing to move, and they said, hey, we did a second pressing of your record, and we have a lot of them left. And I said, oh, sure. So I picked up a bunch of them and put it back on, and I was like, yeah, yeah, that's good. Plus, the other thing is that a lot of times people, if they meet me and they know my music, they're like, hey, your first record is awesome. And I have that moment where I'm like, have you heard anything I did okay that's good yeah it's thanks yeah um you'd been doing a lot of music leading up to that I assume trying to get to a place where you felt like you had something to say or you know this like fully formed idea how long did it take to put together that record uh I I was on fun employment, so it took about four months of super solid work. And it was a really good period. And I think for me, getting stuff done is about... having a purpose, like a gig or a particular idea, a concept, and that's pretty much in everything. If I'm asked to do a specific site piece, like I was asked to play in a cave and make a soundtrack for a public event of celebration of their natural park and this cave in a small town in Japan. which is like my dream gig. Like, here, let's go to this crazy place in a cave and make music for the bats. So it's really easy for me to get excited about stuff when it's really specific. I think earlier you were... talking to Leslie Flanagan and she was talking about the idea of like narrowing your options and I think like I also went to art school like in college for handmade books and really thought about you know the nature of the empty canvas and what you can do to start something. And also the nature of, like, linear, like, storytelling and stuff, because a book is... you flip the pages and you have a linear experience from beginning to end. The song is really similar. So I got pretty interested in placing limitations on myself and using those to develop the concept. What does music for bats sound like? Well... Or what was the approach that you decided to take with it? Well, I realized that it was a really specific sonic space, so the very first thing I did was I developed a reverb that I thought was probably pretty close to what it was going to sound like. Were you right? Yeah, I was pretty right. We made a live recording in the cave, actually. Live recording sounds a lot better because it's not a synthetic reverb, but when I was composing, I composed it all. through the reverb almost entirely wet, like not listening to much of the actual dry signal. So it was composed specifically to be like a reverberant sound, you know, and music as well. And I, you know, tracked some violins and some other like instruments and, but also used like synthetic tones and that kind of stuff. I was really at that time just starting to get into kind of more esoteric sound design stuff in software. Because for years I was a hardware person, you know, dragging a sampler to the gig, you know. Even after people started showing up with laptops, I was like, you know. had a cassette recorder because I had time in between when I was loading my next floppy disk, and I'm here with bizarre noises on cassettes. But that was sculptural, basically. Reverberant and sculptural. You said you were lugging around hardware for longer than most people. people. You made the jump though at some point. Oh sure. Oh sure. What was the, it was just, I'm tired of taking this stuff. Yeah, it was a pain in the ass. And also I felt like I was kind of like running up against limitations that were not limitations that I was placing on myself. It was just like, yeah, it was just a pain. So, and. And particularly if you're going to travel and do a gig, it's just so much easier to have a smaller setup. What does your setup look like today? Well, I'm going to play at the festival. I'm just using a laptop, and I'm using a machine. I'm using a machine. It's a pretty square 1-2-3-4 machine, but I'm using it for... predominantly live manipulation of hi-hats and snares and stuff. So just to be able to have control over those dynamics and that kind of stuff. Using it as a MIDI controller as well to trigger other parameters in software. performative like you can see things being done and you can tell what's been done is that important to you but you know that aspect of people being able to see it's it's not to me because i know it is to a lot of people but when i go to a show i don't like watch the dj like i'm there for the sound i'm like one of those people that's in front of the speaker half the time kind of like just in it. But I do understand people like a show. I've been doing a project with Sasha from Alka-Rex that's called Conk, and we've done a couple of shows with crazy weird costuming and stuff. And that seems to kind of bridge that gap. People just want something to look at, period. What kind of costume are you in? Boy, this is a tough one to describe. I've been drawing weird, this kind of strange cartoon character. like forever and I've got this one that's got kind of a slightly disturbing but kind of cute looking face it's just kind of two holes it's like a hole that looks almost like a nose or something and then one looks like an eye but it's really it's a super simple shape super abstract but it's instantly recognizable as a face and actually as a facial expression but you can't tell if it's smiling or if it's horrified or what's going on. So Sasha was really into it, and I had kind of been high or something and drew a picture of like... Us performing as this character, you know, I thought it was ridiculous and Sasha was flipping through my notebook and he's like this is it man and I'm like What we were gonna come play We were gonna come play in Colorado actually and we're like we're like what can we do because these people are freaks What can we do to just like make everybody like lose their shit? So we did that we develop with a friend who's a costume designer and we developed these you know these monster heads weird outfits. We're wearing like white, all white, like a body suit and then this strange, strange head. So you look like the residents. Yeah, basically look like the residents. Yeah. So you, how long have you been working with Sasha doing stuff? Like what? Five, six years, right? Yeah. How did you guys meet? I'm pretty sure it was Tonic, right? In Tonic, in the basement. Yeah, it was the wild days. Yeah, and we started hanging out at some point in their studio, in Alkarek's studio, and just made some tracks that were... sounded like my stuff and like Alkerex, but also really pretty different. So we were like, oh, cool, done. What does his stuff sound like and what does your stuff sound like? Alkerex stuff is more straight techno, I think, and it's got a little more of a... We both have a sense of humor. But I think their stuff is more kind of trippy sound design. My stuff has some sound design in it, but it's more kind of groovy. But I think we both connected on... having sound design that was avant-garde but approachable because it's a little bit silly that you know there's sounds that we we think about things in terms of you know storytelling and and the sounds that we make we get ideas and images and sometimes doing animation and stuff and so like for example we're working on tracks for we just finished a record and When we were working on it, we were thinking, we've got to have these lead sounds are going to be like a character, like they're an animal. It's like a mountain goat on the top of a mountain looking down at this chasm that its mate has just fallen down the chasm to its death. It's a melancholic mountain goat. Yeah, it's up at the top going like... We did that electronically. And then I called up my friend Takuya, who's a really good trumpet player. And I'm like, let's do a session. So we got in there and I'm like, okay, talk. So we want your trumpet to sound like a goat that's on the top of a mountain and it's lost its mate. And he looked at us and he's like, cool. Start rolling. He totally nailed it. It's really kind of special stuff. It's nice. It seems like humor is hugely important in the creative process for you. Yeah, I mean, I think it's a way to connect with people on a really basic level. Music does anyway, but I think if people don't take it so seriously, it's a way for people to approach. your music too because they're not like, oh, it's so avant-garde. Like I don't understand it or whatever. I mean, if you go to art school, you're supposed to be able to understand anything, but like there's some things I'm like, yeah, I get why you're doing that, but I'm really. could have heard about it. I don't actually have to be here listening to it because it kind of sucks or whatever, but I like to make avant-garde stuff, but I like to make avant-garde stuff that's interesting and also super fun at the same time. I mean, I kind of like fun. Did you come out of art school thinking that? I got to shy away from any of that. style of stuff? No, not specifically because I had friends, like I was making books with friends that were pretty serious. Like when I first got to New York, I was working with this books collective called Bookland that has done really well over the years. And like some of our work, we got into the exhibition in... in the Metropolitan and was bought by MoMA and stuff. So I had some kind of nice success, not like huge financial success, but like success in the art world early. And that was the kind of thing that was like, oh, okay. Because I didn't feel like I had to strive to do some bullshit stuff. I felt like a lot of times... in the gallery, in the art industry, there's a lot of like, I have to go to this party to meet these people to get a Chelsea show, and it's all political, and I felt like it was nice to just connect with people that were more like, at those institutions. They're more all about the work, and they're just into concept and talking with you about what they're doing. It's less about the social aspect, and it's less Machiavellian for sure, because those places are established for a long time already. Tell me about these books that you were making. How would I go about making a book? Well, it's actually pretty simple. There's a lot of easy ways to make a book. When I was a kid, I would just take a stapler and ka-chow, ka-chow, and you've got a book. But if you get a book on bookbinding, it's actually surprisingly simple. And art books are specific in that a lot of times... they tell you to think about it as a continuing panel, almost, as if you took a really long painting and you folded it up accordion style, and then you fastened one end. So it's got that linear feeling. But there's a lot of really fascinating work being done. I think that a book as an object has changed a lot because of the internet, that books are no longer purely utilitarian objects because a lot of the uses for a book are now being taken over by our phones and other things. It's almost freed the book to be a very specific... object and create its own like deeper identity or something like that. Yeah, why did you get out of it? Because I like the immediacy of sound. It always kind of, I always felt like it was a drag. doing all the cutting and folding and taking all the time to do, because I'm not a very, like, I know a lot of bookmakers who are, like, these very orderly, fastidious, you know, put on Brahms and fold paper for seven hours kind of people, and I'm just like, can't really do that. So I made books that were strange and had weird, like, sometimes electronics in them. Like, I had one that had, like, a playback head, because I was into Laurie Anderson as a kid, had, like, a tape playback head in it, and, you know. Or no, you had a stylus with a playback head and then there's tape, magnetic tape on the pages and it would mumble at you. You'd roll the stylus over the pages and it would go like... So even then I was getting into sound. And you also do, you're still sketching all the time. Yeah, I've been doing some illustrated shoes, painting on shoes. larger scale drawings and stuff. I did a chalk, a large chalk installation at a gallery I was part of in New York. Tell me about the shoes. I mean, what's the hard thing about painting on shoes? What do you have to know? It's a small surface area, so you've got to be really focused and really hit. really folk in a really focused way which I probably wouldn't have thought to do it except that I went to Japan and I have artist friends over there that are in the graffiti scene and a lot of them do like they'll do tags on shoes or they'll do some shoe art and and then I was in a shoe store and they had an artist collective had created a shoe company that made 99% recycled materials sneakers that were called worn again and it was like they made like they took leather that was going to be thrown away and they broke it down into fibers and added like a polymer to it or something and made like a new kind of leather and then they were making the soles out of like bicycle tires and melted down car tires and stuff. So I thought that was like a really sick idea that it was like a sustainable consumer business practice. And the shoes themselves didn't have a bunch of shit all over them. They were just like pretty plain, but super stylish, really well styled. And I thought like, wow. my friends would like kill these shoes so I ended up doing like a presentation to the company to work with Japanese artists actually to come over to do shoes and then like the following week I got a phone call like oh they actually decided to stop making shoes and go back to being an arts collective So they're like, we'll just sell you every pair of shoes we have in the shop for $5 a piece or $10 or whatever it was. I was like, done. So I ended up doing a series, doing them all myself. What is on them? Characters or is it design? It's actually really abstract. I've ended up doing abstract stuff. It's multi-layered abstract stuff. A lot of times it's kind of about the process of finding satisfying forms and then the multi-layered part is by subtracting, like putting black over the top or another color over the top. bringing forward areas that I think are strong and pushing back other areas. Do you find the music making process similar? Absolutely. Yeah? Yeah. It's very much additive, subtractive, what you can do with electronic instruments, especially on a computer with a DAW. you add and you subtract and you add and you subtract and the process speaks to you. Like if you're in that kind of more Zen mind state of like being receptive to the work itself will kind of tell you the story of itself and how to make it work. Is it tough to finish things? I don't think so. It can be tough to finish things if you don't really have a strong concept or an idea of what you want to do. Sometimes I'll start something... and not with nothing in mind and that might be hard to finish but I think once there's a certain point at which a particular sound will come forward that catalyzes and it makes the whole you can almost even visualize the track in your head or even instinctively just based on one sound sometimes like for example There's a track on the Community Compilation that a couple of my friends put together, Jeremy Everett and Lauren Higgins, and I was like, oh, give me the stems. Those sounds are great. I'd like to work with it. I was kind of fooling around with this really... bizarre rhythm on the guitar part and found this one short loop that was just like absolutely crazily, stupidly, amazingly funky and I'm like, alright. The whole track came just from hearing that. I knew exactly what to do with it. So it's really about being open and receptive to like your interpretation of what you've got in front of you and just kind of feeling that. path forward, not knowing, not, you know, seeing the house on the other side of the mountain, but seeing, like, the path that goes over the mountain to the house. How hard is that? Oh, that's like falling off a log. You recently moved to Boulder. Denver, actually. Sorry, Colorado. Yeah, yeah. Why? I mean, you mentioned New York. This is so expensive, man. Also, I have friends here that I really get along with and just crack me up. And I would come back and visit. it a lot. Because they have good parties here a lot of times. I'll see the same people that are playing in New York and in Montreal or wherever. They'll come out here. And I would see them play in New York and then I would happen to be here and see them play here. And I'd be like, holy shit. I mean, not to put New York down, but the party here was so much funner. part of it too. So you came out here to party? I came out here to party basically. I felt like I was not drinking enough and I was just too busy to get fucked up basically. What do you want to do out here though? What is the plan over the next year or so? More music and artwork. I think I was in a job, a jobbity job job in New York for the last couple of years, which was, you know, on one level kind of necessary to set me up for my current adult way of living, but in another way was incredibly depressing and kind of... like soul deadening in a horrible way, like working, working for a marketing department that like where my office window literally looked out over ground zero. And I'm like, this is not really my life. But yeah, just having the time to make large artworks, make music. In a way, I'm not trying to claw my way to the top. I'm just really interested in projects and doing projects, and that's totally fine with me. I do a gig every once in a while, every couple months or something. the summer quite a few gigs but for me like that's enough like I don't want to have the life of like Mr. Turing guy who has like a million friends but he knows all of them like 17% of what he could if he actually lived in the place and I just kind of I like the idea of having human relationships that are like deeper I'm also not 20 I'm like 40 years old. So for me, having a place with a backyard and gardening with my roommate and being able to make... I took the last three weeks and made 10 tracks. I just can't really do that so much in New York. It's nice. So that's what we have to look for. forward to in our 40s, gardening with our roommates. Unfortunately. You might play some Brahms and fold paper for seven hours. Well, thank you very much, David. I really appreciate it.
