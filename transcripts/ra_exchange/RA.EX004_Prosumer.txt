Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Ryan Keeling and I'm a staff writer at Resident Advisor. I'm pleased to bring you the next in Resident Advisor's Exchange series with Akin Brandenburg, or Prosumer as you might know him from his residency at Berlin's Panorama Bar, and work with the club's imprint, Oskar Ton. Prosumer has made a name for himself these past few years through his classic rooted house sound and all his heartfelt DJ sets. As a conversation at his Berlin apartment earlier this month revealed, honesty is very much Prosumer's policy. We chatted about his struggle for self-belief, the rise of UK funky and his deep-seated relationship with house music. I grew up in Saarbrücken, not actually Saarbrücken, St. Ingbert. It's a small town southwestern Germany at the French border. It's an area... Most people when they're here in Saarland, which is the area, they think of its history of industrial happening there like coal and steel industry, but it's actually a pretty beautiful space. close to France. What we say there about life is "Hautsach gut Gess" which means basically food is the most important thing so you learn to enjoy life there and I think I know also here in Berlin a lot of people coming from there and you can spot them. They know about food and they know how to enjoy life in that way. Well, techno-wise you would think it's... How's in techno-wise? You would think it's a blank spot on the landmark and sure it was, but I was... Yeah, I was really lucky because one guy started a hardwax branch there in '94. And yeah, so all of a sudden I was exposed to a lot of music I didn't know and I was able to buy all these. these records in a small town and that must have been quite a big thing for a small town yeah definitely i mean uh uh i think um yeah sure at that time i i wasn't wasn't aware about how special that that was i mean i only knew what i knew so i i I wasn't aware that in most other cities didn't get that selection of records. I mean, we got stuff, the guy who was basically behind it, he really was good at knowing, okay, this is essential and he stocked that. that stuff and there were prescription records he bought I don't know how many but they lasted for many years so they were sold out basically everywhere else and I was lucky to be able to buy them even years later and I'm yeah it's still a lot of fun to remember all these faces coming into to the shop going through the sections "Really? You have that?" Every time somebody came from outside of the city we had a lot of people obviously coming from France but also internationally. What were the popular styles in the store at that time? Oh, '94 when it opened and I started buying there. The relief stuff was really big, casual, then the prescription balancing started, European labels, Jackson Beat was really big at the time, yeah, stuff like that. And the nearest city was Frankfurt, is that correct? Yeah, there was... Luxembourg is not far from Saarbrücken but I think there was nothing really going on then there were parties in Mannheim Ludwigshafen okay which is like halfway to Frankfurt I used to go to party stairs sometimes but Frankfurt being its biggest thing Were you partying much in the early days? Not really I mean mostly I stayed in South Britain and we had a quality scene I would say If I look back the acts I saw playing in Saarbrücken, like we had people like Chez Damier playing and Claude Young and Jeff Mills and for a small city that's quite good. Yeah, I imagine. And also, yeah, it was, I think it makes a lot of difference on how you receive things when you don't have to go to a bigger city to a big rave, but it's actually happening in your hometown. Was there anything before? full house music for you in terms of electronic music? I was always, yeah, my main source for music was the radio station in Saarbrücken and there was one of the guys running shows there. He was obviously more interested in in dance and he was also running a show called Super Maxis where they played all the extended mixes and I was always more interested in into the synthy stuff, new romantics stuff like that, the electronic always. got me more and yeah when House and Acid radio style started happening I really really liked that and then I had this phase where my sister she was really into goss and industrial music for a while I really dig that for a while but then Hardworks opened and then there was House. What about the DJing side of things? What sort of year and time period did that first come about? Well, I started DJing at parties of friends, 95, 96. I don't remember if it was 96, 97, something like that. I had the first residency at a bar there. It was a really, really great bar. in Saarbrücken and me and Franz used to DJ there on Thursday nights. And you were playing house in those early days? House, techno, I was more techno at that time but basically mixing all the styles. And what was behind your decision to move to Berlin? It was 2000, was it? You moved to Berlin? 99. 99, okay. Well, in 99 I moved to Potsdam because I was studying there and in 2000 I moved to Berlin. Yeah, basically the main reason for moving was studying, but I... basically also always knew okay i don't want to live in suburbia for the rest of my life i mean yeah sure it is a great city i still have close friends there and for its size it offers a lot but still yeah and what was your impression of Berlin when you first moved here? My first impression about Berlin was before I moved here first time I was in Berlin it was 92 or something with my parents. I basically don't remember much but Potsdamer Platz still being nothing. Really? Yeah, I remember this huge blank spot in the middle of the city and thinking, oh, this is weird. And then in '96 I was here with Hannah who was running the Hardwax shop in Saar-Putten. Being in Berlin for the first time properly. yeah driving into Berlin exciting stopping at Cote d'Azur, horrible also a year later I came to Berlin by train and changed at a station to the subway and got out at Cote d'Azur and thinking oh my god this is so I cannot stand it. I never want to live here and now it's my closest subway stop. You must have seen some quite big changes in Kreuzberg, in the city over the last 10 years then. Definitely. But really first there were parts I hated, there were parts I... loved immediately. Which were? As example, this flat, my landlord is Mark Anestos from Basic Channel and he's running Hardwax here. I was at this flat for the first time in '96 and I saw the walls and I said, "Wow, I want this!" Luckily, in 2000 he moved out and I was moving in. So it's really my dream flat. And also the restaurants are still... go to. I first time went to years ago, yeah, 96. I really love this part of Berlin. I love it that I think there are few areas where it's that mixed that you have people of all kinds of income living here. I mean, at Paulinka Ufer you have... really rich people and other buildings, you can tell. So you've always lived in Kruisberg? I moved into this flat 2000 first Berlin flat and staying here ever since. And how do you say the scene was when you first got here particularly for house music? First year I was basically focusing on studying very much. I was not paying too much attention. What I remember, the Jazz and Oversing at that time was really big. Were you actively pursuing trying to get gigs at that point? I'm really bad at Klinkenputzen, you say in German. I'm really bad at promoting myself. I was a very insecure, strange person at that time. I think if I would have approached somebody asking "Hey, can I get a DJ gig?" their answer would have been "No". But what was that down to? Was it just a lack of self-confidence or you weren't... Yeah, total, total, no, saying a lack of self-confidence, I basically, to be honest, used to hate myself. I really wasn't at good terms with myself. Was that just internal struggles? I had no idea who I was at that time. I mean, I was almost 26 when I found out I was gay. It took me that long and I really had no idea who I was. I was really trying to be but I never was so that changed. Would you say it was kind of a turning point for you when you did finally come out and embrace that? It's not that simple. That changes a lot. It's part of it. I mean, yeah, like I always see the relationship to my father used to be really, really bad for years and years and years. And the reason is we are really much alike. And we basically got to know each other in the last 10 years. We had no good relation. It was always fighting and a big part of things between me and my father. becoming better is saying hey, dad, I think I'm gay because you force somebody to look at okay, this is my kid and I mean most people I think their parents still see the kid like with my mother I will always be the small the little boy and um yeah she has more difficulties with uh adjusting to to who I am now she she doesn't see the person I've She sees the kid she raised and with my father it's different. He basically knows who I am now. Yeah, I think I used to suffer from depression a lot. I used to be really insecure. I think basically maybe I just wasn't ready for the world. Yeah, I think it just took me a long time to... discover who I am and to like who I am. There are so many people in this world who always try to be different than who they are and I did the same for many years and it made me unhappy. Thank you. So what about now though? Do you feel more relaxed and comfortable in yourself? And has Berlin given that to you? Definitely. I mean, Berlin... I think people planning to move to Berlin, especially in the world of house and techno, they see the crazy party weekends. And I think they underestimate the rest of it. Berlin is a great city, but Berlin is also pretty rough. You definitely have to face yourself in this city. That is rough but it's also really rewarding. I think Berlin forces you to be yourself because if you fake it, it won't work here. You can fake it in a small city but you can't fake it here because you will always fall flat on your face. Why do you think that is? I mean, Berlin... For me personally, Berlin makes you look at things differently. A lot of cities have a beautiful icing, you have beautiful buildings, everything is clean and Berlin, well you have these areas with obvious beauty but it makes you see things differently I think you have to discover the beauty blow the fills maybe and I think that that changes a lot and that also changes the perception of people and they notice more easily if they're just being blinded by something in the foreground which seems beautiful but isn't. Yeah. And what about as an artist now? Do you feel like you're comfortable with what you're doing and you're confident in your abilities and what you're trying to put across to people? Yeah. just been something that's happened over many years um i always knew i had uh some kind of talent and uh i i'm i'm really grateful for for all the lucky coincidences which uh me to to do what i uh do now and um and yeah the the confidence i have in myself is that i know being honest in what i do yeah i think that's uh what i can do then doing that and um if people like it great if people don't like it well okay this is what i do then um yeah there might come a time i won't won't be successful with what i'm doing anymore but uh i think i will be okay with that because uh yeah it's it's really important to stay true to myself for me and really say okay I did the best I could and this is me and I'm putting myself out there and the music I love. What specifically did you always feel like you had a talent for? To sense people in a way, I would say. Some weeks ago when I DJed... A friend of mine, she usually was never sober when she went to party and she said that she just stopped doing drugs for partying. And she came to me and said: I wasn't enjoying anymore going out because I wasn't feeling it and your set I hear now is the first that I can feel for a while because you're sober, I'm sober and it totally works for me and this was basically the biggest compliment I could get that evening. because yeah it's it's I'm happy to to get the feedback that I have to determine to to reach people like that even if they say okay for the moment it's not working for me yeah sure I mean do you feel like yours is an ability to to really read and connect with what people are feeling and what maybe they need at the time when Just on a very basic level. Sure, I won't succeed doing this every night I'm DJing. Everyone has good and bad nights, but I think on a good night I definitely can do that. About a year ago I read on a blog for the period of time of my set for somebody that made everything bad go away and him just being trapped, not trapped. Trap sounds too negative. What's the word? Well, just being in a world of music and happiness. wow, I mean, what bigger compliment can you get? Do you think there's always been a sense of that in the music that you've played? A sense of escapism and, you know, just like... I mean, music always has been my escape from reality, always. Sure, this will be, you know... Do you think that's... With house music in particular. Do you think that's maybe there was something in house music that kind of resonated with you and allowed you to um, yeah Definitely. I mean it's it's it's really you often get a better version of the world. In a lot of house music I personally feel understood and found. What was it, do you think, about those early Chicago records? What specifically was in those? tracks that I don't know that allowed people to feel these things and to get this release? What is it for you? Honesty I think it is because if I now look at the UK Funky releases coming out now with they have the same quality for me. It's really those people, they don't think too much about what they do, they just do. And it's always honest and it's not like, "Ah, this could work now." Sure, you always think that a bit, but I mean, we're exposed to how many years of techno in house now? We all know what works. And I think as a producer, it's different. to ignore that you will always fall for what works and that might even might be preset in your mind and not yourself. I think in the beginning of a style you're always more free to really bring yourself to the music and I think that was what always gets me in all the early house and techno stuff. really the honesty of the people and naivety in a way talk about my own stuff I'm pretty much aware that I will for me the craze will probably stay my best record because In that record I really bring myself with a naivety I don't have anymore. And also if you look at the lyrics, I'm longing for something. this longing cannot be this big anymore because it became my reality in a way. I speak about join me on the dance floor, won't you dance with me? When I hear his music, feel the beat. I get to go dancing, gotta move my feet out on the floor. What about House in Berlin for these last 10 years? Have you ever... Have you ever kind of felt like it's been in the shadow to techno at all? Have you ever struggled with the sound that you're pushing? Ummm... I wouldn't say struggle. I mean Berlin is a techno city. It is. It's really... If you look at the buildings, most of them scream techno and don't say house. If you ask people for the sound of Berlin, a lot of people associate the basic channel style with it nowadays. If you ask people for the style of Berlin, it's people like Marcel Dettmann who are in the foreground of what people associate. It is a techno city. I don't have the feeling that I have... struggled. I mean, just because something is more out there, it doesn't necessarily mean that something else has to struggle, fight, whatever, to exist. I mean, I remember great house parties over... so many years here in Berlin and it's not a struggle. Sometimes as a DJ, I mean obviously as a DJ you don't always get booked for exactly what you do but also get booked for a promoter to be able to put the name Berghain on the flyer so sometimes if I go somewhere it's obvious that people expect something else from me than what I do and that can be a struggle but and what was your What kind of introduction to producing tracks? Basically I started buying gear. A friend of mine, he had some stuff. He showed me some of his equipment and the first things I got was a was the Space Echo and the 707, both stuff I always loved in productions and basically I'm quite sure always will. And I was just playing around with that and started getting more equipment and was making music for myself. my bedroom. And how did the hookup with Playhouse come about for the craze? I just sent them a demo. Oh really? It was that simple? Yeah. I mean obviously I was working at Hardwax in Saarbrücken later and those people knew the Playhouse people so I could have gone that way through people, knowing people but I... I thought no, okay, I definitely prefer just to send a CD and yeah, Adar got back to me and they released it. Would you say Playhouse has been quite a key label for you down the years? Well, for a while they definitely were. For a while they released a lot of... quality music. Definitely they were also breaking stuff. Like if you look at "Play's Lovely Day" even putting out a video. for that. If you don't know that video, just check it on YouTube. It's great to see Atta going to a bar with a seal. It's hilarious and funny and great. Yeah, I think Playhouse definitely pushed quality music. To talk a little bit about Serenity, how do you feel about it looking back on it now? It's been a couple of years, a bit of space. I mean, the day after I finished something, I always say, I could have done this differently. And so it's still the same. But yeah, there's definitely things I would do different nowadays. But there's enough where I say, OK, I would do it exactly. the same way again and I'm pretty yeah I'm still very happy with the outcome I mean it was amazing how Oscotone trusted us with the release I mean we were the first artist album and they heard the complete album when it was mastered already. It's not that we had to go like "oh this, we have this, what do you think of this?" No, it was us being in total control. They heard some of the tracks but they never heard the whole album before it was mastered. How big a gift is that as an artist? It's amazing. And also working with Murat and Elif was really great. They are both really talented artists and basically for working with them even more important great friends. Breathe. Murat and I, we both were coming out of relationships at that time, pretty much suffering. from that and it was great to work on an album at that time. I think it really allowed us to put a lot of emotion and energy into this and yeah, it's still great for me to see how how much we really could work with each other. I mean, making music is something so personal that I think it's usually quite different to do it not alone. the situation made it possible for us to really work together and really... I always had the feeling that my ideas were resonating with him and the other way around. and also I mean the timing for the album it was great it was It was at a time when everybody started saying "House is back" and I think if we would have released it half a year later the feedback on the album might have been different because of a lot of it being so retro sounding then I think it might have been received by some people somebody's faking sound just to be part of a trend I think yeah the time of yeah when when it came out it was Nobody thought, okay, they're faking it at that time. It was obvious for people, okay, they must be real and honest about it because this is not what somebody puts out now. Yeah, of course. I mean, you just said House was back. Yeah. What was that period of time like when House was away for you? For me House was never away but... I guess I just mean to say was there like was there ever a period of time where you just maybe felt unsure or other stars were popular and you were maybe having to play records you weren't necessarily into 100% or how it was? that i don't don't play well okay i play records i'm into 95 but um um no i mean um uh a lot of the times i was made friends even for using the equipment I use like the 707 was really really cheap when I bought it nobody cared about it everybody's had this is so 80s sounding and all of a sudden it came back and now if you look at people like Tiva Howard and yeah they are all using it again if you buy a 707 now it's much more expensive than what I paid for it What I did seemed too retro for a lot of people for a lot of the times. How would you say the sound has moved on since the album? Also, I'm losing naivety. I'm pretty aware of that. How would you say that? kind of manifests itself in the music? Yeah, as I say, something like the grace, like these lyrics, which I notice if I hear recordings from live shows, there's not... that honesty in the recording when I sing these vocals as it was when I recorded it. I explained that before. What about singing? What about the singing side of things? When did you first start singing? Oh, I was singing as a kid in choirs. how do you say in english my voice dropped yeah okay and uh and obviously that's you stopped singing at that time yeah and um i i was uh i was thinking okay i cannot sing anymore i i um just sang for myself under the shower and I never wanted to release a record with my voice. I just recorded the vocals for The Craze at the time because the melody and the lyrics they kind of appeared and I just had to record them to remember okay this is what I want for it. I always pictured the singer performing it. But then people said like, okay, it's great. Blejo said, oh yeah, we love it. And that's, I mean, to sing better now, but to hear my... voice recorded on a record was so empty. Obviously my voice wasn't also that great at the time. I remember this really really nice review I read about The grace sounds like no fire erasure and Alison Moiré on a bad day. Which I really loved. It took me a long time to become more confident with... the singing again I mean I always enjoyed it yeah it was something like okay if you want to hear that I can do that I'm having fun but are you sure and nowadays I'm really having more fun doing it but in the beginning it was like wow I wanted to talk to you a little bit about the FUNF compilation that's coming out because I found your entry into it very interesting just in that it seemed to be one of the more techie tracks that you've put together. I mean, were you thinking about the other artists and maybe where your track was going to fit into the album or is it just how it came out with the... with the found sounds and the source material? Yeah, I mean, the building is techno. Yeah, sure, sure. And also the sound library. I really hope that they will also make the sound library. accessible. I really hope there will be a webpage where you can listen to the original sound files because it's really not only interesting but parts of it is really just simply beautiful. Obviously the sound material is definitely more techno. If you bang metal on metal, it's techno, not house. And so that basically is the reason why the track... became what it is. Also the RZ1 drum computer I don't have for such a long time. It's the first track I really used it for, really wanted to use it and that's also more techno and Yeah, it wasn't that I was thinking, okay, I have to sound more technical because the other artists sound more technical to fit in. If I would have thought about that, I probably would have. to be as housey as I can. I was interested to know how were the files in the library labelled? Were you all aware of exactly what the sounds were? Well, they were like, there were folders like cooling room, stairs, doors and stuff like that. So it was... pretty much labeled so you never know which fridge it was. And what did you go for? Like a lot of the people I went for the fridges. The fridges really? Their humming is really really great. I recognized the fridges in a lot of the tracks. It's also a lot of fun when you know the sound material to spot them in the tracks the others did. And I... Yeah, Emma, she also recorded the sound of the... couches like the moving leather and somebody moving over it. That's in my track. And how did you get the fridge sound into the track? What did you do with it? It's the melody. There's a more subtle melody in the background that is basically a small... it's the recording of the humming of the fans of the fridge. when taking a small sample and this turned into this melody and what else did I use? Banging doors, the sounds, the squeaking sound when you close the door. And also I not only used the sound material also for the sounds where I didn't use the sound material, I used the room. Like I played all the tracks I used in my track, I played them through the... sound system of Panorama Bar and re-recorded them. I also understand you're mixing the next Panorama Bar CD that's in the mix. When is that coming and is that complete? It's about to... No, it's gonna be released in April, so I have to finish the mix. by January. So there's still a lot of time for that. I know about some tracks I want to use I know already with others I... I was just interested on the licensing side of things, if there was any potential difficulties with some older tracks. Definitely. I will have a meeting with Nick, who's managing the LEGO scene next week, with some stuff where I know it's going to be difficult and where I already know I want to use it. can start working. Staying on the Panorama Bar theme, you've been a resident since when exactly? When did they open? Six years now? So pretty much since the start. How do you think the club and the sound of the club has changed since that time? Well, obviously there has to be change over that long period of time. people have the tendency to always be more interested in the new, especially in Berlin. Like I remember going to concerts when artists released their second album and everybody was the first note, everybody was like... I prefer the first album. So it's a pretty blinzing to say everything used to be better. I mean, I also do that a lot. So, I mean, even from when Panorama Bar opened, you had a lot of people. saying it's not the same thing anymore early um really even even when it opened uh it's it started early so um um i mean uh the Sometimes it is even... I have the impression that people... decided to not like things anymore because it's just not new. I mean, obviously there have been changes, but I think sometimes people are a bit... trying to see changes where there are none. But I mean obviously Panorama Bar used to be something more secretive and something more special just because it was not the most well-known club in the world maybe. I mean nowadays you read in Bild-Zeitung about Berghain Panorama Bar so obviously everybody knows about it. It cannot be something anymore you can say "oh I discovered this for myself, it's my secret place" that's how it felt for me in the beginning even though it was a huge club. So that is gone obviously what everybody keeps complaining about the tourists they come and know about it but I actually also don't like all the people talking so negatively about it's just a bunch of tourists I mean a lot of them really also make a difference because they come with these huge expectations and they bring themselves which is great they come, they want to party and also they contribute to the nights being great and sometimes I think they bring more to the party than people from Berlin who can go there every weekend and say, oh, yeah, there we go again. You were talking earlier about new things and you mentioned UK Funky. Have you or any of the other residents been playing any UK Funky in the club? Yeah. I mean, obviously half of the crowd, if it's more to the dubstep side, on a Saturday night can be irritated about this. Like there's this one track, Clap Trap by Joe on Hassel Audio, which is a really basic rhythm track. Really half of the crowd they hate it, the other half they love it. Still, this is definitely something I want to play even if I know I piss half of the crowd off and the other half they come to me: "Wow, what's this?" Do you mind doing that sometimes if you know you're going to get a reaction whether it's going to be negative or positive? I don't do it on purpose to get a reaction. For me first it's just a great track then I think okay how will people react and if I know that for some people it will be really special for some people this will be the track of the night. Let's talk a little bit about Hardwax. How long have you been working there now? It's about two years now. Okay. And something that's quite interesting to ask you, do you feel like the demand for vinyl in the city and elsewhere is kind of going to be enough to sustain Hardwax for the foreseeable future? I mean obviously we're not just selling vinyl in Berlin we're doing shippings worldwide and As Mark, my boss, always used to say, he started Hardwax when everybody was saying, really, you want to start a record shop? You want to start selling vinyl? Vinyl is dead. People were saying that back in... 21 years ago. People were saying... Okay, it was at a time when nobody had an idea what was going to happen with house and techno. But yeah, he started when vinyl was dead. He's not worried. I also think, obviously people are buying less vinyl than they used some years ago but it's still gonna be enough to survive. I mean, if you ask kids who never owned a record player, never owned a record, if you ask them which of the formats of release is the most valuable, even if they maybe haven't bought a CD, they all say vinyl is the most valuable. It's still the collector's item thing and I'm quite sure it's gonna survive. Do you think Hardworks will ever get into the digital side of things? Yeah, Hardworks is gonna start a download shop as well. Still don't know when that is gonna be but yeah. Where do you feel that your inspiration comes from to write music? Is it listening to house music you love or is it your experience as a DJ? It's basically bringing myself. the name prosumer, the original meaning put aside it also for me I'm pretty much aware that I produce on basis of what I consumed I mean I don't think that some people have to approach music to create something which has never been there before and something unique. For me, uniqueness in the terms of unique feelings, honesty about it, yes, but I'm so aware that... yeah my music wouldn't exist without me being influenced by all the music I've listened to and that being reflected myself and this is a huge inspiration and yeah also my emotional life with some lyrics it's more obvious what was moving me at that time with instrumental tracks. Sure, it's less obvious, but still probably you can tell some of the tracks that I was happy or sad at the time I made it. So it's, yeah, I... Yeah, it seems to be a recurring theme for you, the honesty side of things. It's basically what I... If I say what I do is really self-centered, you can put it in a way like, oh, this sounds bad. But I mean it in a positive way. Still, it can sound bad. but yeah in the end this is what it is
