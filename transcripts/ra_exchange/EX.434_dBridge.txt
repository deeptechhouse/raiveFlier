Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Dbridge. Despite being one of the most respected players in joint bass, the man born Darren White has done as much as anyone to explode our idea of what the genre can be. With his own productions and label Exit, White fluidly builds connections with genetically related styles, building immutable but instantly recognisable sound in the process. The vision was crystallized on his first LP in a decade, A Love I Can't Explain, which was the occasion for bringing in White for a conversation with veteran music journalist Joe Muggs. Together, they trace White's life from his small-town roots to the breakneck evolution of Jungle and his transition into new territories following the founding of Exit. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with D-Bridge is up next. Nice. Hi, Darren. Hey, how are you doing? I'm good. How are things? What's the occasion that we're interviewing you on? What's going on that's important? I'm going to assume it has something to do with the fact that I've finally released my second solo album after 10 years. That might be it. Yeah, we'll go with that. All right. I mean, the obvious question then is what took you so long? I had other things going on in terms of projects, musical projects. It wasn't really sort of at the foremost in my mind. Maybe on a personal level, self-doubt in some respects. I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do and how I wanted it to be. Those are probably the main reasons. But yeah, I think it was kind of like, I think the idea of it, 10 years of it was coming up and that was playing on my mind. This is getting ridiculous now. He's like, you're not D'Angelo. Get on with it. Yeah, I mean, you have been busy. I mean, Exit is a prolific label. Yeah. I mean, what... Aside from recording and kind of realizing that you had to do an album and doing it, I mean, over the last few years, what's been the main focus of your life? Is it DJing? Is it the label? Is it... It's been a mixture of all three things, of three and that and just life in general, I think. You know, I think for the label, it's... The label kind of goes through this kind of cyclical kind of me looking for new artists every now and then. I get a group of artists and they sort of blossom, so to speak. And then I kind of feel like maybe I should start looking for some new artists as well. So that's been going on. The DJing, yeah, that's been a part of it. I've struggled with that a bit over the years as well. I think that's something that a few producers go through in sort of like separation of me the DJ and me the producer. So there's been that. stuff going on. And yeah, moving, leaving England, moving to Antwerp and starting a family. So there's been a lot of sort of, you know, these life things going on as well. And hanging around in the background, of course, is bad company as well. Yeah. Yeah, that was, that was, yeah, that was an interesting project. Usually when people say interesting, it means it's quite, you know. Painful, I think, is usually the euphemism. Yeah, that was fun. It was fun, and then it wasn't. And then it's something I'm proud of in terms of... the history and what it's contributed. But I think looking back on the project itself, I don't think it was fully realised as much as... I'm going to say I hoped rather than we. I don't want to put it on anyone else. So it was something I felt that I needed to get out of my system and something I felt that, why not? I think in some respects I was probably one of the main sticking points in it and us all getting back together as such. But then it was like, you know, I've got nothing to prove. Why not have some fun? It'd be good to hang out with the guys again. Yeah, I don't want to put too much of a downer on it. It was fun, but it wasn't what... It didn't really become what I hoped it would. But I think that's just... the nature of you know these these kind of things you kind of look back on them and like hope that those sort of glory days can be really really really realized and they tend to not i don't want to focus too much on it because this is a deep bridge interview we're here for your stuff exactly um I mean, what did you hope for from getting it back together? I hoped that we would kind of carry on in terms of where we left off in terms of as a group where we were going into this whole sort of, there was this transition we were going into like this digital nation thing, which is all these live... Almost like we were becoming like a digital rock band of some description. Are you saying you wanted to be the new prodigy? Far from it. Even though our manager, who happens to be their manager, would have liked that, I think. But bless... You know, no, it was... That would have been too big. I don't know. I just wanted us to be us. But I think, you know, you grow up and things change. It was almost like the distance of it kind of gave it this image of like, oh, right. Yeah, that was all cool and it was great and everything. But you're almost like there was a reason why we split up as well. And then sometimes that sort of starts to come back around. So was there also a pressure from the fans to be a kind of tribute act to yourselves rather than do something new? Yeah, I think there was in some respects. I think there was almost, there was like these two opposing forces in the sense of like, there was the original fans who wanted us to just kind of like do what we did. and then there's like you know we'd signed to ram and you're in the modern age of drum and bass And you need to create something that can sonically stand up with what's going on right now. What we did then doesn't necessarily work now. For people outside of drum and bass, this is almost difficult to comprehend because the sonic arms race of drum and bass is a real special thing in its own right, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, it is. It's something that I've... tried to steer clear of just because I haven't got a clue to be honest about any of that stuff but yeah it's just when the sort of the details overtake the vibe that's when I personally lose interest as well I just want to kind of let's just get a vibe I don't want to spend five hours sort of sculpting a snare, you know? Yeah. Well, I mean, that takes us quite neatly onto your solo stuff and your solo sound, which seems to me has... kind of been variations on the theme there has it's been exactly the opposite of a kind of arms race you've you've found a mood and you've really worked within it over years i'm very i've i've said it quite often i'm very sort of i'm quite a bit of an emo so i want things that kind of create a feeling or create a an emotional response in me It's quite dreary in some respects, but I think that maybe that's my thing. Sort of like an underlying moroseness. But, okay, I mean, let's go right back to some roots because you were like a Shoegaze and Cure fan. Yeah. As a teenager, same as me. I mean, I grew up in the Thames Valley and that was our music. We were proud of it. And from the outside, it was really easy to take the piss out of boys with fringes over their faces, kind of staring at their effects pedals. And yet, once you're in the thick of it, once you've got your ride record or your My Bloody Valentine record turned up, it's like you're out in the cosmos. It's majestic. It's huge. It's the absolute opposite of dreary. Yeah, exactly. That stuff really resonated with me. um i think i because i grew up in a time as also sort of bruno brooks and the chart show and all that kind of stuff but gary davis yeah it was like when i started to sort of really find my own kind of voice it was that stuff that sort of connected with chapter house and um i suppose the sort of the manchester stuff and um You know the fallen whereabouts did you grow up in in Malvern in Worcestershire? Yeah, so it was it's fairly disconnected Yeah, it was going on as such exactly. So we had smash hits you know, I could say Bruno Brooks and then it was just kind of sort of swapping tapes and Actually, the jukebox down at the Nags Head and the Morgan and just like swapping music with your mates as well. So it was... Were you a goth? Did you dress the part? I didn't go that far with it. I was more into Paisley at the time. That was more my thing. And a really awful leather jacket with a fur collar. And a flat top. I had as well. I love that flat top. That's quite a combination. Yeah, it is. I've got a picture and it is quite a combination. What people don't appreciate is how in small towns, certainly then when you didn't have that much communication with the outside world, like subcultures would kind of bleed together because there'd be only like one punk and one goth in the town. Yeah, exactly. And we were all mates as well. And it was kind of like we are going. up was going up onto the hills and doing drugs for what you know what i mean it was like waiting for the aliens to come yeah pretty much it was that it was you know it was it it wasn't a lot going on we had we did have a nightclub in worcestershire called tramps and you know it wasn't the greatest music but but it was just somewhere for us to connect but Where we were, it was, we started to, you know, as early 90s, it was getting into the kind of early dance music, you know, Castle Morton was just around the corner. So that happened, that had a real big effect on me. And there was just, for me, I think sonically as well, there was this connection between the sort of shoegaze and what Manchester were doing and then breakbeats and dancing. So it was like this natural progression into... So were you going to free parties? Were you, like, experiencing it out under the stars? Yeah, there was a couple. There was a couple. I think I managed to get to a couple DIYs, if I remember rightly. There was a few that we didn't find. LAUGHTER but I think yeah the Castle Morton one was the one the big one because I'd come back to London and my mate was like yeah it's going on and I just got on a train straight back I was like there's no way I'm missing this and I you know I can't remember the obviously there like the police had had it all cordoned off but because we knew the area we knew ways in so I was just like we were literally going in and out as we please it was amazing that's so funny people don't appreciate the connection with drummer bass but I mean obviously the Bristol guys were so connected with that yeah crusty traveller free festival scene I mean you know I've spoken to Crust on a couple of occasions and he kind of puts Castle Morton as like the crux event in his life almost yeah it was it was it was it's weird because obviously you can look you look back with like this whole rose tinted view but it was really out there what was going on and it was just like like I said all these sound systems the ones I already know Spiral Tribe were there And it's just weird, just certain songs I remember, there was that really cheesy hardcore version of a Beatles tune for some reason that stuck with me. Is it Eleanor Rigby? No. That was around that time. I'm not sure which one it was. I didn't make it myself, but there was one DIY at Castle Morton Tape that was just our soundtrack for about two years after that. Pennies from Heaven and like certain and Merc tunes and like, yeah. Yeah, no, it was, it was, so let's say growing up there and having that sort of disconnect in some, some ways from the rest of the world, you know, in a lot of ways, you know, as I was in a band as well, I was a lead singer in a band. We used to do really dodgy covers of like Simple Minds and Steppenwolf and Benny King, which is a real sort of random... We made a few of our own original songs, the Mr. Thomas rap about our geography teacher, I remember that. So it was like... You know, when I left, I still look back at that place and just... love what it did for me because I left London in quite you know I left home when I was 11 and I went to live with my auntie and uncle in Malvern so it was quite a difficult time for me but moving there and then the friends that I've made there and still have it was so important to me and so it's like that whole era of my life in some ways has moulded me into who I am today So what were your ambitions at that time? Was music like did it seize you quite early or were you more interested in academic stuff? I was, at the time, I was more academic. I wanted to go to Bristol University to study real-time computer systems. And I wanted to, I wanted to do like, I remember wanting to create a 3D, like a... an animation like 3D animation movie that was my thing and I think Toy Story came out and it really sort of pissed on my chips so I was like oh okay so because I actually I had to leave I left Malvern and I went back to London and I was studying computers there and then I was so I was learning like I learned about seven or eight different computer languages and I had a conditional acceptance offer to Bristol University and then I went to live with my brother in Jungle and drum and bass sort of quite in the way and decided no you ain't going forget any thoughts you've got on that that's like let's Let's do this. So yeah, that was a quick turnaround. So what clubs were you going to? What were the key ones? The key ones at the time, because I was South London, so we were all about Laserdrome. But we used to go like Roast Astoria, there would be like Orange where I think they did things at Hippodrome. There was, what was the other one? Desert Storm, Lee Valley Trading Estate, they used to do their things. The, what was it, Equinox, those two that they did in Leicester Square. These were quite lawless raves, right? Yeah, I remember actually the first Jungle Fever that was on Curtin Road. I remember that was pretty lawless. I'm pretty sure Channel 4 were there, weirdly enough. And that's when Shoreditch was a wasteland, more or less. Yeah, exactly. I didn't really know too much about it. It was like my brother... used to take me I used to just tag along with him he's like yeah we're going here like okay and be like yeah and it's just it's like almost like years later I was like oh then that was when I was at Plastic People and then suddenly recognising the gateway on the other side of the road like oh right okay that's where I was um But yeah, at the time, it was a strange time. It was kind of like, there's this whole thing of this sort of, you know, talking about the knife culture and things that are going on today. For me, it was like, it was almost just as bad then as well. In the early 90s, it was like, a lot of people were carrying, you know, carrying weapons. And it was like the whole single-band... bandana over one eye and the jeans rolled up. CS gas was quite popular as well. Yeah, and people, like all dayers in like Brockwell Park and people getting stabbed in their bottoms used to be like a weekly occurrence, it felt like. It was, so it's always like, it kind of went hand in hand in some respects, but. At the same time, you know, there's all of that. It was just, there was this underlying energy that you had to be a part of. and I just, you know, I needed to be a part of it. It's that you could choose to kind of mix in all of that if you wanted to, but, you know, it was... It was worth the risk, so to speak. This was my experience as, you know, a really white, small-town boy coming into London and, like, going to the occasional thing, and... going this is terrifying but then once you're in the thick of the dance floor as long as you're participating it was like it was it's still a rave yeah exactly i think early 90s when i was with my brother and we were doing sewage monsters and we we did i did i remember we did a couple pas at um say pa Basically, you put a DAT tape on and pretend to play the keyboard. Those were the days. Yeah, did a couple of them for Desert Storms. And that was around the time as well I kind of linked up with Lenny the Ice and Arms House Crew. And that was sort of... they were in they were doing the what was the the main drum and bass the Carnival they I think it was All Saints I think they used to have the All Saints stage then I was just in the thick of it and just loving it you know I can imagine if you were because I mean they were important players and so you know you were right in the middle because I mean those stages at Carnival were mosh pits as well yeah actual mosh pits yeah I haven't been back to Carnival in so long um But yeah, it's kind of like, that was, you know, kind of on 93, I think 94, I think they were still doing it as well. So it was just, it was weird though. It was kind of like, I was there, but I wasn't, I was very quiet. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. It was like, and I always remember actually being at like Lenny's studio and then them having a meeting like Groove and Navi and... hype and everyone coming round and I was just a little guy, a little spotty kid in the corner just sort of You know, just keep trying to write tunes. But yeah, I've always kind of sort of been weirdly connected with it, you know, with them in some ways. I mean, in terms of the music you were making, were you thinking about self-expression at that time or was it just make a jungle tune? Um... I think I was just learning my craft more than anything. I listened back to some of that stuff. And, you know, it's awful. But you can see the roots and the progression of where I am today. And back then it was like just learning to use these pieces of equipment, the S950 and the Akai S1000 and mixing desks and whatever. So it was like... You were influenced by what you were listening to as well, you know, so, and that's, I think if you listen to, to, to Jungle, it's very, it's quite insular in that way of sort of, we've all borrowed from each other and, but it's been in a progressive way. I think, you know, if you look at the early, it was, in fact, it was lawless. I think in terms of like, a record will come out. And if someone had left their break clean, you'd have that straight away. Do you know what I mean? Or if there was a break, yeah, I'm having that. Do you know what I mean? So it's like, it was all part of the progression. And I think this is like, my main sort of example is like, if you listen to the Amen break, from what it is to what it became and what the different versions is, all through resampling. So sampling was like... what I was really into and trying to get my head around and, you know, listening to like, especially like early Dillinger, you know, like Southside Stompers and all those kind of tracks. stuff on what Moving Shadow were doing all that stuff was really sort of like it used to bug me like how did they do this how did they do this and that was that was what drove me more than anything like I need to kind and learned how to do this. The pace was insane at that point. I mean, really, Jungle was two years. Yeah. It was kind of 93 and by the end of 95 it was done and Drummer Base was off on the next thing. But so, and during those two years, Jungle just evolved and evolved and evolved. day by day not week by week but yeah it did and there was there was like you know i think there was like the whole ragga jungle thing and then there was like the dark side some of it was really sort of like quite creepy you know some really like quite disturbing you know and then that that sort of became a thing and then it sort of i think it's sort of refined itself and dmb sort of as it is, sort of grew out of that, out of that refinement, out of people, I'm personally feeling like they were, I'm maybe moving away from sampling, but just kind of learning, again, like learning their craft and not being so slapdash about it. Like, I've just... seeing what you could throw out and seeing what sticks in some ways is what a jungle was because you listen to it and you're like they're not in key but it works so I think as producers progressed they got better at what they were doing and that's how dnb you know sort of came out of that do you think there's there was a sort of parallel between the sound going into something more refined and kind of replicatable if that's the right word and trying to go towards something more sustainable in terms of a scene that wasn't quite so chaotic maybe i think i uh Because I look at my progression and I think it was like suddenly you were seeing crews were being formed and that was a big part of what was going on. And crews were defining the sound in some respect or defining their own sound. In terms of reinforced and metal heads? Yeah, reinforced heads, like V. So I kind of like, when I kind of came out of the whole Arms House thing, I wanted to be part of something like that. So I kind of got involved with, a mutual friend introduced me to Maldini, who was already working with Trouble and Vinyl. And so that was kind of like, okay, cool. You know, this is Clayton's down there. He's got studio. There's this kind of, there's just jungle. There's Kane, there's Shogun, you know, they've got, they've got renegade recordings and stuff. So it was like, I can kind of get with this. There's a nice crew mentality here. And then there was the connection with those guys between TOV and No U-Turn and Nico and things like that. So it's kind of like that was really something I sort of gravitated towards. I liked the idea. And I think as you say, like 95, 96, Blue Note was starting to kind of... take a hold and become a thing. There was obviously Blue Notes, Speed, all those kind of nights. And that refinement in sound was affecting me as a producer as well and what I wanted to make. And then, you know, me and Jason were going down to... to Blue Note and being like, right, yeah, this is what we need to be doing. And TOV at the time wasn't really geared towards that. It was a lot more, for want of a better word, sort of mainstream. I'm not even sure where the scene was at at that time because it just kept splitting apart. I'm trying to think. I would have thought of it as party tunes. It was just kind of like, you know, straight ahead. DJ Tools kind of yeah so it was kind of like but we were a bit more I don't want to say deeper it was a bit more aggy in some respects but yeah that was like wanted to be a part of that so me and Jason basically because of the stuff we were writing it was like well this can't work on TLV so we basically made Clayton start Renegade Hardware that whole era was was you know for me as well really important because it was like again you know the equipment was changing and like the new samplers coming around is like working with Nico and his whole ethos of producing really sort of rubbed off on me as well, which was kind of this whole hands-on, on the desk, live EQing, live reverbs and effects. And basically his studio in the Metro, I don't think he turned it off for like four years or four or five years. It was never turned off. And so he was like, that... Personally, that was a really, really great era for me. Because at the same time, watching Matt and Ed with their whole Russian optical thing and where they were going, Trace, you know, so it's always been around for me what felt really cutting edge in its own way. I mean, I think people... often don't appreciate how fiercely dedicated the drum and bass scene was all the way through the second half of the 90s. You know, obviously people got distracted, like outsiders got distracted because Garage was going on or Trip Hop or, you know, whatever other developments. But drum and bass somehow just kind of knuckled down. Yeah. And whether it was, you know, reinforced over in Dollis Hill or the V guys over in Bristol or whatever, people were just like honing and honing and honing these different sounds. Yeah, I think in some ways I think it was... to do with the fact that we were really interested in what each other was doing as well. We took an active interest in it. We'd go out and, you know, somewhere like Blue Note, for example, it was like, it was, there weren't really producer DJs in there, there were just DJs. So the producers would go down there in the hopes of hearing their stuff, do you know what I mean? Like I say, having somewhere like what Nico had with the Metro store, just his whole set up, it was just like it was somewhere you wanted to be. And so there was all these hubs of creativity and we were all sort of bouncing off each other and, you know, listening to each other's records. And it was very blinkered in the sense of like we didn't really care what was going on outside of... are seen well this is this is the flip side of it that it became seen as modern maniac you know it's like drum and bass is just drum and bass and it had its own rules and you know to outside ears often it just sounded like the same thing over and over again. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it did. But at the same time, people were raving to it. Yeah, I think it's weird. It's gone through, it's definitely gone through its peaks and troughs and it's almost been, it's almost been killed a couple of times, but it's just like, there's just, like you say, there's this diehard sort of undercurrent of people who just, you know. who won't let it go. At what point did you think it was sustainable that maybe this was actually a career and that Drum and Bass was... something that was more than just you know another phase in the evolution of dance music personally um it was weird because i had i did have a job i was a kitchen porter for a while whilst i was making it and then again it was a different time especially like in terms of the in the early 90s and mid 90s because i was signing on and i was on the doll And you go down there and you go down to Dole office and you're like, so what do you want to do? I want to make music. And they just look at you like, all right, we've got nothing that fits that description. Here's your check. You didn't get sanctioned then. Do you know what I mean? So it was like, we were left to kind of get on with it, weirdly. When you saw people like, like you say, like Ronnie with the whole new forms and represent Goldie with Timeless, the Photek, SourceDirect, you know, I was watching, you know, Moving Shadow and how that was being run as a business and obviously being a part of hardware and seeing how that was run as a business as well. It was like, okay. I could, as a career choice, it probably didn't really, really sort of stick until Bad Company when, you know, that was what, 90, when the nine was what, 98, December 98, I think. So that, when that suddenly, because I didn't do my first DJ gig until... 97 so I was a producer all this whole time up until up until 97 and then it was like oh you can get paid for alright okay you know it was like that's an option I can I can go with that um but yeah it wasn't until the BC and then we signed to what was the agency oh god she's going to cuss me for forgetting it Caroline unique unique artist so there was there was Andy Hype all the GQ everyone was on there and then so suddenly we were like hot shit and we were just you know we were getting paid a fair amount of money internationally as well yeah so then it was like oh right okay this can I can do this But I think, you know, like I say, looking at people like Ronnie, seeing that they were starting, you know, these people getting sort of chart success of sorts. And I think the majors, in some ways the majors... They decided to get involved and I think they signed a lot of the wrong people as well. There was a few acts, a few people that got signed and it was like they got their fingers burnt and they were like, oof, no, you know, let's not get involved with this. So that's when I think it was like it... It nearly peaked and then it just dove off quickly. With untold eternal respect for Photek and Source Direct, they weren't major labour acts. You know? Exactly. This was like the most underground sound you could look for, really. Yeah, that was quite a strange choice. Who was it? Was it Virgin? Yeah, it was sourced through Virgin, I think. Yeah. But... You have to suspect that there were huge amounts of drugs running through the major labels. More than likely. Yeah, so it seemed like it became an option. But... For me, like I say, it wasn't until 98. And that really was drum and bass sustaining itself rather than relying on anyone else. Yeah. It was your own productions and it was a drum and bass specialist agency and it was the scene that was, like the international scene that was sustaining you. We were going off to America and we were going off to like, 97 was like, wasn't it? 98, 99. New Zealand was popping off over there. America, again, was popping off. And it's so Germany, Cologne, Mannheim, all these, you know, really like solid, like, DMV, like, strongholds. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure what happened. I think it was weird. I always kind of look back and think, like, German bass sometimes doesn't help itself. And it used to be, it was almost quite closed off in the sense of, like... we wouldn't let outside people get involved. Well, from the days of the Jungle Committee, there was always an attempt to kind of keep it locked. Yeah, the mythical Jungle Committee. I remember I was asked to be a part... There was another one not too long after. It didn't have a name, but there was a meeting at a pub over by SRD and we were there and it was like a lot of people and there was the discussion was slowing down the tempo. It was like we were going to have this sort of scene-wide consensus that we were going to bring the tempo down. What, 150 or something? I think it was 164 was the agreed tempo, if I remember rightly. I think I've still got the sheet of paper that was written out. and it was like yeah if everyone if all of us write four or five tunes then that's you know we all swap it and then just think thinking back looking back the idea was a really good idea but no one did it i don't think i think actually no actually tell i i did my b side my b sides on v called true to the craft was that tempo the agreed tempo um but yeah that never really took off nice so right name names who who's gonna do this Name names. Who was there? Well, BC were there. I believe Dillinger, Lemon D were there. Who else was there? Total Science. J Magic was there. Cardios was there. This is a real vision of what could have been. Yeah, exactly. If only we'd stuck to it. It's just taken like this amount of time for us to finally come back down. But yeah, so millennium time. Obviously you were doing fine and the production values were ramping up. Were you simultaneously thinking, "I want to do this more emo stuff" or was there a point where it was just like, "I have to do this"? No, I think it's like, because I've always been involved in collaborations and it's always been a part, it's almost like what I've brought to the table, whether it's been working with Future Forces or Bad Company. So that was, you know, that was what I brought to it. and those tracks which my name are on I think you can kind of hear that so that was it was always there and it wasn't and I think kind of like actually working with my brother had a really profound effect on me as well just kind of in terms of in his approach to music and his ear kind of it was kind of similar in the sense of kind of slightly it's almost like slightly detuned a little bit uneasy slightly a bit wonky um um and that's kind of where i feel comfortable so we're doing when i just kind of like i needed to when when bc sort of split up i wanted to i wanted to write my you know do my own stuff um I'd done, obviously me and Mick had done, there was True Romance and then I did, you know, Bellini. And there was the stuff I did for Bingo and things like that. So it was kind of like me finding my feet in that respect. Were there other influences coming in on this? I mean... all that time that you'd been kind of in the thick of the drum and bass scene were you were you listening to other stuff outside because a lot of people weren't i was listening in the sense that i was buying records and sampling things like that and collecting samples so i think my outside influence is I've always been outside of DMV. So, you know, collecting CDs like Michael, I don't know what his name is, like Michael Stern's Tomita, well obviously Tangerine Dream, an obvious one, but it was a big part of it. And then just sort of collecting, yeah, collecting records and And having, and my tonal choices were stuff that looking back had that connection, I think. What's that guy's name? Is it Luke Ponty? Stuff like that. Especially with Tangerine Dream, it was just kind of like you're finding these sections within their stuff with these tones and stuff and layering them with other things, with maybe stuff, something I'd got from Vangelis and whatever, and it's creating these quite odd harmonies. that was a big part of my sound and I think it's like whoever could have predicted you'd end up fascinated with hardware I mean these are all early synth experimenters who were like building their stuff on vast synthesizers. Exactly. And I think that's what kind of like, I think it was weird being in BC because we were really at the cutting edge of the software and in the whole in the box thing. We really sort of ran with that, whether it was in the studio, even to like, we were, we used to take CDJs to our events before a lot of people, we got cussed heavily. But when I really started to get back into hardware, it is that kind of thing of like, with the samplings, all I'm trying to do is recreate what I was hearing on those records. And it's now I'm in a position to be able to kind of get the sort of... the bits of equipment I want, like my guitar pedal, like collection is ridiculous. I just love that. Just, and that was something I learned again, learned from Nico, just kind of jacking things in and just seeing what happens. And then sort of getting that connection of like, ah, okay. Listening back to sort of, you know, my bloody Valentine, the obvious ones like soon or whatever. hearing how those tones were created and knowing for me now knowing that I'm able to do that I just really get off on it I can just do that all day I mean that actual it's the control aspect the fact that people can really control the sound that doesn't involve clicking a mouse. I remember seeing that Metalheads video quite recently where you see Dillinger in the studio and you suddenly realize that the reason his bass wobbled like nobody else's was because he was actually whacking a fader up and down to make it wobble. Yeah, exactly. So I think like when... towards the end, especially towards the end of BC, because we were becoming so software-based, the studio, as a result, was becoming very one-player. Whoever was sat in the seat was in control. And then there were, you know, the consequences of that was whoever was in the, you know, because the studio was, say, for example, was at Fresh's house, he was getting to know it more and more, better and better and better, so he was leading that. So I was kind of... feeling further and further disconnected from what was going on. So that's kind of like when, you know, I had my, when I left there, I had my little setup, but it's still, I was like, still felt a little bit, wasn't quite where I wanted to be. And it was when I linked up with Instrumental that suddenly like it all sort of clicked again. like suddenly seeing, you know, working with them, it's like they'd sort of disappeared and then come back like they were still in the 90s kind of thing, had all their simps and their massive desk. And it was just like, all right, yeah, I've got that. Where's my one of those? And it was a lot of that. And I mean, sonically, it was kind of coincidental or zeitgeisty or whatever. But, you know, this is at the time when Dubstep was being born and Forward was happening. Were you aware of that, that there were other people kind of going into these like more spacious, moody territories? Yeah, no, I was. And admittedly, I think I've said it before, admittedly, I was quite stuck up about it. just because in the sense that I'd listen to it and I'd be like really do you know I mean just just it just didn't I weirdly just didn't connect with me straight away there's a lot of people's first reaction to that early dubstep stuff is that it yeah and so it was almost like you have to kind of hear it and see it in context to kind of and then also sort of like again there's this snobbishness of I've been doing it for so long that you forget where you started and like you look back and like actually if you look back and look back at your own stuff there was a it was really bloody raw so it's like they've still got to get you know still move through all those stages before you know to get to where you think they should be but it was like i knew it was going on but it was again it was like this There was a mass exodus from DMV of producers who were suddenly like, right now we're making dubstep now and the whole bandwagon jumping thing. And that was something I was like, I'm not doing that. I'm storing it. DMV! But you were doing the half tempo thing by then. Kind of. By the time people were actually jumping ship... Like, by the time it became a big move from D&B to dubstep, you were definitely... Well, when... OK, because I don't know the true timeline of dubstep. When would you say it really started? Just so I can get it in my head. The actual scene was happening from, like, 2002, like, the forward stuff. Right, so, yeah. But it was 2006 and 2007 when, like, drum and bass scenes started properly taking notice and... Yeah, so I was still in my staunch, nah, DMV. I hadn't hooked up with... Okay, maybe it is a bit later then. Yeah, for me personally, I hadn't hooked up. So I was still kind of like, nah. I'm not about that, this is what I do. Because I had my label as well at the time. So I was aware of it, but it wasn't something that I felt like I needed to, not needed, it was something that I wanted to make. Because I think personally I felt like I would just be perceived as a bandwagon jumper, so I don't want to, you know. It was almost like it was too late for me to it if I was going to do it. So yeah, so it's almost like 2009 when I was working with Instra, I think that was from my point of view where we were seeing artists from that scene who were like wanting to move off into other directions as well. And then what we were doing with the Autonomic was something that they connected with as well. which I thought, you know, which was really cool. So we were getting stuff from like Scuba, James Blake, Pearson, you know, Ramadan Man, just who were exploring their own, you know, directions. And a lot of them had been drummer bass kids early on, like as kids, kids. Yeah, exactly. So it was like, that was, that was when I think when, and also I think working with Instra as well, kind of like they definitely opened me back up to kind of like being honest about your influences and being honest about what, what it is that drives you and what, you know, just basically what influences you. It's almost like sometimes DMB was like, no, nothing, we're not influenced by anything, we're just drum and bass. That's shit. Yeah, so it was really refreshing to kind of... hang out with these guys who were like you know Damon who was really like really into sort of the warp and Boards of Canada, Drexia, and then hearing the connections as well. And then again, sort of like being able to sort of openly put, express my sort of influences and connections into what we were doing as well. So that, I think that's when we were kind of like the halftime thing. It was like, it's... As long as it works, it doesn't matter. So do you know what I mean? It's almost like I think I'd almost like... It's all electronic folk. Yeah. So I'd gotten to the stage where I'd just chilled out about... not being taken it so seriously not feeling like I have to kind of hold this flag of like it can only be this way and do you feel like since then I don't know eight nine years you've kind of been in that space and been able to explore it Has there been big changes since then? I mean, hearing this new album, it sounds like you're still exploring some of the same ideas. Yeah, I'm exploring in the sense of... I kind of feel that DMB is a really truly versatile form of music and I think a lot of that comes from the fact that it was so sample based. The fact that we could put these super groups together on a record coming from completely different scenes. So it's like, we can do still, you know, still able to do that, piece those influences together into whatever this, whatever the agreed tempo is. Do you know what I mean? But I think it's like, it's, I kind of feel like it's, for me, I've moved beyond that. It's almost like there's a... it's like a spirit, a sort of feeling that D&B has that can be explored in other tempos and in other areas of electronic music. And that's where I'm kind of like, where I'm at. I think it's like, I know that that's what I'm known for, but it's not the be all and end all for me. And it's kind of... I want to explore other areas of electronic music, but bring what I've learned from that to it in some respects. It's more like what I used to do when I used to get really pissed off with bad company. I'd sort of bugger off and go and hang out with my brother. And it was you know it was cool being able to bring what I would learn from BC to what was going on over there you know I had a um I got a couple credits on the vintage high-tech album on K7 and things like that. So it's kind of like... And then again, kind of like what I learned from my brother and him getting me into JD and Dilla and... that whole you know sarah all that kind of stuff and that taking that then taking that back so that's why i'm it's i'm still still doing that and that's why i love collaborating and just trying to piece all you know different things together and see what's see what's possible it's like it's what it's like I'm really into sort of reaching out to people outside of our scene as well and hearing their versions of what they think DMV is, you know, and trying to get, you know, trying to get them to produce stuff. Yeah. And, I mean, in that period since that kind of, I guess the millennium era is when... it was at its most insular and inward looking. And since then, you know, you end up with now with people like Omunet and Machine Drum, all these people who've kind of cracked, cracked the wall and are able to kind of bring, bring influences both in and out. It's, it's definitely become. part of the electronic music family, the wider electronic music family again. Yeah, and I think that's where I'm kind of sort of really happy with how Exit has progressed because it's like, I love straight up rolling drum and bass like what Skeptical does. I love, you know, the sort of jungle Duke influence stuff that Fracture does or the stuff, you know, the stuff that Fixate does. I love, you know, what Consequence and Joe Seven and They Live and, you know, my brother Black Pocket and Dan Harbinem. So it's like, if you look at my catalogue, if you look at the Exit catalogue, you can see that... It's very varied, do you know what I mean? And I do personally try not to have too many crossovers in terms of artists, do you know what I mean? I want people to have their own space and be allowed to have their own space. And in a weird way, I suppose, in some ways, having that ethos has allowed me to be who I am as well, so that I can go out there and put out a record. like Too Late or my album and people will not be so surprised by it hopefully, do you know what I mean? It's like, he's been quite selfish, I suppose, in some respects. Quite capitalised. So all of those people you've mentored, all of that work you put into the label was just so that you could carve out a space that you... In a weird way, yeah. You just carve out a space for me to allow me to be me. Do you know what I mean? So I don't have to kind of like... like write a true romance again because I can't I really can't I wouldn't know what to do do you know what I mean so and I think it's like working with Instagram working with all these people over the years it's kind of led me down this path so this is where this is where my head's at sonically this is what i want to make so i just hope people get it in some respects but again i'm not overly bothered if they don't you
