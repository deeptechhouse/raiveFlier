Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Stephen Sitness, and I'm a freelance writer for Resident Advisor. Tony Woods is by no means a household name, yet he's had a huge impact on electronic music. He's not only shaped the sound of UK Garage, but influenced a wide spectrum of artists. including Akifen, Burial and Daft Punk, who actually collaborated with Todd on the track Face to Face. Despite this, Todd is one of the most humble folks I've ever interviewed. He often references his religion, a central theme of his work, mentioning how it's gotten him through the bad patches in his life and kept his head in check in the good. We talked to the House and Garage veteran to find out what lies in store next for Todd Edwards. Bye. My world. My world. So you grew up in New Jersey, so to people who are not so familiar with America or American geography, could you say what that's like and where it is in America? It's right next to New York City, basically. Well, North Jersey is right next to New York City. I think that people will probably know Jersey from the two main shows from Jersey, which would be The Sopranos and Jersey Shore. Fortunately, it's not... you know, 100% like that, though there are elements that I've grown up with that were like that. You know, it took the worst personas of Jersey and put them on those shows, per se. But yeah. Have you always did that? Yeah, I've always been in Jersey, around the same area, too, to be honest. Yeah, I mean, it's good. I mean, it's close enough. I live close enough to New York City. That's where all things were happening mostly, especially in the early 90s. It's like you wanted to tackle New York City. I mean, at least that's what I had in my mind coming out of high school. Like, I'm going to make it to New York City, you know? So what was life like growing up there? For me, I guess I was an average kid. I really didn't fit into any one group. I mean, I was in the popular clique, and I was in all the smart classes, but yet I didn't kind of fit in with that group of people. So I kind of had just a couple friends that I hung around with. I found myself writing a lot of cheesy songs in high school, you know. I've always had a... interest in music and computers. But in high school, I started writing more. And, you know, I mean, school was just average, you know, it was school was typical. You were kind of ostracized if you were if you were one of the smart people, or you ever encouraged anything intellectual of nature, you know. So there wasn't I didn't really I was never one to be active in anything. I mean, they had I had band and chorus and stuff, but that wasn't like, you know, you're trying to find your way and it was just not a popular thing to do. So I kind of just did my own thing on the side. Like, you know, I would write songs. I had portable keyboards. I knew nothing about real music technology. And the technology back then is much different than what you kids, you kids know about these days. was your age you know it's sad but it's becoming cliche but it's true so I think I always loved dance based music but I in high school and in middle school I grew up more on pop music than I did on so what kind of acts are we talking about I mean, when I was younger in grammar school, I mean, I was a Duran Duran fan, you know. Whatever was on pop radio, you know, I mean, there's so much. I mean, like I grew up, I mean, I think music was most important to me when I was very young. I went through several generations of dance music from what my sister listened to. Quincy, like stuff produced by Quincy Jones. There was a bunch of disco to like some of the funkier R&B, even like with names that I can't even, you know, it's just whatever was on the radio. And I was never good with, like I said, I was never good with names. So if it was on, you know, the radio station at the time, Z100 was our radio station. And that was the popular one. couple. You know, I'd like to Prince, you know, Stevie Wonder would be on. There's other acts. I mean, you know, the Thompson twins. I was just I actually was just going through some old 80s stuff just to listen to and getting nostalgic about it. But it's just like, you know, there were so many one hit wonders back then. But that's what made up the pop market. And it was fantastic that way. So. Then, you know, throughout high school, I was writing, you know, I wrote some ballady stuff. I listened to Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson. Janet was kind of bigger during the high school time. And then there was this stuff, if you know, Latin freestyle. became very big. Yeah, Shannon, even beyond that, like, George Lamont, TKA, you know, and honestly, I always felt that Two-Step kind of resembled the format. Like, no one ever made that connection, but to me, it was like, maybe a little bit faster, you know, the beats were special. I'm like, this is freestyle, but with, you know, UK elements to it, you know? I wasn't a... big freestyle fan because I felt like I mean I wound up writing a song never really did anything with it but freestyle to me all sounded the same you know and when I say sound the same it was the same chords some of it sounded like it was written in five minutes and some of it really was written in five minutes but I guess that was part of its charm as well well it's interesting you said your sister showed you a few records were your folks all musical or my mother plays piano and she grew up playing piano. My aunt, her sister passed away, she played accordion. Their brother played drums and he was into jazz drumming and stuff. He's the youngest of my mother's brother and sister. My father's father taught guitar and sang as well. And my grandmother played, you know, played the organ and stuff. So we definitely had, you know, we have music in our family, definitely. And I definitely came out of the womb a complete artist. No athletic ability, no, didn't fit. Oh, talk about not fitting. I would never fit in. Dreaded, you know, that part of school, like having to go to gym. So you wasn't a jock. Oh, no, no, not at all. No, made life a little rough back then. So what are you going to do? Yeah, well, that's it. So maybe jumping forward a bit, you know, it says you've had this history of like writing pop music into that kind of stuff. So when was the turning point when you was like, okay, house music now? I owe that to my friend, Rich Creso, who did one of the mixes on the S'more, I Refuse. He went under Filthy Rich, and he was also the guy that did Stormy Day with me, that Damon Truitt sang on. Where did you go, leaving me here all alone In the rain, by myself, left here with nobody else Stormy day, go away, leave me to look on heaven's edge Stormy day, go away He introduced me to the works of Todd Terry and the other, he was DJing in high school, but he was a big, big fan of Todd Terry. And I just borrowed his record collection and started to listen to that. And surprisingly enough, I had known Todd Terry's work from hearing it when I would go out to like teen clubs, like, you know, underage clubs. And you'd hear, I'd hear this song called, you know, it was Can You Party? And I'm like, that sounds like that was from Move Your Body. You know, like, and I'm like, what is that? Like, it's not playing the whole thing. It's just playing parts of it and you know then did I realize that it was being sampled per se uh you know so he turned me on to that so for two years at after high school I studied house music just listened to Tony Humphries who was uh playing on 98.7 at the time that was our Kiss FM It was great because back in the late 80s, early 90s, there were radio shows that played house music. And I'm not talking about the pop dance music that you're hearing today. It was real underground. house music and it was on like three channels that you could check out on a Friday Saturday night even the pop channels like Glenn Frischer he was a really big DJ at the time and he would play music that was partial poppy but still had underground the later it got he would start playing houseier and houseier stuff so he got a good dose I have I have cassette tapes Cassette tapes are these little square things with this tape that actually recorded music on it, just for you to know. I have cassette tapes sitting out in my garage of just recorded shows. I should probably bust them out and try to convert them to CDs. Yeah, so, yeah, Jersey. He's listening to Tony Humphries. Yeah, Tony Humphries. Did you ever go to clubs like Zanzibar and things like that? Actually, I did go to Zanzibar before, and I think that was the club. There was two clubs down in Newark. And now, mind you, you have to understand, and I'm not dissing Newark because I'm not trying to sound bad, but if you know Newark, you'll know that Newark is not exactly... a place you'd feel comfortable strolling the streets at night. You know what I mean? There's some, it's pretty dodgy, but the music was good and it was like, you know, you had your New York clubs and you had Jersey clubs. So, I went there a couple times. I'm trying to think of what the other club's name was. Names again. Once again with the names. Zanzibar definitely was one because I was excited because that was always advertised on TV. I mean, not TV, on radio. Like, Zanzibar. And I was like, oh, can't wait to go there. And the music was good. I think Jersey had a different flair from New York as far as how they, you know, they still played a lot of the similar things, but I think it was slightly different and the vibe was a little soulful but a little bit more soulful than New York. But wait, one of the reasons I stopped going to Newark is when I was at, I believe it was Zanzibar, one of those clubs, someone blocked me in the parking lot. And surprisingly enough, we... We're sitting there, it's freezing and we don't know who's, it's a parking lot, you know what I mean? So you pay to park there. So we come out of the club, me and Rich, you know, and we're both freezing. We're like, well, what are we going to do? It's like, well, let's take a cab back and we'll come back at like six in the morning to pick up your car. So anyway, we do that. Now mind you, I'm helping Rich move his grandmother's apartment from Brooklyn to Jersey that morning too. Yeah, I remember this like it's yesterday because we go back and the car is not there. it's gone. So we just assume it's stolen at that point, called up North police. No one knows anything. I mean, North is huge. So, so that's a horrible feeling, you know, especially as it's like a 17 year old, 18 year old kid. I know you might not even be able to use this, but it's still worth going. You're the first person I've told this story to, and it's music related. Mother was freaking out, you know, like pissed off. You know car stolen you stupid dude um and i'm and i'm like on no sleep helping this kid move his grandmother's stuff and anyway uh funny thing enough there was a uh a record store in montclair right next to the town i live in called crazy rhythms and this guy um kenny he was uh really good on his music like his whole apartment decked out from top to bottom records you know he's like oh no like i talked to him a couple days later after this event he's like no no that happened to me he's like your car wasn't stolen it was towed to a lot it's they have this scam going that by the time they contact you you have to pay so much in back you know uh fees So I'm hoping that he's correct. He takes me to this place, my car sitting there. I actually kissed the car. That's how excited I was. I mean, like, you know, that was a four grand car. I didn't, you know, I paid for that myself. So to have that thing, you know, that was like, that was a blessing from God. I told him I'd take him to dinner. I never, I never treated him to dinner. That's, I really still kind of I owe him that one from 20 years ago. There you go. I never told that story before. And you didn't treat the guy either, man. I know. He's a nice guy, too. He was a big supporter of mine. You know, something that you're going to do, you're going to do, and it never happened. I definitely owe him a dinner or two. Yeah. With interest, probably. A few weeks worth of... Well, he might be listening to this. Yeah. He's still around I just want something I want to talk to you about because it was really talked about in the UK press at the time like the Jersey sound and you said it was slightly different to the New York sound was that something you was aware of at the time or um I I mean, I didn't go out that much to be able to be a connoisseur of it, but the couple times I went out to Jersey, I think Jersey felt as far as the house, the underground house scene, the black soulful house music. I think they clung to the more gospel-y-esque sounds. You know what I mean? Like, follow, you know, Elliot. How do you pronounce it? Elliot. I was going to say Elliot. Elliot's Follow Me. I remember them playing Todd Terry's Queen of the Nile remix, which was Whitney Houston's track at the time. But all those more really soulful... things you know whereas when i went to hear little louie spin in new york city it had a mixture of masters at work and some more energetic it was still soulful but it was kind of a little how do you put it just i think it was a little more energetic in a different way you know more more drum-oriented, you know, less darker, deeper type thing. But, you know, everyone played these tracks. It's just the vibe was just a little slightly different. So one of the most interesting things really for me is that most people, they go to a club, they fall in love with dance music, and the next thing, going to go out and buy some decks, become a DJ. You didn't do that. Why was that? That was because I had, I was a, in my 20s, I was, I mean, I was a wreck. I mean, I was this insecure, you know, kid with issues that was, you know, the music reflected probably one of the best parts of me, and it did not reflect my state of mind at the time. time because I had a lot of stage fright. I was, you know, I mean, I was very sensitive. I still am sensitive, but, you know, I mean, you know, I didn't take rejection well, you know, and I had a bad experience in a church play that I lost, choked on my lines. And because DJing was never a major thing, I just, I mean, I just did not feel comfortable traveling and being in front of an audience. and I still was just more into production. It wasn't like, you know, because even at the time when I started listening to house music, I did start, you know, just doing, you know, friends parties a little bit and DJing and when Rich would go out and DJ a gig, I would, you know, there was a few that would go with him and I was good. I mean, I was going to, if I kept with it, I would have probably... It had been really good. But it wasn't, you know, I decided, look, I got to do one thing and do it right. You know, it's like I can't focus on everything. And production and making music was more my strong suit. So in later years, there was two reasons that I wanted to DJ. One was to connect to the audience because that's how you do when you're a producer and you're not really doing shows, live shows. And then two was because I needed to help supplement the income as well. And, you know, I mean, they're both... think legitimate reasons to DJ as long as one doesn't surpass the other in any means. But yeah, 20s weren't good. It's funny because I think it was the peak of UK Garage and, you know, I think the, I don't want to say the peak of my career, but just the pinnacle point of UK Garage. And I was nowhere near prepared for that, not because I was afraid of success. but just because just, you know, where I was at personally in my life did not go with where I was at musically. And if I was where I, if who I am now was back then, I probably would have capitalized on a lot of things a lot better. But, you know, I mean, I think things happen for a reason. No one sits there and thinks that they're going to have... a massive amount of success. I didn't anticipate that it was going to have the impact that it had. And I just wanted to have a significant sound that people knew when they dropped it on the record. Like the Todd Terry record, you knew it was him when you put it on his record or a Masses at Work or an MK. That was one of the questions I was going to ask you. Your production sounds obviously very, you know, stands out. You can always tell it's yours. Is that something you were consciously aiming for straight away? Yes, it was. That say. I think I stumbled upon, I mean, and I've said it before, it gets cliche after a while, but I mean, I, MK, Enya. and masters at work kind of like the the drums of masters at work and then the concept of using the vocal snippets but even so before that i was still trying to make an identifiable something i but i didn't know what i was doing i just it just kind of uh happened and i was telling jeff because jeff we were talking about like the old nervous uh stuff today and he's like do what do you feel when you listen to it do you get nostalgic he's like because it's sounds nothing like what you do today and it's funny because I don't think I could consciously perfectly replicate what I did back then because it was partial talent and partial ignorance and partial just you know trial and error and you know it's that part of the career where you are just you know It's almost like when you're less educated, you kind of come up with something really raw. I think I'm a much more seasoned producer now, and I feel very confident going into a session. However, that lack of ignorance or that kind of knowledge you have of music is going to guide you into the journey. it does definitely take you into some cool directions but to try to replicate something perfectly that was born out of you know those couple of elements it's it's not an easy thing to do you know so how did it first come about you know you was obviously making pop star records writing pop star records been out to some house clubs and then when did it get to the stage where you've got this kind of totem with the sound you know how did that kind of evolve over time? Like I said, my friend Rich introduced me to house music and it just seemed like it was so simple to make and it was the way to break into the music industry. And I just thought I'll put the pop music stuff on. hold um but then I embraced the music it wasn't just like some you know cheap way to get into the industry I really did take the music very seriously um and it was it kind of took over where the point where I couldn't stand listening to pop music anymore and I still kind of it's hard to like I mean I can appreciate pop music but it almost feels like less intelligent and I don't mean that in an arrogant type of way but it's almost like I guess because it's a very general form of music you know there's there are a lot of intricacies in dance music the Todd Edwards sound kind of just started to slowly develop the more I started to sample I had My one sampler that I got from the $1,400 that my parents saved for my college education. And I bought, instead of, you know, I used that money to buy my first sampler, which was an Ensoniq EPS. And I was sampling more because I didn't have enough, I didn't have a lot of keyboard equipment. So, you know. keyboards are these large things with keys that have sounds in them they're actually touchable tangible things as opposed to plugins for your laptop no but it's you know when you think about it what's that? they'll never understand yeah I know it's like yeah I'm just saying it's just like you couldn't buy sounds on a disc or off the internet there was no internet at the time the time or at least that I knew of so um but I had one I had a Juno 106 which had a lot of simple analog synthesizer and my sampler and so I didn't have a lot of piano sounds or things to use so I sampled stuff you know so so what kind of stuff were you sampling where were you getting these sample sources from honestly I would I would get a lot of disco in R&B records. I don't mean this in any negative way. If they had a black person on the cover of the record, I would buy it from a flea market because I'm like, there's going to be some good soulful stuff on that. And, you know, I was usually right. I mean, in the funkier the cover, usually it was like, oh, you got to pick, you know, the bigger the hair, the flashier the cover, you know, painted or whatever it was that there was going to be some gems on there. So it's funny because I remember the first, one of the first flea markets I went to and these places, some of them are nasty and smell like, you know, bad cooking. I picked up this record by Jeffrey Osborne called "Plain Love" and I threw it on and I heard this bass line. I'm like, that's where Todd Terry got his bass line for this track I can't quite understand. And I'm like, you know, and I didn't realize how much this man actually sampled, but he was my idol at the time when it came to first sampling. And it was always a score to find a track that, you know, where he got his samples. Oh And anyone, even like when Soul to Soul, like I dropped this one record and I heard like, oh, that's where they got that horn stamp for most of their early classic stuff. I'm like, oh, that's cool. Score. you know so it's funny you say about the image thing on covers that's exactly what Norman Cook said about sampling Fatboy Slim yeah yeah he said the wackier the cover yeah that's what he goes for so yeah it's cool it's not just you man no no no and believe me I didn't read his stuff so it just goes to show there's a genuine maybe it's a thing among sampling artists they all like view it the same way so what's the strangest thing you've ever sampled do you know I heard you sample your dad's voice everyone keeps going to that one and it's not even that's not the strangest one that was a necessity thing because I had to re-sing a lot of the samples for Save My Life because we weren't going to get clearance from Stevie Wonder for we you know what I mean like and that was one of the primary samples it was from a Stevie Wonder track so I had to re-sing all these things that I sampled from Roberta Flack and you know all these and I did pretty good singing everything but when it came to the lower parts of this choir piece like where it was like I didn't have it so my father kind of lent his ooze like you know um I've sampled from Irish folk music like you know I don't know I'm trying to think if it's actually how much of it made into into uh you know the record I also see Donovan I love Donovan's voice I could just picture teenage girls going he's so dreamy like you're throwing his records and I'm like wow his voice is just so damn captivating and it's just like he sings about these whimsical things like what drugs was he taking or if he was taking I mean like I didn't know who this man was before I you know dropped his first record I'm like then I just went and anytime I saw a Donovan thing like that was pretty interesting What else? I mean, it was quite interesting going from sampling... 70s R&B and disco to 60s folk music because I never was into the 60s. I didn't like it. It just gave me a weird, eerie feeling, the 60s, you know, seeing it as a kid, you know, it didn't represent anything cool to me. But I found that it's more enjoyable to sample from 60s stuff because there's literally no drums in some of these songs and just beautiful vocals, folk singers, you know, singing about heartache and stuff. So maybe talk about your singing though, you know maybe some people didn't even realize how many of your records you do actually sing on because there's so many processes and things on a lot of the voices. Yeah, how long have you been singing on records and yeah, where do you see it going? Well, there is a group that if they still want it, because I'm so overdue for this one particular vocal for this group called The Swiss. So if the label doesn't kill me and they don't kill me, I'll be singing on one of their tracks, a very disco-y sounding thing. And I sang half of it. I just have to finish it up, hopefully, as soon as I get home from it. from England so there are people that actually want my vocals I don't get it like I mean like I the Daft Punk thing really put me on the map with that and they were wonderful with what they did with it they really didn't process it or anything I sang it twice they said sing it like foreigner like kind of a rock vocal and I did it when I work with my vocals I put it through so many different things. And probably also, too, is through my circumstances, I never had access to singers, which it's a shame because I should have, but it is what it is. So, like, all of my whole Odyssey album is all my vocals, and I'm impersonating different people. Before that, there was, you know, I would sing where it was necessary. I would try to find spiritual messages, but if I couldn't find what I was looking for, it was just... It's just easier to come up with a quick phrase myself and put it in with my own, you know what I mean? So tracks like "Mystery," "No Worry," the track "No Worries," you know, you'll hear my voice intermingled, you know, even on remixes if I wanted to add something to say a specific message, that was there. But my favorite to date is the fact that I bought, I think it's funny because I bought a helium tank. to sing like Bjork on the Odyssey album for Next To You. So that was fun. And obviously that's a huge theme for your work, the kind of religious message. years in your work, do you remember when the first time you actually used someone else's vocals in a remix to kind of get that across? Let's see, the first remix I think I did was, hold on, I think it was MJ Cole. I mean, well, no, no, no, no, no. The first remix actually was... And it wasn't intentional that I was just doing it, but the first one was for the St. Germain dub. Because... I'm not going to say who sang it because I don't need any lawsuits from, but he sang Jesus Loves You, and I love the way he sang it. I'm like, this is great. So that was the first time that I sampled it. But then what I would start to do is I would actually try to sample the vocals of the artist. And then it started to become dominant when the first one was MJ Cole's Crazy Love. And I actually ran my voice over. vocoder and said the word savior christ but my manager was a little concerned that the label wasn't going to put it out so we called he called it the savior cries like save your cries remix so but that was actually you know i put piece together message and you know so because it's obviously you know a huge theme for your work but um you know as you mentioned there that your manager said hey stay away from that as people kind of said to you, you know, you should put less meridians. Some people do. Has it been an issue in your career at all? I don't think so. I mean, I think, you know, there are people that have said that and, you know, I'll never be able to tell if it has been a deterrent for certain projects, but, I mean, I don't... I don't know too many people that have anything negative to say about me. I haven't come across... and usually the ones that are, they're more in a vicious jealousy type thing or like "Oh, this stuff all sounds the same!" and then they stopped doing that after I started experimenting with different drums over the last year or so. So they're not saying that either, but... But even the case being, it's just like, I think for the most part, people know I'm a genuine person and I'm not looking to do anything that's going to be offensive. Like, you know, I try to do everything I do out of love. And I think as long as there's a genuineness there, they could feel it, you know. And I don't do it when I don't, like, I don't just sit there and go, I got to put a message in here. If I don't feel it, I've proven who I am. I think I've established where I come from. So I don't feel the need. That was part of that faith. I will still, all the music I make now, I still try to put positive messages in there and even keep it about God. But it's not like, I don't just do it for the sake of doing it. I have to feel conviction to do it. You know, there are tracks that I put together that, you know. that might not I don't just say oh I didn't put a religious message in this one so but on the other side of things have you had positive feedback from like religious groups or people like that or have you ever I think it's more on a personal yeah I mean I think that people that are fans are fanatical like in a positive like are really are moved by it I mean I have people you know I mean it's you know I get some good emails and stuff and it keeps me going to be honest and again I think it's the genuineness of the fan group you know I mean like the people that do follow are following you can feel it means something to them, which makes it more worth it for me to keep going. It does encourage me because it's not an easy industry to be in. It's funny because I think over the years when I was first making music I wanted to quit every five minutes. I was not, I didn't have a lot of confidence in my work and every time I wanted to quit something positive would happen and I accepted that as kind of God saying we just keep going and the more confident I got it seemed like the more adversity I'd start to see like in other words when I finally got as productive as I wanted to be. It seemed like there was less success and less work coming in. It just seems like... And I was just thinking like if this was 10 years ago I would have just dropped out and it's just like I'm more persistent now and I've had to deal with more uphill battles with it but it kind of shows that I do have a love for it. I'm not doing this... for fame and fortune because there's less and less of that, you know, to get anyway, which is kind of good that I didn't take it that seriously when, you know, when making music was at its height of, you know, money making and all those things. And, you know, whether I'm, you know, put on a pedestal or not, I still want to keep making music, you know what I mean, in some way, shape or fashion. So maybe you know you just talked about when the kind of main area of two-step of garage and that you said you didn't want to get more involved with it. Did you ever felt when did you first realize there was this whole scene in the UK being interesting? I suppose I said that wrong. When did you first realize that there was interest in the UK? I knew, I started to know through, my manager would speak with Carl Brown from Tough Jam. And I knew that things were picking up. And also, there was a DJ from New Jersey named DJ Camacho. He just passed away not too, but he was one of the earlier supporters. And he would come home and he would have good things like, oh, you're blowing up, man, you're blowing up. And, you know, I don't know what to make of it. again, internet wasn't really that big and I didn't jump on, you know, early 90s, you know, you would know through reading magazines and whatnot more. So I knew that there were things going on and I was getting major label remix work. And honestly, it wasn't even the UKG quote-unquote stuff that actually put my name on the map, I think as much as it was when I did the Wild Child remix. Because it hit a bigger it was like that I did the Panther Party remix and they were kind of more housey based stuff and I in that whole genre I think I was getting a lot of major label remix work from getting Save My Life signed so I knew then things were going on and then I went through a couple cycles because like then I kind of died down a little bit and again a lot of it was based on personal life issues so it's like you know if you don't stay consistent there are on to the next. It's more like that now than ever, but you have to kind of keep going to stay relevant. I've been blessed that I've been able to keep with it so long, even with a couple of hiatuses here and there. But it was those major label remakes that I realized that things are going in the right direction. And then there was like a second coming, per se, once I did... MJ Cole's Crazy Love remix, there was a slew of mixes after that. And then the change in the industry came and, well, you know, it's like the market crash and everything changed at that point. So have you ever seen yourself as part of any kind of scene? because the media, you know, tried to tell you to speak Irish, it's a two-step, it's all these kind of things. I, I mean, the thing of it is, I get put into what's called the UK garage scene. And again, I was just talking to him about that. It's like, everywhere you go, you always hear people saying, oh, UKG is dead. I've been hearing that for 10 to 15 years now. It's dead. And I said, it's... dead but yet I'm getting work still doing the same thing. EZ's playing, you have a slew of underground DJs and regular radio that's playing some form of what you consider UK garage so it's the most alive dead thing I've ever seen so I don't pay attention to that but I just can consider myself I do Todd Edwards you know what I mean like I'm proud happy to be associated and and to be considered part of the UK garage team but I was doing what I was doing before they coined the phrase so it's kind of like I'm not going to change I think you need to stay relevant and I totally believe it's good to explore and to move ahead but I'm not going to just stop doing something because there have been changes. This is an art form that I've been doing so why do I need to change that? If there are fans for it, if there's still a niche for it, then I'm going to keep doing it. So I know I base my relevance on the amount of people that contact me or seeing a jump in Facebook friends or Twitter friends. I mean, since I have gotten a new manager and reestablished, you know, got a booking agent, I've seen a significant jump in Twitter and Facebook action. And I'm not doing that much more other than doing some mixes. and I have been trying to stay active, but there's plenty of people that are a lot more active on these things. But over the last two years, I've had, it's more than doubled. And, you know, in this day and age, I think that's pretty damn good. you know so I mean you know you work for Resident Advisor I mean how many how many flavors of the month come through your door and it's like you know there's one I think it's Ralph Lawson that said you know you never want to be hot because the time you're hot you know you're never going to be you'll be cool as quick as your heart kind of thing you know so people that stay on this even feel right i mean honestly and i think my sound has always kind of the reason it's had longevity is because some people listen to it and don't get it and then i kind of grow on you like a fungus it's just kind of you know it's just like you know it's like i don't get it and then you listen to it more it's like a slow build-up i think things that go that do go they burn out very quickly even songs like you know you ever hear a song that you hear on the radio nine billion times and it's just like after a while you never want to hear that song again and it's not because the song is brilliant but it's just like you know so the stuff that kind of hits that kind of media market you know it's been it's been we're getting we're getting close to 20 years now so So speaking of records you've heard 9 billion times, I want to ask you about Face to Face. How did that come about? Because obviously you almost finished the record. How did it come about? They reached out to iRecords, they wanted to possibly collaborate on something. And this was before Homework was released. And we met in New York City, had a nice lunch and just talked about stuff. And it was cool to meet them. They were typical French kids. Thomas was more talkative. Guy was more quiet, you know. I was just out of my mind at the point. I was just, honestly, it was just like, again, like all these positive things were happening during like darkest periods of my life. And I had to just kind of like put my best face forward. And that's, again, not something that a lot of people would know because you don't really get that personal with stuff. But it was, you know, quite a trying time in my early 20s. Things went quiet. The homework came out. There was a group of them that wanted me to come out for a gig in Paris, and I just was not up to doing something like that. It's too bad. I think, like I said, if I could jump into my body now, like do a quantum leap. that would be great because I'm totally up for just whatever these days. But whatever. Then Discovery came around. They reached out again. And it was kind of cool because it really coincided with, there was like, it was funny because there was like a lull. Like, you know, it's kind of like I was, like if there was peaks and valleys of my early career, it was kind of like. kind of bottoming out or like just you know Things were getting a little too quiet. So doing that plus, you know, doing the MJ Cole thing, it just like the timing was really just good with that particular thing. They came out to my studio. I sampled up, I took 75 of my samples. They sampled up 75 things. Thomas sat at the keyboard, played. Me and Guy were kind of sitting behind him. I was a little reluctant to tell. much to put in. I was, I have to be honest, it's a little intimidating, especially because I'm not the most assertive person in the world at the time. You know what I mean? But we put our words in. Thomas was playing in my, kind of in the vein of the Todd Edwards thing, but there was a sample that sounded like it was saying face to face. So literally they flew me over because we were going to finish the track. We really didn't. We just listened to it and said, okay. enough for now, we'll get back to it, just go have a good time. And like I said, they treated me like royalty. Very, very kind people with the way they, you know, I mean, it was like, I'd never been in business class before and that was like, you know, you don't really like going back to economy class after something like that, but, you know, keeps you humble. Put me in the best hotel overlooking all of Paris. And significantly, the first trip to Paris coincided. That week was like the year before that was one of the worst of my life. So it was spiritually very significant as if God was saying, you see how much I can do for you if you just let me in. And that's also why it became so much more. imperative for me to spread what was positive for me I wanted other people to know that there's there's hope when you're feeling like you want to jump off a bridge that there are there are other alternatives to you know to giving up you know what I mean so maybe talk about the touring actually because you know you said you didn't DJ, but now you do. You're here to play Fabric. So when did you first start thinking about touring and DJing? Again, I think part of it, it was during, I mean, I had wanted to get involved, I guess, around the turn of the century. I think it was around 2000 or so. that I was considering the idea. And my ex-manager had this thing that he, you know, the strategy was to try to get the most maximum amount per gig, which works in one way, but at the same time, like, you don't build a repertoire of gigs by, you know, playing the, you know. not being flexible. I mean, I know that's my take on it now. So, um, so I guess it was around 2000. It was time to start utilizing the, I mean, well, first of all, I did a small gig at the, it was at the Metropolitan Hotel. I think it was, or I'm not asking you as if you were there. It was just a small little gig, and then I played City Sounds the next day. That was the first experience of really seeing fans up close, was City Sounds Record Store. Do you remember what year that was? Whatever year Full On 1 came out. So I'm assuming that was around 2001, 2002. Yeah, 2001. You know what I mean? But I mean, even before that, you know, when I was, I was nervous at one point and Mike Weiss was like, you should really just do the Sunday, you know, they're doing Sunday best or, you know, the Sunday, whatever they called it at the time. Yeah, it was like a gas club and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, he was like, you should just go around and make that money. It sounded like a great idea, it just wasn't my thing. So was that your first trip to the UK then at that point? Or had you been many times before? I was to the UK before to work with Carl Brown. And that, I believe, was my first trip to England. Yeah. Then I played a small gig and did City Sounds and then the next time was at EZ's 4x4. So and that was just immense and amazing and it was just like you know. I'm gonna interrupt here because funny enough that was the first ever gig I went to like as an actual like I was 16. Really? I remember I was listening to Iz Ed's show and I was like, I was really into, I was really into like, Garage and you at the time. And I was like, fuck, Todd Edwards is coming to the UK, I've got to go to this. And then, it's in Romford, I live in Romford, I've got to go to this. And yeah, that was a great night. I've never seen like, a thousand men in a club singing to like, TJR, Just Get Better something yeah it's so funny yeah and there it was just cool because the most memorable thing is i dropped this intro with wishing I were home and the reaction, I still have that on tape, you know, the videotape, and it was just so, like, I was, you could see on my face, I'm like, oh my God, because everything I dropped, it just was like, people were just so ecstatic to have me playing, and it was, I think, after all that's said and done, and even though I had years of doing work and knowing that I was known, that kind of made it a for me I suppose it's also worth saying how big that club was it was quite it wasn't a small club it felt like I don't know how many people but it felt like 1500 or something like that and it was packed And going from a small venue, just some hotel lounge, which I was scared, and it was very stressful, going from that to this, getting rid of the stage fright thing and just being able to let go, and then to slowly just be okay with it. It was a really, it was a big step both on a mental level and just on a career level to see that happen. So on all levels, it was cool. So do you enjoy DJing now? Yeah, I enjoy it. More so because I like connecting with the people that know my work. I mean, as an artist, you want to meet people that have an appreciation for what you do. You need to have that connection to, I don't know, I think as an artist you need an audience to feel relevant. It doesn't have to be a huge audience, but you need to know people that know your, it's part of the process. I think I like making people happy I like you know I think I took a two year hiatus where I did some BS work which made me more appreciative of my music and which kind of inspired no place like the track no place like London was just like never to take if I ever did take for granted what I had And I also became more energetic when I DJed too. It was never just this quiet thing. I just kind of bounce around like someone that's just taken a Red Bull or something. So you said, did you have a high ace? Did you completely quit music at that time? I didn't quit, but I left iRecords and I needed some time to just regroup because there was nothing coming in and it became a bad situation on different levels at i and it was just like enough was enough and I just made a clean break and I didn't honestly know where my next move was going to be so I needed to regroup myself. a path got revealed. I mean, you know, I knew, again, I knew God was in control of it because like I was getting interviews saying, yeah, you have all these dubstep producers that are quoting that they're fans of your work and inspired by your work. And like, you're hearing this like dub what? No, I mean, it's like, I knew what dubstep was, but like not to the point where I was really familiar with it. I mean, I heard the term a couple years ago. years ago and it's like you know I like I knew at that point that something was going on because the timing once again was impeccable and I mean it's not saying this was some easy road it hasn't been but I knew that the doors were opening to to do more things and it's been you know a lot of ups and downs but it feels like it's going in the right direction so I was gonna say is that weird you know you've got acts like maybe Chip or Joey Orbison that, you know, grew up on your music and now that you're working on remix projects one way or the other, is that a strange feeling? No, I mean... I don't, I mean, I think it's, only when you think of it in terms of age, you know what I mean? Like, I think that that makes it a little weird. I mean, because you start to, you know, you realize, like, you know, it's cliche to say, but when the crowd's getting younger and younger, you know what I mean? Like, you know, whether you look young or old, it's when you can see, like you said, you see a noticeable difference This person's not my age anymore. They're 10, 15 years. That's kind of freaky at times. But aside from that, I mean, I, if I, you know, I look, I respect producers for what, for what they can create. So I don't, I'm not above anybody. And, um, I'm. always happy to do a remix so it's just kind of like you know i just want my fair share that's you know and just to to do my part in this you know what i mean again it's just like to still have an audience and to keep an audience you know to have an audience to to play my music is is a great thing so so this you mentioned it's been 15 years now and one thing you said which sometimes sometimes people say negatively oh it all sounds the same but Your sonic palette is pretty small compared to a lot of people. Have you still managed to make that sound fresh and relevant over all this time? You know, what I find always, and I don't like to make it, like I really don't speak negatively. I try to always put my best face forward with things. The funny thing that I always found funny about people saying it sounds the same, it's like you listen to any genre of music. Especially when I started DJing more and I'm trying to, because I don't really feel like I have a DJ sound. I kind of just go, I'll play, it depends where I'm at. I'll play some UKG, I'll play some Classic House. I think if I don't jump out of the Todd Edwards persona, jumping out of the Todd Edwards persona would be the only way that I could establish myself as a different DJ. Because people just expect certain things when I DJ. But I was exploring. And I'm like checking out Beatport, you know, after a few years of really not. caring about listening to a lot of dance music and I'm listening to genres and then sub-genres of those genres and after my ears stopped bleeding and I woke up I was amazed about how much was out there but then in each of those genres when you go through the top 10 or top 100 Come on, man. I mean, it all sounds the same. And that's coming from different producers. So, you know, it almost, I started to just really, because I'm a people pleaser. So I do care about what people say because, you know, I want to strive to be the best that I can. And when I make music, I mean, you know, again, when you get comfortable with something, it's very difficult to think outside the box, but I'm always trying to bring in different samples or different musical elements or different chords. And I think any genre of music, when you listen to... That, you know, if you just listen at it from a distance, you know, you can listen to rock music and think it all sounds the same or heavy metal or R&B or rap, you know what I mean? Like, until you start getting involved with that music and you listen to the intricacies, you know, but, I mean, there are forms of music that basically, you know, I mean, taking, like, house music and... I was like, okay, there's always the minute and a half intro until it drops, and then it comes back in hard. I mean, like every single track, I didn't even know it became that formulaic. I mean, like the last time I really bothered to really look into it, I'm like, really? All of it's like, you know what I mean? It's like this is the format. I don't know, it's accepted. So I don't really pay too much attention to that anymore, especially now, like I said, now that I've been experimenting, because I've never did two-step really, like one two-step record. So now that I've been kind of, I've been really inspired by Future Garage and I like the sound. It's kind of like this ambient, futuristic sound thing going on and I found it inspiring me to experiment with the drums and stuff. What kind of producers are really ticking your boxes right now? I mean, I guess it started off with first hearing Joy Orbison stuff and I had to listen to it several times before I kind of grasped what was going on because I'm like, I think I didn't honestly get it at first, like, you know, because I'm so used to hearing like, like, okay, you know, like thing. And then it starts to, again, it's one of those things that. just starts to grow on you and you start to just to feel it. I'm trying to think of who else I listen to because honestly I just check out stuff that's on SoundCloud and you know it's not like I'm into any one producer. I mean like I checked out Minded Kingdom's remix and then I started to listen to you know what he did I mean I who else like I on SoundCloud I just checked out like people like Kovu um you know everyone's experimenting with it too even like you know like even Duncan Powell and you know the UKG people so it's you know Solutions done some stuff and you know there's just there's a lot on there I've listened to uh I don't know if you know Resketch and who else? It seems like your music's in a really good place right now. You know, you're probably getting just as much re-win as you've ever got, plenty of gigs. How do you think things will develop next? The main thing, and I have two accountabilities, him being one of them, because he's honestly my, one of my, it's him and John Liu who went under DJ Sarky, who started, who had the fan webpage, and they have been like kind of my online promoting and just kind of personal encouragement, and I have my close friends too, but like they've been very active on the actual. promotion level to keep on me because I'm putting together a digital label. So I have like 10 to probably 14 releases or tracks now that need to come out. When I go home from this trip, I dedicated August is going to be mixed down month to get these things mixed down and ready for digital. you know, digital distribution. So, and I'm already in the talks. The people that, the digital distributor that did the thing for Scion, the I Might Be release, I talked to them when I did the release and I talked to them about, you know, getting a label. together. I mean, there's a lot of digital distributors, but I like the idea of working with someone that's working with someone else that I know is a good company and whatnot. So you will see my label. I don't want to talk about it. I mean, I've always flashed around the logo of it. So, but it's, I guess it's safe to say with its new trend music is going to be the name is the name of the label. So that's. I started with that name as a production, like I went under New Trend Productions and when my manager put out, he put out the New Trend CDs, but that was like, that name came from the New Trend project and that was before, you know, so it's mine. you know what I mean so and I think it represents who I am because I always the concept at the time when I first started making music to start my own trend of something which ironically is kind of still the same thing that I've been doing which isn't a new trend but you know it may not be a new trend it's your own yeah exactly I want to do more gigs I mean, I definitely, you know, I want to try to get out. to Europe more. My biggest fan base is London and centered around London. It seems like gigging is a lot like major label A&R. It's all about what does he have out and you know it's you know they're booking you because they think you can pack people into a club. So it's not about artistry and it's not about your reputation as an artist. It's about... do they think you can pack people in a club and what does that come down to having hit records or something new or something whatever so you see you know what the strategy is with that you have to have something that that makes noise on a grand scale so that means hitting you know whatever getting some releases out on other labels I have plenty of labels that I can reach out to to do stuff so I'm going to do that as well And I don't know, I feel really, I think things are moving into a positive direction. You know, I hurt my neck and that kind of triggered off having to relax for a little while, got into some good health and, you know, I don't know. Things are, it was a really rocky, positive, but rocky year and it just feels like it's... Yeah. Again, that seems to be another theme that continually happens throughout your life. Things negative and positive. Yeah, it's, I mean, it's, you know, I mean, I never think, you know, I hope I never come off arrogant at all. And if I am, I'll probably lose a leg or something. But I never thought I was, I needed humbling, but I'm constantly put into situations where it's like, it's almost like it's got to, I got to be knocked down a couple of pegs. So I'm always in this vulnerable state of just, I guess just being appreciative and thankful. I think it's God's way of just cracking the whip and just keeping me, you know, be thankful for where you are and don't, you know. Don't get ahead of yourself, don't get full of yourself. And I think it's work because I'm confident, but I'm not, I don't think I'm egocentric. And even the confidence thing doesn't always hold up. It's like, you know, if you don't like something I did, I'll probably start getting, you didn't like it, you know. It's just the type of person that I am, so. Bye.
