The creeps. The creeps. The creeps. The creeps. I've got the creeps. The creeps. The creeps. The creeps. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Benji Lehman and I am a freelance writer at Resident Advisor. Luke Solomon has lived through the best and worst that underground music has to offer. His early releases on seminal house imprints like Chez Damier's Prescription label established crucial musical links between London and Chicago. During a visit to the Windy City, a chance meeting with Derek Carter led to the pair setting up arguably the most important underground house music label of the 90s, Classic Records. The past decade saw Classic fall foul of the problems experienced by the music industry. A brief and ambivalent flirtation with chart music proved a dead end, and the experience of loss blighted his personal life. Now though, with the relaunch of his label and new albums forthcoming from a number of his various monikers, it is clear that this talented producer has more to say than ever before. you You're from the west of England, but you moved to London in 1990. What made you abandon the West Country for the capital? Truth or lies? I actually sort of... The latter part of my teenage years were pretty misspent really. What happened around sort of '88, '89, during the heavy rave period, we'd kind of come out sixth form, I dropped out sixth form, friends had left sixth form, got A levels, etc., etc. Everyone sort of started to disappear around me. People went off to uni and things like that. I was kind of left on my own really without a lot of my sort of close friends to just do my own thing. And I'd had various jobs and then kind of got in with a wrong crowd. because just the boredom of living in Western Supermare, which is close to Bristol, it's a seaside town, so come the winter periods, there's really not a lot to do. You know, you rely on summer jobs, you rely on working on the pier or the Tropicana Pleasure Beach or different things like that. then sort of as the winter comes around, you just fall into a different life of stuff. And drugs were pretty rife in Western Bristol. I think it's very much like Brighton. There's a big rehabilitation clinic called Broadway Lodge. And a lot of people kind of drop out of there and introduce things into the culture there. And I got caught up in it quite heavily, really, to the point where I was, yeah, it was my sustenance. You know, it kind of let me, it kept me in money. And I reached a point where I'd kind of reached rock bottom and ended up in the industry. in rehab and as a result of that I'd had a few friends that sort of stepped in to try to rescue me and that helped a little bit but I was still sort of left in this world of not really knowing what it was. that I wanted to do or what I was supposed to do and I had a couple of friends that were living in London that were up at Middlesex University and they were telling me about how the university was and how much fun it was and that they didn't do any work and they were out raving every weekend and all those things that sort of ticked all the boxes for me and I had a floor to sleep on if I needed to come up. I got myself in a situation with a couple of rather unlikely characters and they sent me on a mission to London with money in my pocket and I had to return without the money and with other things in my pocket and I went up and I never went back. It was very much a kind of dickwitting. thing really you know where I'd not particularly proud at that point in my life but it was a that was the only way out really and and that was my way out and that's that's how it came about and I I sort of stuck and we were living in Green Lanes and there was about five of us in the house and became really good friends with the people there and then I used to go up to the university every Friday Saturday to the student union there would be stuff going on people playing music and it was interesting because it was kind of cross referencing sort of rave and the influx of rave music like stuff that was going on house music and then you'd had sort of northern soul and funk and rare groove and stuff like that so it was a real hot spot but a couple of really good DJs that were up there and And within the space of, I think that was literally by 1990, within the space of about six months, I met my wife, who's my wife now, and she was kind of my saviour, really. I stayed with her at university, and then we ended up getting a place together. And, yeah, it went on from there, really. That was, yeah, she got me on the straight and narrow, kind of. But mostly the straight and narrow. So while you were in the West Country, were you aware of a lot of the music that was happening in Bristol? Because, of course, I mean, I suppose perhaps a little after you'd left, but even during the 80s and early 90s. um it was a massive melting pot and a very important place for uk music yeah i mean very much so i mean the wild bunch um um a massive attack and all that that world of things smith and mighty especially you know we kind of knew them we hung out with them we used to go to bristol we used to go to the mug club we used to go see the Wild Bunch, you know, just there where they were DJing and stuff that was going on. So that was part of Western's Bristol life. But the rave world had also kicked in. So you had this kind of mixture of both those things, which were quite diverse, but they had a point in the middle where they both sort of met. really you know soul to soul had become you know a big big act but then you had all the sort of DIY parties and things that were going on out in the in the countryside so we had I mean, Western's an unusual place. It's a big, big mod town. It's a big northern soul town. There's a lot of skinheads there. It's got a real history of black music, and it's quite cultured, even though it's a very small place. And so from a really early age, I was exposed to quite a diverse range of lesser-known or not-so-popular music. That was in my blood, really, I think. For a lot of people from Western, it's part of their blood. You know, music is a real driving force. So, yeah, I mean, you know, it still is. You know, I'm still, you know, I'm a Bristol boy, really. And so between moving to London in 1990 and 1995, a lot seemed to happen, leading eventually to your releases on... Freetown and Prescription which is Chez Damier's label can you just give me an idea of what life was like during those years and how you became first a DJ and then a producer oh so I guess within the first couple of years of me living in London from sort of 91 92 um I I basically I'd I'd always collected music, but I'd started buying records. And then a friend of mine, a guy called Damon Chicken, who was the DJ on a Friday at Middlesex Union, he'd given me a chance to go and play a few records. And I got a real sort of bug for it. And I would just go out and buy music and constantly buy music, spend every single bit of money that I had. buying records and I discovered a record shop in Barnet which is literally just around the corner from where I live which I just stumbled across one day it was called Stop On By and I was like well this is weird I didn't even know this was here and I went in and there's a guy working behind the counter and I looked around and I was like wow this is This is a whole world of music here that I need to discover. And the guy behind the counter turned out to be a well-known. DJ at that time but someone who'd been around for a long time called Ty Holden and who's actually there's a really famous musician called Vince Taylor who David Bowie modelled himself on and he wrote a few songs The Clash covered and Ty was his son and a real interesting guy and He kind of took me under his wing and he sort of educated me a lot in music that I didn't know about, a lot of American imports and stuff like that. So I literally would go there every day, every single day. And if I had any money, I'd buy imports. I'd be there Thursday morning. I'd wait for the import fans to come. We'd, you know, there'd be Strictly Rhythm releases. There'd be... early Merck stuff, a lot of kind of Miami things that had appeared, and he'd given me some mixtapes, and there were some great early DIY records on there. stuff that I just, it changed my world, really. And he kind of mentored me, I suppose. And from that point, opened up some doors. I started working at the record shop. I worked there every Saturday. I'd be in there every day. And it was just like a drug for me. My addiction kind of changed from that to music, really. And that was my kind of saving grace. I met people through there. It's how I met Kenny Hawks because he used to come down to buy the records. There was a big connection between Ty. Richard's and Terry Francis and and so we had this kind of little hub really of creativity and people and great DJs and from there I made a connection with Freetown Records through a DJ called Femi B and Femi took me, he was working at Freetown and he took me over to Freetown and introduced me to the owner. and there's a guy called Steve Canueto working there who went on to work for Ministry and I just, I don't know, I felt like a natural progression for me to move from the record shop, it was just ambition, I think it was just plain ambition really of going to a record label and being involved with a record label and it was a great record label putting out. you know, masters at work, Robert Owens, Arnold Jarvis, Kerry Chandler, um, Failing Brown, like all kinds of mad stuff and things that I was really drawn to. And, and so I started, I had, I was working promotions there and I started working there and. I'd built up some connections. One of the connections was Marshall Jefferson and the other person was Ron Trent. And through Ron, my knowledge of Chicago music was kind of broadening. Prescription had appeared when I was at the record shop in the first couple of releases. And I remember just being completely destroyed by this. house music that I'd never heard before, really. Nothing like that had ever been around and so enamoured by it. And then listening to early Derek Carter records and hearing these records that I'd never heard anything that was quite like it, was very different and they were a bit odd and a bit quirky and a bit weird and all those things and those boxes for me sort of ticked and made it something that I... I wanted to find out more about really. And Ron Trent was kind of my connection. Freetown was my connection there to Shay and to Derek. And I was also working with Rob Mello, who I met through the record shop. He was working at Zoom and then he moved to Black Market and we'd become really good friends. He was my first studio port of call. I worked with Ty Holden on a record that Rob engineered and Rob sort of taught me about making music and so from then on we sort of, I think Chicago became the next place for me, the next place to want to discover or to feel I had some kind of connection with. that I wanted to be a part of really. And you've mentioned in the past that you had quite a unique privilege in being introduced to many of the Chicago DJs and producers who were operating during the early 90s. Can you tell me something about what Chicago was like during those years? I think the first time I went to Chicago was 94, and I went out there with a good friend of mine who wanted to travel America, and sadly he's not alive anymore, but he was a very close friend, and he knew I was going. He wanted to come with me. It was nice to have someone to go with. He wasn't into music, but not part of the musical world. I had managed through Freetown to sort of hook up a couple of gigs and I'd got a gig in New York. I got a gig in a couple of. gigs in Chicago and something in Toronto I think it was just through music connections and managed to get my playing fair together gone out to become really good friends with a couple of the guys that ran Relief and Casual just through records sending records backwards and forwards to each other and it was a real kind of community spirit there and I'd made a record with Rob and Zaki which we wanted specifically made it for prescription wanted to get it to Shea Shea had wanted to sign it up so all of the things that have led to me actually going to Chicago and and hooking up with Derek for the first time. And so when we got out there, it was quite mad. We were sleeping with a guy called Rob on the floor of this guy, Rob Kachoukas, who worked at Casual. We slept on his couch and we rented a rent-a-wreck. And I had these gigs and I was completely out of my depth. I mean, completely out. Thinking back now. It's like I don't even know how I managed to do it. I wasn't really a great DJ, although I had great music. I had access to a lot of stuff that people hadn't heard. And I guess I kind of just blagged my way through it, really. But with... with an ambition that was you know genuine really you know and going out there and I played the first time I played I think I played at a club called Medusas which was with Sneak and Spencer Kinsey who's Gemini and then I also played at another mad party which a guy called Dave Gandy put on, who was a big promoter around those times, which was like Morris Joshua and Ron Carroll, and Derek was playing, and Derek knew the party was going to be crap, and he came and rescued me, and that was sort of our connection, and we ended up sort of hanging out at his loft space. It was, even though it was a bit mad and it was a bit all over the place and sort of disorganised, it was just, there was something that just changed everything for me. Like, I think more than anything was hearing DJs play records in a way that I'd never heard them be played before. The use of crossovers and cutting out bass and... and uh an energy and a mixture of music that could incorporate anything from sort of new stuff to old stuff and and even disco and real sort of straight up you know chicago dance mania records or relief records to then playing um um you know like a phelan brown record or a um a Basement Boys record or a Masters at Work record to like a Straight Acid record to then into like a Nizza Reb record and just this just energy that's just incredible and the other thing I think that that really just encapsulated everything for me was the dancing. I mean, I'd never seen anything like it in my life, you know, that people that could really, really fucking dance, you know, that majority of a black crowd and people just throwing down, just genuinely going at it and dancing. Like, I was just like, wow, you know, I've always liked dancing. It's something that... give me enough drinks now and I'll do it but I've always been enamoured and just amazed by great dancing and that was all part of the parcel and I think it it changed my life you know it really did it was and then going to New York as well was you know I hung out with the guys that were there they took me to uh wednesday night sound factory bar i got to hear um little lewis play and that blew my mind and there was a great energy in new york as well and there was a lot going on in new york i got to go to the strictly rhythm offices and all these things you know being a little kid you know really and it was just yeah it was just the whole experience i was just hooked on america full stop really you know from that point on But yeah, it was a good school for me, really. So then you came back in, well, in 1996, you started Space? Yeah, yeah, I think it was roughly around then, yeah. For somebody like myself who was of a younger generation and who never got a chance to attend Space, can you give me an idea of what it was about, what a Space night was like? Yeah, I mean, Space was something that was sort of born out of all of those sort of previous experiences that I've talked about where, and I'd met Kenny Hawks and we were doing a radio station called Girls FM and we'd become sort of very kindred spirits and there was no one really on the radio that sort of... played the music that we played and we were both a bit odd and a bit different and I think that's how we were kind of drawn to each other and the fact that we had an opportunity to do a Wednesday night which started out with a guy called Tony Transatlantic and um There was nothing in London midweek really happening at that time for our world of music, apart from Paul Trouble Anderson's Loft, which was more the soulful end of dance music. And we had this, you know, great venue, Bar Rumba, Wednesday night. We started out, we'd make some great connections through the radio. We got Derek Carter to become a really close friend of mine and the opportunity to put him on and Ron Trent and people I'd met through Freetown and people that had come to the radio station. And we just wanted to do something that we liked, that we played music. or we heard music that we liked that we weren't hearing anywhere else. Not even at the weekend, really. I think the music we played, there wasn't really anything going on. You know, plastic people didn't start till after Space. So, yeah, and that's how Space was kind of born, really. From that point on, we did it every Wednesday for a good four or five years. What led you to bring it to an end in 2000? Soho changed more than anything else. I think the new centre of London became Old Street. Soho just didn't become a very nice place anymore. It got quite scary and rough and I think there's a lot of things that went down and people had kind of just moved on. There was more stuff happening midweek and we had a lot more competition and it was a lot cheaper for people to go out on Old Street and all those things. There were a lot of factors really where I think that it... it just felt like a natural conclusion for us, I think. We wanted to end it on a high. We didn't want to just hang in there for the sake of hanging in there. Kenny was very much of a, like, do something and then move on. And so that's what we did. You know, we did a great party and it was remembered in a special way. I think we got, over the years, such an amazing amount of DJs that came through their doors, from Steel Silk Hurley to Franz Reckovorkian. Frankie Knuckles to to Naglia to Derek Carter to Ron Trent, Shea Damian, Marshall Jefferson, Andrew Weverall, Carl Cox I mean the list was it was really across the board Darren Emerson and and I think we got to point where we we we felt like we'd we'd done something great but it was time to move on really and and I had the record label, and that was sort of taking up a lot of my time. So, yeah, yeah, it's just, that's it, natural conclusion. really I think more than anything else. So during the late 90s Classic Records started to reach its apex. What were the most memorable records you signed to Classic and what were the most important moments for the label during that time? I think there was a point where we sort of we elevated ourselves out of being run from my house to getting an office is an office i think sort of sneak allowed you can't hide from your bud was definitely a kind of pivotal point where things changed quite drastically um then after that isolate um was another sort of turning point for us where i think people really started to take the the label became quite a serious thing and people We're like, OK, I guess we're making a statement, but, you know, this is a label that's going to be around and we're not just all about one thing. We're sort of crossing genres. dance music and doing stuff that's a little bit different to the norm and I think it just kind of grew out of that it's such a blur really because it was such a mad time I think we went from we had music for freaks at the same time and so I was making music as freaks releasing that and at the same time as that classic stuff was happening and It was, you're just in this kind of world of just hype and mania and a whole lot of attention, really. And, yeah, it was quite, it was different. And then from that point, you know, we suddenly then falling into sort of financial issues. It became a very different beast. yeah I don't know sort of putting it down to records or moments or amounts of records but it just felt like there was a period where we just had this roll of records one after the other coming out Gemini Derek Islay Rob all these things and every single record would touch a different person in a different way and you suddenly were building this sort of bigger and bigger audience and then greens keepers and you had people like Jarvis Cocker contacting you and you know because you were sort of reaching out into a different world and I and I you know none of it was planned we just it just happened and and it became you know I think sort of I'd like to say bigger than the both of us but I don't think that was possible with Derek really but it did become something that now I realize what an impact it had it's quite an interesting sort of legacy to have left really it's quite um you know we're back again but in a very different way but for that point in time that was a great sort of legacy to have and i mean a lot of your artists or some of your artists like freeform five teeth sports and some of the people who'd remixed on the label like ivan smag um who remixed something as black strobe um they went on to become part of this kind of electro house scene and i just wondered it seemed to coincide i suppose with the point at which you started to bring the label to a close and i just wondered whether you ever thought about taking it down that road You know what, the interesting point of that, I think even, you know, you look at people like Jesse Rose and Stephen Goldman and people that have gone on to become successful from, you know, as a result of putting music out on our label. I think at the point, it was, there were artists that were being realised from the music that we were releasing and exposing to them too. And it was a point where the music industry was quite healthy and you had labels like Sony and all these people suddenly coming and snatching them up and taking them from us. And I think as an artist, when you are having money kind of waved around in front of you and, you know, it's a difficult... I've been there as an artist before and it's quite a gamble. It's quite a big leap to take, but I don't think that... Derek and myself would ever, I don't think it was ever in us as businessmen to capitalise on that and to hold on to those artists and to turn into, you know, a major independent label because... For us, it was always about music. It still is about music. It will always be about music. It's not me about sitting back in a big armchair going, oh, look, all these artists, I've made hundreds of thousands of pounds, I'm very rich, aren't I special? For me, it's about moving on and doing something new and trying to break the mould and change things musically. Again, it was a natural conclusion and it was a natural progression for a lot of those people, really, I think. Whether those choices that they made creatively were the best things or the best decisions they made in their life, I don't know. I think that was for them to kind of find out, really, you know. It's interesting because I've redeveloped. a lot of relationships with those people again especially Anu and stuff and I think it was quite a hard thing to have to go through to be forced from A label that was very organic and allowed you to have all this freedom to then being put in a situation where something was expected of you and you had to deliver. And I've been there before and I think that it's really hard to be that person. You know, we come from a very different world of music and I think you should allow it to happen. on its own really, but, you know, that's all part of growing up really, you live and learn really. Because, of course, you have also had some experience as a major label artist, or at least as part of a group that were quite commercially successful with Freaks. Yeah. Is that something you'd consider repeating? Uh, no. I think, I think it's interesting really because people ask me about the record and they think, you know, was it, what do you think of it? And generally I have to, I have to be grateful and go, well, you know, it earned me some money and I built a studio out of it and it was fine. But if I'm genuinely honest about... how it made me feel or what it did to me and how I think in retrospect. Do I have any regrets? I kind of do, really. I do wish that it had never happened in a lot of respects. I think it has an effect on relationships. It has an effect on friendships. It has an effect on a false sense of security of sort of financially. You've suddenly got the world and money and your ego is driven and boosted into a way where you think, oh, this is great. It's easy. I can do this again. And with all of that comes strains on relationships. financial woes you you you go above your means and then on top of that you're forced into a world where you think i've done this once i can do it again but really you can't you you can't preempt music unless you are um in a world of that if you're a madonna or a lady gaga and generally it's because you've got money and a team behind you to help you make you that thing If you're trying to make pop records, that's the hardest thing that you could ever do. To actually go and do something by accident, that has always been the way that we've had our biggest records, really, is they've been happy accidents. They've been things where we've had an idea or concept, not a... let's go and make this, we'll sell millions. You lose sight of what it is or what it was you were trying to do in the first place. And I think we all did, really. I think it took a while for us to reset everything and go, actually, you know what, we don't want this, we want to go back. to the way we were and let's see what happens and so in retrospect it's a tricky one but it definitely caused me a lot of mental turmoil I think which I've really only just come out the other side of, I think. So obviously it's you and Derek Carter who are behind the label and his name comes up a lot in the kind of story of your career. And I just wondered if you could sort of give me an idea of what he's like. I don't know. I think for us, more than anything else, is that I think we both... I think we both are very similar in the fact that I think we both feel like we don't fit in. And I think that was the point where we both connected. But he's an odd person to explain. He's really difficult to explain. But, you know, ultimately, he's a very kind and generous person. that's also a little sidetracked by a lot of confusing behaviour that translates into, I don't know really what it is or what he's searching for or what he's doing, but I guess as he's got older, he's sort of calmed down or he's not quite as erratic as he used to be. in his behaviour, I think, whether it's because he's got his dogs at home and having that responsibility and whether he's just grown up. But he's... I can't... I just see him as a maestro, really, a wandering minstrel, you know, that's... He sort of... He has a fixed abode, but when he's travelling, he does his own thing, he has his own little world of things that he does. He plays music in the way he does that no one else does, really. You know, one of the few DJs that I could hear a mix of his and know exactly who it was that was DJing without you having to tell me. And that's a talent in itself, really. But I think as... As we've got older, our relationships have changed a lot and we're, you know, we'll spend all day on texting each other about plant pots or the colour of some shoes or something like that. Our relationship is... is beyond sort of music and work and DJing and what the next hot record is. You know, we don't... There are very rarely things that we'll exchange apart from if it's actually work-related, but we don't generally have those conversations. We just talk shit, really, like most friends should do. Someone else you mentioned, JT Donaldson. His name came up recently, actually, because I was talking to somebody about Spencer Kinsey, who, of course, whose records you released as Gemini. That's someone who I know in past interviews you've talked about as being quite a big influence. And I just wondered if you could tell me something about him. what he's like and whether you still have a relationship with him. Who, Spencer? Yeah. Spencer was like, I mean, Derek is like my friend and partner and mentor of sorts, but Spencer was like my real mentor. He was the DJ that I could probably equate to a lot more in style and music than Derek, for instance. I think... just in their kind of madness and musical taste and the similar interests that we shared. And he was the one person that used to listen to my mixes and used to listen to me DJ and used to help me sort of push myself to become different and become an individual and take risks and do all those things. And for that reason, you know, I owe him a lot. from a musical reason as well. I think, you know, he spent a lot of time together. He used to live with me for periods of time. And it's quite a sensitive subject for me because... I see his music being exploited. Me and Derek made a conscious decision not to re-release his records because he's not in a situation to basically okay that or allow it. And I think that's vitally important. He's chosen to opt out from society. He's chosen to not have a fixed abode. And he doesn't want to be a part of the music industry anymore. And he doesn't want to be a part of... this world anymore and I think for that reason um that's his choice um I mean mental illness and things like that have are a factor in different things but um I still you know he's a very intelligent man which I still think he has his reasons for doing what he did um and I just, I mean, it's sad that he's not around. It's sad like people don't exist or they exist for a certain period of time because they have such a lasting impact on music and they're inspiring. But I also get very disheartened when I see their music being exploited by people that... don't have the right to exploit that music directly from him and that makes me angry because you look at a lot of artists in those instances that have either gone off the grid or died early or... You know, I think people take advantage of that and their argument is, oh, they're just trying to get them heard. Where does that money go? What happens to those things? They're not, you know, it's all very well they're getting heard, but someone's getting paid and something, I don't know. Sometimes I find it's for other people's gains rather than their own. And yeah, it's sad. really it still makes me sad I miss him a lot I also wanted to ask you about Kenny Hawks who very sadly passed away last year of course he's somebody you worked with a lot and again I just wondered if you could give an idea of what he was like for people who hadn't ever met him or come into contact with him but know his music This might be a difficult one for me, but I'll give it a shot. Yeah. I mean, there's no... There's no denying the fact that Kenny was like, he was an arsehole. He was like, Derek summed him up as a wonderful arsehole, you know. He was like, he was such an unusual guy. I mean, there are people that he'd upset. There were people whose hearts he'd touched. And he was very much like Spencer is, I think, in a way where he just was a renegade on this path of just champing the music that he had discovered that no one else could play, that no one else could make sound like he did. He had this just wonderful talent for... There are... he's saying there are a few DJs that you hear whose music you could hear in in their that they put their soul into what they do that you you could listen to the songs and it sounds like their character and Derek's like that Spencer's like that Kenny's was like that too where he um um And his music sounded like his makeup, you know. It was dark. It was a bit sinister. It was always some sexual ambiguous stuff going on in it. There's a lot of comedy and a lot of irony and, you know, a very sort of twisted sense of humour. And that was what I loved about him. You know, he was incredibly dry, incredibly dry, you know. I loved his sense of humour. I mean, we had a great connection there. And it's just, yeah, it was a sad turn of events, really, for someone that really had... everything going for him that um unfortunately due to um the nature of our business and our job i see people that get caught up in And I've been there and I've been close to being there and I think it could have been any one of us that it could have happened to, but to fall into a world of addiction and to let that get the better of you is a heartbreaking thing, really. You know, it's, yeah, I wish he was still here, you know. You yourself are a well-known proponent of vocals in dance tracks. Where does your love of vocals come from? Are there any particular records that you cite in as being prime examples of how vocals should be used in a club music context? It's funny, really. My interest in vocal-led music probably comes from being a kid and I was brought up in a kind of Catholic... upbringing and had to go to church with my grandma and had to go and sing and like singing and then as I got older I used to listen to my dad sort of listen to the carpenters and and stuff like Crosby, Stills and Nash and sort of a lot of melody led sort of harmony records and things like that which I'd always been fascinated by and then As I kind of got older, I started to delve into like soul and northern soul and, you know, so much. I mean, everything really. I mean, sort of historically for me and my musical taste of looking at records that really moved me. I mean, it's very rare that it would be an instrumental record that has the same impact on me as a vocal record. I've always made a point of listening to lyrics. I think that's something that a lot of people don't do. And I think lyrics that are relevant and lyrics that actually say something. You listen to David Bowie, you listen to Van Morrison or... you know, they're singing about something. You listen to punk, you listen to John Lydon, public image, stuff like that. You know, there's, they're, they're, they're, they're the things that speak to me, you know, are more than stuff that, you know, I listened to James Brown. I love James Brown. I love, I love the elements that make up a James Brown record, but lyrically, um, I wouldn't have said that that record moves me in the way that if I heard Space Oddity or something like a David Silvian record or something like that where I love to hear that voice. Using a voice as an instrument is something that's really quite magical and the people that have the ability to do it and do it well and do it in their own way, you have people like John. Marsh from The Beloved or you know David Sylvan from Japan or Bowie or people that have a real character in their voice the Blue Nile bands like that I've been really drawn to and lyrically drawn to and for me to do that with my own music it was always a real challenge it's like I would love to write a song you're making an instrumental piece of music is something I've grown up doing and I could do with my eyes closed when it comes to dance music and stuff. It doesn't feel very challenging for me. It feels like a natural progression is to be able to write a song, to get a singer, to get it sung, and then to be able to write a song with melody and structure and arrangements and then to progress into, you know... discovering musicians and writing things for them and actually being a writer myself is, it was just a natural progression really. And, and I find it kind of quite challenging and, and something that I. I'm still not good at it, but I still, I'm getting better, and the more I do it, you know, to have actually written a song for John Marsh and have him sing it, you know, who'd have thought when I was sat in my car when I was 16 years old listening to, you know, the beloved to think that, you know, here I am 25 years later having written a song for him to sing it and for me to produce it is quite an ambition that's... I've achieved that I'm really proud of and I don't know I just songs and lyrics and melodies as things that just grab you and take you somewhere else you know you listen to something like the new Kate Bush album of that where it's just she's using her voice as an instrument and writing words or songs or conceptual stuff or conceptual music about things or telling a story and I think that's quite remarkable Tom Waits has a song on his new album called Hell Broke Loose and it is him singing in his sort of low range demonic voice about being a soldier and it's got this kind of military beat over the top of it And for that minute, you actually think you're in Afghanistan and you're terrified by what he's done in this record that makes you really think about, you know, life and what the fuck goes on and what... how real it is and how wrong situations are. And I love that. I mean, don't get me wrong. I mean, I'm a sucker for Teddy Pendergrass and Al Green and Bill Withers. You know, I could play Bill Withers over and over again, but there's something about sitting and listening to Bill Withers sing you songs with a voice that's so magical and telling a story and singing about his grandma. And it's just, I mean, how could you not, really? You know, how could you not like vocal-led music? I think that's something that's been, that's died from dance music in recent years. You know, I grew up around sort of garage and soulful records and not always records that I... I played, but they were around a lot and there was a lot of, you know, vocal-led music through my early DJing career, which is a real challenge to play because you have to key records and play them and it's quite hard to play vocal after vocal after vocal. But then I'm not... I'm not the poor sort of person that wants to hear vocal after vocal. I like to hear things broken up. But then we went through a period where it was kind of, you played a vocal in a club and you were, people looked at you like you were some kind of alien, you know, and it's just then, and now all of a sudden again, we've gone back into the world of vocal-led music. Again, it's touching on it, but, you know, for me, more recently, like last year, to hear records like the Storm Queen record, the first Storm Queen record, which I thought was so simple and so great, that had a real impact on people, to the Merc record, the Alma May Intruder record. which is so discordant and weird and shouldn't really work. But, you know, people are like coming up to you and saying, what is that record? You know, in a dance floor environment, that's quite rare that that's happened and it's happening more and more now. And I'm excited by that. You know, it's really good because I think there's still a lot to be said for... playing vocals in a dance environment and having that sing-along and that party aspect, which I think we've lost a lot. And over the years, I think whether there's sort of, I don't know whether the perfect dance vocal led, I mean, Tensity did it very well. Blaze did it very well with a lot of their vocal records, but a lot of them were times, you know, using Casio or using even Robert Owens where... The vocal's really an instrument that's running ad-libs and stuff like that, but they're not really kind of song-structured, key-changed records. I don't know if that really works so much in a club environment. I think when it gets too complicated, then I think that loses people's interest a little bit. Another way in which you have maintained the paradigm of being a songwriter and an artist... not just a producer is in the way that you've continued to release artist albums and I just wondered what your interest is in that form and how you think it translates today um I know it's got a bit of a bone of contention for me actually because I the last album that I've I wrote and I've um as an album after the different engine was an album called Timelines which I still haven't released and I'm sort of due to release it, but I'm actually remixing the entire album again because I don't think it translates the way I was hoping it would translate. But I love, I'm a sucker for a concept, you know, and same with the Freaks albums with Man Who Lived Underground and anything that can tell a story and you can write a narrative to it musically that runs over a period of time. It's brilliant. I love that, sitting and being taken somewhere else for 50 minutes or 60 minutes or 70 minutes. 40 minutes, whatever it is, on a journey where every piece of music is different but sort of links together and becomes part of a bigger picture. And I think that's being lost more and more and more now. Everything is about the hit, the single and the hit and the single and the hit and the putting it out and... we'll get to an album or it'll be a series of the first five songs are great and then everything tails off towards the end because people lose interest at that point and they're not really that bothered and I don't really come from that world at all. I love to be able to hear an album, listen to it as it was made and in its entirety and like the Steve Mason album, Boys Outside, that Richard X produced. That, for me, was a great album. It was a piece of music where you could listen to from beginning to end. There wasn't necessarily a single on it, although they tried, but it made sense as a whole rather than individual pieces. And there's a real talent in doing something like that, I think. You mentioned that you're going to be... releasing a digital kid album as well as um the um the what we now know the existence of another luke solomon album yeah um and um there's also of course what you've done as freaks i just wondered if you could give me a quick disambiguation of what the different aliases mean and which collaborators they include? I think with Luke Solomon, I think I've become more of a... And whether it's music that kind of fuels my DJing or replicates what it is I play as a DJ. And so in that respect, I think, you know, for me to do the John Marsh record and do a series of records that will become an album at some point. With the Digital Kid, that was an experiment, more of a concept of doing something that was instrumental led that I wanted to do as a whole and collaborate with a few different... people and it very much has a sound um that represents the digital kid and um i wanted to use samples and do different things like that so that's how that turned out with freaks It's still very vocal-led. We've just signed the new Freaks record to Hot Creations, which will be interesting to see what happens there. But that's a record that we wrote maybe five years ago, which we've reproduced and redone and worked with Diz on. We have another record, Freaks record with Stella, which is another vocal record coming out on Rebirth. which again is very much a Freaks record. It sounds like a Freaks record. And then outside of that, you know, I've moved into a different world of music, which I'm working with. on a project called Mother Rose, we were releasing a four-track sampler on vinyl only, which has got a kind of Alabama Three, sort of Tom Waits feel to it, which is a different world completely. And then another world of music I'm working on with a cellist, and a guy called Richard Walters, which is very much more kind of a soundtrack world of music. So I don't know. I'm kind of spreading my wings a little bit more. Well, I have been doing for a while, but this year it's all going to get heard. So finally, I think people are going to be... bald shitless of me by the end of this year. Then I can go and live on an island for a few years. At least they don't have to listen to me on Twitter or Facebook anymore because I've left all of that, all those worlds behind, so that's fine. I mean, talking of the internet, you have been quite a vocal critic of digital music, which I suppose arguably has been quite a big driver in the demise of the album format. And so I just wondered how it's affected, the advent of digital music has affected your life as an artist. I don't, it's interesting, like, because I don't, I don't dislike digital music. I don't, it feels like a stepping stone to me. It feels like, even if I sit on iTunes, even now, like I use it as a tool to discover new music, which I will gladly sit and buy, 79p, 899p, whatever it is. will be for me to then what generally what happens is i'll go to youtube i'll discover a whole world of stuff on youtube i think i wonder if that's on itunes i'll go to itunes oh yes it's on itunes because itunes is a treasure trove of music and then you think oh i've got that but it's an mp3 and it's still not how the artist made it's still not how it should be heard So then I go on to Discogs and then I start filling up my Discogs want list or I go on to Amazon and then I buy the music. So effectively I'm buying the thing twice, whatever it is, but I like the actual aspect of having physical music. And I still think that there is a lot to be said, whatever people say to you. I think with film and cinema, it's different, you know, the actual pain of owning a DVD and storing a DVD. and keeping things like that and having it on a hard drive, it kind of makes sense to me. With music, with vinyl, with CDs, it becomes part of packaging and part of something that is your makeup. And I think that there is still a lot... of life. There's a lot to be said in that world. And I also think that my, my problem is not with digital music. My problem is with the internet. You know, my problem is with the fact that everyone knows everything about everything. And, and also everyone thinks that all of that stuff that they know everything about, that they can have it for free because that's what the internet allows you to do. And that therein is where I have had to shut myself off from that world because I cannot abide it anymore. You know, I can't abide Facebook. I can't abide the fact that people will like things constantly and you will be marketed stuff. And, you know, I was turning into this minority report that has seen where they're walking down and as the person walks past... the billboard comes up with the thing that they like related to something that they've just bought. And I hate that. I think that it's diminishing. It's making people into bigger idiots than they are already, you know? And I think that there's a lot to be said for a whole other world. existing outside of the digital realm where you have record shops and you have people that actually sell you things and actually physically give you things and you're discovering things that no one else knows about. And I think that kids are still going to come back round to that. You look at the amount of record labels that are making vinyl only releases. You know, you look at all these people that sit on there and talk about, oh, how digital music and they haven't got a clue that this other... the world exists they have no outside of radiohead or lady gaga or all the things that they think that they've discovered or adele or all that stuff they think oh yeah there's a world of music that they have no concept of no idea oh you still sell records you still make records yes you know people that actually only do that because they are so fed up with having everything you know extracted from what it is that they put their heart and soul into and I think that that community is I think it's going to grow I honestly genuinely do I think that kids are still I don't think it's going to be I don't think it's going to change anything I don't think that suddenly we're going to have an industry again, an underground industry again. I think a lot has to happen in the internet for that to happen. I think there's some policing that needs to take a hold in some way or another, but all the dick swinging that goes on that they can't come to or reach an agreement, we're going to be up against the egos for years before they reach some kind of point. conclusion where that world needs to be pleased in the interim I think there still has to be this world that exists outside of it and you know I want to remain very much a part of it you know I want to release records on only on vinyl and because I think it validates it and it makes it relevant you know and I think it's an it's an important piece of education that people need to grow up with the kids need to grow up with I teach my kids that you know music isn't doesn't come free you know so It's like making shoes. I'm going to go and lift them up off the shelf because someone's made them, you know. It's a lot of time and effort that goes into making a shoe that someone needs to make a living from. And it's quite simple, really. But people will sit and argue with you for hours about what they think is right and oh it's just the way it is. It's not the way it is. I will refuse to take that as an answer. You have to adapt. You have to make music so you can go and do gigs and you'll get paid for that. Oh come on. you know that's a separate job I learned to DJ as an individual skill that acquires a whole different set of work rules to me sitting in a studio and making a piece of music you know that's two separate jobs that's how I perceive it not I make a record I give it away for free but I get three gigs off the back of it I've got a family and kids and and I want to see them come on I should be allowed to sit in my studio from nine to five every Monday to Friday come out at the end of the week and get paid for it quite simple you know why not then not have to go away at the weekend in order to justify what I've done for five days. So in turn work seven days a week for what? I mean, it's, it's so frustrating, but you know, there you go. We could sit here for another two hours while I rant on about how rubbish it is. But I don't, I'm not gonna, I refuse to just, I see so many people, it's so sad, so many colleagues, so many people so despondent and so fed up that have put their heart and soul, that have had to go off and get different jobs and do different things in order to put food on the table. And it breaks my heart because they're so talented. And you just think that slowly you're gonna diminish more and more. unless something happens, you know. So I don't know what it is. I don't know, but we'll see. you
