🎵 🎵 Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Benga. He was part of Dubstep's second generation who transformed the genre from a local concern into a global phenomenon. By age 28, Benga had toured the world several times over, so you can imagine the public's shock when he suddenly retired from the industry in February 2014. Yet since publicizing his battles with mental illness last year, he's back making music and playing shows. Carlos Hawthorne spoke to him in London to see what it's like getting back in the game. As always, you can hear our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Benga is up next. you Before we get into the interview, I just wanted to say quickly that it's good to see you here. There was a time not long ago when maybe we didn't realize that you'd be back in the industry, back making music, back doing interviews, back DJing. How does it feel to be back? It feels good. It does actually feel good. I feel like I'm being nothing but honest, and I know that. You know, it's been like, it's been an eye-opener. I forgot what it feels like to kind of produce music, DJ, family life, whatever. I feel like it's all together and do it well. So yeah, it's been an eye-opener, but it's been wicked. Just looking at the kind of handful of gigs you've played so far since you've come back, Fabrics obviously stands out. How was it like being back there? Everybody around me was excited. And my family, all my family came out. And I remember being on the way up there. It was playing like nights, playing 26 bass lines in the car. And we was all just so gassed up, just excited. And I remember getting on stage and Pokes just give me this intro and he's like, bingers back. And it was just like, here we are. let's play some music. Do you know what I mean? But it was great. It was so, Fabric was amazing. And to see the crowd, it was literally like picking up where I left off. Really? Yeah. To see the crowd just go mental from the get go. It was great. Was it emotional? Yeah. In a good way. Yeah. I'm struggling here because I just want to be completely honest, you know, and I kind of feel like. I've got a lot of music to finish, so that's always on my mind. Do you know what I mean? So I kind of, I've got one hand in the rave and I'm there and I'm excited and pumped, but then I've also got my head in the tunes, like my new tunes that I'm playing and I'm kind of listening. And every producer will tell you this, like you listen to your tunes in a club. If it doesn't sound the way you wanted it to sound when you was gonna freak out so I'm back in that zone I'm like freaking out about my tunes but then the crowds go mad and I'm like I don't know how to take it. But it's great though. Can't be mad at that. So you dropped the tracks off a new EP. Yeah. A few of them. I mean, I mentioned Fabric there because it feels like it was really instrumental in the rise of dubstep and in shaping your career. Do you agree? Yeah, definitely. I feel like there are a few clubs that played a massive part. Plastic People being one of them. Fabric being one of them. And they're just the clubs in London because if I start to name clubs in other cities that played instrumental parts, we could be here forever. But yeah, Fabric was definitely one of the clubs that, you know, as DJs, especially coming from plastic people, and no disrespect to plastic people, but coming from plastic people and getting to play at a club like Fabric, it's like it brings on a whole new level of excitement. and a whole new level of dynamic. You know what I mean? You know, and it's such a statement. You're having three rooms at London's best club, one of the best clubs in the world, all dubstep. Yeah. You're headlining the room ones like, this is it, man, dubstep's here, kind of thing. Literally. So yeah, obviously we're talking about your return because in February 2014 you posted this thing on Facebook that said that you were... stopping DJing, concentrating on your family. No one really knew what was going on at the time. But I mean, what were the immediate circumstances that led up to that decision? I guess at the time, wasn't it actually really in my right mind? I cared a lot for the girls we were with at the time. I'd been doing a lot of just insane things. Right. You know, I'd been doing a lot of insane things. This is like... Manic episodes. Manic episodes. I feel like I was pretty manic when I put out that statement. I guess I just had to deal with it, you know, when you come down. But was it a decision that you made, that your doctor made, that the management made? No, it was just a decision that was just like spontaneous. Okay. Spontaneous. I was in mania. I guess it kind of, it worked out for me in a way because it kind of made people leave me alone. I think at the time I wasn't... go into my shows I was just like roaming the streets doing crazy things and so at the time promoters are obviously thinking what's going on no one knows what's going on so for me to put that statement up even though it was pretty manic it took some heat off my back right so I mean in terms of entering that kind of manic phase, was there a particular moment, a particular show that you remember as being the point of no return? Yeah, definitely. I feel like this must have been early December. Or maybe it was a little bit earlier than that, but I went to Singapore and I was playing this festival. Zouk out. And on the way there, I'd had some really bad episodes, but on the way there, I was really bad on the plane and I was, like, freaking out. Talking about some religious stuff, I was just, like, freaking out. It was sending me, like, really bad. I couldn't seem to snap out of this, kind of. My sense of smell was, like, really... making me freak out who's around me what's going on and I got to Singapore kind of just tried to relax before my show I think I had a day before I was actually playing and tried to relax didn't come out of the hotel room I was just like freaking out like washing things like religiously and just kind of just like panicking about everything just is the devil here with me if this is that it was quite crazy for me and I can remember it all like it was yesterday So then the day of my show, I go down to my gig and I have to do press. And it's like I'm doing press with a lady from MTV and I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out. I'm like, what does MTV have to do with the devil? And what is this? And I'm just like, I'm getting through it somehow. I'm communicating. But on this next level, which is just like crazy. And you're doing this all on your own? No, it was with my girl at the time. But she was trying to... She, like, completely tried to... keep me level and she didn't really understand what was going on at the time. So she did her best. And that show, I don't know how I got through it. I really don't. It's like one minute somebody makes a sign and that's something that just throws me off. So I start playing different music. If someone else makes a sign, that throws me off. I start playing other music. It's just like... Somehow I made it through that show, but that was it. See you later. You attributed the decline of your mental health to excessive touring and drugs. I mean, what role were drugs playing in your life in the kind of months and year? Because you've always been a hard partier. Yeah. I've always hit it quite hard and I feel like that point in my life, just before I got really, really ill was there's a lot of things going on and I kind of feel like I had a lot more time. I wasn't writing as much as I would be. I think I was moving studio and stuff like that. So then I just had, I felt like I had so much drugs around me at that time. And whereas during the week, I would focus on writing music and radio and stuff like that. But as I started to kind of not write as much music and I had that much drugs around me, I was doing it every day and just doing like cocktails and just going crazy. That definitely had a massive effect on me because I started having like these pseudo fits. You know, I'd have a few crazy thoughts and then I'd be back to normal and I'd be like, right, let's hit it again. Do you know what I mean? Like, you know, everyone goes through that. Oh, this, this. I've had slight moments before. And at this point, I was just hitting it really hard. So that definitely played a massive part. I mean, looking back, do you think you were addicted to drugs? Depends how you explain addiction, but I kind of feel At the time, I wouldn't say I was addicted. Dependent is a better word. Yeah. Because I feel like a lot of the time when I was doing drugs, it was like I'd be quite fatigued or I couldn't quite get myself in a space where I could be myself. So then sometimes I would take something and I would be, I don't know whether you'd say settled, but I would function slightly better. I could communicate with people. So then I thought to myself, maybe if I start taking care, I would constantly function on a level where I could communicate. I feel like I was just so fatigued. So nothing was coming to my head. So I'd be blank and then I'd think. I'm not blank when I'm on cat, so I do it. So I was slightly dependent on it, yeah, definitely. So it feels like the absence of the studio, of being able to write music, played a huge part because during the week you didn't know what to do. Yeah, definitely. Definitely, and at that time I needed to find something that was inspiring, that I could wake up and do every day, kind of feel like. I'd been doing something for so long and I needed something else. I just didn't have the time to kind of find it or I didn't step back to find it. Do you know what I mean? Was it the case in years previously that, you know, the weekends are when you go out and you just go mad and you play your shows and you have a wicked time with Scream or whoever. Yeah. And then during the week you're more focused, you're yourself, you're in the studio just... chilling, recuperating and then I would go out and play the lectures. I feel like nothing ever mattered because when I was making music that was my grounding but without that, see you later. Yeah. If you go back three years, I mean like, yeah, late 2013, mid 2013 and tell yourself something then give yourself one piece of advice, what would you do? What would you say? It's the easiest bit of advice. Slow down, lad. Do you know what I mean? Slow down. Yeah. I look at myself now and I think to myself, slow down. Yeah. nothing's going to run away from you. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? If you're happy to talk about it, can you lead us through the kind of 18 months that followed that Facebook post? Yeah. So I carried on doing some crazy things and I got to a point where I ended up in hospital. Being in hospital was good for me. You know, obviously they gave me some medication, calmed me down. I feel like I was pretty manic for quite a while and it wasn't really coming down. So they gave me some medication, some sedatives, and then they obviously gave me some antipsychotics and stuff like that to kind of keep me level. So I took those antipsychotics for a while after I got out of hospital. And I started to realise all of the stuff that I'd been doing was just like, wow, it hit me at once. It was like, whoa, you've done this, you've done that, you've upset this person, you've done this, and you don't DJ anymore. So yeah, I started to... No job. No job. Everything's gone. Like, everything. Right. So that hit me. And I went back to my mum's house for a bit. Yeah. Which, at the time, I really didn't want to do. I just wanted to go to my own house and just chill. probably really the best option. Give me some time to actually just think. So I think for maybe three or four months I was in the studio a little bit trying to write some ideas. I kind of had this idea that I was going to do this sound called Future Funk. when I was ill. But I still had to figure out exactly how I was going to do that. I'd made this record of artwork called Shut It Down and that was kind of a staple. That was kind of the basis of what I could do. So six months goes by. I was writing on and off air. So you're just kind of taking it easy day to day. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Just kind of taking it easy, reflecting. So music was present throughout the whole thing. Yeah, definitely. There wasn't one time where I stopped writing, but I obviously wasn't playing. I obviously didn't know what anything sounded like out. But yeah, music was present. So tell us about a decision to return, you know, because you officially retired. But now you're back. I mean, was it just a case of feeling better? Nah, definitely not. I didn't think, you know what, I'm better. I'm ready to play. Let's go play shows. Never that. I'm just not that person at all. My mindset is, have I got something to offer? Right. I wouldn't necessarily say, what does the industry need? Can I provide it? But it's like, have I got something to offer? And I feel like nobody... has been able to kind of sit down and kind of go, this is what I've done in the past. Can I take what I was doing in the past into the future, flip it, and kind of give people something new that's not around? And I actually had the chance to do that, do you know what I mean? So I tried, and I'm trying to do that. Does it feel like, I mean, not quite starting from scratch, but you're kind of building something up again? I mean, how does it feel coming back into being Benga, being an artist? Yeah, it's like, I feel like right now at this very moment, I'm still trying to realign. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? I'm still trying to figure out exactly where I am because I kind of... to feel like I'm in the right place. And I don't just mean that like mentally, like am I stable mentally? I mean that like... Is everything around me moving at the same pace as I am? Do I feel right in the club? Is the music right for where I want to be now? Like the production style. Am I overcooking things because it's too early for that? Nobody wants overcooked shit at the moment. They just want ideas. I just want to make ideas. Do I feel happy with everything going on around me? So to answer your question, how do I feel? I'm still realigning. Come back, I feel like... And I'm just being brutally honest, slightly premature. Yeah. Come out of last year a little bit with the fairies. So I'm kind of just like getting there, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. The Guardian article came out in October 2015. The response to that in your tweets was pretty overwhelming, you know. People were very... appreciative and happy that you came out and were kind of spreading this message I mean was that an important part of your own recovery I wouldn't necessarily say it was an important part of my own recovery But I thought I owed it to people to be real. Yes, now you recognise your symptoms, do you think that mental health is a bigger issue in dance music than we realise? Yeah, definitely. I not only hear from other people that are suffering with mental health issues, but I see people that are wavering. You know, I guess I'm obviously more open and I speak to people a lot more about things. But people, there are quite a few people that are still closed off about it. For me anyway, I was really young when I started. Yeah. So you don't really get time to become really self-aware. Life needs to hit you before you actually really start touring. And then you kind of... You're like, whoa, I feel like this and I feel like that. And you can express that. And if you have to take it to what really is the issue, would you say it's the drugs and the alcohol? Or would you just say it's the lack of self-awareness? Yeah. So the period before you retired was a really interesting time in your career. You know, you were kind of stepping out, being Benga, the club DJ, entering Benga, the producer, working with more vocalists. I feel like the start of that for me was Magnetic Man, the major label deal, the headline shows. How did that project first come about? I guess it was just being mates. music. Me and Scream started off like bunking school and just like making tunes at my mum's house and stuff like that. So we'd always made tunes before. So we had a couple of beats and Sarah from Rinse, who's a genius, she heard the music and was just like, why don't you lot just come and play a show at Forward? And at this time we was just anonymous. No one knew, well, they kind of could tell from the sound who it was, but it was playing the game. Artwork being artwork came up with an idea of how we could make it look at Forward. So we ended up playing this show with a blind that covered, and all you could see is silhouettes. But at this time, I had this massive afro. This was before everyone was taking pictures and uploading pictures constantly and video constantly. So you could keep a secret-ish. Anyway, so we did that, and it went down wicked, and we made a lot more music, and then we started to do this show. We got a grant from the Arts Council. Yeah. Princess Trust. And they was like, do your live show. So again, artwork comes up with another idea. It was too funny, mate. It was too funny. Like, what we would do is we would create this kind of box and we would be in it with our laptops and stuff. And we would get in it... I don't know whose idea it was, but we would start off like this and then we would just rise. And we was like the Jack in the Box show. It was funny. We did it at Cargo first, I think. Yeah. And that was the beginning because we were just making tunes and it was blowing up. It was at the same time, Me and Scream was touring quite heavily. Our tunes were blowing up. It just made sense. Was the idea to bring dubstep to a wider audience? Nah. Never did we have any thoughts like that. We just wanted to build tunes and tour. So you just wanted to collaborate as a three? Yeah. But it was a bigger sound? Well, when it come to the album, definitely. Right. I guess at that time, when we started making Magnetic Man album, the first album, we had just come back from Australia and our heads were in different places. Definitely. I remember coming back from Australia. and like playing all these massive shows like consecutively. and then thinking so i feel like i was definitely in this headspace anyway i was just like i want to smash this right when we went to the studio in cornwall because we built a studio in rock in cornwall it was so funny so funny like the funniest things happened in that place anyway so we built a studio we recorded this album and i kind of feel like we wanted to we still wanted it to have it we still wanted tunes like mad we still wanted tunes like do do do I can't remember what that's called but we had these tunes like I need air we had these tunes like getting nowhere and it was just at that time with artworks influence as well you know he's he's been involved in it yeah hits smashes Daniel Bedingfield top level hits and plus he's worked his way up from like studio kid and he understands that life you know production style anyway and recording life so we had him in our camp and we kind of just recorded with some wicked people before you knew it, we had this thing, which I don't think we even knew we was going to make. I mean, was it working with the major and like, and the whole magnetic man thing just gave you that taste of the kind of next level? No, I was already kind of there. Just before we went in and did the Magnetic Man album, I had done it on a mission. Right. Do you know what I mean? And I was getting there in my head. I have always been that kind of guy. I grew up listening to Michael Jackson. I grew up listening to all kinds of music. Do you know what I mean? It wasn't just like... dubstep didn't just fall on my lap and then i was just like i'm gonna do this for the rest of my life do you know what i mean yeah i grew up listening to music i was ready at the point So what was it you were moving away from them? Did you feel pigeonholed? I don't even think it was super conscious. It was really how I felt subconsciously and what was going on around me that was making me kind of be so abrupt and kind of just be so spontaneous with what I was saying to the media at the time. I just feel like... Like, you know, I was playing a lot of shows and as I was turning up, it was what I was playing compared to what other people was playing at certain times. It's just like, whoa, I was always so varied and I would play some Tehran, but I'd have some techier things and this and that. But then I was turning up and people were just like, bang, bang, bang. And it was just getting crazier and crazier. I was just like. I spent some time in the studio as well and I can remember it like it was yesterday I actually listened to some of the tunes that I was making at the time and it was just like I was laughing at it I was like trying to compete with it it was like an arms race who can just go in the hardest like do you know what I mean bruv And I'm like, kind of caught up in this thing. And I'm just thinking to myself, I need to do something that I can do the stuff that made me happy again. Part of what I'm doing now, it's because I was there at the beginning. I remember how I felt. I remember what was going on. So by me kind of branching out and doing this thing again, it's like, can I just go back to kind of just being creative? And Future Funk's allows me to do that. Yeah. It was never ever about me trying to be like a hero. It was just about me being creative again. With Future Funk, yeah, I mean around that period in 2012, 2013, you were working a lot of vocalists and you were like cultivating this idea of like, you know, it's a lofty comparison, but Dre, Timbaland, you know, someone who people come to for beats. You were working with some pretty big artists. The Future Funk stuff or what you're doing now, is that, are you doing like just bingo the club beats or is that, are you going to try and cultivate that image again? I feel like I... One step at a time, isn't it? Yeah, to a certain degree. But I kind of feel like for me, first and foremost, like you say, one step at a time, get the sound where it's exciting. Part of the thing about that period was that... you know, you're growing up making, playing music that's 140 and dubstep is kind of defined by its tempo. But after a while, it's kind of limiting, I imagine. You know, you want to make tracks that, as soon as you make a track that's not 140, oh, it's not dubstep, Benga's doing something else. Yeah. But I can imagine, you know, you just would want to break out of that mould. Yeah, that's it. It's just about breaking out, What I was doing was so distinctive. It was just like these shuffly beats and the way the bassists were sending around the beats and the drums. There was no better way for me than just to go scrap those drums that I was doing for a bit and kind of just go... You've always seemed super ambitious. You know, you've always like, you said you came back from Australia and you're like, I want to smash this. Like, you see no ceiling like this can go through the roof. I mean, has that been in you from young? Yeah. I feel like. Coming back and what I set my sights on, how to do it and how I was going to do it, that was fearless and that was ambitious. Yeah. Still going for it. I'm still at it. I think that just comes from a belief. You know, it just comes from a belief. Now, more than ever, it just comes from a belief that I have the ability to do it. Yeah. And the platforms. I want to take it back even further, right to the beginning. So you're Croydon born and raised then? Yeah. Nice. No, no, no, lie, lie. I was born in Hackney. Oh, really? Okay. Yeah. And then I moved to... Croydon way when I was about seven. What was life like there growing up? In Croydon? What was it like for me? I feel like a lot of the time I spent going to parties when I was a kid, going to like shubs, playing sets with Scream. So when did you actually meet Scream? I feel like I was about 12. Wow, okay. Going 13. I feel like... When I actually first met Scream, I don't think I knew him that well. I think it was just like he was turning up to a party to play. I was turning up to a party to play. And he played tunes. I don't even think I realised he was as young as he was. Like, same age as me. Just remember, we turned up to this party in Selsdon and I felt like we both played sets but didn't actually meet him properly or start speaking to him on the phone until a couple of years later. So you were DJing from what age? 12, 13 years old, yeah. Is that the influence of your brothers? Yeah, definitely. And I mean, a couple of years later, you're already in Velvet Rooms, going to Paul Wood. I mean, you know, it reminds me of those stories of the Detroit guys snuck into the back of a 14-year-old in a club. You wouldn't get away without that, would you? What was that like? What was the atmosphere, the music? It must have been a mad experience. I remember going to Velvet Rooms. I don't think it was that busy either. I just feel like it just excited to hear Hatcher play our tunes. You know, only place Hatcher was playing that kind of music. So did it have like a resounding impact on you? Do you feel like, well, this is something I want to be a part of? Yeah, definitely. Definitely to a degree. I feel like being able to go out and hear your tunes that young. It's almost nearly the feeling of making it. It's nearly the feeling that you've established yourself, but you know nothing, do you? Yeah, I'm interested in this idea of, you know, making music that sounds like nothing else. Where were you pulling your influences from as a young producer? I guess the first people that kind of inspired me... were LB and Wookie. They just had these skippy beats and these dark bass lines. So then that was inspiring me. So I was making tunes, trying to copy that. And then also people like Soul Solid come about and Musical Mob come about and they made like Pulse X and Dilemma and tunes like that, which just was like, that's so stripped back. There's nothing in that. We was trying to make these tunes that were just like really well produced in bad boy studios. And then we heard that and it was like, yo, we can do this. I feel like from that point, we stripped it pretty back and I came out with Skank, which is like my first release. And then we carried on moving. I feel like Lofa come about and he started doing some hip-hoppy vibes. And then we kind of settled along this kind of 140 tempo. The basses were so loud at the point. I don't even know how people... People were cutting them to dub. Like Jay, I don't know how he was doing it. He was just like bass, like crazy. Yeah, so Loaf played a massive part in bringing like a hip hoppy vibe to it. And that was it. It was away from it. I kind of, we inspired each other. Like Scream would do something and then I would hear something and be like. to be fair obviously we inspired each other but the plugins around at the time inspired us as well software coming with sounds that nobody had ever heard like Albino coming around and me and Scream messing with that and then yeah I mean those years 2004 2008 let's say were incredibly prolific for you you know like did music was it making music come easily yeah definitely definitely I feel like you just you sit in the studio every sound is inspiring again you hear something that screen does and it's just like you sit down and you hear a sound and it's like bang I've got this idea but also it's exciting because it's like you dictate the direction this music goes of course it's never existed before so whatever you do this is it you think about it that way it's a blank canvas you know you think about it that way Let's talk about night. Your big smash hit. Does it feel like you can kind of mark your career before and after night? To a certain degree, because I feel like it changed slightly. And it took time for that to balance itself out. but I feel like I started playing some shows that I was not used to. Right. You got any examples? Well, I played this show with Soul Solid in Cardiff, and it was like, I remember I'd been playing shows, and by this point, I was playing shows that people got what the music was about. Right. It turned out to... do this gig with South Solid in Cardiff. And it was just like, not one tune went down. And then... tune's done finished no one's raving anymore I was playing them kind of shows do you know what I mean for a little bit so because I was just listening to your Essential Mix from I think 2011 yeah and Judge Jules was presenting it it's making me laugh and he was saying that like it was getting played Radio 1 during the day yeah you know for a dub set tune I mean yeah it's mad but doesn't it just show the power of the people yeah I mean, how do you feel about Night Now? Yeah, I still love the record. Sometimes I hear it and I forget about some of the things in it myself, percussion-wise and how I did it. That file is long gone now, so I cannot remember how that was made, but yeah. Do you remember listening to it with Cokie and thinking, this is a hit? No. We always thought the records were good, especially when they sounded that different. Because that was the aim, right? It was always the aim, to sit down in the studio and create something that we had never heard before. It was a real patience, sitting down and crafting noises to make them sound like how they did. I'm pretty sure we kind of just made it and was like, yeah, this is wicked and we're going to play it on the weekend. So obviously we've mentioned Scream a few times. I have to ask you about your relationship with him. I mean, I can't imagine a few things more fun than... having a childhood friend and then just touring the world, playing shows, playing music together. It must have been. What is it about a partnership that works so well? I've got to give him props, like massive props, because it wasn't until I started to really reflect that I realised how much of a friend to me he actually was. Like, incredible, incredible, incredible. And not to say that wasn't vice versa, like we didn't both put up with each other's shit, because we did. He wasn't only just inspiring, he was helpful and he looked out for me. And I feel like him more so than I, he really looked out for me. Are you speaking about your entire career or just more recently? entire career the boy is a very sound character yeah and he looks out for me proper was it him looking out for you like more so in that just in the kind of dynamic relationship I know because I feel like we You know, I was the guy that was like, I probably played most of the part of getting us from show to show. But I feel like... Put it this way, if somebody said a bad word about me to Scream, they wouldn't know what planet I was on. His career has taken a pretty interesting left turn. Pretty amazing how well he's taken to it and how well he's doing. Was that something you envisioned happening? He was always dabbling, wasn't he? Yeah. He was never going to go into it and fail at it. He had everything going for him. You know, he's charismatic, he's talented. What more? Yeah, I mean, Scream is one of many who's, you know, diverged and done other things and excelled at it so well. You've got, you know, Ben UFOs, Scoobers, artworks even. It's clear that there was just so much talent in that generation. Apart from what was going on, the time with internet and stuff, we was brought up on good music. really talented musicians and a wealth of great music yeah definitely i mean just from speaking to you it's like there's just there was just such a kind of youthful confidence about what you're doing in just in a great way you know just like like a belief see this is it this is another thing dude i feel like that's why partly my two-year hiatus was great because I did spend some time listening, but the rest of the time I was just like separated. And I kind of, when I started producing again, I tried a load of new things to make a new sound. And it's kind of like. Some of the tunes I never would have been able to make because I would have been like, nah, it sounds too cheap or it sounds too whack or it sounds too this or it sounds too that because of production style. It's another thing that came to me. So I started uploading some tunes to my SoundCloud where I was just like, people were like, that's unfinished. And I was like, isn't that up to the artist? Do you know what I mean? And I feel like it should be that way because it's part of the reason why things sound so the samey because it's like things have to match up yeah you know people can't be as creative because it's like this is this but I guarantee you if you give people the right idea the production's not going to be the be all and end all
