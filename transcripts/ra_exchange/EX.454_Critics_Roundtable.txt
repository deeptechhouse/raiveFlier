Thank you. *music* ♪ ♪ Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is a new edition of the Critics' Roundtable, which gives RA's editorial staff a chance to go in-depth on the year in electronic music thus far. For the first time, RA's North American contributors take the reins, with Andrew Rice joining Max Pearl and Michelle Luke. The conversation covers their favorite new releases, DJ sets, and emerging sonic trends, ranging from Canadian Ildian to jazz fusion Vaporwave and the changing face of New York's club landscape. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net. and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The Critics' Roundtable is up next. Welcome to the Resident Advisor Exchange Critics Roundtable. It's a chance for us and our writers to talk about what we like, what inspires us, what we think about the scene, the landscape of electronic music. My name is Andrew Rice. I am the North American editor of Resident Advisor, and I'm here in New York with... Hi, my name is Max Pearl. I'm a staff writer. based in the New York office. I cover the New York scene as well as the East Coast. And this is my first ever Critics' Roundtable because usually we do them in Europe. And this is an exciting opportunity because finally we get the American perspective on election. electronic music. on Helsing Unveil, so why don't we listen to a track from that for a bit, and then we'll talk about it. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so Masalama is based in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. I came across their music because Rabbit, who runs the imprint Halcyon Veil, sent me this Dropbox of the album. And I was immediately super blown away because it just sounded like nothing I've ever heard before. You know, I've always really loved how Arabic sounds. Like growing up in Singapore, I would hear, you know, like calls to prayer for the mosque all the time. And until... recently I feel like the extent that most western music fans have heard Arabic in music and electronic music has come from like weird news stories of like DJs playing you know like the call to prayer in a club like you guys remember in 2017 there was this like controversy that a Tunisian club hosted a Western DJ who played A Call to Prayer and it got the club shut down. So what I'm trying to say is that usually I think up until this point, it's been very much filtered through a Western perspective. And I think this record... was a really cool hybrid of, you know, the beats kind of sound kind of like burial-ish to me and very much in line with like the rest of the club music that we will be hearing like out in a club. But then with these like really poetic phrases that apparently come from like the Quran and it has this whole narrative. Unfortunately, I can't understand, but yeah. I don't know, I just love the sort of hybridity that's happening there. Yeah, when I listened to it, it really blew me away also. It feels natural, but something about it feels very unusual for our world, like you said, especially the vocals. From what I understand, a lot of it is in classical Arabic. A lot of it is from the Quran, or from ancient translations of the Quran. And I read that, or I heard... that he had to leave Mecca because it would be too controversial and now he's based in Egypt. And Egyptians like Zouli produced the beats on the album. So it's a very collaborative project. But a lot of it is pretty mysterious and I had to piece together a lot of little bits of info. But yeah, it really stuck with me too. And I also think it's cool that it's being released on Halcyon Vale, which is based in Texas, which is not at all. you know, the place that you would associate, but like totally make sense at the same time. You know, I have this theory that cities outside of like the typical urban metropolises of like New York and London. So Halcyon Vale is based in Houston. And I think that these other cities. have a connection through their so-called otherness, I guess. You know what I mean? And I think that thanks to the internet, there's this new sort of digital global club community that transcends geographical boundaries while still being hyperlocal. but there's a sort of interconnectivity happening between all these cities and it makes sense that they're able to join forces and promote each other and push really interesting underground club music. Yeah, actually, just piggybacking off of this, I recently, DJ Haram posted something on Twitter the other day that was a link to... project called Cairo Concepts, which I guess is an Egyptian sort of experimental club project that has a compilation coming out. And Haram is included on the project. So just that and hearing the Zouli record and then now hearing about this guy who is based in Egypt now, it piqued my curiosity. It seems like maybe it's sort of like shifting into becoming a focal point for really interesting cutting-edge electronic music. Max, what was your selection? I picked something called, it's the artist's name URA, and it's an album called Entertainment. It's from a label in Montreal called Collect Call. and I'm thinking of it as like an ilbient revival record. I don't know if that's a term that our audience knows, but why don't we listen to it, and then we can... This is the title track off of the LP, Entertainment. Like I said, it sort of reminds me of... I wasn't really around for this, but from what I understand from the late 90s and early 2000s, ill-be-ent was a genre that grew around the chill-out room, where it wasn't necessarily ambient music. It was still sort of danceable, but it was down-tempo and it was loungy. And I think coming up for a long time, the kind of music that I liked was really high intensity, a lot of bass. And so I thought of lounge as sort of like a bad word. This album, it's got elements of jungle and breakbeat, and it has some pretty dubby bass lines and a lot of echo and delay, and even a little bit of Memphis rap. hypnotized mind stuff that you can hear as if like, but it's sort of like all underwater. Um, so I picked it because, uh, I thought it was interesting just for me acquainted with like chill music and like learning how to listen to relaxing music again. Um, and it actually reminded me of, um, I don't know if you guys remember two, five, six, two's debut album, uh, aerial, which was sort of like, the moment where dubstep and techno really came together with sort of a vocabulary of like very sophisticated techno sound design, but with like dubstep rhythms, which is sort of what it brings to the table. And I thought the drum programming was super interesting. I thought it's like so futuristic that it actually almost sounds like organic. it's almost as if these sounds are coming from the natural world. I'm reminded of a hand slapping against water or like a foot crushing a branch on the ground. So yeah, the whole album is really great and it goes between sort of hip hop and jungle and house. Are you familiar with A&F or Perishing Thirst from Montreal? No, I'm not. So it seems to me like there is this new scene in Montreal of this kind of stuff. Dusty One, who produces Jungle under that name, also has an alias called Perishing Thirst, which released an album on another Montreal label called NAF last year. It's very similar. It's a lot of ill-being kind of stuff with some breaks and really old-school, loungy house and techno vibes. And then he also does a project called... A&F with Priory and they have a record coming out on Pacific Rhythm and that's more like that kind of vibe but dancier. And so it seems like in Montreal there's this new groundswell of this really silky, ill-being influenced dance music. And it's interesting that it seems to be becoming a thing now. Yeah, I think that like breaks in general are just super trendy in like dance club circles. And it's cool that that's being reflected in the ambient scene as well. I also think that like ambient music in general has become so trendy. I mean, that kind of started like last year or two years ago and it's continuing even more. Now, and I think it's related to the whole wellness craze, actually, like thinking about my own sort of like cannabis writing, you know, like wellness is like such a health trend right now. People really feel like they need self-care. And I think my sense is that ambient fits right into that. And ambient music also fits this. model of music that lets you be productive. You can work to it. Cosmeteergy put out that album. I think it was inspired by WeWork. It's all music for working and it's really hyper-capitalist ambient music. It's like a parody of it. What I thought was interesting is I found that what we just listened to, which is actually one of the most relaxed down-tempo tracks on the album. I find that even that is danceable. And so I'm interested in the notion of stuff that's sort of slow and not overstimulating, but is still, you can find a way for your body to connect with it. Like I like to dance slowly. and I love dancing at like 90 beats per minute or 100 beats per minute, and so I'm interested in that sort of weird liminal space between being so abstract that you can't find a way to dance to it and so-called dance music proper, and I think that kind of occupies sooner. What did you bring to show us today, Andrew? I chose a track from the first album by Non-Local Forecast, who is an American artist with over 30 aliases. The most well-known is probably Fire Tools, but let's listen to Non-Local Forecast. Thank you. you you So non-local forecast is the new alias from a producer named Angel Mark Lloyd, who started out in a vaporwave scene making pretty standard, like sampled, woozy, down-tempo beats. But she has, like I said, around like 30 projects. And a few years ago came out with this project called Fire Tools. which blends a lot of vaporwave aesthetics with black metal vocals, which sounds pretty bad on paper, but it's actually really amazing. And I think that she has a really unique polymath talent for bringing together all these different genres. And she's also an amazing musician. And so this album, under the name Non-Local Forecast, It was more of a jazz fusion album, kind of mixed with like vaporwave aesthetics of like hyper-futuristic, really polished, kind of schmaltzy, muesacky, but like the chords are crazy, the bass lines are crazy, the drumming is really intense, and she plays everything herself in her home studio. In my review of the album, I called her like a one-woman Steely Dan. My other favorite way of describing this record, which I did not write, is the Weather Channel on cocaine. Because it sounds like the Weather Channel background music, but really fast. And the album really stuck with me just because it's such a, like that was just one track, but there's some ambient bits, there's some bits that get really intense with like guitar solos. And she also collaborates with herself under the Fire Tools name on the album. And you can kind of tell which... parts in the track are fire tools because it's more aggressive and which parts are non-local forecast. And I think it's really interesting to be a young, not that well-known artist and have such a defined sense of identity that you can collaborate with yourself and have it be clear that it's not just another track on the album. Yeah, I was struck by the musicality of it because I think these days you don't necessarily need to have much much of a training in melody and chord progressions and key changes. But when you're talking about something that has such a strong influence from jazz fusion, these are legit chord changes. And you have to write a bass line that's like a counterpoint melody for each of those chord changes. So it's cool to have something that... requires such a technical understanding, you know? I'm so gagged that vaporwave is still such a thing. Like when I wrote something about it in 2013, I thought it was just like a fluke. I was like, here's like a weird internet micro trend that will disappear in like a year or two. But it's actually just this thriving online genre right now. I'm curious what you guys think about why it continues to be such a source of creative inspiration for so many artists and moving into black metal territory now. I think from my understanding of it, I've done a lot of writing and interviewing with people in the scene, is that it's all like everyone's an outsider who's in their bedroom. So they connect to each other through that in weird parts of the world. One of the best and most prominent modern vaporwave producers is Telepath. It was in Ohio. Not in a major city in Ohio. And then because they're not in scenes and they're just talking to each other, there's no musical limits or one style. Everyone's exchanging stuff. The last few years there's... hard vapor, which is vaporwave that takes influence from dance music genres. There's like little... blips of stuff like Jungle Wave, which is like Vaporwave with breaks. And so it's just like endless possibilities because this scene isn't rooted in anything or anyone or anywhere. It's just this amorphous thing on the internet that these young kids who are taking in all this information are just making whatever they want. And Angel Markleud is a good example. She ran her own label for a long time. It was mostly noise. Then she ran another label that releases like 50 things and she has all these projects and she just sits at home and makes all this stuff. She's not like a touring artist or anything. It's crazy. It's interesting. There's a semi-ironic tongue-in-cheek element to all this stuff too, especially if you're like, you know. coming back to a genre like jazz fusion that was very maligned for many decades as corny. And I think for me, actually, that is part of why I have trouble getting into Vaporwave is because there's an arm's distance where it's like, do I like this or is it half a joke? Not to say that your relationship to the music is a joke. This record is a good example. The music is very cheesy. It's comedic. It's imitating something that is quite maligned. It sounds like Weather Channel music. But at the same time, I think the songwriting is so good. The first track... There's one point where this really happy guitar solo breaks out and it makes me happy. I really enjoy it. I enjoy it unironically. So I think there's a bridge to cross and you can cross it. I think it also maybe was a premonition or precluded some of the really creepy, algo-pop, very sort of mosaic-y commercialized music that... is coming to dominate music today. Like Spotify core. Exactly. But like Vaporwave doesn't feel evil because it's outsiders making fun of it, you know? And like, in a way Vaporwave to me is surprisingly like, again, like I didn't expect this, but it's. kind of like the most recent and probably the last like micro genre that emerged from the internet like i can't really think of micro genres that have emerged since then that have been significant and i don't really know why this is happening I think it might have to do with just the internet no longer feeling as intimate and as underground. Like everything became, all these platforms became huge and like omniscient, you know, whereas 2012, 2013 was like the last time that you could like be part of this like weird underground music community online. Something that wasn't immediately findable. I remember back in the days of C-Punk, people would intentionally use symbols rather than letters, and part of the strategy was that it made it hard to Google. So I think that might be what you're talking about in terms of there was a weird hidden corner that was just... me and my weird internet friends right, sea punk, witch house vaporwave, like that whole thing the softcore continuum laughing Thank you. Yeah, so next I would love to talk about DJ sets that y'all have heard this year and really enjoyed. Max, why don't you tell us what your pick is? Okay, so I have two picks. Sorry, I'll make it. quick. The first one is not as Dito said, it was a live act. And it was Mark Ernestis and Dagar Rhythmforce. So Mark Ernestis, who is one of the two members of Basic Channel, the legendary German dub techno duo. He now, I'm going to say sort of collaborates with, although I think it's more complicated than that, but there's a group of musicians from Senegal who play a style of percussive music called Mbala. And it's an ensemble of percussionists playing various different types of... traditional skin drums. And it's actually really interesting because it's unclear what exactly he's contributing to it. And he's like this German white guy. And when he performs with them, he doesn't get on stage with them. He actually stands at the back of the room at the sound mixing booth. And I saw him recently in Brooklyn at Pioneer Works in Red Hook. And I was expecting him to be on stage playing a synthesizer or a drum machine or something, but he was actually just next to the sound guy managing the levels of all the different instruments. And they're amazing percussionists with crazy energy and they have two different dancers who are on stage with them. But I thought it was really interesting. I recently read an article about his participation in the project and it was talking about how he doesn't like the idea of a fusion because a fusion tends to subjugate one style to another style. When two styles meet, there's always a dominator rather than what he's trying to achieve is something that's more meeting on a middle ground. And I thought that was amazing. It was a really cool performance. And then I wanted to pick up one of my favorite local DJs. His name is Andrew Okambi, and he's from Lagos, Nigeria. But he's been in Brooklyn for a while. He has a party called Groovy Groovy, and I've seen him twice. I saw him at Groovy Groovy at Hollow in Ridgewood, and then I saw him at Nowadays, and I feel like there aren't... and he DJs locally doing what he does because he really channels super high energy spirit of rave, just like this sort of wild energy. I think his nickname is actually Rave Man or something. But he's playing stuff from, he's shifting tempos and he's playing stuff from different regional musical styles. He's really switching it up. without falling into the trap of autism. Just really tight mixing and really adventurous and taking a lot of risks. Yeah, just people like that who make the scene feel exciting, you know? Andrew, what's your... What's your favorite recent DJ set? Josie Rebell really embodies this idea of a UK continuum of music. I don't want to say it's the hardcore continuum because she plays a lot of house and disco, but she's a DJ who can play disco, house, techno, hardcore and get really weird with it and everything makes sense. She'll jump genres with a blend, but it makes total sense. She has such control and it really blew me away. The next weekend I saw her play Sunday afternoon at Panorama Bar and it was a much different setting than a warehouse party, but I think it made even more sense. Just playing really classic UK garage tracks and some really obvious disco, but with such skill and finesse and flair. There's something about her that's really impressive to me. I guess this would have been the second and third time I saw her because I saw her last year in Berlin as well. But these two times really made me realize that she's essentially my favorite DJ now. maybe even more than Ben UFO. And I also wanted to shout out one more person. I went to Lisbon for the first time this year and I went to this queer sex party called Kit Kat, which is a spinoff of Mina, which is like the dominant queer techno party there. And I saw this DJ named Karox, who is the only male resident at this party, which is otherwise focused on queer, trans, feminine people. But he'd only started DJing like eight months ago and he was playing this amazing, like sinuous fluid set of, I guess what you would call like experimental club music, except it was really. really smooth and like it was like kind of reggaeton influenced like dembo but it wasn't those things and i i called it like it almost felt like reconstructed club music as opposed to deconstructed club music and it was like in a smoky basement at like 4 p.m on a saturday afternoon it was just like so interesting to hear this music that i had no understanding of i didn't know what it was but it felt so natural and it was a really nice vibe and i think that the the queer scene in lisbon You were at 4 p.m. still going from the night before or it was a daytime party? No, it was a daytime party. It was a daytime sex party in a private sex club decked out like Weimar Berlin style in the middle of a residential block in Lisbon. And it went from 1 p.m. to 10 p.m. A daytime sex party? It was their first birthday and so of course they called it bitch day. Got it. I love it. Michelle, what about you? I recently threw this weed rave in LA in January and all of the DJs were incredible. I sort of tried to ask DJs to focus on more of the dub jungle end of the spectrum to fit the weed theme. But the set that really stood out to me was by this Oakland DJ named Russell E.L. Butler. And beforehand, you know, we've been discussing what kind of tracks they wanted to play. And they were really kind of getting super creative with it and like talking about wanting to play songs about weed as well. And taking a very sort of like playful angle to it and really thinking about, I think. what it means to be to play weed music which is like this weird question that people ask me all the time like what's weed music because like please let's not assume that it's only like reggae or something you know but um when when they actually played the dj set they played a lot of like jungle reggae but also played like you know this one like a dj sluggo set called a blunt which was great um a blunt i like it I wish I had it on my computer. So that kind of made me think about how weed music is also just funny. You know what I mean? I love DJ sets that have humor incorporated into it. And afterwards I asked Russell, I was like, what did you think of weed dance floor energy? Like how did it feel different from a typical dance floor? And they said stoners have a different dance style that they get fatigued easier, but they're also more cerebral and like more intimate. in the way that they listen to the music. I think they said, it's a dance to conserve. It's a sway. It's real deep and personal. And at one point in the middle of their set, they actually played this excerpt of a vocal from a Mad Mike interview. I mean, I think it was a RBMA lecture. So they totally just cut all of the music and played this monologue, which they drenched in all of this reverb to make it sound really sort of weird and trippy. I mean, it was one of the coolest moments for everyone to just stop and like listen. And everyone was super fucking stoned. So, you know, they were super into it and not bored. I think if it was like a speedy kind of dance floor, people might have been like, what's going on? I'm going to leave, you know. But with the weed dance floor, people are down. People are down to kind of stew and like think about. which is cool. Did you want me to play this Mad Mike? I would love to. Okay, let's hear the Mad Mike monologue. All y'all moving to Berlin. It's too late. Stay independent. Do your own shit. Start your own distributions. You need to do something else. What you looking for here? It might not be here. So, you know, I've been listening to y'all dreams and stuff and, you know, and I... I do care about you. I feel rich. I fucking love Mad Mike. I also just love DJs ripping audio from a YouTube video or a lecture and dropping it into their sets and going beyond playing two club tracks mixed into each other. It's so simple to add an unusual touch to your DJ set and yet so few people do something as simple as ripping an mp3 to YouTube. and using it as an interlude between two tracks to give it some kind of theatrical message. I was going to say, speaking of moving to Berlin, there are always these cyclical trends in dance music. Michelle, you pointed out that breakbeats are big right now. I was wondering, what else have you noticed? a thing in dance music or like a trend in dance music right now in your eyes or in your experience? Well, I think that queer culture, which has already been a really strong presence in dance music for several years, but now it's like the dominant. vibe and I've been kind of working on this theory for a while of how queerness is a sound and I do think that DJs who are queer play differently than straight people. Like if you just think of like a really typical techno song that's like 4-4, very linear. Like to me, that's a very hetero sound, you know? And the queer sound to me is very much like a mishmash of different paradoxes and contradictions. It's a refusal to be within like... the boundaries of binaries. It's a very sort of like ambiguous in-between state, a very transitory state. Obviously, I don't think only queer DJs play this way, like some straight DJs play in a queer style. I don't know. This is a theory that I obviously haven't written about or anything yet. It's still developing. But what do you guys think? Do you see what I'm trying to say? Yeah, I was going to kind of talk about a similar thing. And one thing that I've noticed, not only is there a resurgence of queer artists, parties, promoters, queer people involved in this community, but... I think a lot of the most boundary-pushing DJs are trans people. Yeah, all my favorite DJs are trans. I'm like, why is that so? And I think it has to do with this. refusal to give a fuck to what the usual rules are. And so I think that the more inclusive these communities and parties come, the stranger and more interesting the music gets. Like I saw the New World Disorder, which is Jasmine Infinity's crew, play at Honcho Campout. And like their set was crazy. It was like... 2 p.m. in the afternoon, sunny day, really hot out, and they started out playing some regular house and techno, and then they got into really strong, hardcore techno and gabber, and everyone's losing their minds. It felt really transgressive. Transgressive in a musical sense, but at this festival, which is dominated by men, and they're just playing this crazy music. at like a crazy time of day to play it like they're not giving a fuck about what you're supposed to play like a sunny afternoon they're just like playing like super fast hard like gabbery techno and so yeah like you said it's like there's they don't care about um a lot of these queer djs don't care about binaries or systems or what they're supposed to do and it feels like this like liberating energy is spreading through the scene and i think Not to get too much into this, but I also think there's a difference between the queer sound and the gay sound. Because the gays love that straight techno. but they also have this sort of fabulousness to it, right? And this sort of like femme quality to the gay sound as well. But it's not as much of a intense clash between genres and ambiguity between. Yeah, I mean, I've written a lot in the past few years about the resurgence of gay techno culture. If you think about, particularly in the US, it's different in Europe, but in the US and Canada, even five years ago, almost every gay club or venue was just going to be playing either like top 40. pop remixes or like really boring circuit music circuit parties or like a gay parties that started in the 90s as HIV charities but have just grown into this moneyed body fascist kind of thing with the most boring music that's like tribal house made only for these parties. Anyways, that was the sound of being gay. And I remember when I first started going out in Vancouver where I'm from, it's like... I had to choose between going to a party with good music and hanging out with straight people and hanging out with gay people at places with horrible music. And with the help of crews like Honey Sound System in San Francisco and Honcho in Pittsburgh, I feel like the gay community has really opened back up to underground dance music. And there's been like this... It's like the two things have met again. Because everyone says that dance music started in oppressed queer communities, but for a long time it didn't feel that way. When I started working in dance music... I didn't know any gay people at all. I felt like I was like an alien. And now I feel like in the US, these gay parties, which are becoming more queer and more inclusive, and they still have work to do, they're still very white male dominated. But I feel like these parties have become so cool in themselves that the gay people are starting to drive the scene again in a way that hasn't been seen in a long time. I also think it was interesting to provide a counterpoint. When you were tweeting about a new club opening up in New York City, you tweeted, there's a new queer club in town, maybe this could be our bird kind. You were just talking about it because you said it was tongue-in-cheek and some people took it too seriously. And someone tweeted back at you. They were like, queer club? What does queer club mean? Does that mean it's owned by someone who's queer? Does that mean it has queer promoters? And so I thought it was interesting, the idea of queer club and when does something become a queer club when it's not even open yet? Its crowd hasn't defined its vibe yet. You know what I mean? And I was thinking about queer now as something. can put on a flyer to drive ticket sales when it's not necessarily something that's even based in the dynamic of the place yet. You know what I mean? Yeah, totally. But I think that's a good sign in a way, right? That it's cool enough to be used as a marketing gimmick. It's a symbol of its arrival. Max, what are your thoughts? I was thinking about how I feel like recently there's been an arms race of who can make the fastest and hardest and most intense techno. And I feel like there's maybe starting to be like an oversaturation of super hard and intense techno. And I think maybe at some point this year, the public is going to be ready for sort of like an opening up or a broadening. or a more dynamic definition of what techno can be. Like techno can be melodic, techno can be percussive. Techno doesn't have to be built around a kick drum. Like even if you just think about the mixing of a techno track, like recently I've been hearing so much techno where the kick drum in terms of volume is just mixed way up. And I think there's been a proliferation of people who only see techno as a weapon of brute force and be something that's nimble and subtle and has a lot of intricacy and subtlety. And I think we can expect maybe this year to see the definition of what techno is. What do you think? Yeah, I mean, some of the most banging techno tracks don't have a kick drum. There's so much you can do within the template. One of the most exciting things about techno to me is the fact that in some ways... The genre is so rigid and defined that you really have to tweak and do inventive things within this small template. And that's how you have these small strokes of genius. You're like, whoa, this track is insane, even though to the layman it's just another techno track. But you can do so much within the template. And most dance music is like that. It's the same reason I like metal. It's a very similar thing. It's like there's all these sub-genres that are all based in the same idea, but you can do little things with them that maybe no one else has thought of. And so I think techno could always use more space, more ingenuity, more brokenness, more queerness. It doesn't have to be just doof, doof, doof, doof. And I think that... there are a lot of people who are maybe getting lost in the quest to just like pulverize the dance floor. One more trend I wanted to shout out was this whole post-EDM milieu, which I find fascinating. You know, we were talking about this the other night in the club, Max, about how when we worked at Vice together. We covered a lot of EDM and witnessed this crazy thing happen in America. And now EDM is kind of over. The last time I went to Miami Music Week for Ultra, it was like, there's no one there. So I feel like a lot of the artists that were making the most interesting music during EDM's heyday are now moving in new directions. And I'm super interested in how... They are porting the sort of like accessibility and mainstream appeal of EDM to like audiences that are also ready for different styles and sounds. So two artists that I've been following are Miha. and Porter Robinson. And I think Miha started making acoustic, very personal, very poetic storytelling kind of music. that's completely like completely opposite from the trappy like, you know, stuff that she was doing with Ausla. And Porter Robinson, who I caught at a show in LA recently, holy shit, he's playing like. berghain tracks to like you know kids who usually go to like heart fest and they're eating it all up um it was one of the best most insane shows that i've ever been both in terms of the music and production but also just like the trippiness of hearing like hardcore techno and hard style being played to like 18 year old like candy kids who were eating it up so i almost feel like A lot of the candy kids who would have gone to like Nocturnal Wonderland or whatever, all these EDM festivals are also starting to get into underground rave. I know for a fact that there's like a whole bunch of like kids in the valley who are throwing like happy hardcore raves and like tunnels. You said that when you went to Ultra Festival, it was basically, it felt empty? It felt like a lot of the brands. that were typically there. The brands and music labels were not. There were still fans, I think. that EDM will always have people who are interested in it, but it didn't feel as zeitgeisty as in previous years. It's interesting that the EDM bubble seems to be bursting, but in terms of clubbing and nightlife, like New York, there's so much happening. And it's not even EDM for the most part. It's what we would consider quote-unquote underground music. In the last year or so... There's been kind of like two years. There's been an explosion of new clubs, but also some older clubs closing. So I was wondering what you guys thought of where the scene in New York is going and where it's at. Max, why don't you start? Well, I recently spoke to someone who had a very interesting theory that I'm not sure I fully buy, but I thought it was provocative. And this person told me that some of the medium-sized clubs, like Output, closed last year. And someone recently told me that they attributed it to the existence of places like Avant Gardener or Brooklyn Mirage. which is like I think 5,000 capacity and they have pyrotechnics and they have this super high budget light show and it's a spectacle and people go there to be wowed by the size and scale and the colors of the experience. I had a great time. I went to Lady Fag's party, Holy Mountain. I haven't been to a party with five rooms in years. Holy Mountain is crazy. It was awesome. I remember being at Elsewhere, which is a club that's a few blocks away from Avant Gardener, and you can see plumes of fire coming up from the venue. It's literally like you're at an REO Speedwagon concert in a stadium. This person was telling me that she thinks that... that this is endangering mid-sized and small clubs because the new mode of going out is you go out a few times a year and it's this super crazy spectacle that's like a $300 night because the tickets for these things are not cheap. And then all the alcohol and whatever drugs you're doing, it ends up being a pretty expensive night. And so she was saying that that's hurting medium-sized clubs because people aren't developing these relationships to a nightclub where you go every weekend because it's your favorite spot. You don't even necessarily care who's DJing. You just like the club. You know what I mean? And she was saying that the mode of partying and of seeing music is shifting away from going to your favorite spot every weekend and instead you're going to Disneyland three times a year. I don't know if I'd buy it totally because I think there are a lot of mid-level, medium-sized, medium-capacity clubs nowadays and smaller ones like Jupiter Disco or Bossa Nova Civic Club or Mood Ring. that are doing well. Like I remember when I interviewed Frankie here for the RA Exchange, she was telling me like she was working at BASA where she was there one night. She texted her friend who was doing a party at Nowadays and she was like, it's full here. How's it doing over there? And they were like, it's full here too. And it's full everywhere. There's enough to go around. Do you know what I mean? Is there something like that in Los Angeles? No, it's kind of an opposite effect where in LA a lot of parties that I've been going to have been half empty. And I think it's because we experienced a period of rapid growth in the last year or two and it almost became too fast. and now the scene has to catch up. I do agree that New York nightlife seems to be on a completely different level compared to a year or two ago. And it is interesting that a lot of these so-called legacy clubs have closed, not just Output, but like Pasha. Cielo. Cielo. theory is more has to do with like the like real estate and like how certain neighborhoods are just untenable to have clubs in and i'll put is like almost this super ironic example because they were one of the first to gentrify williamsburg when they moved in to that street that they were on. There was nothing else there. And then a few years later, they basically turned it into the meatpacking of Brooklyn with all of these really terrible stockbroker bros coming for their one crazy night out in Brooklyn. And now it's like all those bros live there all the time. because they live near the Williamsburg waterfront and like literally output could not afford to be there anymore. And Avant Gardener, nowadays, all these clubs are further into Brooklyn, right? They're all in like Bushwick and Ridgewood. Avant Gardener actually invested really smartly, I think, in buying up the whole block that they're in. So that's how they're able to sort of like... you know, navigate the rising prices of real estate is just like to literally own it. I do think that there is a bit of a tension between clubs or venues like Avant Gardener. I don't know what we can call them. They're not mainstream, but they're like. middle room house like middle in the middle and like the truly DIY underground spots right like a lot of those places have disappeared we don't really have that many DIY venues like there was like a loft called Taffy that's completely gone now and that was like the last house in techno Taffy's still around no what Yeah, girl. I went there two weeks ago. I know. That was their last party. Wow. Yeah. That place was a fire trap waiting to happen. Yeah. But it was a beautiful fire trap. It's like the post-Goship landscape that we live in now. I saw today that this other bar that's run by a group of DIY kids called Secret Project Robot is shutting down. Wow, I had no idea. Yeah. So I do think that we're losing some really important underground spaces because of the legitimacy that New York Nightlife has won in the last... one or two years, you know, overturning the cabaret law, getting a nightmare, all of these sort of like officially sanctioned positions that allow the nightlife ecosystem to operate as a capital I industry. has allowed for like a lot more accessibility for people. And that's why, you know, all these places are slammed because a lot more kids are able to, you know, it's easier to find a club than a rave. Like you can, you know where nowadays is all the time. You don't need to have the address from a homie, you know? So it's a lot more accessible. But on the other hand, all the DIY spots are disappearing. And I think we need to think about what the effect on culture that will be because DIY spaces are real incubators for what's next. While clubs are by default, I think they have to be more profit-driven. Yeah, it's interesting because as someone who doesn't live in New York and has never lived in New York, At this point, it seems almost like a clubbing wonderland on par with somewhere in Europe because there are so many legitimate venues. And in Los Angeles, where I live, almost everything is underground. There's a few clubs, but most of them are either booking mainstream stuff or they're expensive. It's a nightclub. And there really is, like, everything is DIY, which is cool, but there's no one place where you can really go every weekend and dance and know it's going to be a good time. And a lot of people complain about that. And it's interesting how you have a city where there's all these legitimately amazing nightclubs with, like, great amenities, good drinks, good sound. But people want the DIY spaces. And then in LA, it's like some old ravers fever dream where everything is a rave, everything's in a warehouse, but there's no comfortable bar to go to. And it's interesting to me how each coast is on a different extreme end of it. in LA, these people who are going to warehouse parties, they would love a reliable club. And in California, they're really pushing to bring the last call to 4 a.m. so clubs can serve alcohol later. But do people want to pay club drink prices and pay for club entrance? I'm not sure. So I feel like in a lot of ways, it's kind of like a grass is greener thing. I was actually just going to talk about what Michelle was saying about how DIY spaces are incubators and specifically about the idea of having an overhead. I think what happens is a club moves into a neighborhood, they have an idea of what they want to be and they have an idea of what kind of programming they want to do and they have these sort of hard values about what kind of music they're going to play. And then they face the harsh reality of having to fill the nightclub as many nights as possible and they start making compromises to the kind of music they book. You're in Williamsburg. This is some of the most expensive real estate in the city. You're paying a crazy real estate tax. You've got to keep the lights on and you can't hold dear to those to the values and to the taste that you thought was going to define your business. Whereas a DIY space doesn't have to necessarily worry about overhead and isn't trying to be a sustainable long-term business. It's like, we're just here, we're going to do our thing and then maybe we'll be done soon. And so you kind of have to compromise values when you have to worry about it. paying for the roof over your head, you know? Right. And even if you compare like, you know, a city like New York and Berlin, Berlin being like the big example of a city where. nightlife has become an industry and a Disneyland experience for many people, like a tourism attraction. But I feel like Berlin still is relatively hospitable to artists because the cost of living is still pretty low. Whereas in New York, it's so hard to live here as an artist. So if all of the clubs are like Disneyland and you can't afford to like live here and make music, curious about where New York nightlife. is going like what is it going to look like in five to ten years obviously it's on this insane upward growth explosion but does it come with the loss of artistic cred can artists still afford to like create and make interesting music here Like it would be so ironic if we get the booming nightlife industry that we've all kind of wanted and then it comes at the cost of like literally killing the underground. Capitalism. One of the major differences between New York and Berlin is that the government in Germany and Berlin the city supports nightlife. More so than lip service, like an American government would do. Nightlife is embedded into their economy. They provide grants and subsidies. As if they were small businesses that could deserve to be. nurtured. Which lets them book whatever they want and not have to worry about selling X many drinks every night. The pressure's not as much. So if the New York City Council or whatever was a little more like that, maybe it would ease some of the pressure. I think that's part of why Berlin is not garbage. Yeah, I mean, New York is showing some signs of recognizing and supporting nightlife as an industry. You know, this new Office of Nightlife that they started last year recently did a survey that released some hard metrics of like how much money the industry is making. and how much it's growing. And it's super interesting because apparently nightlife is outpacing all other sectors in New York, almost by double in its growth. Yeah, I think it'll be interesting. Well, I think you guys both know that the LAT radio, the Attached Cafe, recently had its license pulled. because of complicated bureaucratic issues. And I know that the people from the Lot Radio working with Nightlife Office to be like, this is your job. You guys smooth out the bureaucratic relationship between a small creative business and the city. And that has yet to be ironed out, but I think that's sort of the litmus test of like, all right, how effective is this organization actually going to be? You know what I mean? Are you going to help these people get their lights back on? You know? And like, cause otherwise I haven't seen any hard evidence that they're really doing anything. I mean, it's still new, but. And it's such a contrast to the nineties, you know, which I would say was the last golden age of nightlife in New York, where you associate Giuliani, like literally like trying to. get the government to investigate people and shut people down. It was like such an antagonistic relationship. So this does represent something really new and interesting to me, like New York City supporting nightlife. ♪♪ so so
