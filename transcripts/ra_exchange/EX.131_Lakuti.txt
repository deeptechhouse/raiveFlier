Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. Bukuti is a South African-born DJ, booking agent, label boss, promoter and general industry all-rounder. Her name is perhaps most closely linked with Sud Electronic, the London party and label she ran alongside Portable. The event came to an end in 2011 after a 10-year run, although the label was dusted off again this year after a five-year hiatus. Lucuti is also the head of Azuri, an imprint she began in 2007, which has since grown to include a booking agency, which represents New York house artists like Fred P, DJ Q and Yvonne Vincent, alongside a dozen or so others. Although she's been based in Europe since 1997, Nakuti got her house music education growing up in Johannesburg. She became involved in the city's thriving scene during the 90s and attended clubs like the highly influential Fourth World and parties and warehouses right across the city. We started our recent conversation even further back than that, though, as she recounted her experiences growing up in the township of Soweto before the end of apartheid in the country. I got to have it. So I think the best place to start with you would probably be right back at the beginning. You grew up in South Africa, that's right? Yeah, I grew up. I was raised in South Africa, Soweto. and lived there until about '97. And from '97 onwards, I was based in London. Okay. Can you tell us a little bit about what it was like growing up in Sweat Home? I had a great childhood, you know, lots of poverty and I'm a product of apartheid. So back in those days, especially around about the late 80s and the 90s, there was a lot of political turmoil. You know, there was literally a civil war in the streets. Despite all of that, it was a happy childhood. You know, music, extended family. Soweto is a great place. A lot of poverty and even till up to now. But I have great memories of the place, yeah. How aware were you of what was going on politically during your childhood? My first... My memory of the situation in South Africa was in 1976, which were the famous student uprisings. And I remember, I think I was around four years old. I remember a lot of buildings on fire. And as a child, this is pretty scary, you know. And a lot of municipal buildings were on fire, people running around, police. And I remember at the time, my grandmother hadn't arrived from work. So I kept on going to the gate to kind of have a look. And I mean, I remember this vividly and I keep on thinking, wow, you are four years old. How can you remember this moment? But I remember being very nervous that my grandmother was nowhere to be found. And there was all this chaos around me. Eventually she made it home. Were you making sense of it as a child? Could you kind of grasp what was going on? I mean, I didn't really know what was going on at all. And I don't come from a particularly academic family. So there were no major political discussions, but I knew that... Black people were not equal to white people, you know, because this is what my parents would normally say, you know. But I didn't really know in detail until I was a teenager, really, about the extent of the situation we're living in. And what role did music play in your childhood? I mean... Music has always been super important in the townships. I mean, I grew up with a family that was so into music. My mom had a vinyl collection that lived in a suitcase on top of a wardrobe. And Sundays, she'll grab it out, Barry White, Isaac Hayes, The Temptations, that kind of thing. And my grandfather was an avid jazz collector and dabbled in playing the double bass. And yeah, I feel really privileged because one of his best friends was Kipi Miyake. I don't know if you're familiar with him, the famous Penny Whistler. And so he was in and around the house. So, you know, tons of jazz, disco, soul. music was always around. I mean, were there particular places that people gathered to hear music in the township? Yeah. I mean, at the time, it was illegal for black people to be in the city after a certain time. You know, you would literally be arrested and you had to carry an identity card. you know, so that you could be identified and you had to have a reason to be in the city, you know, and usually it was due to work. And after 6 p.m., if you were caught in the city, you could be arrested. So you had what we call shabins in the townships, which were basically somebody's home. And they would use a part of the home to have a shabin, which is kind of like a drinking hole, basically. normally run by women and uh they were called these women were called shabine queens so This is where local people used to go and drink lots of drink. And were they able to do so without outside interference from the police? Well, I mean, the police now and again will go, not to really shut them down, but for bribes, really, if you give them a backhander. they let you go on. So some of these things will start on a Friday and go on until Tuesday. You know, pure madness, but really great fun. And this was the only way for people to come together. and have, yeah, a party, if you like, yeah. What sort of music were people listening to back in those days? What was popular in the township? Ooh, everything from Brenda Farsi, Yvonne Shaka Shaka, you know, lots of local music to a lot of American music. I mean, right down to even... the birth of Chicago House, the first, some of those first records we heard in some of these shabins, you know, so. I mean, looking back, does it feel quite strange that these records did come to South Africa so quickly because the house has been in the country. since the late 80s. Yeah, I mean, there was a very quick connection, especially with Chicago house music. You know, for some reason, it kind of resonated with the people and it's been there ever since. I mean, house music is not a niche thing that it is in Europe. It's an everyday life thing. Your grandmother knows what house music is, you know. right down to the kids, young kids in the streets. So it is part of who we are, I guess, you know. I mean, have you thought much about why it just caught on in the way it did or why South African people identified so closely with it? I really cannot put my finger on it, you know. I really cannot. I mean, it could also be down to some of the message that some of these records carried, you know, like promised land was huge in the country then, because I think in terms of what we were going through as black South Africans. this message carried some form of hope for us, you know? So those kind of records were really big then, yeah. Yeah, I mean, were you able to get together and dance to house music? Yeah, I mean... Pre-apartheid. We did. I remember even, I mean, I used to sneak out of my parents' house when I was 14 to go to a date club. in downtown Johannesburg, you know, just to dance, yeah. So for you personally, like, who were some of the artists of interest? Like, who was really doing it for you? I mean, as I said... Promised Land was a huge hit, you know, and Larry Head, I would say, was the most important figure. And I think when I first heard his music, it really kind of... changed everything for me, you know? So even Daryl Pandy, Love Can Turn Around, I mean, here we are at home watching the telly with the family and this huge, larger-than-life, transvestite type of character. is on the telly and my parents kind of like oh this is not right and I was kind of intrigued and thought wow what is this who is this what is it but it it yeah I mean, were you able to easily get hold of the music physically? Like, was vinyl much of a concern? No. I mean, at the time we were kind of, if somebody had music, you know, a friend of a friend or somebody's cousin was in the US. We'll get some tapes and those tapes will do the rounds eventually. So that's how pirating, I guess, but that's how we got hold of the music. There wasn't any vinyl around me. You know, there were DJs that had vinyl, but... At the time, I was just somebody that was interested in the music rather than a collector, you know. So post-apartheid and thinking more around like 94 and years after that, did things change? I mean, did your world noticeably change after that point? I mean, I left the country at the time for about two and a half years to go to Toronto, where I had a scholarship to study film. So, though, I mean, I do remember specifically the round election time then. I mean, it was, wow. really crazy. I mean, there were hundreds and hundreds of people in the streets, in particular on the night when the results were announced. I actually had friends from Canada and we went around Hillborough. You did experience Hillborough when you were down there? Yes, yeah. And I mean, it's one of the most densely populated. areas of Johannesburg and everybody was in the streets banging dustbins, whatever they could find. It was just, the mood was electrifying, you know, and in terms of change, I mean, It didn't feel that change came overnight. I mean, even now, going back after not having lived there for so long, I'm still amazed as to how slow the pace of change is. You know, I mean, you do get a prominent black metal class now, which was some... that was not common then, but even so... the majority of the black community is still living in very, very poor conditions, you know. And is it right that you, when you did move back to South or to Johannesburg specifically, you moved to the city? When I went back now to Joburg and a lot of friends were like, you're crazy. go to Sandton, go to all these, you know, all the wealth or most of the wealth is in the northern suburbs. It's, that's not my heart, you know, I don't want to live in a gated community. In fact, In my opinion, I think it is more dangerous to live in these kind of high security areas, you know. And yeah, I chose to live in the CBD, which has been abandoned by most of businesses. And it was quite shocking to go back. and see, I mean, where in the world do you have a central business district that feels like a ghost town? It's quite incredible to see. And, yeah, I mean, I found a nice apartment. for very cheap and I really wanted to kind of assess for myself what was going on there and it's a it's a really dynamic space in that you you get a lot of uh migrants from other parts of Africa living there and in particular Zimbabweans, Nigerians, Ghanaians and for me that was pretty interesting and I used to go weekends with friends to check out the local shibins and for me this is where the interesting music as well in the country can be or from within Africa can be heard you know So I loved it. Yeah, it's just I'd seen that you'd spoke in the past about particular areas like Yeovil and places like Rocky Street as being like real central hubs of creativity. I just wondered if you could tell us a bit about those kind of areas and Fourth World as well, you'd mentioned as a big club for you. Well, I mean... Yeovil was traditionally a Jewish area and round about the late 80s and beginning of the 90s a lot of artists moved to this area and it really kind of changed from being kind of a sleepy family orientated area into a very very creative hub you had rocky street with bars that were open 24 hours a day and you had a lot of musicians filmmakers even some of the people that even went on to become politicians, were hanging around there. I mean, when I was at university at the time, I was working in a coffee shop called Coffee Society. And this was an amazing place where you had all these people who are now really well-known. and famous in whatever field of work they're doing, all hanging around there. And at the time, we still had the Gray Areas Act, which prohibited black people to live in white areas. So, but essentially... We didn't give a damn, you know. It really felt like there was something big, some big change that was going to come into the country at some point. It was a great time, a very, very special time in South Africa. And you talked also about a particular club that I'd mentioned, Fourth World. Fourth World. Tell us a bit about that. Wow. Shaking your head. You know, let's just say Fourth World was my music box. as Music Box was to people from Chicago or, you know, The Loft or whatever seminal club that we refer to. It really was a very, very special place, tiny, tiny place, downtown Johannesburg with a rooftop, very small rooftop. I mean, this is where we really connected with house music. You had Tim, who later established House Africa. the label and the record store who used to play weekends, but also did a Wednesday. And he's the one that introduced us to Strictly Rhythm Records and stuff like that. And you had another really great local DJ called G-Foss who, I mean, who played anything from Tent City. to Larry Head, all that kind of stuff. And it was just really a great time. There was also raves going on around that time. I mean, it went crazy. I mean, any crazy space that people could find from old prisons to anything really, old factories. you would have a party in there. And these parties sometimes went on for days, two days. You arrive home completely filthy and mental. I mean, I still remember the very first rave, which was in Yeovil in an old cinema. which was disused for like probably a decade or something. And you had a sound system from Nottingham called the Mooty Sound System that came into town and decided to do a party in this old cinema that we've been passing through for years and not seen it open. That night we had this most incredible and life-changing party in this incredible space. I mean, I still remember we had tickets that were kind of UV green cloth tickets that people put on their clothes. And I mean, the excitement in Yeovil was unbelievable. in anticipation for this event. And people were even asking each other, what can we wear? It was just insane. This was 1990. And after the party, there were literally, when you walked on the streets, people gathering outside. still asking each other what was that what has just happened it was i mean we never look back since it was a really special moment what would what would have been the soundtrack to the to the rave party god i don't even remember because at the time before then people would have considered too unlimited to be groundbreaking rave music you know I mean, I kind of remember, I guess, you know, stuff like Derek Bay and, you know, and a lot of house music, even Delight, this multi-tribal. very much into delight because I ended up making friends with them because they stayed for about six months and went on to Cape Town as well and did a beach party there for two days. It was, I mean, it was an insane time where we kind of lost our faculties and just... followed these people around you you went where the party was you didn't care you know yeah i mean do you feel like the parties were like big drivers of social change were they successful in bringing black and white people together they were in a lot of ways because i even remember meeting a lot of kids from pretoria which was the hub of uh right-wing politics at the time. And I remember meeting quite a few people from Pretoria because the strange thing is when I hear about how the vinyl got into the country, it went via Pretoria. I don't know why. And some of the... leading forces in the scene then, like G-Force, were all kids from Pretoria, you know, who grew up with really right-wing family values, and all of a sudden, they're partying with black kids. And I remember people saying, you know, you know what, we never thought that we'll party with black people. You can't, you can't. kind of all right you know and you just you know so on on that level yeah it did kind of change people's opinion of each other yeah um so when did the vinyl start really flowing into the country because um house africa was a big store around that well house africa only came about later actually but back then i mean all these guys were playing vinyl so i mean i would say around the early 90s you you know we had djs already playing vinyl yeah yeah i see um i wanted to ask when you met alan For the first time it's kind of been widely known that you two are extremely close friends. We're talking about a portable. Yeah. We met, I guess in, was it 92? Cause he used to live in Cape town and he just moved to Johannesburg. And he came to a house party, actually, that a friend put together. And there we started chatting. And the next day, I remember we went to a market together. And that was it. And he had a studio as well at the time. And I used to go around his flat. would play around in the studio and we even made some music together back then and including a music video which was shot by I mean, I sit here and I'm amazed that we managed to achieve that at the time. Lance Giva, who actually won an Oscar now for a film called Sozi, as the cinematographer, shot the video for us. I mean, these were friends. We were asking people around, can you help with this? Yeah, so we met around '92 and hung out, made music. - Were you both into the kind of house styles of music at the time? - Yeah, we were both greatly into house music at the time, yeah. - So what was kind of the background surrounding your decision to leave South Africa when you did? - Matters of the heart. But yeah, no, I grew up reading, you know, magazines like The Face magazine. And, you know, I guess this is the power of the West in that it influences people in such a profound way. And the grass is always greener on the other side. So through television and magazines, you have this vision of what it's like. And London in particular was the whole acid house thing that I was reading about that fascinated me so much. And I thought, yeah, I'd really want to go there. And also Manchester was another place that I thought, wow, this is amazing from reading about La Hacienda. You know, and I mean, the funny thing is that. a lot of people in South Africa, though, when they do want to go overseas, they tend to go to New York or those kind of places. I think people have much more of a connection with the US rather than the UK. But for me, the music. And part of it really played a major role in my decision as well to relocate to the UK. And did it live up to your expectations? I was really shocked when I first arrived in London. I think I stayed in Whitechapel my first night in London. And, you know, you expect the streets to be paved in gold, you know, but... Coming to Whitechapel, I was just quite amazed as to how rough looking it was. It was in the picture I built for myself. I mean, were you involving yourself in music around that time? Well, when I arrived here, I mean, that was the plan. I just thought, okay, I need to find a way of getting into music and stuff. So, but as you know, London is expensive and I arrived with like 400 pounds. in my pocket which didn't last for very long so the priority was to find a job just to eat and a home and i think a year later i got a job i mean at the jazz bistro which was an incredible place, pre-fabric in Farringdon. I don't know if you know about it. It was amazing. You had DJ Harvey had a residency there. You had people like Earl Gates heard from the Trojan Sound System, Bob Jones, Phil Escher, all these guys. were playing regularly in this venue. And I got a job working behind the bar and eventually worked my way through the bookings office because that's where I wanted to be. And I also got a spot DJing there every Thursday. So that place was very important because through that spot, I met a lot of people. In particular, Elgate had played a huge role in introducing me to people and letting, you know, helping me get into the whole scene in London. Maybe just to go back slightly, when did you start DJing? I mean, in Johannesburg in 90, was it 90? I mean, I'm very bad with dates and numbers. I mean, basically, when I worked in the coffee shop that I mentioned, they used to have a small theater upstairs, and they stopped running shows there. So we managed to convince the owner to let us use it for a club. So I dabbled from then, but it was nothing really serious. I never thought of myself as a DJ. I just had the spot where I could do whatever I wanted to. So now and again, I'd play some records. But when I moved to London, that's when I started investing some money when I had... money left over from the measly wage that I was earning. Yeah, that's when I started seriously buying records, yeah. And how did you find the scene in the late 90s? London was it kind of inspiring place to be at that time? I really really loved it I thought London was really really great at the time and was unique which now I mean we'll get to now but back then you had the the old blue nodes in Shoreditch you know places like that and what was the velvet rooms and Bar Rumba with Charles Peterson on a Monday. It was a great place. Great, great, great time. So tell me about the forming of Sud Electronic. Well, we started doing parties actually in London. Well, nothing big. There was a bar on Kingsland Road. And on a Sunday, we started doing a thing called Mahala, which is a Zulu phrase. It means for free on a Sunday. And it was really good. fun and this is how portable ended up getting a um a recording deal with uh sutek for context uh recordings from um the u.s uh he was in town touring and a friend said oh there's a really cool happening at the spa let's go there walked in heard Alan play live and he signed him so we started off doing that then we did a party once a month at plastic people called a couple call And from then on we decided, okay, we need to kind of maybe start doing parties for real. And one thing that we wanted to do was to try and do something that was outside a traditional club space, you know, because we felt at the time that clubs were, you know, restrictive in within the spaces themselves you get a lot of decorations that are already existing and we wanted somewhere that was empty and so that that would allow for us to kind of put our own stamp and we had friends that were making art so we got them involved in visuals and stuff like that so But yeah, we decided, yeah, we wanted to do parties and we wanted to do our own record label at the time as well. Hence the Soot Electronic name. I mean, do you feel like London was missing something that was a little more DIY at the time? I definitely thought so. I thought the way... a lot of very established things that people weak in and weak out want to. And in terms of the music that we were into, we felt that there were not a lot of venues that were offering that, you know. So, yeah, we decided why not try and do it ourselves. at that time also decided okay we want to start this record label because even when we were in South Africa we had this huge dream of starting a record label but we didn't know how to go about doing that but By then, in London, we had a slew, but no finances. And incidentally, the Prince's Trust actually funded our first record. Wow. And what sort of artists were you? hoping to represent on the label with the parties like who was exciting you or what sounds were essentially we wanted to use the label mainly for portable's work you know but it then grew from that because he when he went touring he met people And he liked this stuff and he put them on. Yeah, but I mean, we were the first party to book people like Lawrence, for example. We had a long going relationship with Dial Records that lasted. probably for around eight years. And after me, those kind of acts were first in London via us, you know. I mean, were you able to see those type of artists gaining popularity during that decade? I mean, it was pretty incredible to see. how these guys later became kind of household names within that field of music. I mean, it was great to see because nobody booked them for quite some time and we just pushed them because we liked what they did and you meet people, you end up really... forming a great friendship. So it, yeah. I mean, was that also the case with the type of parties you were running? Because now in London, like the, you know, the non-party space or just taking over a space is almost like the standard model. I mean, at the time, you didn't have all these kind of secret warehouse location stuff. I mean, I guess London did go through the kind of warehouse parties during the squat party days, but by then, there was not really a lot of parties like that, you know. So, yeah, we felt that what we were doing was pretty unique and there was nothing calculated about it. It was just, it came out of a necessity or a need, I guess, you know, and we didn't. you know at that time as also we were not as influential to go to its lab and say right this is who we are we're gonna put on this you know so we had to find other means and uh did a lot of research and we're lucky to find some really great great spots i mean we used one in uh Cambridge Heath Road with a crazy 60s lift for quite that for about five years and now that spot occasionally the body hammer crew use it for their parties and yeah And eventually you started another record label, Azuri. Yeah, Azuri came at the tail end of 2007, basically, because... And then I kind of thought, you know what, I would actually like to do something on my own, you know, and see how it goes. Because this electronic label was always you and Alan Musgrave. And by then I just thought that, you know, I'd like to try something on my own and, you know, not have to have some kind of consensus. with somebody and hence Uzu Recordings was founded. Yeah, I mean, did you see it as being particularly far removed from the sound of Sood Electronic? Did you have a different musical vision? In a way it was because with Sood at some point I kind of felt okay, I mean... Am I really inspired at the moment by what we're doing? The last release was an album we did with Portable, and that one is still very much a special project for me because I sunk a lot of my own money into that project and with no return, really. But it feels special. I mean, I still love the music on that because it was very... And I thought Alan was very much ahead of his time, you know, and he put on a great record. But I think after that record, I felt really mentally and financially exhausted and needed. a little bit of a break from that. And, you know, to also, I'm somebody that's all over the shop with too many ideas sometimes. I'm stubborn enough to also pursue those ideas and make them a reality. So, yeah. So was starting a booking agency one of those ideas? No, not at all, actually. I mean, do you actually, I don't know if anybody really, or at least I didn't think that that's what I wanted to do. It just came from. meeting artists that were really desperate to get some representation. And I felt in a way that I was kind of pushed into that role. And before I knew it, the agency had... formed itself in a way you know but it's not something that i dreamt of doing you know i mean was it that they couldn't get representation or the right type of representation or it's just the sound wasn't it's not even about the sound I mean I'll tell you how it started I met just Ed and I booked him to play in London and I think that was his second booking in Europe and he had a great time at the party and he was like yeah can you do my bookings but I was like I'm not a booker you know no no and for a while i remember saying no i i don't know you know so i just said okay eventually because he was pretty persuasive and i said okay we we give it a shot and see how it goes and it didn't take too long for the agency to really go well. And, uh, How was it quite a steep learning curve for you? It must've been difficult to begin with. It was because it was very different from anything else. You know, although I've, you know, I've worked in promoting nights. and running a label blah blah blah that was something completely different for me but it was a challenge so I guess I'm a sucker for a challenge I don't know I mean there are other qualities you feel like the artists that you represent kind of share because I feel like Azuri does have quite a strong aesthetic even if I couldn't describe it somehow Well, we have a lot of New York artists on the agency, so I guess that's kind of a running theme. And fortunately, quite a lot of the artists themselves met and know each other and they like each other's approach to music even the artists that are not from new york uh it felt like there was some kind of connection between these artists and uh and yeah i'm really quite pleased that they're all really supportive of one another and they all get on great with one another so But there was never really a plan that, hey, we're going to be a booking agency that represents house music or that it just organically became that, you know. And I guess it very much represents my own taste, you know, in terms of music as well. How would you describe those tastes? I know that's a difficult question. I mean, I'm very, very open to music and I find it a great shame that the whole scene is so genre driven right now. And I think it's a great shame because somehow the message is lost and you don't really hear much. of the word music you hear about how step step this and this and for me it's a great shame and i i think my ideal is to be in a club space where it all can kinds of music can be heard you know so have you found that anywhere recently I have to say, Tamasumo has been really, really inspiring with the DJ sets, in particular at Panorama Bar with mixing it all up from Afro to UK music to house music to techno, you know, bringing it all together. into one big pot and it's it's it's been really inspiring and really great fun and you know again i'm hearing more and more people saying yeah we need to make clubs more open in terms of music approach and policy but so i do hope that that kind of changes because I think it does a great damage to music when we're so concentrating on genres and what's hip or trendy right now because it doesn't do much in evolving the music, I think. um another kind of party or or crew if you like who i'd kind of associate you with is uh free rotation um have you had kind of official involvement with the festival or well basically we met stevio Who is the person behind the festival, Stevie and Susie? Wow, I guess... Nine? I mean, it was a long time ago, long before free rotation, because we bought one... of his records on Mind Tours and we liked it and there was an email contact so started speaking to him And before we knew it, he invited us to a party he was doing in his house in the middle of Norway, in North Wales. Beautiful place. And yeah, and Alan and I, Portable, went to play records there. And for the next few years, we got an invitation again to go back. to his house once a year and hang out and play records and yeah from then on free rotation came and he had this idea and I thought he was nuts I was just like wow how are you gonna pull it off it's gonna cost a lot of money but he was uh he's a very stubborn character so he managed to organized the first party, and to be quite honest, by then I had established relationships with people like Movedi and also all the Dial guys and some other people. So, you know, on Steve-O's behalf, wrote to the people saying, yeah, he's a great guy. and this could be a great idea, and Wales is very beautiful, so, you know, can we, trust me on this one, you know, lower fees, and, you know, give it a shot, you know, you've got nothing to lose, and they were very supportive from day one, and... the first festival I mean we're I think 200 150 200 people so not very busy but it felt good it felt that there is a bit of potential and it just grew and grew and grew and grew but I mean, yeah, it's a great festival. So when did Sud Electronic as a party come to an end? November. Fourth or fifth, I think, yeah. Because for me, it was always a London party, you know. Every city comes with its own character, and I'm not the one that for circuit parties, I just... I don't want to move my party to every city. I don't know. I just think that London, I mean, Sood was made based on the city, London itself, so it didn't make any sense whatsoever to then just transport it and do the same thing in another city. Because you're now based in Berlin. Yes, I am. Yeah. So why did you move? Again, matters of the heart. I seem to move to every country because of love situations. Yeah, I moved because of a relationship. But the record label has now started up again. Yeah, because, you know, we felt that, okay, we've had all this time to kind of... think about what we've done in the past and uh and i think distance also makes you realize that you did do something good it's not you know so we thought okay There is some scope with this. And I wanted to also have an outlet to not only concentrate on necessarily just dance floor orientated music. And Sood was always about experimentation anyway. So rather than then start another label, we thought, okay, we'll revisit. that old project. And also that for us to kick things off, we were inspired and I guess Tamasum, our God, connected with a guy called Wahib Sumadi who worked for an organization in Germany called MIGT. that it's an NGO dealing with funding for, in particular, African organizations. And they did a project with some musicians in South Sudan. And this was... during the elections right in South Sudan and I think the first record was they worked with Inner Visions so basically they approached Tamasumo to do a remix for another project that they're working on with a an artist called Mary Boyoi And, yeah, but at the time she couldn't think of a home for this project. And we got talking about it and I just said, why don't we resurrect soon? And Sood is very much a southern, south label, and this would be an appropriate home for it. And at the time, we've been exchanging a lot of conversations about... and its role within lifting or uplifting communities. And this project came at the right time, basically, because also we were really fascinated by Mary Boyoyo, who grew up in a civil war in South Sudan and lost family members. And we really admired her courage to also start her own organization to try and help in particular young women that were victims of war. So, yeah. So do you feel as though you continue to have quite a global focus with the label? Definitely, definitely. And also having lived again in South Africa after so long, I just felt like, OK, I mean, in Europe and in the West. all these things are pretty much established. You know, there's a template that is so solid. And I felt that Africa has really a lot to offer. And I think in terms of... ideas and the future is really, I truly believe that the future is particularly in that continent so I just felt inspired to be a part of that future in one way or another. Thank you. Bye.
