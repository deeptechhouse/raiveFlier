you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Finn Johansson is a DJ, a label owner, a writer, and a record store clerk, and not necessarily in that order. A Hardwax employee co-runs macro recordings with Steffen Goldman, but his beginnings in the world of electronic music were more modest than that might suggest. He grew up in Kiel, a town outside of Hamburg, a city he was drawn to because of a legendary German DJ named Klaus Stockhausen, and his sets at a club. Stockhausen instilled a love of deep house music in Johansson in a DJing style that privileges versatility over fluidity. He's one of my personal favorites behind the decks, and so I was excited to talk to him last month to find out about Front, Hard Wax, and more. you A couple of years ago you made a mix for a website podcast series called Promo Mixes. Yes. And it was a tribute to a club from Hamburg called Front. Yes. Which was started in the 80s. Yeah, it started in '83 actually and ended in '97. So quite a long stretch. Was this the club for you, the first club, the seminal club, the one that started it all? Had you been collecting records before you went there? No, I basically was going out since a very tender age of like 14 or whatever. I had some experiences, but I lived in my hometown in Kiel, which is not that big. And the clubs there were interesting, but they were not really good in a sense, especially for the DJs. You know, there were like two ways of playing records. The one was... just playing everything in a totally confused way, like playing one Italo disco record, then some new wave record, and then some disco and whatever. The whole night was just a mess. But it was entertaining. And the other style of DJing in those clubs was like you played the music in blocks. Like there was like a rock block or you played some disco records in a row or slow phase or whatever. And of course, at that time I was heavily into mod culture and being a sober boy and collecting rare soul stuff. So I also went to Ornithus, which was something else entirely. but the Front Club was the first time that I really experienced someone playing records that really knew how to mix and how to structure a night, and that was, of course, a big change for me. The DJ was Klaus Stockhausen. Yeah, at that time it was Klaus Stockhausen, although I think I first went there in... end of 86 or beginning of 87 and then I think Boris Lugosz was also playing his first gigs there who was like a protege of Klaus Stockhausen at that time being really young but yeah the main attraction was Klaus Stockhausen for me tell me about the club because I think For people who are not German, I had never heard of it before I started moving here. And now I get the sense that it's pretty legendary for a lot of people. Yes. The thing about that club was that... They played a lot of music maybe other clubs played too, but Stockhausen played it quite differently. The music was pretty hard. He often played dub mixes and he had special edits made and dropped acapellas. tricks and he was incredibly tight. And it was also a club where I think it was one of the first clubs in the whole of Europe where house music was played. And he kind of introduced that. When I started going there, it was like a mixture. There were synth pop played and disco stuff, Italo disco, high energy, and then there was house in between. But they were already laying some emphasis on it. And the club itself was a pretty rough basement club. Basically, it was... There were not many distractions, so to say. The light show was really basic. It was just a few neon bulbs above the dance floor. And more than that, they just cut out the lights to some effect during the night. It had a really simple but really effective sound system that was kind of brutal. And yeah, it was really a rough place. It was hard to get in. It was pretty hard to get in, yeah. I mean, it started out as a gay club. And they had a pretty notorious bouncer called Jürgen, who was very choosy, especially with girls in the beginning. And types he didn't see glamorous enough, probably. So the door was pretty heavy. But then that, of course, helped the glamorousness of the whole thing. I mean, the crowd was pretty hysterical. You went there when you were 15? No, no. When I first went there, I was like 18. Okay. How did you get in? How did you get past your luck? I probably looked much prettier than now. They must have liked me. I don't know. I went there with a friend of mine who told me I should really go there. And I was really skeptical at first. I mean, I heard some rumors about it. And especially the gay thing first kind of scared me a bit. I later discovered it was for some reason. It was pretty wild. But, yeah, I mean, when I first went there, I was kind of really into disco and wrestle, and I didn't really believe that this would be fun. But on the other hand, I always, like, collected disco in all aspects, like, so I liked Italo disco. and synth-pop, although you couldn't really admit that with a rest so true. But, yeah, so I went there and it completely blew me away. I mean, I danced for like... from start to finish, never got off the floor. How did he play? I mean, you mentioned a little bit of what he played, but how did he DJ that was so interesting to you? I mean, for me it was like I heard a few bits in the mix that I knew or records that I knew, but... He played it in different versions and he cut back and forth. He used hip-hop techniques, juggling things, did a lot of teasing with really microscopic signals. And that was completely unfamiliar to me. And there was some like, it was... very much going to some climax but repeatedly like you know he raised the tension with each record then he totally broke it down I mean there were some some gimmicks that he used for example there was stereo test record with some heavy lorry driving off and they cut out the lights and it was like going, revolving around all the speakers in the room, all this lorry driving off and all the people were screaming and going insane. Obviously at that point I have never witnessed a DJ doing something like that. Do you find yourself taking a lot of inspiration in your own DJing? Yeah, I mean, it would be strange otherwise because I was going there quite regularly for quite a time. I mean, like from 87 to... Around '94 I was going there really regularly, so that wore off of course. But for me, I really started playing house and mixing properly. after I regularly went there. So I started out playing records in clubs in the 80s. That was more like playing soul at all-nighters or playing some disco at friends' parties that was not really mixing. And then I took quite a long break with DJing just for the simple reason that the music played and the DJs there were so good. I just didn't know really where to start. And I enjoyed dancing there so much that the thought didn't really occur to me that I might start playing myself. That just came later, like in '95, I took up that when a club in my hometown opened and the owner knew me and he knew that I was buying a house in Tegno all the time and lots of other stuff, so he asked me to play there. But back then I couldn't really mix. which is even an understatement. I was really crap. I learned that kind of life. I had no decks at home, no mixer, and I just went there with my records and started playing. And on the first night, I couldn't mix at all. On the second night, I was trying a bit. like four months later i could mix uh because of course you you learn absolutely quicker if you just have to yeah but it was i think it was a painful experience in the beginning for me and the crowd too but it went better so you said you you didn't even think to dj no because there were better people out there. Yes. Going back to Front just for a moment, Boris was also quite celebrated, I think, as a DJ for a while. How did he differ from Klaus? What did he play? And how did he play? For a while, I always thought that Klaus was maybe... He was a bit more strict with what he played. He was really like a dictator in the booth. And he was really relentless. He was not getting clues from anybody. It was just his personal vision. And he kind of perfected that for a long time. and he absolutely knew what he wanted to do. And when Bo started out, he was pretty good too, but he was not that defined, maybe, with his own style. He was like a younger version of Klaus in a way. But that soon changed. I mean, Klaus Stockhausen quit DJing in 92, I think. And in his later years there he was also not playing every weekend and Boris then at that time developed his own style. I mean, they played lots of acid house, of course, and in the early 90s they played lots of techno Detroit stuff when it was not really differentiated as, like, between house and techno. It was all basically perceived as house. like some records on Warp or New Groove or whatever that nowadays you would call maybe techno. Back then it was all house. And then at that time in Hamburg there were some other clubs who started to specialize in a harder variety of house and techno. Boris took a look at that and decided to do something else and then like I think it was at the end of 91 or something like that from one Saturday to another he kind of changed the whole musical agenda of the club and went deep house and vocal house and that became the main sound for for yeah until the end of the club it was specializing in deep house and garage house and stuff like that But, I mean, for Boris, he was really, really good with vocals. I mean, playing vocal house, it's probably not what's the main sound nowadays, but it's just something that you have to learn. harmonies and that the vocals don't bite each other and he always had double copies and playing dub mixes and vocal versions, stuff like that. So that was really something at that time that at least I remember that not many people... were doing that in Germany, if at all. He was a little bit smoother than Klaus, I guess. Yes, a bit, yeah. But, I mean, I have live tapes from Boris from like... those early years and they were pretty energetic too. I mean that's the main thing when I listen to old live recordings of the club, the difference to what is played nowadays. Now that a lot of sounds from back then are referenced again, but the DJs nowadays are playing them much slower and much more... yeah, much more thoughtful. Back then it was like just kicking. It was all playing, played really fast. And that's a bit different nowadays, I think. You know, when there was like the first time that Speed Garage came around, I can still remember that we all thought that must be the most silly thing ever because... The garage was played at speed at the club, so it really made no sense. You wrote a piece for, was it Debug? About sort of the Deep House resurgence. Yes. Which got a lot of feedback, you told me. Yes. It was written in German. So I had trouble making my way through it. Was that one of the things that you brought up? What you just said about everything's a little bit more considered and played a little bit slower? No, not really. I mean, it's of course a sign of the times how people play records. There's just a general... consensus in a way that you don't go in a club and play deep house records at 130 bpm or more. That's kind of a sign of the times. I mean, it's the same like with Berghain, where techno is played much slower than like in the mid-90s. That's just a development. Why do you think things have slowed down? I don't really know. I don't really know. It doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing, you know, especially with the techno thing. I thought like the way techno was played at Berghain has like given the music back some groove and some funk even. And I really like that because... the way techno was played in the mid-90s to the years after that, for me that was just too hectic and too aggressive and too ungroovy. And I like that. But with house, it's kind of a bit different because... I think the way house is played today for me is a bit too conservative because especially deep house is a bit conservative anyway. And the way it is presented nowadays, it just lacks some punch for me. But that was not really something that I addressed in that article. It was more like about the sound, how the sound is revived. And I had the feeling that... Nowadays, a lot of producers are just jumping the bandwagon because it's kind of hip again to play Deep House. And they reference... They always reference the same... pool of records and they kind of do some mimicry of it and they don't add much and I think that's just too little. Yeah, I think certainly over the past few years, I've gotten the same history lesson over and over and over again. It's a very limited pool. And one of the things that I really like about watching you and hearing you DJ and dancing to you is that you're playing a lot of the... some of those records from that time period, but it's always records that I'm sort of like, I... no idea what that one is you know yeah but i wanted to touch on the writing thing a little bit how did you when did you get involved with that when did that become um writing about music yeah when was that i started writing for local newspapers like in the 90s and then That was on a pretty low profile level. It was just DJs who visited town or some concerts, some record reviews, nothing really special. That kind of really started when I moved to Berlin. uh 2003 i moved to berlin and i had no real plan to to write actually i i had no plan to to dj either i was at that point i actually stopped djing um and i i was kind of on the lookout for for for a nice job but I had no real idea what to do. And I knew some people at Debug magazine from my hometown. And since I had nothing else to do, I kind of slowly but surely got in there. And first I was just helping out with some copy editing. And at some point I got asked to review some stuff. And then it was more and more. And then at one point I was writing interviews and features. Do you get pleasure out of it? From writing? Yes, I actually do. I like writing. I like interviewing people. Doing some, you know... having the opportunity when something really bugs you to just write about it and it gets printed and discussed. I like discourse and I like to... I don't necessarily mean to put off people, but I kind of like when music is discussed or just topics are discussed and I think that shouldn't be... like just left for blogs and message boards. I think that belongs in print. And I like that. But the only thing I don't really like is writing reviews and I don't do that anymore since quite a time now. I stopped writing reviews years ago actually. Why reviews? It's too limited, maybe. Yeah, I mean, I have to be brutally honest. You don't get paid for reviews. That's one thing. Or very rarely. And I had a few ugly incidents with records that I wrote bad reviews for. And at that time it was not really a thing that was common. I had to discover that lots of producers and musicians, they thought like they give you a record for free or whatever and you write something in favor and I thought like this is not really what a reviewer should do. So I opted for the honest the honest option and that was kind of difficult. But that was not the main reason. I mean, there were several reasons. Also, I realized that at some point I really had nothing left to say about a certain kind of music. because I had to review so many records that sounded very similar. And I thought, if you write the same and just different variations about music, it's not really, it's not fun anymore. When browsing through Discogs, I see your name submitted by quite a bit on records that I'm looking at. Yeah. It seems like that's one website that you helped build almost in a way. Yeah. When did you first get involved with it? I got involved I think in 2001. And that was basically for two reasons. I'm not really nerdy about music. I don't really care about Cadillac numbers or whatever was required for Discogs, actually. But I had two reasons to join in at that early stage. The one thing was I was writing my final thesis at university and I just needed some distraction. to something to do, to just keep my mind off it for a few hours a day. And then at that time a few of my friends records collection were stolen by junkies. It was in my town it was pretty common that junkies just sacked whole record collections from basements and flats and that totally gave me the creeps and I thought it might be a good idea to archive the whole thing for insurance reasons. and that was basically it so I started getting in there and yeah of course it developed pretty quickly after that I mean I remember writing a feature for for debug about this course when it was still not certain where the site would go. But back then it already had this behavior of every website that's growing really quickly. Like they just impose changes on the community without asking them in the first place. For me it was pretty obvious that this would develop to this whole marketplace thing. Back then it was not settled, but I just speculated on that. Yeah, time proved me right. I suppose the marketplace thing is a good thing and a bad thing, of course. I think basically it's a good thing just for the reason that I don't believe in being secretive about music. Basically everything I... do is about spreading knowledge about music. I don't like it very much when people just exchange music and do it in circles or something like that. If I like a record, I want everybody to know, basically. So the marketplace, of course, nowadays is a good thing to educate yourself about music. So if you discover a record in some specialist message board discussion or whatever, the chances are pretty good that you can buy it. And you can even buy it for less and less money. because at this point I think so many DJs are getting rid of their vinyl. I think it's a fact because prices are really getting down for rare records. I mean, you can observe that with lots of stuff that's just getting cheaper and cheaper because there's... so much supply right now. But you're not getting rid of any of your collection? Well, I promised my wife to not erect another shelf. So at this point... So you promised her that you wouldn't buy any more. But that you're not going to get rid of anything. Well, of course, I'm buying and buying and buying. So you have to get rid of the same amount that you buy. In a way, yes. I mean, my record collection nowadays is a bit like a revolving door. If I buy lots, I have to get rid of something. I remember getting rid of parts of my collection in the 80s, 90s and there were lots of stuff that I totally regretted and bought later on for much more. And it is of course a painful experience but nowadays I mean, I'm 43 years old now and I think it's pretty realistic to say that maybe like at least 40% of my record collection I won't need again to play in clubs. And if that's the case and I don't listen to it regularly. It's just like sitting around. And so there's always some things I get rid of. Of course I do mistakes. But that's natural. Yeah, of course. Tell me how you met Stefan Goldman. I met him in Berlin. There was a really mysterious, secretive message board that belonged to a former fanzine called Oak. And the fanzine died, but the message board lived on. There were like 15 people posting there, but they all were like producers, writers and DJs. And Gerd Jansson introduced me there, who thought it might be interesting for me. And then there was a meeting with a few people. who were members there basically. We went to some place and got drunk. And they were all part of that. And there was Gerd Jansson and Michael Kummermeer and Dixon and Stefan. After that I rode the train home with Stefan and he was kind of surprised that I basically knew all his older records that he released on Classic. I kind of asked him why he's not releasing so much anymore. And so probably we got friends because of flattery. That's how all good friendships start, I think. Yeah, but we started doing things together and then... Yeah, it was kind of weird because we're totally different, actually. I'm older than him, I have a different social background, I have a different taste in music even. You have very different tastes in music, which I find really interesting. You run this label, Macro, together. Yeah. And almost every release, I either say to myself, that's a Finn release, that's a Stefan release. And sometimes I say, that's actually probably exactly both of them somehow. Yeah, but the thing is, and I'm not lying. thing is that the records that are more like a Finn release or the records that are more a Stefan release they don't get released the releases that get released are just like you know they are really typical democratic 50-50 agreement thing. It's basically just the music that we can agree on. I mean, we listen to demos or we listen to stuff that people send to us or artists that we already worked with and if we don't agree with it then we more or less don't do it. You did a release where you both basically did a DJ set with the exact same records. Yes. And they sounded different. Yes. Yeah. I mean, that was, of course, of course, that wasn't. experiment really but we we thought like we we are just two people running that label and we are totally different and we're we're especially different as djs and we thought it would be It would be interesting to just try that. We use the same playlist and do not anymore talking about it at all. We just take the same records, do a mix, and then compare the results. It was an experiment. It could have failed. I mean, we could have done it similarly or in the same sequences or same groove or whatever. But of course we didn't. They're really different, yes. You said that obviously you're both different DJs. How would you describe Stefan's style of DJing? He likes to keep the groove a bit more basic than I am. He's much more disciplined. I like taking detours and I'm maybe a bit more spontaneous. I also like taking chances when I play, like also trying to mix stuff together that doesn't necessarily fit and of course it fails. quite regularly, but if it works, it's of course very rewarding and he just has different influences and maybe also different things that he's looking for when he hears somebody play records. I remember hearing you play Heaven 17 as your first record at Panorama. Yes. And it seemed to me at that moment that it was quite obvious that you were willing to take chances. Yes. And that was basically also a moment where it not really worked. I mean, yeah, I got weird looks on the dance floor. But that was pretty typical for my approach to playing art because at that time it made perfect sense to me to play that record. And I can't really explain why. But I just had to. You've been responsible for some of the more interesting nights, in my view, at that place. You brought in, excuse me, Onea Ahun to play live there. And also Electra Guzi played live upstairs, which were gambles, I think. paid off quite well the oneon thing was really really special yeah i feel like uh i thought that was absolutely amazing um For us it was kind of a weird experience because we had to negotiate a lot to make that happen because at first when we told them we want to book him to play they were kind of reluctant about it. They thought it would be too experimental. And we absolutely thought it would rock the place. And it did. Really happy that we could pull that off. And for me, that was really, really impressive. because I think that he has a really special vision of techno and he's really individual. I always look for artists that kind of have their own signature sounds. really sound like nobody else and he certainly does and even to see that live was was more impressive even than than on record because I mean, his live show was pretty basic, but he had really weird stage outfits. I mean, I think he wore a rubber suit that looked like it was fouling, had a green backdrop with some pastoral paintings on it. I had forgotten about that. Yeah, they put up like three walls around him, like a backdrop. drop and it just had these very banal pastoral paintings as though he was like playing in a drawing room from the like 1800s or something like yeah it was totally totally naive and and blonde and yeah i like that So then he shaved his head and airbrushed it white. And he looked like really alien. And then in combination with the music, that was really cool. And it worked. I mean, people had lots of fun that night. got screamed at a lot and people were really impressed and I was immensely proud. You mentioned that Berghain was slightly reluctant to book him. Do you find that, you know... what you guys do has cost you just in general, in a way, in terms of getting bookings. I guess it's hard to know whether you're not, you're not getting bookings because you're too hard to predict. Yeah. be. I mean with Stefan and me as DJs it's kind of different. Because Stefan as a DJ is different than he is as a producer. As a producer, he's pretty adventurous and unpredictable. But as a DJ, he really likes to play proper club sets. And in that aspect, I might be the odd one out. that is regularly running into difficulties because club promoters or so don't really know what to make of it. But, I mean, it would be silly to do a macro label night, I mean, to book us and not, I mean, if you book us as a label, you should know what the label does and you should also be ready that, you know, the DJ part of it is kind of similar. Not like 100% similar, but at least some unpredictability is always part of it. Do you think that's missing from a lot of DJs these days? Unpredictability? Yeah, a bit maybe. I mean, I seem to always enjoy the DJs most who are very individual in a way, who have their own idea. and then just execute it for the sake of it, actually. Who are some of the DJs that you really, really enjoy? I had tremendous fun with DJ Sprinkles at Panorama Bar, for example, who I thought was really, really good. And of course he plays lots of his own records, and he plays them from start to end, and then just does a little blend and that's it. So he's not doing it with some technical visitry or whatever. It's just about the music, but the music is so good. That is just, the whole package is just astonishing. I remember seeing him play Cookies and it seemed like he played four records in an hour. Yes. And yet it was completely transfixing the entire way through. It was amazing. Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's basically it. The records are so good. I mean, they're so thought out. and that it doesn't really matter. I mean, he's not the first DJ to just play his own records. I mean, there was Todd Terry too, who made a career out of it. Of course they're totally different artists, but I think if your music is so distinctive and of such a quality that you can rely on it, then why not? I don't really mind that. You started working at Hardwax semi-recently. How did that come about? That was kind of a coincidence because I became father of a beautiful young daughter. in October 2010 and then I quickly realized that doing solely working as a freelancer is not really compatible with the base. I just had to cut down on deadlines and it was just getting out of hand. So I thought it might be a good idea to at least try to get some steady job, even if it's just a few times a week for a few hours. Then I just, I mean, I went to Hardwick's buying records nearly every week for years and years. And I was on good terms with Torsten. the main buyer, T++, and I kind of just suggested that to him, and not thinking much about it, and then basically a week later, he already got in touch with me and said that Achim... would be quitting the job and if I might be interested in taking over. And so within a very, very short time, the idea became a job. And yeah, so now I'm still working there. How do you like it? I love it, actually. Working there doesn't take the joy out of the record buying that you did. No, absolutely not. Of course, it takes the mystery out of it. The aura of Hardwix is of course not really that strong if you go there every day. You know how the back office looks like and you're not at the counter and you never get a glimpse of it or whatever. No, I enjoy it very, very much. It's like another part of trying to bring good music to people, like basically everything else that I do. And it's just another aspect of it that I can work with, and I do. I mean, it's not just, you know, there's of course the consulting part when people ask you directly in the store if you can recommend something and you recommend, of course, records that matter to you personally. Macro records. Yes, of course, that's always the first choice. No, not really. And then after a few months I started joining Thorsten with the buying too. So now I can also acquire some stuff for the shop that I think is interesting. What was the most surprising thing about starting to work there? What kind of shocked you? I think there was nothing shocking really actually. There were things that I kind of underestimated. For example, if you're a regular buyer and you don't have to go there. every like like two or thrice two or three times a week to to get the records you want you can also call and can you put that aside for me so i basically went there like once a week and if you go there once a week and you mostly go there when it's not too crowded like when it's just open You of course don't really witness the majority of customers there. So there were a few things that I... underestimated like for example the tourist part of it that was surprising how many tourists on certain days people staying in Berlin for the weekend and then record shopping at Hardwix is of course a must something like that And of course I've been to a hard works in the 90s where it was really, really crowded and really busy and I knew about that but I didn't really think that it could be still the same. And then of course... I was kind of surprised of how many DJs pass through Hardwax that you never met before or even admire or something like that. And you meet them in person and they're really cool and pleasant. Looking ahead for yourself and the label, what... What is the plan? What's the concept of the week between you and Stefan? Well, our seminal concept of the week. At this point, all the concepts of the week revolve around Stefan's album that he is currently working on. and he's spending a lot of time in the studio right now. and this is probably our main release next year and I just heard a few bits and they're really promising but he's not quite there yet he still some tracks to do and He's a very thorough worker, so that might take some time, but he's also, that's the one thing, Stefan is also working on some, he has been commissioned to do some more experimental music compositions for a festival curated by The Wire magazine. and some other stuff. And in that aspect, he's also quite active. So there's, as usual, there's a club aspect. Stefan's work and some more experimental advanced stuff going on but the first thing for now is the Peter Kruder 12 inch that we will release end of February and we had to postpone that a bit end of last year and we're so happy that it finally gets out because we think it's massive. Like with every year, we always think that if we run out of... ideas we just take a break and it's okay but it never happens always something getting in between and we want to release that but that's basically what I can tell what we're doing I mean that's Peter Krüller 12-inch and we're doing Stefan's album and there probably is going to be another release with works by Friedrich Goldman, Stefan's father. That's also in the works but everything else this year. I mean we don't have a hectic schedule anyway. Never had so. Will we ever see anything from you release-wise? Do you work on music? No. Why did that never happen? I don't know. I think I'm just too impatient. And back then, you know, when producing with a laptop was not an option, I... It didn't really interest me enough to get going. And I always work the way that I need quick results with what I want. and I'm somebody that loses interest pretty quickly. So if I have an idea, there must be a way to get something done, to have something that you can really present. And back then, I never really felt the urge. to produce and then I just had a look at what people are doing with laptops and production software and it totally paralyzed me just looking at it. Years ago when you had like a few analog gear stuff like sampler and... and synthesizer and a few other stuff and you could produce something that really took some effort to just buy the things but you could like do something and that probably is the only way to work doing music that might appeal to me or that might work with me because Nowadays, all these software things, for me, it's too many options. It's too much choice. Maybe you should just start a punk band. Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah. Stefan joked about it, of doing something with me. talking me into it but you know on the other hand I could have also written my big novel and I haven't done it yet it's just the way I am if I don't if I don't have to do it because I feel I have to do it then I think I better not do it because I won't be satisfied with it anyway So up to now, there's just a few sketches I did with some friends that probably never, ever somebody will hear about. You just said that you won't do anything that you don't feel like you have to do. Yeah. What do you feel like you still have to do? Actually, even as frustrating as it may be, I think on an artistic level, I mean, I'm not an artist in that sense, but on a level, working on a creative level, I think... I'm not really feeling that I have a big goal to achieve because I already have done so much. Even if I would stop doing what I'm doing right on the spot and do something completely... different for the rest of my life, I could still look back and say like, oh, all right, that's not too bad. I mean, I may not be the best or most prolific DJ in the world. There are probably better writers than me. There are probably labels that sell more or whatever, but that's not the point. The point is that I can... look in the mirror and say like it's not too bad it's okay and of course that sounds like I'm not too ambitious and I'm afraid that's that's probably true I'm not a really ambitious person I'm with what I do and if I have a commission to do so If I have a gig to play, if I have a piece to write, I do it the best way that I can. But it's not like that I have a business plan with it. I don't have to... I don't think that if I have three or four gigs a month, I desperately have to play the double amount a few months later, or I have to earn more money with writing, or I have to own hard works or whatever. That's not really interesting to me. The only thing... That is a big goal for me, that I don't want to be corrupted by what I do. I don't want to lie to myself, I don't want to compromise, I don't want to do stuff that I don't really want to do. And I'm in the really lucky position to get away with it. But I fought hard to do it. I spent quite some time when I moved to Berlin where it was not really obvious that I could make a living with what I do. And that was basically for the reason that I didn't compromise. And of course then you just earn less money. And so there were a few difficult years, but now it's all good and I can stay relaxed about it for the time being. And so, yeah, the only thing that interests me at the moment is carrying on in a way that is okay for me. But my main priority at the moment is my family. That's what interests me most. And that maybe it's a big goal that my little daughter won't be a teenager looking back, hearing some mix that I didn't think, oh shit, what the fuck is that? you
