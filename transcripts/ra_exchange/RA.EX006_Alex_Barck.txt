Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I am the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. This week's edition centers around Alex Bark, one of the driving forces behind Jazzanova and the Sonar Collective label. Having grown up in East Berlin, Barcks started buying records at a relatively late age, but once the Cold War was over, he soon caught up to his Western contemporaries and then some. He now boasts one of the city's most eclectic collections, something you can easily hear in the diversity of styles presented by the label and jazz. Casanova. As he gets set to make his way down to Australia, we caught up with him in Berlin to chat about how the city has changed over the years and much, much more. If you do not dance the whole night through We're going to Australia soon. As someone who grew up in East Berlin and not traveling a lot, I imagine that's quite, it's kind of a dream to be traveling the world doing the DJ thing in a way. Yes, kind of. I mean... I lived in the East until I was 17. Then the war came down. So the traveling was never ever a topic for me. So if you don't know something, you don't miss it. Were you traveling around a lot as a kid? No, not really. Actually, I was quite that Eastern bloc. countries Poland, Hungary and something like this but that was it but I didn't miss it so the whole propaganda thing worked like perfect in eastern Germany but now for me it's I didn't have that dream, but it became a dream. And I was really surprised when the people started to book us in foreign countries. I said, what? It must be so expensive for them, the flights and the hotel. But now I'm obviously used to it. and already hated sometimes. I mean, I really like to play as a DJ, but to travel kills me sometimes if you have bad connections and all the weather and climate change and the airlines, they reduce their flights and I always have fuck-ups. traveling recently so it was a dream but now it's more like a nightmare kind of thing I think the quote I always go back to is someone was saying I play for free it's the traveling that they pay me for it's the hassle that's what I always say because I mean I really enjoyed it in the beginning for me it was like on a plane and foreign countries. The bad side of it is that you just see hotels from inside and you don't see much of the world actually. You try to get the feeling as fast as possible talking to the transport person from the airport and try to get a bigger picture but it's still the traveling is for some people it might be interesting if they can only fly business class or first class then it's okay but our circle our scene is a bit more low-key, down to earth more or less and its economy and long distance flights are definitely a bit... Tell me about a little bit about growing up in East Berlin. I read an interview with you with Red Bull Music Academy and you talked how hard it was to get records. You could hear the radio. Yeah. The radio. But you couldn't buy the music. Yeah. I think radio made. radio which I what I do now is really like the dream coming true because the radio for me as a music lover from since I was years or something like that was really the thing music was the most important thing for many people in the GDR so if you meet like people in my age coming from the former and GDR they all are somehow connected to a certain kind of music so in Berlin the real Berliners people from Berlin If you find the music makers, they are mostly from the East actually, which is funny. Not from the West. Because it was something special. That was the real journey, the escape from the normal day life there. And that helped a lot to... Yeah, just to have something and forget all the rest. Imagine the artistic impulse of all these people who... were maybe trapped or didn't have a chance to express themselves in the way that they wanted to finally. Yeah, it's probably one aspect of it. But much more an aspect I think was to be in a group of people liking the same music that was so important. You were dressed like Morrissey and you had a... I had a haircut like him. Did you have a haircut like Morris? Yes. I just found old pictures of mine. Really funny. And yeah, it was like belonging to a group of people. because there was not so much to do in Eastern Germany. There was not a big variety of cultural... possibilities so there was no cinema really some but boring films and yeah the radio was so strong because you had all the western stations broadcasting towards the east so you could hear a lot of good music like Mike Westwood, the hip-hop show. He was on the British station for the army here in Berlin. Then the most famous show was probably the one on SFB by Monika Dietl. This is the one which influenced a lot of people with dance music, electro and hip-hop. She played a strange mixture which nobody else ever played actually. She always had the newest Latin Rascals mixtapes and stuff like that. So this was for me. the biggest influence to end up then later with music. It was always on the side and I was like school and university and music was there but then one day it became like really big when we started to produce. That was the moment where we said okay this is too big now because we didn't expect such a feedback. I was like... Once the wall came down you started DJing out? No, a little bit later. First I started to buy records like an idiot. Like crazy, I'm sure. Crazy. Did your parents have a record collection as well? Yes, a little one. My father had a tape collection. He was recording everything on these reel-to-reel tapes. So he recorded also from the radio. a lot. This was the way of getting the good music, but obviously it was so-so. This is actually funny how I discovered how to loop things with a tape. We had two machines and I started to play around with them like fast, slow and one day I found out, okay, I can record this one. with the other one and then but really naive and not really like beats or something was just like sure and not tight but it was the first these were the first steps till somebody i met somebody who had a sample and he said yeah you can do it like much easier I remember in that same Red Bull interview you said that you got asked to make beats or something to that effect and you sort of were like, yeah, we don't know. how we can't take we want to take the vocals out of the tracks but we don't know how to take those vocals out yeah that was one of those yeah first lessons we had to learn when we went to the Our studio guys, the first time, Stefan and Axel, they were already quite busy with German hip-hop. Also quite famous actually, they did some German hip-hop acts. And for them everything was clear, but we really thought, okay, then take the strings out from there and... thought this might be possible which is actually possible now yeah right it only took a number of years yeah yes and they said no it's not possible and then they showed us how it worked I knew a little bit before because I was working on a record in a record shop in Börnen, Soul Trade in Sanderstraße. And I had a friend, René. He was in one of the first Eastern German hip-hop groups. And he showed me the whole sample thing, what they do with the old music. And this was kind of really taking over then. I was so... thrilled by that idea that you take something which is there and do something new out of it. And I think it has a good potential for young people because it is a little bit not very solid it's a bit criminal right and it I think you as a young person you can be hooked very easily on a working situation like this taking stealing things and do something out of it and did it ever Did it occur to you that back then, that "oh, this is a little bit..." No, no. I mean, I know the culture certainly was way different then in terms of sampling, you know, everyone was sort of... no one thought... We did it. We knew that it's dangerous, so we tried to sample other things. more very little things and then play around with it. We never sampled like the big loop and made something out of it. We sampled the one snare and then reprogrammed it. Which is a bit more work, but it makes sense. Was hip-hop the first thing, the first big music for you? Because I remember, you know, you had a haircut like Morrissey, you know? That was the first music for me. When I was a teenager, I was listening to like all the interesting UK bands. Smith and wedding presents and like rock, rock music actually, guitar, pop, rock. Follow you When you said Do as I do And scrub your fade ways Dial a cliche Grow up in that And I think it's still, when I do music with Cezanova or even on my own, I... It's in there. It's the pop aspect. On the last album we even covered a Morrissey tune. It was your suggestion. Yeah, of course. Further into the fog I fall Well I was just Following you. When you said do as I do and scrap your fake ways. Directly. And yeah, I'm really happy that it's possible to join these two worlds in my life. Did you think it was successful, the cover? Were you happy with how it turned out? I was happy. And I was... reading like in a forum, in the Smiths or Morrisey fan forum that they really loved it also so I thought okay it can't be too bad for them Sure. Because it's another world. It's a gospel tune and Morrissey is everything else than gospel. Yeah. But sometimes it's the context to bring things in a different frame and then you see it differently. And I think, yeah, for me it was okay. do music that's the only important thing sure so when did you meet up with the other guys so jazz first of all I started DJing 92 93 and delicious donuts club was opening 1994 I think and I was a guest I was always going there to check out new music or old music What kind of club was it? Delicious Donuts? It was probably the only real club back then. Club in terms of meeting point for people and always the same people. Not a club like a nightclub where everybody goes. It was really a club. You saw like the... Yeah, you could go there alone and you met 20 people. people you know. So this was actually a good club with a really bad sound system. Bad meaning bad. So no bass, nothing, no bass drum. It was just high because somebody lived. on top of the club, so it wasn't possible to make it very loud. That forced the DJs there to play more melodies because the people needed something to hold on. And I heard Jurgen, my nowadays partner, and playing like brazilian music mixed with drum and bass and in a very early stage this freestyle idea and i always had the feeling wow that's what i want to do and funny enough The promoter of Delicious Donuts was once in the club I was playing and he said: "I like what you do, come over and play one night for us." And I was like: "Shit, I was so nervous." For me it was the end of the career. I want to be there. Do you remember any of the records you brought that you wanted to play for sure? I was deep into the originals of hip hop tunes and they put me... And it was actually fitting pretty well on a spoken word night. So I was playing this stuff and then they did the live show and I played something in between and back and forth. And our engineers, Stefan and Axel, they were always there because it was kind of hip-hop crowd in this. spoken word thing and they were always like looking what what i'm trying so i saw them they saw me we we were like hey we we knew that's them that's me blah blah um and it uh that is the story we the music brought us together somehow And the club wanted to do a compilation where every DJ should do one song. And there was a... Roscoe, one of the Jazzanova guys, introducing us to the Extended Spirit guys, which is Stefan and Axel. And so we started to make music. The first EP was just three songs from us three DJs. It was quite... almost innovative at the time, like asking, you know, I don't, did you have any production experience? and they said "we wanna have you make a track" and I was like "uh, okay, sure" I mean I knew a little bit about it I knew like hip-hop, okay, sampling and all that but the thing is I really wanted to get in touch with the Extended Spirit guys there was a tape flying around back in the days with just instrumental tunes I never heard something like this before because it was hip-hop but they sampled Brazilian tunes like everything and had a very good atmosphere very dark and warm the stuff I really liked so I said okay we have to do it with them because they have that This guy had a certain groove. I think that people belong to groove families somehow. Some people, even if they're black or white, they like the straight. groove or more like steady marching beats and there are other people who like the laid-back things a bit more brazilian influenced is that jazz a little bit improved i would say so and i think the house people who discovered us later for the remixes for the productions and even the hip-hop people these were the people who had the same idea about music about the slowly slightly off grooves and I think this is why someone like Giles Peterson is such a huge fan. That's obviously his groove. He likes Long Village and this is more or less, even if you don't see it, obviously, and you wouldn't say it. the family, the people who have a bit more space between the bass and the snare. I miss it. So you got in the studio and I guess you sort of realized that at some point maybe you were a better DJ than a producer. Yeah, I never wanted to be a producer. I always thought Stefan and Axel, they are the best, I don't want to compete with them. They can do such great things. And I was the guy controlling the vibe, contacting the collaboration people or having the contact to other people while traveling the world. getting in contact with other people and I always had the feeling I know if something is good and this is my position in Jazzanova. I always had the feeling. I sit there and I can arrange things. Not better than Stefan and Axel, but maybe different, more floor-orientated or more modern. Because Stefan and Axel, or Stefan actually, is very... into old music like heavily and he has such a big knowledge about folk, jazz, rock he's a I don't want to say he's a nerd but he is and I think when he wants to do music he want to be free of advice from outside, which I totally understand. And it developed a little bit into this direction, because in the beginning nobody of us could play any instrument. We knew how to sample, how to make beats, and then we started, or Stefan started to... find out harmonies and step by step we ended up now like being able to write songs and give it to people to play and they see okay the notes interesting let's do it. What was the first moment that you you felt like you guys were on to something that you sort of knew okay this is this is the first hit this is the first or the first thing where you could all work together you knew that something was taking off that couldn't be done individually I think it was from the first record. I really had the feeling that was the one because Stefan alone would have never ever done such a song and we couldn't do it ourselves and it would never come out like this. Sure. And so from the first record it was really magical. Or it still is when we're in the studio. I don't know what it is. I think we all come from different angles but everybody has such a... big listening knowledge because we are listening to music like all the time all the time and if you have so much input it must come out somewhere again and I think sometimes it's difficult to play in a group or having different opinions of which way to go And sometimes it's just good to have those possibilities. And we were always like five or six people. I always say it's much easier if you're a group to decide things sometimes than if you are just two people. Because it's 50-50, but if four people or five people are here and here's one, the one will think about it again because maybe you are right. So we always knew how to deal with those. situations and at the same time I have to say most of the time in the studio was listening to music. Everybody played his favorite tunes and this and that. And while listening the ideas came around how we want to do it. What were you listening to when that first session happened? The first session? Yeah. German fusion. Brilliant. Yeah, German fusion records with the Fender Rhodes and the Light drums, not too heavy. We were never actually, and maybe that was the biggest difference, if you like hip-hop, you like to show what you can with your beats, they must be strong. Stefan was... always a bit different he wanted to to fly with the rhythm a bit more than just to stand on the ground and this is what kept our love for Brazilian music because the Brazilian music flies and without a big bass drum you can have a killer groove and go along with it. Does it make it hard in clubs sometimes? Yeah, of course. But sometimes it's hard, sometimes it's easy. When the club doesn't have a bass player. It's not easy. But also, you know, I always say sometimes you go with the world and the taste of the world and sometimes not and it goes back and yes and no. Obviously, you have experience of... what you do but still a bass one which is too loud for my ear is too loud you can have heavy beats like and I like it as well but then the rest is somehow balanced and fits to it because the when we started to make music there was a little bit a lack of music in club in the club context. Everything was loopy, everything was just beats and bass and I mean I like it somehow, some tracks were great from back then but it was not enough for me to really feel home. So what I always wanted to do is music which has a groove which gets the people on the floor but also music. It doesn't have to be like instruments all over but a good musical idea can be just one moment where the people say "wow, yes". It's more the emotional moment, it's not really music, that's wrong. You can do that with bass as well. do that with nothing actually it's just the I need those moments where you want to say yes where you put your hands in the air and the people have tears in their eyes and they want to hug the neighbor on the floor that's that's I need those moments that's very important You mentioned that sometimes tastes have changed over the years. Sometimes things are in, sometimes things are out. How has Jazzanova been in that? And where are they now? I guess it's another good question. By accident we became trendy, I would say. I think that's always the case. If something new comes up, people do it just by accident, not really planned. And then that's the coolest moment, where people say, wow, that's new, that's fresh. We want to do that, like, dubstep. Imagine a dubstep revival in 10 years. Sure. And all the old deaf dubstep DJs come. I mean, it's a weird story with the zeitgeist sometimes. It goes up and down and you have to deal with it somehow. Some people are cool, they just know when they have to be quiet. And some people always run behind the train. And you have the chance to decide. Which are you? Difficult. I mean, I always look what's going on. But our kind of music was always like eclectic. So it always had an open door for new things to come in. And when drum and bass was new, it was obviously also part of our thing. We knew all the drum and bass people as well as the jazzy guys, as well as the hip-hop guys. So I think our kind of scene really helped not being off the track. So it always had a... a connection to what's going on right now and we try to integrate that somehow not always in a production because it somehow makes no sense but I mean that that's the good thing in music it never stops in both directions You always find something old which is new to you, which can inspire you. You always find something new. Do you find that's a pretty rare thing for many of the scenes in Berlin specifically? That they have such an open door to things? I mean, I don't know exactly what's going on there. But I often meet people who don't know me, but I know them. And it shows me that I check like full spectrum artists. because I do radio shows, I need music to roll. I do radio shows in a week and this is four hours of music and not to be bored to death. I have a really high frequency of turtleneck. turnover with music so this could be the reason but it's a difficult it's it's more as a philosophical question if you really like want to be an expert on one thing and you're really like this hardliner are you Yeah, you swing. Tell me about the radio shows that you have. Because obviously radio is, to some people, a dying medium. I don't think you'd get a lot of kids who, like yourself, it was the most, you know, it was a lifeline in a way. Some, of course, but maybe not so much anymore. I mean... I don't know. I do radio now for 15 years. When Jezanova started, I started the first radio show on MDR Sputnik, which is an eastern German station. And then Multikulti in Berlin later, which is now on... one on VDR and one on Radio 1 and I don't know for me radio is a romantic thing I always think I'm sitting there do the radio and outside on the highway is somebody in a car listens to radio which he might like or make a turn in the station but for me it was always like that radio was important. I don't know if it's still that important. I'm afraid no, it is not. But I still know enough people listening to radio. Myself, I just listen to spoken radio, like info radio or something like that. I have too much music around me already. Have your shows changed over the years? Or has it been mostly I can play whatever I want for two hours? Yes, there's one show on WDR, Funkhaus Europa, which is a little bit more DJ orientated. So I play really like DJ. sets more or less more housey uptempo style not only but mostly in the other show we wanted to come up with a new idea so i do it with a friend of mine matthias helwig i know him back from school from the morose days and he's more rocky than me and the jazzy guy is the rocky guy and the concept is that we play us music which we like and sometimes he's like oh that's just too jazzy, that's shit. And then he's playing me some chill wave stuff. I have to say since I do the radio with him, the horizon is even like 30 degrees more for me because he comes up with all those lo-fi producers near in India. Funny enough, I always have people around me which show me something which I like. That's probably why you want to hang out with them. Yeah, probably. Good taste. And the idea of this show is that it's a bit controversial, but at the same time we show that there is a common sense as well. songwriting or where it's coming from. So when we do portraits of artists as well like Arthur Russell, we did a big piece on him. Stuff we like together, we work together. Arthur Russell seems like an obvious. integration a meeting point for those two deans let's talk about Christian Promer and you I recently saw a video of you guys playing at a weekend in Berlin. That was the secret. In which the club was empty at first. That was the rehearsal the first time. It was magically full later on. The guy filmed the whole afternoon and then the night. This is... I rethought this is what you have to do right now. Documentary of everything you do. And it was the first time we played... more or less live. I don't want to call it live. I'd say it's somehow like a live meets DJ thing. Like a project kind of. idea and I mean I know Christian for so long now he was on Compost, Fauna of Cash, Tribi Trio and he was always there and I was there and then we one day we met by accident actually I was on the way to Austria and he we did just stop in Munich and he played me a tune, Strings of Life, which he did just as a joke. Which has become his career now, basically. I said, "Okay, man, I want to release that." He said, "No, nobody wants to do it." And, "Are you sure?" And I said, "Yeah, please do it, and then you will see it will be a big thing." So he gave it to us, we released it, and we sold like on vinyl something like 6,000. 12 inches of the tune these days is huge these days it's huge and then I called him okay you do a whole album like this now so we started to work together and it was a good combination of label artists that fit perfectly. Yeah, and then one day he was in Berlin and I was like, oh, you have to show me something, how the Ableton Live works. I was into it and I just got it from Ableton. And because he's a teacher, he teaches that on schools. like Logic, Ableton Live, all that. He's really the fastest engineer I know. Like, you tell him something and then it's there. And I gave him a sample, like, for instance, yeah, what would you do out of it? Can you warp it or whatever? And he was like: "Yeah, you do it like this, this, this, this." And I was like: "Wow, that's easy!" But it wasn't so easy, but it looked easy. So in one afternoon we did one song. And I was like: "Wow, that's a cool song!" I mean, that was quick. We should do it again! So I was always into sample digging since years and in Jazzanova there was the music moved on on another stage they went live working with musicians no samples anymore and the samples they used were like self recorded. So I had tons of ideas in sample format on the table. I said, why not bring it to Christian? So we did an appointment for four days to meet and do some songs. And I went there and I think finally we did. 12 songs and 2 remixes one for Jamie Lloyd Australian guy one for Incarnations Phenomena and Gladband and 11 songs in 12 days wow and is it the much faster than working with Jazzanova. Yeah, Jazzanova was... the way of working is totally different. It's much more accurate and more... details and stuff but for DJ music generally you don't need to tune the hi-hat for 40 minutes and we thought okay that's a good way of working not staying too long on one thing just try to move on the way he works and the way I think of using samples. fitted perfectly. It was almost like he did something with that sample and I was like "Shit, I know another one which could fit" and then it was like "Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang" So every day we did more or less one tune and then we thought "Okay, who...?" We wanted to have some singers here and there but... I tried to record some guidelines for the singers but then we decided that I sing because it was already quite interesting. It was different, not super duper singing but it fitted somehow. Have you sang very much? Never, never. So finally your Morrissey dreams are coming true. No. But the good thing is if you want to sound like somebody, it's easier to sing. And all the songs on the... album I wanted to sound like something I had in mind inspired by a whole record. So for the first track on the album or whatever who did you want to sound like? Who are some of the singers? Actually the first track we did on the album is also now the first track on the album. I wanted to sound like the guy who was on the original track because of the cover version. So that's an easy one. Can't you see the sun? Can't you see it glow? Can't you see the rain turning into snow? Can't you see the clouds? They are the show pictures of the sea. Can't you see the sun? Can't you see it glow? Can't you see the rain turning into snow? Can't you see the clouds that are pictures of the sea? Tell me about the label as far as the day to day. What are you doing exactly nowadays? I think some people notice that there's a bigger break right now because we had some problems financially. internal problems just move on like it was and we had to more or less stop it when the when the Jazzanova album came there was so much to do outside of Sonar Collective that it wasn't fair to just move on and let it flow so we decided okay we do a little cut here and see when it's the best moment to get on again which is difficult to come to this point because it's an ego thing, definitely. I mean, that's our baby. We had so many artists and releases. and to say to the people, you know what, we have to take it easy. That made it somehow very hard for us. This decision was tough to make. And obviously all the artists are not so happy about it. How many releases do you think probably... altogether were not able to get come out that were kind of perhaps scheduled to come out no no no nothing we really worked it out for one year slowly you knew that yeah yeah we knew before On the other hand I have so many interesting projects like flying around from back in the day all these artists have to move on and it will be probably easy to to restart again but it was the the old problem of labels in kind of middle size. You're not a one man show which works and you're not a major with a lot of money in the background. You have this cash flow problem and therefore you have to be logistic genius to make everything work. thing happen and make every artist happy. I think that's the under recognized type of label that is really struggling in this economic environment because as you say one person labels very easy and there's very very there's not much expectation anyway. Majors, of course, they're hemorrhaging money, but they still have to pay. have it available but these kind of big kind of if your last release bombs it could actually you know totally take out the company yes and we we were successful fighting against it for 10 years because the first five, six years were more or less easy for us. We had a big exposure and every record, even if it was okay. sometimes not really my thing, sold 3,000 copies. So when you start your label in a period like this, where even an average record sells 3,000, And then you have to deal with the situation and try to keep it there, but it's not possible actually. That's really bad. I mean, you have to adapt very quickly, which is actually possible to do that, but you don't want to. You want to stay there. It's weird. I mean, when you look back, the Jezanova really started as a... DJ Starling with all the remixes. I remember being in a music magazine back in the day on number one and number three with remixes. And they were different and that's why they were noticed. And this is the biggest lesson somehow. because people find you when you are different. When you're swimming downstream with thousands, you're one of the swimmers in this big river. And if you swim to the other direction, it's easier. This is the one guy there, which is crazy, but he's... strong because he goes in the other direction and that helps us always because we We were driving down the big street named "Haus" or "Club Music" but we drove a really weird car. And this is what I believe in. So when I do music or when I release music on a label, on a new or on an old label, then it should be a bit different just to be... yeah... or to have the possibility. to be noticed. What label you put the... My own label. My own label. And what is that called? You can't know because it's the first release. It's called Derwent Recordings. It's inspired by a restaurant in France where I have my vacation always. It's an old school crepe restaurant with amazing quality. And you can't pay with credit card, it's really old school, you can't do reservations, you just have to queue up. do all of these things somehow relate to the music in your mind? They relate to the music. A bit old school but quality. So what I've noticed like you have people just buying digital, some people just buy charts of other people, some people just buy vinyl and they are like thousands of... possibilities and ways how to consume music and what brings the people together is always a classic feel. If it's a download or a record, if it has something which you can't go around it, you have to have it in any... and I think this classic moment is the key for me in music where what I try to produce on the dance floor as well as in the studio to create the... neat. For me, when I started to discover house music during the 90s, I bought a lot of records which I didn't play back then. But I had the feeling, okay, this gives me something. I can't play, people wouldn't. follow me this way because it's maybe too far out or too different to what I play normally but I needed to to be with me somehow and to give me inspiration maybe for the next step or next little excursion. And you find yourself playing them three, six, nine years down the road and you're like "Oh wow, I have that!" Yeah, I remember getting that Talking Loud test pressing of Arthur Russell. the light famous tune he had it signed for Talking Loud back then and he had test pressings and he gave it to me and I was listening to it and I was like I don't know I can't play this there's something about it I listen and listen over and over again I was in a shelf and every month I was like listening again and then suddenly... I think that's normal. You explore your ways of listening, your kind, and you land sometimes somewhere which you never would have thought of before. really where have you landed lately I guess neon Indian is your landing no actually I'm learning. The good thing I never learned really. Because it's... I never thought that I could be into new rave music really. I liked it as a teenager, Human League and stuff like that. But... I never thought that it comes back so heavily on what I do. and it has nothing to do with all the stuff around it. It's just... Gerd Jansson gave me once a record or a suggestion for a record called "Schock" like a new wave band from the UK, middle of 80s. And this was one of those records which opened a door and I was like gone for years again. Exploring these things and find out that there's a lot of good stuff and soulful stuff as well. And that was very, very good. It's always like people give me one... record or i know that's there or when i'm in the shop for instance and when i sometimes on the road I'm really looking forward to Australia because I have a lot of spare days and free days and there's one record shop which is always very good. And you don't want to name it. Yeah, it's called Revolve in Sydney. And I always find stuff which I never heard before and never saw before. And there's always something. For instance, when I go to a record shop and the dealer asks me, what are you looking for? I say, I don't know. Probably look for the things I don't know. Because not only my profession, it's really like a passion for me to get new music and be inspired by them again for, I don't know, it's a restless thing, it never stays, it's always close. Maybe when I'm older I will be like... It's enough now. Bye.
