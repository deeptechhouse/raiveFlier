Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. When it comes to club culture, Terry Farley has been there, done it, and bought the 12-inch. He was dressing like a punk before the punks, and was dancing to Rare Groove before it was a revivalist scene. Later, he was partly responsible for the first article ever written about Acid House, and the first outdoor house music rave in the UK. This was all a preamble to an astonishing run in the 90s, as part of the boyzone in the 90s. and Junior Boyzone collectives, he helped discover the likes of Andrew Wetherall, The Chemical Brothers, Underworld, and Express 2, all while maintaining a notable production career with Pete Heller. In conversation with Stephen Titmuss, Farley relayed his colorful past and weighed in on the state of London's contemporary house music scene. Terry, would it be fair to say you've had around 35 years in the house music trenches? Well, in the clubbing trenches, yeah. I mean, I think I was about kind of 10 when I decided records was a big thing for me. My mum took me to Shepherd's Bush Market. And we bought a Georgie Fame record called Bonnie and Clyde. And my mum was quite young, she was about 24. And she was a mod and she taught me how to dance. Amazing. And she told me not to tell my dad, though, because he was against young boys dancing. He thought it was kind of a bit, let's say, foppish. And I would end up being, you know, not on the straight. a narrow so to speak well I'm sure your dad would get a shock later on in years to come when he was out doing all sorts but we'll get to that we'll get to that later but I just wanted to ask you a question about now because I feel you're in a quite good place to answer this what do you think of the house music scene in London today you know you've been through all these changes You had a lot of history. What do you think, what kind of point is it in now? Well, I mean, first of all, I don't think there is a house music scene in London. I don't, you know, I think it's a, we're a big city. I mean, even in, even in. The golden period of 88, 89, 90, when there was millions of people out on a Monday night, Tuesday night, Wednesday night, Thursday night, there was never a house scene. There was several house scenes, and I think we're exactly like that now. There's loads of really good clubs and parties that cater for all types of people. and very rarely do they actually cross over. And that's just simply because I think London's such a big place. I mean, it's a bit of a shame if you go to, you know, even a city like Manchester, you know, the house scene in Manchester or Leeds would be a better example. The house scene would be much more kind of inclusive and they would all know each other, whereas in London we tend to... you know, be kind of quite insular. But I do think, to answer your question, I think we're in one of them explosion years. They come every kind of five or six years when things go really quiet and then all of a sudden it all picks up. Something new comes along, whether it's kind of a new, you know, a new style of music or someone suddenly decides like... Lazy Dog did. We're going to open a Sunday afternoon club in, you know, 1999. And people are like, oh, my God, Sunday afternoon, who's going to go? You know, queues around the block. And the next minute, you know, kind of Italian kids. in London, Open Vertigo at the Cross, and suddenly we had something going. We had a Sunday scene starting, which is still going now. And we're in that explosive times now, but there's really kind of a lack of venues. There's a real lack of spaces for people to go into. um losing so many clubs in in a short space of time turn mills the key the cross um you know these places all went really quickly and they haven't been replaced um i'm rather surprised because there's a lot of money to be made in dancing and clubbing. Well, it wasn't as though any of those clubs were doing badly when they shut. No, they were all doing well. They all sold up simply because of gentrification, regeneration, and the land basically being made. an offer they couldn't refuse in the case of The End and Turnmills. Both of them places, funnily enough, I mean, I drove past Turnmills the other day and their building, which looks like a kind of block of flats and it's actually called Turnmills. And I thought, oh God. Well. Going back in time, though, and maybe the start is a good place to start. What was the first club you ever went to in London? The first club I ever went to in London was a club in Wardle Street called Crackers, which was a disco pub in a basement on the corner of Oxford Street. I think now it's a Peter Stringfeller establishment. and you went downstairs. It was a basement bar, and they had a tiny dance floor, a really loud sound system that was really tinny, and a small wooden floor. And there was a DJ there who worked there seven days a week called Mark Roman. He was the only person who played there. There was no warm-up DJ. There was no specialist DJ. He played the whole night. And on different nights, he played different music. And on a Tuesday night, he played imported black funk and disco coming in from America. And it was really hard to get into. It was very black. The people there were a mixture of really good dancers. There was no one over 18 in there. Most people were underage. How old were you? I was 16. And a lot of kids were younger than me. There was no such thing as an ID. No one had ever asked for an ID. People ask your age, and if you've got the date right, you got in. And then he started a Friday lunchtime session. which attracted an even younger audience. This was kind of 1976. And the club probably held 500 people. And for about two, three years, every Friday lunchtime from, and we had terrible licensing laws then, to get into this place for... For people to be able to dance in there, they had to sell food. So they gave everyone who went in a little voucher that got you sausage and chips in a basket. So the place stunk of sausage and chips. Did anyone eat the sausage and chips? Well, funnily enough, a lot of the kids in there. I mean, you know, it's... I suppose very much sign of times, mid-70s, you know, a lot of the kids in there were young and a lot of the kids, maybe it was the only meal they got a day. I mean, there were kids going around asking, you know, if you're not having that, I'll have that, you know. And it was a bit sad because I did see people, you know, put the food in bags and take it home with them. But anyway, so you would have 500 kids in there from 12 to 2.30 on a Friday lunchtime. Most bunking off school, some bunking off college. And Sir Martin's School of Fashion was just around the corner. So a lot of the fashion kids and designers would come in. So you had a really nice mix of kind of ghetto kids, I suppose you'd call them now. And fashion kind of fashionistas and people who, most of the crowd who would go on to become the Blitz kids were kind of in there, but they were in their first year at St. Martin's. So what was the music at Crackers like? It was really raw. It was started off as funk. 75, which, and then it would be things like Ohio players, the Blackbirds, Donald Bird. And then kind of, as kind of things changed around 76, it got a lot more disco-y and you'd get like the Southside Orchestra, be a lot of. Big orchestral tracks were big there. Quite camp. MFSB. There was a... Although a lot of the kids were kind of, as I say, kind of ghetto, and afterwards there would be a lot of thieving going on up and down Oxford Street by the... the very large group of kids going in there a lot of people used to go into um Debenhams and kind of have open up their adidas bags and throw in bottles you know loads of bottles of aftershave uh aramis in brute to sell you know the next day in some market um but it was quite a kind of gay vibe in there as well um I think it was one of them clubs that was one of the only clubs in the West End at that time where you could dress weird, you could be gay, you could be black, you didn't have to, you know, you could be underaged and you was okay. Out on the street and around the rest of London. And, you know, standing out and being different, you know, could get you a good kick in, actually. So interestingly, at that time, you said it had a big fashion element. Were you attracted towards that element? Did you get the clothes? Oh, absolutely. I was obsessed. I mean, every Saturday afternoon, every kind of soul boy in London would walk up and down the King's Road. It was a kind of tradition. And you would actually get kids coming in from all over the country to Victoria coach station on the kind of early coaches. And they would get off and there would be like, you know, a coach from South Wales and you see all these kids dressed up. kind of like in American 1950s clothes. There'd be coaches coming from Derby, just from all over the country. I suppose all these places where kids didn't fit in, you know, and then they could come to London, they could come to the King's Ride, walking up and down and feel part of kind of a movement that would later become punk. but didn't have a name, didn't have any punk clubs, didn't have any punk records. So most of these kids went to soul clubs because, as I say, they were safe havens. And, yeah, we used to frequent Don Letts' shop, Acme Attractions, and used to try and go into Sex, which was Vivian Westwood's store. But Jordan, who was kind of that woman who was used to stand with her sex pistols dressed in Nazi regalia in a rubber bikini, she was always on the door. And, you know, as a 16-year-old from kind of the suburbs, I find it kind of scary. And it was very expensive as well, the clothes in sex. I've got friends of mine who bought those clothes then for, you know, £25 a shirt, which was a week, two weeks wages, who have managed to sell them onto Japanese collectors now for like two grand. So even then they... were kind of works of art. The whole thing was very inclusive. I mean, you could spot people, you know, very much a tribe thing in the 70s and 80s, which you don't get that now. You know, people go, oh, you know, East London hipsters, and they're very sneering as that. But it's just people really dressing up, you know. You can't tell, you know, a Dalston hipster from a... from a Wembley hipster, you know, but back then you could actually tell people from what clubs they went to, you know, even within the soul world, you know, people who went to crackers dressed different from the ones who went to. you know, other clubs maybe outside of the West End. So it's very much the beginnings of the punk scene came from the soul scene. You said your dad didn't like it when you danced to records. What did he make of it when you were wearing all the gear? Well, I remember once my friend Gary Hazeman, who had a pop record actually, but with a record called We Call It. Acid with Demob which was kind of went to the pop charts And I think it's one of the first English Acid House records. Actually got banned by the BBC. The BBC banned Acid House. We should always remember this when Radio 1 go on about Radio 1 Big Weekender and all that. Actually, Radio 1 banned Acid House when Acid House was actually relevant. And he knocked on my door and he had a pair of... big red 1950s sparkly peg trousers with like a glitter thread going through, plastic shoes, and I believe a 1950s kind of Billy Fury shirt. And my dad's face was a picture. And he actually, when I got home, I had to explain to him that. Gary was not a homosexual. He's actually having sex with more women because of how he dressed. Well, more women, more young girls, how he dressed. than anyone else I knew and it was just a fashion but you know dads that's dads just moving on like obviously Crackers was a very important club for London's club scene in the early days but that kind of soul and funk scene eventually exploded and went national with I guess the popularity of jazz funk and it very much blew up. What did you think of the music then and the scene then as that moved on? Well, it's like anything, I suppose. I mean, some of the people who I remember at Crackers were people like Norman Jay, Cole Cox, Jazzy B. Practically every kind of DJ who... would have been around kind of in the early house scene in London was part of the soul scene. Paul Oakenfold, Trevor Fung, you know, they were all soul boys. It's like anything. At first, it's great, and it's great when you're dancing. and then there's 500 of you and you can walk up and down the road and you can spot someone who looks like you and you give them a little nod and they give you a nod and then the next year there's 5,000 and then the next year they're putting on all dayers for 15,000 people. There was an Aldea, I think there was a festival last summer that Eastern Electrics did, which was exactly where they did the National Soul Day Aldea in 1982. And they had 25,000 people there dancing to DJs. And kind of, you know, we kind of... I think all the people who I knew kind of said that, you know, that's the end of that, you know. And probably, you know, it's probably like, you know, it's probably those of 18-year-old people into house now who kind of, you know, look around and go, ooh, we're all these like... Wally's come from and Nobe's come from who are kind of, you know, invading my space and, you know, taking pictures of each other and everything that everyone gets annoyed about, you know, we got annoyed about, you know, then. So it's nothing new. I mean, it's just, you know, you have dips, you have explosions and you have... Then you have years where you think you're the only person in London who's still playing house music. And then everyone's playing house music. You know, I DJed the other week in Edinburgh and I played a really old David Morales remix of Maria Carey, Dream Lover. It kind of sounds new. It sounds new. And a kid come up to me, you know, asking what it was. And I told him it was Maria Carey and he wrote it in his phone and he went away. And at the end of the night, I was in the toilet and he come up to me and he goes, you know, house music. He goes, even Maria Carey's jumping on the bandwagon now. And I was like, yeah, yeah. He goes, I'm going to buy that record. tomorrow and I went yeah yeah good this guy called Davey Morales some new young cat yeah exactly yeah and the record's only like you know 20 25 years old or whatever you know so so obviously that that was um an interesting point and I guess though with those weekenders it's something that's not really ever talked about in so much as that they I guess these big dance music events it's not really Often the press doesn't really associate them with the house music events that were going on. Basically, the reason house music was able to explode the way it did in 88 was because of the infrastructure that had already been laid by... the house scene and and and especially under the soul scene and especially when kind of from about 84 the warehouse scene in London really took over so people who were doing soul clubs before then started doing soul warehouse parties soul to soul were doing warehouse parties. Norman Jay was doing shake and finger warehouse parties. And people like Noel and Morris Watson were doing the D-Mob party warehouse scene. And they were going to New York a lot as well and knew Larry Levan really well. So they were coming back. This is about 85. And they were coming back playing records that he was playing at the garage. were a lot more up-tempo. They weren't house records, stuff on Sleeping Bag and stuff like Dinosaur L and Weekends, you know, the original Class Action Weekends, which Todd Terry covered in 88. And suddenly, you know, people were kind of trying to emulate what was going on in New York. without actually have been there. You know, we had magazines like The Face. It was very, very influential. And you could actually go to America very cheap in the early 80s. There was a guy called Freddie Laker come along and did flights to New York. for, I mean, probably the equivalent now of about 100 quid. And loads of clubbers were going. I mean, I personally didn't go, but I have loads of friends who jumped on a plane just to go to the Paradise Garage. And there were other people like Norman Jay and Bobby and Steve who were part of that zoo crowd who actually chartered planes. uh in the mid 80s and took a whole plane to new york of like you know club kids and they did the dance material they did the garage they and um and bought loads of kind of you know levi's 501s that you couldn't get air in trainers that you couldn't get you know in england at that time almost like the european kind of joint joint to ibiza that people do nowadays yeah very much so very much so it was like the grand tour amazing so i guess in that kind of mid 80s period in london um It feels like, compared to Manchester at least, house music was slower to take off in London. Do you think that's because that funk, rare groove, warehouse scene was so strong? I think there's loads of factors. I think the fact that London, like I said to you about the actual scene in London now, about there isn't a house scene. There's, you know, 10. There wasn't a club scene in London in 1986. There was dozens of club scenes. And some of them played house. I was DJing for a crew called the Raid Club. And we did parties at the 100 Club, the WAG. a warehouse part is in Wapping and I was the warm-up DJ and the other two DJs were Pete Tong and Paul Oakenfold who were both kind of relatively unknown Pete Tong was kind of known as a Kent DJ on the Soul jazz thing but he was very much i think into playing modern music and kind of been cast aside by the elders of the they were called the soul mafia at the time chris seal and robbie vincent and i think you know he was kind of cast aside by you know for trying to play hip-hop and house And Paul Oakenfold was actually working for Def Jam Records. And he had a little office in Acton. And we were certainly playing house. Nolan Morris moved Delirium to heaven on a Thursday night. in 87 and had Frankie Knuckles as resident the whole summer. So there was house stuff going on, but it was kind of sporadic. You know, you would go to warehouse parties and to be quite honest with you, there was two, 3000 people, a lot of these places and most of them wanted the, the big tune. You know, which were the Jackson sisters, I Believe in Miracles and Maceo and the Max across the tracks and Dougie Fresh the show and the Beastie Boys. It was... It was kind of one of those things that's a victim of its own success, you know, where a scene kind of, again, explodes. There was a huge explosion when the warehouse thing took hold in London. And you could go to Trafalgar Square at like five, six in the morning, and there'd be hundreds, hundreds of kids all trying to get home to the suburbs. You know, no one had a car, no one had money for a taxi in those days. And there wasn't like nowadays, you don't, you know, there's no such thing as a bloke outside going, I'll take you home for a tenner. You know, there was no, that didn't happen either. So people would kind of walk back to Trafalgar Square and wait for the first bus home. And it was a big explosion of it. House was played, but I think it's like Manchester, You know, we had house, but they're talking about, you know, one or two clubs. I mean, you know, there was at least five or six clubs in London playing house, but then we had 500 clubs, which wasn't, you know, so it's very hard to say. I think that, you know, the house explosion in London was a direct. result of the the ib from club culture that came back um that had the whole package had the had the chemistry set yeah i've read you say that before that you know obviously the likes of you know rampling and cohorts didn't obviously invent anything but they did come with the package together the dance the drugs the clothes yeah that's what really sold it to london i mean i mean To be honest with you, the two people who actually deserve the credit for this are Trevor Fung and a guy, I think it's his cousin, a guy called Ian St. Paul, who actually were... the ones who brought, got Danny and Trevor, the rest of them to go over for a birthday party. And they had actually started, they had actually been at Tribine for a couple of years, seen what was going on, wanted to recreate it. And they had actually opened a club in San Anne. where they were playing themselves. But of course, you know, kind of history gets kind of, you know, rewritten and it gets rewritten so many times that, you know, it's kind of as gospel. But, yeah, I mean, you know, people like a package, you know. As we're talking about when I said to you about, you know, kind of 1976 walking down the road, I could tell who was that. Nowadays, if I walk down, let's say, Shoreditch High Street, I couldn't really tell you who was in. You know, if you said to someone. Does he like techno or does he like kind of, you know, deep house or does he like soulful house or does he like hip hop? you kind of could say it looks like he goes clubbing, but that's about it. Even if they're wearing like a band t-shirt, it might not tell you because they might be wearing it ironically. Exactly. So it doesn't really tell you nowadays. There isn't really a kind of a, there is a look, but that kind of look is everyone's got it. And the house, when the house thing broke, there was a brand new look. I mean, you know, I can distinctly remember. you know, going out. And we were doing a raid club party in 87 in Marble Arch, in a big hotel, in a basement in Marble Arch. And a load of guys turned. Funnily enough, me and Andrew Weatherall were actually... doing the door we we weren't we weren't dj'ing we were we were doing the door turning people away because back no you know it was like first come first serve but you know if you didn't look right you didn't look and i remember a load of guys come up to the door who I kind of knew who they were, but I didn't know them, and they knew who I was. And they were all kind of dressed like hippies. And I had kind of long hair, and I was like, oh, you know, you're not going to like it. We were all kind of dressed in that kind of Duffer St. George kind of style with like Baker Boy caps. You know, and that kind of big MA1 jacket. It's very kind of London warehouse, Buffalo look, I think it was called at the time. And we turned them away. And, you know, and about two months later, I got dragged to Shum, which was like, I think the second week of Shum. And they were all in there dressed in exactly the same clothes. And I was like, oh, my God. You know what I mean? You know, and not only did I kind of, that was a massive kind of, you know. up on my point of view and I actually because I've always thought I've kind of pretty much on top of things especially then and but this look was you know everyone in the club had this look Everyone had on Converse, everyone had on Lee Dungarees, people with like just growing their hair so little kind of top knots and tie and dye stuff and old jumpers, big baggy jumpers that were like you know a foot too long in the arm and all doing the D.I.B. for dance. Everyone doing this dance. You had a smoke machine, you had strobes. you had the DJ, who was Danny, actually dancing. You know, which like, you know, the DJs before, there was a very much kind of, the DJ before house music was very much a selector in the sense of a reggae DJ, it selects records, you know. So he would be playing records. There wasn't kind of, people didn't. didn't really mix because they played a wide variety. You know, people would play a jazz record next to it. to a funk record and the tempos could be, you know, 30 BPMs in between. So there was no kind of mixing going on. And to see Danny kind of, you know, dancing around, waving this record above his head and everyone kind of doing a similar dance, you just kind of went, right, well, this is a scene. This is new. You know, house music on its own. They were just records and they weren't enough to kind of create something like we got now. I mean, you know, what we have now and the fact that we have 18-year-old kids, you know, buying house music wouldn't have happened without what happened in Ibiza because, you know, house music would have just kind of, I think, just fizzled out. I think you need that kind of combustion and that kind of madness that creates a real passion that stays with people forever, you know, and people try to recreate them. nights uh and new promoters who come on look look at you know films and videos and they write this is what i want you know and uh so everyone's always striving for uh to create something really good so when was your first trip to the balearic islands um well i i went to the i went to ib for first in 1981 with some friends. But I had no, to be honest with you, I had no idea we were in San Antonio, which actually wasn't like San Antonio now. It was quite cool and they had some really nice clubs that were a mile was away from the sweaty little kind of, you know, basements I was used to in London. with really nice sound systems, good-looking girls, and drinks that didn't come in a plastic glass. So I loved it. But no one told me Amnesia and Coup were up this road that kind of went south. I sadly I missed out on that until, until 88. And we went, we went to the opening, um, 1988. So have you been back there recently? Um, twice this year. Yeah. What do you make of it nowadays? Oh, well, it's just life, isn't it? You know, it's, it's, um, I think. I think there's some really good things in IB for Steel. I think it's a great place to go and visit. There's some great parties, but there's just such a kind of deluge of greed that is completely unnecessary and completely counterproductive to... to what we all want, which is for this kind of, you know, for House and our scene to go on long after we've, you know, we're dead or... Or we've given up. You know, we no longer, you know, and I think that the clubs, the DJs who take these ridiculous fees, which only means that, you know, someone's got to pay for it. And that person paying for it is, you know, is the general punter who, you know, leaves the island skint. and can't afford to come back again or it leaves him with a dirty taste in his mouth and he says, fuck it, you know, I'm not going back there again. It feels unsustainable, you know, obviously in one of the biggest recessions we've probably experienced in the last hundred years that prices are so sky high in Ibiza and they're still trying to attract a very young crowd. We would probably... have got the highest levels of unemployment. I think it's Ibiza and Premier League football. And you just think, my God, you know, it just goes up and up and up. It is unsustainable. You know, Ibiza doesn't have the luxury of having a Sky or a BT willing to pay £900 million to film it live. And it will burst. I mean, to be honest with you, it's already, you know, just because we have a packed club. doesn't mean that the balloons burst. It just means there's a load of people there who have got loads of money. Those people, I would suggest, are not house heads. They're not the sort of people who go... The people who would go to a good house club in England, I think they're, you know, by and large, they're people who are just out there larging it and going to Pasha and sitting in the VIP at Pasha is what we do, you know, and they're willing to drop £1,000 on a weekend or two grand during the week. But they're not going to, you know, they're not going to come back. and go, oh, look, you know, um, It's a really good night at Dawson's Superstore or like, you know, Summer Show's on at the Dance Tunnel. Let's go to that, you know. So by and large, you know, all they really do is they help these sort of people is they help create the prices going up because people say, you know, they're spending the money. People have got the money. People have, but they're not house people. You know, we've replaced, it's very much like football if you look at it. You know, Stamford Bridge and the Emirates is packed, but it's not packed with Chelsea and Arsenal fans. It's packed with customers. It's packed with tourists who come here and buy, you know, half the tickets where I sit, I have a season ticket, half the seats near me are owned by touts. You know, they buy them at the beginning of the season and they sell them match by match. So you have different people sitting there. Half the time, people are on their phone, you know, or they're taking pictures or they're waving at someone else. They're not Chelsea fans. They're not Arsenal fans. I suggest that most of the people at Space and at Pasha and at these big Ibiza clubs that are charging 60 euros are not house people. They're just kind of random oligomakers. So tell me about Boyzone. It was a fanzine that you set up. How did all that come about? And can you tell everyone about that? I was living in Slough at the time, which is kind of west of London. I moved out of London with my mum. There was a few, Slough, quite a big soul boy town. Most of the people living in Slough were second generation London families who had been moved out because of slum clearance and bomb clearance, site clearance in the 60s when they started to tidy up all the places that had been blown up by the Germans. So there was a big kind of dance culture in Slough and Windsor, which was a nearby town, was kind of a bit more kind of upmarket and had like a kind of really nice pub culture. And they were quite kind of, whereas the kids in Slough were mods, let's say, let's modern day mods. They were the kind of the hippies, I would say. And we met Weverill, basically. Not calling him a hippie because he'd get the ump. But he was kind of alternative, let's say that. And Simon Eccles, who has also become part of Boyzone, who up until recently owned XOYO. And he owns the Griffin in Shoreditch. And we met and we were hanging out together. And fanzines were kind of a big deal in the 80s. And I just said, we should do a fanzine. There is no fanzine for people like us. you know, who kind of was into records, into going to football matches, into buying clothes, into expensive trainers, all the kind of things that... everyone's into now. There was, you know, we kind of was like, we should do something like that. And we started this fanzine called Boyzone. And we sold it around London. A lot of our friends at that time were shop workers, people they worked in down the Kings Row, robot. Reese and American Classics. So they just sold them for, we never really sold that many, you know, about 1,500. And we did about 12. And we just happened to be there when kind of acid house broke. And Paul Oakenfold wrote an article. called Bermondsey Goes Balearic, which I actually typefaced myself and I scratched them because we had the thing and spelt Balearic wrong. And it's still there to this day. I said it's like Balearic as in Eric. And he actually... said that he wrote this article and it basically was the first ever article written about ib for acid house and he wouldn't let me put his name on it because it mentioned drugs in there and um at that time you know people who worked in the music industry if you kind of mention drugs my god it was you know terrible i mean the fact that all the bosses were doing coke kind of you know, gallon by the, you know, by the mountain of it, uh, was he even there or there. Um, and, um, and we just did a couple of parties. We did a couple of very small parties with me and Andrew playing. Uh, Andrew used to play really weird records. He used to play this kind of orchestral version of the six, four, seven, or, uh, from, from kind of old British film about bomber command. and then he used to turn the smoke machine on, smoke the smokes out, play this kind of British war film thing, and then we would be thrown off. It happened on several occasions. The club owner would just throw us off. How many times did it take for him to do that before you said to him, No, no, no. Well, that was the point. The more it annoyed people, the more he did it. His cantankerous reputation is well-deserved. And the fact that now, you know, he's even more cantankerous in his old age comes from them building blocks of... of what he was like then. And we were just there kind of in the right place at the time. Me and Andrew started playing at Shum for Danny. And then Paul Oakenfold opened Spectrum on a Monday night. And it went from 120 people in there the first week. Everyone was given a free ecstasy tablet on walking through the door. in a venue that held 3,000. And within about six weeks, they were, I'm told, in so much money to the owners that it was all going to go kaput. And it was almost like, fuck, this acid house thing hasn't happened. Everyone thought it was going to happen. You know, we all thought it was going to be huge. And it just not happened. And then I walked up there, I think the sixth or seventh week with my records, and there was a thousand people outside Charing Cross on a Monday night at 10 o'clock waiting to get in. And then it just went on there for two years, every Monday night, two, three thousand people. Police roadblock. on the Charing Cross Road afterwards, people dancing. As the police were doing, you know, would turn their sirens on and the whole crowd would dance to the siren. And people, you'd get kids on top of the police car and the police would be arresting people left, right and centre. I mean, it was totally madness. But most of the kids going there. you know, they went there on a Monday and half of them just give their jobs up. You know, half of them went on to open record stores, start clothes companies. start record labels, become DJs. That kind of nine to five that everyone had been doing, you know, pretty drudgery jobs, you know, Acid House opened people up to the extent of where, you know, practically... Everything you can think of in the 90s that was creative stemmed from them first few months of 88 in the spring. In terms of Boyzone, obviously that was very early, successful early on. When did you start turning that more into the record label, Boyzone and Junior Boyzone? Well, Pete Tong offered us a deal with FFRR. Boys' Own, me, Andrew, and Pete Heller, who at the time was playing a guitar at Shum over the records. At Shum, Danny kind of had this thing about people playing live instruments over records and pete could play the guitar there was another guy who played bongos and i think there was another guy who played trumpet and it was just kind of very random and very kind of did it sound good um i think at the time but they were very good pills um and pete had a drum machine pete had a tiny little 808 drum machine and um I'd never been in a studio. Andrew had never been in a studio. None of us could play an instrument. And Pete said, go make, you know, Pete told him, go make a record. We had a girl called Hannah, a very young girl, was about 17, who was kind of hanging around the boys' own kind of parties and that. So she kind of sounded punky. We went into the studio in, I think it was Acton. That was £800 a day. We spent two weeks in there on full catering. At one point, I think there was like 20 of our mates in there. ordering bacon sandwiches. We wanted to sample Jesus on the Payroll, the Thrashing Doves, the piano start that was a big Alfredo Ibiza record. And then someone came up with the idea of, no, we'll get someone to replay it. Who can we get? I don't know. We'll get a session player in. This guy turned up who could play piano, but we didn't have a piano. So we ordered a mini grand piano that was delivered from another studio at ridiculous expense. And we made this record that was Bocca Juniors, Raze. We did a video. People want a... to look online you can still find a video it's quite fun it's loads of people with long curly hair and baggy trousers and baggy clothes running around primrose hill um and it was kind of the talk of the town it was the talk of the balearic network um which kind of meant sadly about a thousand people and it flopped terribly um and we made another record um we released a few singles by other people uh one was a band called less stress um we released um a single by Jar Wobble, a big reggae thing called Bomba. And everyone loved them. I mean, you know, they were being wrote about in the NME, you know, as if these were the future of like dance music. But most of the country was just going around mad to Strings of Life. You know, this kind of was, we were in the wrong place at the wrong time. A year later, I remixed Rope for Luck with Paul Oakenfold for the Happy Mondays. Andrew did Primal Scream. And then I did The Farm. And these records, you know, them records kind of had a scene ready then. but our kind of attempt was at least a year too early. Obviously that success that kicked on with yourself and Andrew. It actually wasn't a success. This is what I'm trying to say. We was a huge flop. But the remixes were, right? Yeah, the remixes were, but London actually dropped us. So London dropped us and then Steve Hall. who was a friend of ours who had been working for British Airways. We got him to run the label and London Records were paying him. And when we were dropped, he said to me, you know, why don't we start a label? And at the time, John Paul Gaultier was kind of like loads of people at Shimmel wearing like John Paul Gaultier stuff and all that. It kind of become very fashion again. And he had a little label called Junior, Junior Gaultier. So I said, let's call it Junior Boys Own then. And we just do house records. We're ditched the kind of... of Balearic kind of idea. And me and Pete started, we made a record called In Your Bones, which was basically an idea that at that time we were getting loads of cassettes sent over from New York of Tony Humphrey's WBLS New York show. No internet, no way of hearing anything except someone taping it in their bedroom in New York and putting it in an envelope and sending it across and then you'd get them. And he had a big jingle that went, Tony Humphries, putting the beats in your bones. So I was like, am I going to make a record like that? And we got this guy called JC, who was a gay rapper, part of that trade crew. And he did a kind of rap that was, you know, got the beat, beat, beating your bones, bones, bones. And everyone loved it. And it was great. And suddenly people in America started, oh, your record's a... the radio in America and you know Junior Vasquez is playing your record and Andrew who didn't come to the label he started his own label Sabres of Paradise He actually brought in the tape to the office and he said, I was DJing in Manchester last night. Some kids give me this tape, a little C90 cassette. It's really good. You should release it. And we put it on and it was the Chemical Brothers and they were called the Dust Brothers. He tried to call himself the Dust Brothers. And we had this track, Song of the Siren, which we put out. then we had someone from America calling up saying, Hey motherfuckers, you know, some hip hop group, you know, where the dust brothers, uh, you know, you can't be the dust brothers. So they actually address you as motherfuckers. Uh, well, I never took the call, but I'm trying to, I'm trying to, I'm trying to elaborate. Um, and the next single that they actually put, we're putting out was called chemical beats. So why don't you call yourself chemical brothers And then Darren Emerson, who was like a young kid, he was about 17, playing on a Monday night in Nicky Holloway's milk bar. On a Monday night, he was doing a part called the Recession Session. It was about free to get in. He'd come into the office and told Steve Hall that he was working with some band. who wanted to kind of have a new dance kind of direction, who were underwhelmed. And then we had two young kids, Rocky and Diesel, who was warm-up DJs at Boyzone, who wanted to make a record. They made a record with Ashley Beadle. And what do you think of it? Yeah, it's great. Let's make a name up. And I made the name Express 2 up, and we put that out. And, I mean, we were selling. I mean, the Express 2 record was selling 20,000 twelves of that, you know, 15,000 of other tracks. You know, it was kind of a really good period of... And all these records seem to fall into your lap. Yeah, yeah. Well, yes, they did fall into that. I think what it was was I think we were lucky enough for other people to consider us kind of worthy of what they were to bring us. you know, which was really, really good. I mean, we didn't actually go around looking for records. We were lucky enough to do that. I think we positioned ourselves. And we did have a, we had a kind of attitude that when we were at London, you know, these were the records, we were releasing the records on Boyzone that we wanted to release. And the fact that... No one bought them. To change direction and be not true to ourselves just for the sake of keeping it going, we decided not to do that. So I think people who wanted to come with a label that they know would stick by them. If we're genuine about this, you know, because I mean, it's now, you know, you talk to people at record labels and... And people say, yeah, yeah, I love it. But, you know, and oh, yeah, we get it remixed by that. You know, we didn't get these records remixed. You know, if they come in and if we genuinely loved them, you know, we would do everything we could to get behind them. And I think the artists kind of appreciated that. Did you like everything you put out on Junior Voice Zone or was there anyone that you'd think back and go, oh, I don't know? There's a few records that we kind of liked that maybe aren't so good, but at the time we definitely liked them. Or we really liked the people. I think that was another thing. I'm not going to say who they are, but it was a couple of tracks that, you know, we probably like the people more than we like the record. But for us, we kind of were a family. And to a certain extent, we still are a family. I mean, you know, Boys' Own, we still do. did a party last year with Dixon and we did one, you know, we still do stuff together and, and we are a kind of family, although we're kind of very much a kind of in a kind of semi-divorce situation. Uh, but that, that was important to us. And, and, and, um, so yeah, I mean, you know, later on the, the, the label. when the Labour got really kind of successful. and we were releasing a hell of a lot of music. I'm pretty sure that there was, you know, the more kind of New York-y, garage-y stuff that I really liked. I think Steve, you know, didn't like so much, and the stuff, you know, we were quite big with kind of the John Digweed kind of, you know, bedrock crew. Some of that stuff I personally didn't like so much, but, you know, again, the people making it, we loved. and we like the vibe. Speaking of the New York kind of garagey stuff, which I suppose you as a producer with Pete had a... most known for it must have been very exciting during that period to go to New York and see the likes of Frankie Knuckles playing your record or Junior Vasquez or something like that absolutely amazing I mean to be honest with you me and Pete have actually just done a remix our first remix together for about four years of a Frankie Knuckles track And on Sunday, we went to see him play at Shoreditch House. They got a new little room in there. It was a little kind of, you know, 200 people thing. And he started off with our remix. And I literally went running across the room to Pete. and was going, this is it, he's playing our record, he's playing our record. And it just reminded me of being like, you know, kind of young and in the sound factory when we heard like Junior Vasquez play, you know, our remix of Happy Monday's Stinky Thinking, this dub. and we did a dub as well for Ultranate that they turned down in America. So we ended up releasing it ourselves, which turned out to be Ultra Flavor. And when he played those, you know, we were running around with my head exploding. But I actually felt... Not to the same extent, but I actually felt that kind of like childlike excitement again on this Sunday, which I thought was quite nice, actually. You can still get that thrill. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think, yeah, yeah. You know, sometimes you kind of, you do get blasé. And I'm kind of known for being a bit of a misery. And, you know, and a bit of one of those, you know, people always kind of, you know, put me down as a kind of which it probably isn't, but it probably never is, you know. And in 10 years' time, someone who's 18 now will tell their mates, like, it wasn't as good as it was in, like, you know, 2013. So that's just the way it is. Yeah, no, I did get a big buzz. And I certainly got a buzz from the New York DJs and American DJs playing records on Junior Boyzone. And we also got a respect in this country for it because before then, because we were kind of like, you know, a load of white guys, people, I think, you know. People like their kind of house music made by black Chicago guys or Latinos from New York. Well, that's, you know, Joey Negro, the whole thing there, pretended to be from New York and had his biggest success. And because we weren't kind of, you know, people to a certain extent, London DJs and DJs in England, I wouldn't say they ignored our stuff. But it was like, yeah, they play it, yeah, but it's not a big thing, you know. And when sort of like, you know, Tony Humphries turns up at the ministry and he's playing a mix of DSK, what we do, for like half an hour, two copies, suddenly everyone starts playing it. So we got this kind of reflected kind of acceptance that, you know, it's cool. Yeah. It's typically British as well, isn't it? Absolutely. Yeah. And I'm as guilty as anyone when it comes to that. Interestingly as well, I wanted to ask you, I think you're pretty well placed to answer this one. You know, you were there first time round for the 93, 94 Garage Bonanza. What do you think of the kind of recent resurgence of all that kind of music, you know, music you was making first time round? Well, I like, I mean, I like it. You know, I like it. I've got to say, I'm a big fan of Waz and Odyssey. But I actually thought they were two young kids. And I even got into an email conversation with Waz, and I kind of didn't realize that he was Serge Santiago. which is obviously another made-up name, so I've got no idea who he is in reality. But I like it all. It's become a bit tedious now. I've got to say, you know, M1 organs and the same old kind of show-me-love bass lines are a bit... boring um but it i i think it managed to get a lot of younger kids who were maybe into kind of grime or or into kind of you know uk garage into house which, you know, is a good thing, you know, absolutely, you know. So I really like it. I really like it. But I think it's time to move on now, you know, and make kind of records, you know. I think the late 90s, you know, if we keep, we have to, it seems, keep regurgitating music. And, you know, people kind of one minute, everyone's sampling old disco records. Next minute, it's kind of, you know, the last couple of years, we've had everyone making records on old analog machines and, you know, Lego Welton and all these records that sound like they were made in Chicago, you know, in 87. Now we're on the early 90s. the late 90s now, you know, there's an era that's really good. You know, the first Deep Dish records, the Dunnington Eggly stuff, the Junior Vasquez records, Mood to Swing, you know, that's going to be hard. That's going to be a hard show to kind of copy, I think. So moving on, obviously, from Junior Boys, which was a big success. Eventually, you started running a new fanzine called Faith. Can you tell everyone a little bit about that, about how all that came about? Well, the late 90s was a real shitty era for London clubbing. There really wasn't that many places to go. That whole super club thing that had kind of taken over meant that people were playing really, really rubbish music. You know, the gay scene had become hard house. There was handbag house. There was trance was being played. And, you know, the actual kind of, you know, proper underground house music was really being ignored. There was a few places. Kenny Hawks and Luke Solomon did a club in London on a Wednesday night called Space at Bar Rumba where they had people like. Derek Carter, Sneak, all coming over for the first time. And, you know, Derek was like a young boy and Sneak was a young, slim boy. Well, he wasn't young and slim, but he was a bit, you know. And they were kind of, they were out there, you know. And then Stuart Patterson, who was doing a thing called Soul Sonic in West London, Bill Brewster, the... the guy who runs low life and a journalist, he was running a small party and we did a couple of small parties for like 200 people. And we just decided that why don't we all just join up? The three of us. And, and. And, you know, we've got 600 people and we can kind of. So we started doing some parties called Faith because they were on Sunday because that was there wasn't nothing going on on Sunday and you could get a venue on a Sunday because no one wanted them. They wasn't open. And we started doing parties as Faith. And then Stuart's partner was a guy called Leo Elstob, who is Leo Zero, who does loads of edits and is a very clever guy. And he was doing all the artwork. And I just said, we should do a fanzine, you know, in the style of like Boyzone, but make it kind of really militant kind of house. to the point of, you know, Black Power salutes and kind of getting back to that old, we like that Northern soul imagery, which did exactly the same thing in the 70s. You know, they would have Keep the Faith and they would have a Black Power thing and it would have Chicago, Detroit. And we kind of... did a play on that and we did patches you know for people's to sew on people's things that on uh people's clothes that had a black power thing on it at detroit new york london um keep the faith real house music and this was at a time when there was very you know We had really kind of got to that situation where a lot of people just thought it was going to fizzle out completely. And then, as I said, you know, suddenly Ben Watt starts up, Lazy Dog. At Lazy Dog, we met Giles Smith and James Priestley, who kind of, you know, come along to faith and went, right, we're going to start a club. You know, me and Bill went to play for them at their very first Secret Sundays, which was on... on the rooftop at 93 feet east, and they had like 100 people in there. But the 100 people in there were the coolest kids in London. And suddenly it was like, right, this is off again. You know, Fabrico. and suddenly, you know, London got its shit on again. And the fanzine, anyway, the fanzine run for over 10 years. Fabric was a very good supporter. It was free. And it basically got all around the world. people on the front cover that no one had ever even heard of. Omar S was on the front cover before, you know, he'd ever played in this country. We had RPR. Yeah, and RPR had only ever played in this country for Raul Galloway, who was working with the fanzine, at a really tiny little place off of Commercial Road. They come over and they played, you know, for about 100 people down there. We had all sorts of people and even some of the bigger people, you know, like Frankie Knuckles did a really nice interview of us. It become quite big. in Japan, people were sending it to Japan. But then when the kind of 2008 crash happened, suddenly we didn't have enough people to advertise to be able to kind of print it up and give it away for free. One thing I really loved about Faith and Boyzone as well, actually, was that quite funny, but also quite bitchy about a lot of stuff as well. Absolutely, yeah, absolutely. It seems like something that's missing in today's dance journalism. Like everything's very pally, I guess is maybe the word. I think everything's dry as well. Yeah. I think it's dry and it's pally. And people... I think people nowadays are too, they rely on each other. You know, if you want to get some editorial in a magazine, you know, the quickest way to do it is just to get an advert. And then, you know, you pay for the advert and you get editorial. We've always been kind of. arsey and alienate half the advertisements out there. And the only people who come and advertise are the people who actually think we were funny or agree with our opinion. But that's not really a way of running a professional, you know, magazine. So the fact that both of my magazines folded, my record label folded, tells you that... It might appeal to kind of, you know, the outsiders out there. But if you did want to be running MixMag or you did want to be running music magazine, it's probably not the way to go. But yeah, but the point is there, when you're running a physical magazine, it's obviously harder as well. And if you're going to alienate those people, it's very tricky. So that kind of brings us towards, you know, the modern era of what you've been doing. So recently you put out a compilation of Acid House on Harmless, which I found really interesting. Why, you know, revisit? acid house again after it's been revisited so many times I mean to be honest with you I think because it's it's not been done properly and it still hasn't been finished. I, I've actually got volume two waiting to come out, hopefully in the spring, uh, which will kind of complete the circle. I mean, and it's big, this compilation, right? It's a big one. Yeah. The last one was five CDs. I think it was 60 tracks. The next one coming has got about 80 tracks. And all the records that we couldn't get from Chicago and kind of, you know, the New York stuff that sounded relevant to the Chicago stuff and the Detroit stuff, we've managed to get at least kind of, you know, nods on without any contract signed. People, when people, you know, I think if you was to say to someone who's who wasn't there in 88. Oh, what, you know, what was the big tracks? You know, they go, oh yeah, Strings Alive, so and so, so and so. And, you know, and Break for Love. And it's the same old thing. You know, I get to play, you know, kind of different clubs. I get to play straight up house clubs where most people are under 35. And then I play a lot of kind of old school house clubs where most people are over 35 And sadly, the old school ones tend to kind of want the same 50 records, which is really kind of quite annoying from a DJ's point of view, but also from a historical point of view, because, you know, we didn't play Strings of Life every week. You know, it was played for like... a summer and then it was dropped you know um so i tried to try to bring tracks to to to the awareness of people that weren't huge records some of them to be honest with you i didn't even know myself Um, a guy called Miles Simpson helped me, uh, compile this. He's a, he's a bit of a kind of house nerd. Runs, um, runs a night as well. He runs funder. Yep. He knows his stuff anyway. He knows his shit. And he runs a blog called beyond the stars. Um, and he's really, really into it. And so, so I actually found loads of stuff that I didn't know. Um, I've actually kind of funny enough, uh, We released a record by, we got a record on there by a guy called Alexi, Kay Alexi Shelby, called Orphalicia, which was on Transmat. And since, I've actually done a record with him that's coming out on his new label because of this little relationship. Had a few kind of abusive Facebook messages from old Chicago legends about the kind of, you know. fact that the people who we've licensed from actually don't own it and you know uh so it's been kind of quite a um quite an eye-opening uh but it's been really, really interesting. You know, it's, it's so apparently it's sold a lot of CDs, which is great. Hard to do nowadays as well. It's hard to do. Um, and it's got, you know, got really good press. I mean, you know, I think it was mix mag and DJ magazine comp of the month. Um, you know, so. It's a good thing to do. And Volume 2 will be coming next year, and that will be kind of concentrating more on the DJ international and the vocal side of house. The one that's out now is very, very tracky, and it's kind of very much that kind of Ron Hardy and Virgo 4 and Jungle Ones, that kind of very early Deep House. deep house music. The one that we're doing now is slightly more kind of euphoric, kind of soulful and slightly more New York-y. Fantastic. So... we've covered a lot and we've covered a lot of pit time periods in this interview. I just wondered if we've got the keys to the Lorient outside, we can go back and you can visit any time period of London. Would you pick one? Would you be able to pick one or would you rather just stick with it now? Oh, um, well, it depends on how long I could go back for. Really. You can go back. You can go back for two weeks. Okay. Go back for two weeks. You know what? I'll tell you what would happen. I'd go back and I'd be disappointed. I know that would happen. I know I'd go back and it wouldn't be quite how I remembered. That would be for sure. Because when you look back on things, you either remember the best or the worst. And that kind of 90% in the middle, you forget. I mean, I've DJed all around the world. and people come up to me, oh, I heard you play in so-and-so in like, you know, in 98. I can't even remember being in that country, let alone that club. Seriously. But the really bad gigs I remember and the really good ones I remember. And I've got a feeling if I got in that DeLorean, I would turn up at Shum and it'd be the shit night. The one I forgot. The one where kind of, you know, Danny was off form or the one where, you know, no one turned up with any gear. You know, I wouldn't get the best one. We did a very famous party, Boys Own It, East Grinstead, one of the first outdoor parties that, even this week, it's appeared in the, I think it's the Independent, there's an article on 25, is it really 25 years of acid hours? And there's all pictures of our party with people climbing up ladders on the hail boughs. people dressed as pantomime cows and everything like that. And I look at that and it seems the best thing ever. But I'm sure if I went back, you know, I kind of think that the past is best left there. We built this house. We built this house We built this house way, way back We built this house with love from scratch. With love from Scrap
