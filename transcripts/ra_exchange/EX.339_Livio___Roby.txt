so ♪ ♪ you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Livio and Robby. The Romanian duo have released popular tech house and minimal on labels like vacant and desolate but they came as best showcased in their DJ sets. They've been playing together most weekends for the past 10 years, so R.A.'s Matt Unicombe traveled to their studio in Bucharest to learn about the subtle art of the back-to-back set. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Livio and Robbie is up next. ♪ ♪ We're in your studio. How often are you making beats in here? We are here more than making music and sometimes we make music more than being here in the house. So it's like... almost every day all your time spent in Robbie's house I wonder how much has been spent in this room 60% more yeah I think it's more I think it's like 80 around 80% 85 yeah we kill it we kill the studio together my like remember back in the days we were like in the studio we had a studio in downtown We're in a studio more than we'd be in a house. So that was like a lot, a lot of time spending in a studio. Eight years ago. I remember like, yeah, yeah. Eight to 10 years ago, like smoking like hell. Of course not smoking. We had like a basement. We're a really big fan of the basement of Coca-Cola and this stuff. And I like rubbish. food that we don't go back eating like shitty snacks and uh so snake staying there like i think we just we uh end up being there for for days and we um didn't know what day is today anymore like hey what what this night or day because you we didn't have any window you know it's just a basement yeah no it was like Just get lost in the studio. So now you have windows. You've upgraded. Yeah. It's better. Is that a balcony over there that I see? What's this door? It's a balcony and then there's a tree and a house. And there's a dog you can hear in the background. We have a dog too. So how much time do you guys spend together? It's a pretty huge amount, I think. Too much. Sometimes we're taking breaks. It's difficult to take breaks because we're kind of really good connected. And if we don't spend time being together face-to-face or making music, we have to do some stuff around. Even stuff you have to be collective, just do stuff around what we do. I don't know, sometimes papers, payments, visas, interviews, and all this kind of stuff makes us being together, which is pretty a lot of time. And how does the dynamic work? Is one guy more grumpy, one more happy? Well, it depends on the day, let's say. I mean, sometimes it can be a bad day for everybody, so it can be a bad day for me or... bad day for Livio at the end it's good that we are two and we have a balance and it's not good when we are both grumpy yeah how often does that happen yeah because that's the thing when one is grumpy and if the other is happy it obviously that's a huge advantage for you guys because the other one can lift if we are grumpy if we are both grumpy we I don't know we end up in a ring and have a box match That's it. Yeah. We kind of find a balance to accept each other. So, yeah, you know, you're not just the other thing calling back later on. It's kind of okay. So, yeah, maybe we don't know the percentage. So who talks the most on our flights and who sleeps the most? I really cannot sleep in a flight. So I think for Livio it's more easier to sleep in a flight. I love to sleep and I'm easy. As soon as I get in the plane, I don't know why it's happened to me and I hear many people saying, like, just feeling a bit slow, I could sleep. It depends again, you know. I'm lucky because on the long distance I can do that if I'm tired. So it helps in a way. It's a gift, man, to be able to sleep. It's a gift, yeah, for sure. I only can sleep in a plane if I'm really tired. If I, I don't know, playing for one, two days and then I didn't have any sleep for 24 hours, maybe. Maybe I can sleep in a plane one, two hours, but then it's not really my thing. I prefer to... read a book or watch a movie i cannot sleep in the plane it's not it's not my thing even pretty long flights like yeah i can't like no i usually i cannot but lately i kind of started to to sleep a little bit so but as a usual thing not really nothing for me are you guys ever djing separately in romania yes we did this before i think like 10 years and even more. Even more. Like coming, coming, coming back. But these days it's almost always together. Yeah. Since we formed a duo, yes. Oh, wow. We always like playing together. Yeah, nice. How did you meet? I guess you get asked this all the time. It's always nice to remember that moment, actually. So it's okay. It's okay. This question. We like this question. I used to have a studio downtown. At some point, we had a common friend, a girl that introduced us. And she believed that we'll get good together. We'll get along together. So she introduced us and I met Livio. We tried to work on something together and then we clicked, you know, like was a good collaboration. We kind of felt each other. We kind of were both. on the same direction and we were both following kind of the same path and yeah we end up doing another track and another track and another one and then at the end we formed a duo we said okay like really it's just better so how often do you get to play in Romania let's say almost every month more or less like when exactly like that time or now now yeah because this is the one it's like we were speaking about yesterday i find this so interesting uh that like romania has to be one of the few countries where you can be a full-time like traveling dj and still play in your home country very often yeah because i think the market here um it's offering this like comparing with other countries like you said Here you can still do that. Like there is a huge scene. There is a big scene in Bucharest of underground music and parties. Then other few cities like Cluj, Timisoara, Craiova. You can just tour around Romania. And I think it's very nice actually because you get connected with your scene. So we're kind of... here that's that's that's a crazy thing like uh it's got to be like the romanians are the only ones that didn't all of a sudden move to berlin you know like it's it's just it really seems like london berlin and like bucharest are the three spots where if you want to be like a professional dj You can easily live there. That's good in a way. Actually, that's good. We're kind of okay with that. We didn't feel to move or live in other places because we got to write our own thing here. And even based on our own CDs and stuff, it was like, why we shouldn't move to Berlin? Why not? But it was not us. us and not people we know in the music industry that they did it at the moment it's not not only at the moment it's very important to play in your own countries and if you can't just find a way to do it because that's your bridge that's your authentic background which is good and um We used to play more in Romania in the beginning, like 10 years ago, but now it's most time that you can play more selective, like clubs are more well-orientated in your profile and you get more quality than quantity. We kind of balance how much we play now in Romania and Bucharest and abroad, so you don't overkill it. Is it possible to make a living as a DJ in Romania without traveling abroad? Like are there DJs maybe that I would never would have heard of that are still basically living off DJing, just playing in Romania? I suppose so, yeah. I think it's possible. There are a couple of spots in Bucharest and a couple of spots in the country, as I said before. So you can easily have a tour here. And you can easily play, let's say, every week in order to get yourself a decent living. So yeah, I think it's possible. And also I want to mention that because you said about Berlin and you compare Berlin and Bucharest and London being more or less the cities or capital of underground music, you can just have good parties and stuff. I think Berlin and London are very cosmopolitan cities and Bucharest is not really. So Bucharest is holding more the Romanian DJs, you know, because Berlin is holding international DJs, everybody, you know, like a lot of people move there. So it's not only, let's say, German DJs or, you know, so it's a little bit different. But yeah. Yeah, that's the thing. I guess, yeah, there aren't so many people moving to Romania for music. I guess everyone just goes to Berlin. Yeah, that's it. That's the difference. I wonder what it would be. I wonder if it will start happening eventually. That would be interesting. We heard a couple of people, like very few, but not much. They were coming, traveling, and try even leaving to Romania to understand. than the Romanian house movement and stuff, some stuff like that. Yeah, which is cool. Easy, you know, it's much easier. To get a place here, making friends here, get in a studio with some guys and just be around, it's easy. It's like much easier than other places. And people are welcome, you know. Do you think there are lots of jobs where you can just speak English? I guess in this development, like if you're a programmer or something. Yeah, I mean, I think most of the people here in Bucharest, they speak English. It's really easy if you're a foreigner coming here to get along with people from Bucharest because they, let's say, the majority of the people speaks English, so it's easy to communicate. It's not really a problem and they don't feel like not speaking with you in English or something, you know, that people are welcoming. I don't know why people don't do that. They should come here more often. Especially seeing how obsessed people are with this Romanian sound or whatever. There's so many people coming for sunwaves and to come to parties. You would think that they would also then move. This would be a cool move, you know, coming to Sunwaves and then just stay here. Maybe it happened. Well, they do that, you know, just coming for Sunwaves and stay for like two weeks extra. Yeah, for sure. Or something like that, which is a good start, you know. So why not? Why not? They're more than welcome, you know. Everyone knows that Bucharest has a lot of events going on. There are so many DJs here. Has it been like this since the 90s? The scene started late 90s, beginning of 2000, and then was changing all the time. Actually, the scene improved a lot in the last couple of years and was always improving. The beginnings were back in the days, in 2000. It was difficult. It was a difficult period. No access to information, no access to music. But people had courage in that period of time to do parties. You know, like the owners of the clubs, they're initiating, bringing DJs that were famous in that era. And then things started to roll, easily, slowly, until we got here, at this point. I would say the beginning was late 90s, early 2000s. And were you DJing back then, Livio? The first time I was DJing was 1994. but in the 90s i was you know in the development process i was like into the music and somehow really was that the big sound no no not even not not even progressive house followed up in like 1998 2000 it was a long process but that time we didn't play i was i didn't play and no one was playing in romania techno or progressive or any any type of house music. It was just back in the day we play like tapes, like dance music, like stuff like you hear in the televisions, you know, it was like really early time. So no modern music, let's say. And it was like, you know, very interesting. So people might not believe that, but there were the times, you know. So music exists like parties and discotheques and like... small clubs, clubs, actually the name for club comes really late. You didn't know about the club, you know, concept. Bucharest has some like couple of them, but that time we were at this point on this level, you know, the scene comes to life. when actually people understand and there were more clubs or more access to the music we developed after the 90s to middle 1995-96 and then after 2000 I think then the people start to understand the concept of clubs and music and then later on even we had our first music magazine then we kind of start to create a scene you know djs more djs less product producers and it was a long process and do you see the scene is like do you think it's in a healthy place right now yeah definitely yeah definitely yeah right right now it's very mature it's very um It's a very upgraded scene, I would say. People understand and they have expectations. Also DJs or performers, they're also trying to be the best for the people, for the crowds that are really educated for this kind of sound. And it's not only this kind of sound, it's just like many kinds of sounds also. That's the interesting thing is like so much is done to such like a high quality. The mixes are smooth. The sound systems are good. It's just fascinating that there's so much emphasis on quality. I wonder where it comes from. It's a rare thing. Where else is putting so much emphasis on good sound? There are three clubs in Romania probably have, you can't find clubs in Berlin with sound that good. You couldn't find three. Look how much smaller Bucharest is. Yeah. You know, like. Yeah, this is how we saw yesterday in just a random place where they get food and drinks. A great sound system just for listening and even comparing with other. places was there some guy in the early days that was some sound freak and then everyone said this is how it has to be there used to be a legendary club uh la mania on the seaside that uh had the best sound system in romania for sure and they from my point of view uh back in uh 2000 you know from that that period they offer an example because everybody was going there to party So I think that place was an example for everybody. And also for people from outside Romania. DJs, famous DJs, they came and they appreciate how that club is built and how the sound is. So I would say that place. offered a good example, let's say. I know people like one of my good friends, how they were doing it back in the time, like 90s, after 90s, even before 90s. People who got a little bit access to the information and own actually a couple of speakers, homemade speakers and amplifiers and all this kind of stuff. they were actually, they owned properties and they rented to the places or they just wanted to party. They just like made homemade stuff and then just put their own speakers over there. And those people, they were passionate about the sound and they learned over time. how is to be louder, how is to be more warm, how is to be, it's like a long process. Even when I was like 94, those guys, they were just having a discotheque in a season in Mamaya, in Constanza, in the seaside. So they were just like bringing their own manufactured speakers and, you know, they get, burned out and then repaired and then somehow those people later on they had access to import more equipment and present it and sell it to the clubs or discotheques and then sponsorships and you know this is how this evolving sound and function one is the main thing here are most people using function one yeah i think people likes function one these days It's most popular. It's very popular in Romania and in Bucharest. What do you guys like? If it's really well tweaked, Function One system, I think, should be taken care of. And I think an engineer should know what he's doing and tweak it in the right way for the right place. So if you have a club, you should tweak it for that room and so on. So then this system will become really amazing. Otherwise, function one is tricky. It can sound not so good if it's not well. It just makes everything sound like techno. It makes everything sound like this. harsh hats like yeah yeah the more you play in a system the more you can adjust and the more you hurt the other system you can do a comparison you can compare and yeah i think function one we good with function one if they fit if it fits with the place and more with the dj boots because that's very important Not so many people talk about it, but the sound in the DJ booth is so important, isn't it? You need to hear what you're doing clearly. And then also, if you get to the DJ booth and the sound is bad, you lose motivation or something. Exactly. You're like, I can't hear the track, I can't hear the bass line so good. Yeah, I can hear motivation, I can get frustrated, and then I can end up in a really shitty... night you know so that's why i think it's really important to have the dj booth well prepared and the booth actually so in order to play vinyls and not having problems you know the club owners or people who who's organizing this kind of places they you know they should get their experience over over time so in the end they would know how to build a dj booth proper sound system there you know so i think it's really really important and sometimes it's not happening you know that's the that's the thing sometimes it's not happening but yeah one thing which is The good difference they did, like a club owner, if you don't know how to make your sound system, call a guy who can do it. And they understand the sound has to belong to a really good company who can do it. So that's very important. Before they understand this, it was just like, why do I need to spend another couple of thousand and just put a monitor for you as a DJ? I don't even, they don't even respect that, you know? Well, the big topic at the moment is everyone is complaining that you can't, that so often you go to a club and you can't play vinyl properly. Like, what's your experience with that? Is it, it feels like that's all everyone complains about now. It's the truth. It's really often you end up being in a place. and the vinyl, you cannot play vinyl for different reasons. Because of the monitors, you cannot play, or it's jumping, or the needle is jumping because, I don't know, the turntable is not well, it's on top of the subwoofer, or stuff like that, you know? So I think it's a lot of, more a lot of work to do in this direction, you know? A lot of work to do. And what happens when you say to someone, do you tell the club, like, hey man, I can't play vinyl? And they're like, what do they say? I mean, of course people try to help and try to solve the problem most of the time. The funny thing, which I don't understand, it's when you have a writer and they say yes, and then when you go there, it's actually, they're not working. But you learn, you know, to make a little bit of a small adjustment on the way. You might travel with your own kit. But yeah, sometimes you just have one. You know, like you can't play vinyl at all, which is sad. Yeah, because it's more fun. Yeah, of course. and it's more diverse and the sound is different and so on and not only yeah i mean sometimes you just want to play those records and then by not playing it you just like you have to change your whole whole sound or whole set So how does it work with you? So you're playing back to back all the time, basically, one track each. Yeah. Do you know all of each other's tracks now? Like how often will Livio play something that you don't know? This is happening. I mean, it's nice because it's like we are in a continuous search for new music. And of course, when you hear new tracks, you know, it's like, what's this? Yeah, it's really cool to surprise. We like, you know, I like when he surprised me, I surprise him with new music. What is this? You know, it's like, it's cool. It's a cool thing for sure. When you come up with something old or something like. you didn't play it for such a long time, you want to play it again, it's a sitting, you know. I know this, but what is this? Sometimes it's our own track, and I was like, hey, dude. Yeah, we may remember that. Yeah, that's the thing. It's such a good feeling when you're playing with someone and you know you have this bomb that you know your friend is going to like. And it's such a nice feeling. You mix it in and you watch them as you are. Yeah, and that's the moment when you think, hey, maybe Alzheimer's is coming. Or should I take it easy with some stuff? Like, I don't remember. Yeah, we did it yesterday. And then the next day, you just don't remember What was that? That's a... Take it easy with, I don't know, with what? So do you have to, when you're playing back to back all the time, like, are you constantly talking? No, actually we don't talk at all, almost. Just when he's telling me sometimes, like, to quit the cigarette or something. No, I'm joking, but... It's not like, oh, okay, it's not saying stuff, oh, we should play something more percussive or... No, we just, we are kind of... Sometimes you do... You have a flow. Yeah, sometimes you do your own, but you just like, you know, it creates... read mind or read of the gesture you know like you know how to adjust this or sometimes you have to speak you know like couple of stuff but yeah of course not so much talk you know not too much speaking in the booth because It's not necessary, actually. It's so interesting, like, playing together so much. Like, what happens if Livio is playing too chilled music for the situation? Like, does it ever happen where you want something? Then is the moment you talk. You're like, hey man, what's going on? It's like, you know, you have to, if the one goes to left or to down or to up, like you can, your next thing, you can just direct him, you know, like just change the mood and, you know, exactly. But sometimes even playing random, that's not really. you have to be in the same mood or driving. It's kind of interesting, you know, like one, it's two tracks mixing differently, can create a nice moment. So if it doesn't work, then you kind of, hey, let's just go back to deep or some stuff like that. But yeah. Yeah, I would say sometimes it's an advantage to be together, you know, two people. Because if one goes wrong, let's say the other one can repair. And it always will be a balance, you know, and you don't have this kind of really abrupt kind of changes. So you can easily keep the track, you know, keep the ship straight. Yeah. Who plays the first track usually? Livio plays the first track. Yeah, Livio plays. I like to... I like to... Yeah. Let Livio play the first track. Start or... It's not like I have to or something. We just like... I don't know. Comes easy. It depends. Most of the time he starts. Sometimes I start as well. And you're both doing pretty long mixes. Yeah. Like transitions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have to be careful to leave your friend enough time to... It's like you ever see... That's a very... That's a good question. I just watched this... There's this video of Villalobos playing with Radu or Raresh. I can't remember. You know this Robert Hood, Baby Baby? Yeah. He's basically doing the usual Ricardo Fader thing almost for the whole track and leaves Radu like 20 seconds to mix out on. That's the thing when you're doing such long mixes. Well, this can be again the moment when we speak again. Hey, man. Like, what's going on? And sometimes it's good to have a long track, you know, in order to have time to prepare the next one and to have a smooth, nice transition. Of course, sometimes they're just short tracks and you don't have time to edit them. And then you end up in this situation, which is not really cool. So yeah, also you can, you know, so many times you play, you learn the trick, how you do it. Ask for a third or the fourth CD player and you can just play something under, like a layer or some stuff like that. You get your own tools. So then when Ricardo's playing a 45-minute track, you can go see your friends in the back and back. You know, and you got your loop ready, no problem. You can just let him play whatever. But yeah, that's also when you are in the mood to do that. Why not? Why not? Because it's working. It's just a moment. Is there some sense of like competition where like, oh, I'm playing this bomb. Like, look at the reaction I got. Oh, no. No, this is totally wrong. And I think it's a kind of negative way of doing things. Cannot be nothing good afterwards. It's not triggering anything good. This is where back-to-backs go wrong, is when someone is trying to... Also, it depends what's your perception about that. Because you can also take it into a different way, not like an ego stuff. So just like, if you really believe in a record, it's going to be a bump. And rise up to your next level. You want to play the same and you're going to kill those plays. Like name, let's say, those guys Apollonius. Amazing how they can... ended up in such a beautiful like almost every track closing in dc10 or ending of night or when they're doing them big house stuff you know all those hits all those all those classical music one by one they are super big so he's playing at the donna summer the other guy's playing something like even you know so they the way they mix it so it's not uh It's not an ego thing to rock a party with a big hit. And that's why they very well know about playing big records. What is a back-to-back duo need to be successful? I think it needs a lot of background and history. And of course, same taste in music. Experience, yeah. A lot of experience. I think sometimes can end really bad a back-to-back if two people, they don't know each other, even though they... kind of know as friends or whatever, but they don't play together and then can end up bad. I mean, not a disaster, but, you know, not really, not really cool. It would have been better if just one person was playing. Exactly, you know. So I think you need a lot of experience and a lot of empathy as well. And, you know, just sometimes to make a compromise and stuff like that in order to... keep the track i think the experience is the most important thing and when you're djing alone i guess you don't do it so much anymore but are you thinking a few tracks ahead Because, you know, when most people are DJing solo, they'll have like three, okay, and three times that. Yeah, that's how you do. So you guys are also thinking. Yeah. But without, that's pretty crazy, being able to do it without talking so much. But you still know where you want to go. Yeah, after all this time, I guess it's kind of normal. also from a gesture or from just, you know, you can kind of feel it. We kind of feel it. You don't need to talk about it. Again, it's like, it depends, you know. It depends, like, two tracks together, two tracks, different tracks, they can give you a different mood and then you follow that. If you program everything in your head before and you follow the move also, it's good. So it's not like a rule, you know. It can be different, both good or maybe both bad. Yeah, I was trying to think like what other people have been DJing together for so long. You said Audiofly, but there's like, I guess Mandy. You know these guys, these get physical dudes. Yeah, yeah. yeah for sure they also played for a long time but there's not many man like as a duo yeah yeah especially in this like this deep housey like minimal whatever you guys have got to be like the only ones After 10 more years, we're going to be the only ones. I don't know. Mostly, I don't know much right now to mention. But people playing together back-to-back, even if they're not a duo. People, they're supposed to make some records in the back, and now they have the same lineup, and sometimes they have to play back-to-back. It's good. Even it's nice when three people are playing, you know. So when's the last time you guys played alone, like separately? When one of us is missing the flight. Yeah, that was also, yeah. That's the moment. That's the moment. Who misses the most flights? Usually we don't miss flights, but sometimes it happens to have... visa issues or somebody you know forgets the passport at home stuff like that so how is it to play alone really weird or you're like yes no it's it's it's it's fine even though the problem is i would say um for me for example it's it's totally fine but the club and the people that comes there they have different expectations and um Obviously, they want the duo to perform. So I was like, it's just half of the quality. When you first started the duo, was it hard to get bookings because people didn't want to pay so much for flights? This can happen also now. It can happen all the time. People think, and it's normal to think about that. They have to pay flights, two flights, two hotels, like everything, twice. Even if you're three, if you're a trio, it's even worse. Plus the gear. Yeah, but then it's much better if they don't afford to have you. So at least you know you go there for sure. That's okay, no problem. The other people in club, they want to do it. It was not worth it. But yeah, but it's like sometimes, you know, people have limited budgets and then it's up to you how you can fit. It's like if you're on EverProfile, there are places that they pay very low. but it's good still to play there. But in the end, you have to make a living. So did you start getting bookings pretty quickly after putting out the first records? Slowly, slowly. We started here, like really, we continue. Olivia continued what he did before me as well. So we continued, we started a duo producing and then we started playing together easily, but we were still playing separately in that period of time, mostly in Romania, touring here. Until at some point when we started to get more hype outside and people started to book us more outside Romania as well. Professional bookings abroad, they happen late, you know, it was a long process. It comes once we start to have a lot of records out. and someone who can properly manage that, you know, or do it. And also by herself. Is there someone leading the selection somehow? Just say you feel like playing acid style sounds. Will you just do it? And then Livio... figures out how to match. Okay, you gave like, let's say, a little bit more extreme example, but I got the point and I think, yeah, sometimes it's just, you know, can happen that Livio has better intuition, let's say, you know, in order to make the party right or I have it in one night. So I kind of follow him or he follows me somehow, you know. Sometimes we're, most of the time we're both there. But yeah, sometimes it happens just to, and then it's better to follow the right way. Like he sees like, okay, cool, this switch. this crowd yeah he sees like he plays some swangy house thing yeah you say okay cool this is working and i will also follow yeah for example can can be a situation so how often do you see djs like just say you're playing in some random club in france how often will you see a dj you like some local dude or girl someone told me almost never one DJ told me like yeah never but I just wonder if you have a different experience like where you think hey he's playing cool stuff yeah it happens it happens man of course we're always looking for that I mean and it's always nice to we would expect that actually and I would like I would love to see a warm-up act doing the right the right things before um you know i don't know a main act or whatever you want we want to call it because i think this is very difficult to make a proper warm-up and a warm-up and it's um it's a whole you know we can speak a lot about this because not a lot of people knows how to do it so sometimes just killing the party, you know? So how often will you get to a party and it's totally inappropriate music before you? Before it used to happen more, actually. Nowadays, I don't think it happens so often because I think the bookings are more, you know, niche, let's say. And I think we are addressing on a... proper crowd that knows what to expect and also the warm-up DJ knows what to do before. So it's better now than before. Before you could easily see... You know, the crowd change and the places are changing. The whole concept changed actually about going out and performing. So most people, most of the promoters, they don't want to build a night like that, having a warm-up these days. In Bucharest you can find, you can still, I mean, like you can still go or for an all night long party of a label or of like we have a label, we're doing a party, we know to book our warm-up DJ, our kid, he knows how to do it. It's not only about how to play, it's very, I think part of the understanding of the warm-up right now. It's not what exactly you play. You have to keep it in the level or something like that, but how you play it. Even the adjustment of the master volume is very important. Leave a little bit of headroom for the next guy, for a kid who understands that. For me, it's a big thing happening. So I saw that recently. in a club in Bucharest, which impressed me, you know, so he was like, wow, this is, this is, we are here, we're good. After all this year, we are good. I think this kind of people that understands also get the respect that they, they want and they need from, let's say, I don't know, maybe bigger DJs or older DJs, which is very important. It's very, very important. So this is like the case when the guy, knew that sound system it's a little bit loud monitors are a little bit loud he just adjusted in a way that you know i would do the same but then he knew and he took his job properly he did it leaving a little bit of the headroom it was like for me having a full full respect you know about it who was this guy Yeah, of course. I remember it was the night who played that night. Actually, it's a new kid called Krihan. He's making, start making some also good music. And main act, he was our friend Arapu. It was a good night in a club called Eden right here. So they really have it. So that was really good. It really impressed me. Whatever he does this, for me, it's a go. It's cool. Just say you're playing a warm-up set. Do you think, from the beginning to the time you hand it over to the next DJ, is it totally smooth, like a gradual rise? Or is it about kind of up and down? down of course still smooth but are you kind of teasing should you be like okay i'm gonna play something a bit more energetic now and then bring it back down again or do you think it should be just a gradual rise i don't think it depends what you want to bring the this what you want to do with the crowd and how you are in the situation i would i would say like for personal taste i would not go like gradually you know like getting to a highest peak or something i like kind of more wavy like more like a story that you know fits in a warm-up or at that hour I think it's more interesting to hear a story like that from a DJ rather than building, building, building, and at some point you don't have any more bricks. And then it's just everything collapsing or something. I don't know. But it depends also on the place, the club, the crowd. It depends, really. It depends what you... with that night and the set and where you're playing. But also I will really appreciate to keep it going on this kind of the same level. You know, nothing changed. You can just do it for a long time. but don't miss the vibe and just kill it and keep everyone in the same place, but not being all over the place, you know, neither progressively playing or, and so that's very, very important how to like keep it there, same kind of mood sometimes, but just, you know. I think this is the hardest thing actually. Keeping this energy. Exactly, keeping the energy. I think that's the real, that's what makes the... great DJs great. Yeah. I think that's what separates professional level DJs from average bedroom DJs. I think that can make a good set out of it. I don't know. There can be other different approaches that can make a DJ famous. But this is one of my favorite styles. So how do you do that? Is it about knowing the different energy levels of tracks? First of all, you have to have these tracks, all this music. So your selection has to be this way. You have to have this kind of set. And then do something about edits or also the vibe of the tracks. are the way you're playing the way you're keeping it that's a whole process you know that can can make you being into it and without controlling very well the tracks without knowing very well and what you're playing that you can have a surprise that this track is out of the range or the mood it's not difficult to have a selection of tracks that are all the same but it's difficult to make it interesting Thank you. Thank you.
