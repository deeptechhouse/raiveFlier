Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. This is our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. On this week's exchange, I speak to DJ Lag and Nan Collet about QAM, the hypnotic style of club music that's been brewing in Durban townships for the past decade. Lag is one of the sound's biggest stars and Kole runs the label Qom Ohm which has been instrumental in presenting the music to western audiences. Qom is an enormous deal in Durban with the sound touching people from all walks of life and its popularity has begun to spread throughout South Africa and across dance floors in Europe and in Asia. As the guys explain in this live recording from last year's Unsound Festival, the QAM scene has a range of unique characteristics that make its journey out into the wider world all the more fascinating. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with DJ Lag and Nan Collet is up next. So the sound we'll be discussing today is QAM. This is a style of hypnotic dance music that's been developing in Durban over the past decade. And a little bit more recently, DJs and music fans in the UK and other countries have picked up on the sound. DJ Lag's one of QAM's pioneers and best known artists. and he's joined by Nan Kolb or Francesco we're gonna go with. Francesco, yeah. He's an Italian DJ and label owner. He's been helping to get QWOM out worldwide through his label QWOM-O. So far you guys have released two compilations, that's right? Yeah, I released one compilation on double vinyl and the second one during the summer on cassette tape. The overall aim is getting the fresh sounds of Durban out to the scene. Lag, I wanted to start by talking to you. Back in 2012, I went to Johannesburg. Resident Advisor was making a film about the house music scene in South Africa. One of the most surprising things for someone from the UK was just how popular house music is in South Africa. Unbelievably enormous concern in the country. So if we're thinking specifically about Durban, could you give us an idea of just how popular QAM is at this point and the kind of impact that it's had on people's lives? GOM is a sound that's been made in Durban. This is next. GOM. Okay, it's a sound made in Durban at the townships by students around 14 or 15. When I started doing GOM, it was 20... 2012 or 2011, I'm not sure. But at that time, the genre was that big and it was only played in Durban, in Durban townships. So now it's starting to get big and it's getting popularity like outside South Africa, like here at the UK. even in the States. In South Africa, it's quite big now because even like the big names in South Africa are starting to get into KOM. But at first, they didn't want the genre to be played even in radios. Even now, you can't find KOM being played on radios. It's still an underground sound, but we're still developing, so yeah. So at this point in time, who would you say is a typical KOM fan? I can say like all ages now, but like around 2012 it was only the young ages who used to play gom because we had like dancing groups, South Africa had like dancing groups, the whole country had dancing groups, so gom played a good role on dancers, they used it for like... performing their dancing but now even like hip-hop artists are starting to get into it like rapping on beats and so yeah i can say first for older people and young the young people so francesco um your connection to quam is very different and it was something that you discovered through the internet that's correct Tell us about that initial moment of discovery. What were you doing? How did you stumble upon the music? I discovered GOM just on Facebook. Because of my previous experience with my previous label, I was building relationships with some of South African artists, mostly from Cape Town and Joburg. I discovered GOM on social network, yeah. I was clicking on this post on Facebook and... I was so addicted from the first time. I remember there was like three days in my house, downloaded hundreds of tracks from this website, Kazi MP3. Yeah. I was feeling a really high energy. It was something really physical, like in the middle of my chest was something like, what's that? It's amazing, simple, amazing. So I guess before we go any further, it would probably be helpful for everyone to kind of define some of the characteristics of the sound. So Lag, if you were to zero in on what makes a quam track, what would you say are the basic components? Well, to make a quam track, you have to make sure that your beat has to be a broken beat. It mustn't be four steps, it has to be a broken beat. To make a quam track, you have to have a lot of drumming. and ghost chants. Okay, so you're using drums and you're using chants. Chants, yeah. And where are these elements coming from? Are you guys grabbing samples online or where are these components derived from? I got the samples from friends. Because, yeah, I got it from friends. They started producing. I didn't know anything about production, but I just tried and taught myself how to produce and then ended up doing Guam. So why are these chants so important for Guam tracks? I don't know, man, I don't know. But that's the only samples that I had that time. I always kept using the same samples all the time. That's where this thing started. So I guess one of the curious things about the style is that although it's very focused on making people dance, you guys aren't really using bass lines very much. Is that accurate? No, we don't use bass lines. We're just dealing with the kick. The kick has to be strong. And the snare has to have a reverb. No one is using bass lines. No one is using bass lines. I mean, do you think it's just not something that's necessary? I'm just trying to understand, you know, the kind of origins of that thinking. Some of my tracks are put bass line. And I don't have, like, loud tracks put in bass line. It's just the beats only, man. Yeah, also the word calm. Yeah, it's representing the kick. So actually the main element is the kick. The guys really like to push it loud. So, yeah. I mean, so if we're thinking about the styles of house music that are popular in South Africa, I'm sure it's something that most people would recognize here. It's straightforward on the floor. It's quite percussive. There's lots of vocals. So I'm wondering, in relation to the popular house stars in South Africa, how is QAM different? How is the energy of the music different? It's a completely different kind of message. I mean, first of all, the atmosphere is pretty dark. Also, yes, this is a kind of... The main difference is that there's no forekick. Also the atmosphere. I always feel this kind of rebellion. Also, the environment is different. It's from the township. It's probably a young generation. And they have something to say, and nobody listens to them. And they found this way to pushing loud, you know? Yeah, sure. So we're discussing something with, you know, you're characterising it as quite dark. It's all about tension. You know, there's almost a sense of dread. when it actually comes to playing this music to an audience, is that type of energy transferred? You know, is there like more of a darker feeling on the dance floor or are we kind of still talking about something that's like us? and celebratory. It's music made for dance, actually. They made gum for dance, actually. So when they have parties in Durban, they really enjoy it. They are happy. The energy is too high. I think we'll be able to play something at this point. So this is DJ Lag's Ghost on the Loose coming out on Goon Club. All stars in a few weeks. Was that right? Yeah. Okay. Let's see if this works. So, Lag, could you give us a sense of the community or the artistic community in Durban? How deep does it run at the moment? Are there literally hundreds of aspiring DJs and producers making Kwan? Yeah, yeah, yeah. There are a lot of producers now who are taking part in GOM. Even the taxi culture is quite big in contributing to music. Go to town in Durban, you'll find every taxi playing a GOM track. It's like 100 sexes, man. They're always playing gums. So, yeah, the support that we have is really big. Even the DJs, most of the producers now are starting to get into gums. The Deep House producers are starting to do Deep House and getting into gums. So, yeah, man, it's getting big. So who are kind of some of the key artists that people should be checking out in addition to you, of course? Oh, okay. There's these guys called Destruction Boys and Root Boys, Infamous Boys, Citizen Boys. Oh, man, the list goes on and on, man. So, you know, we've been driving this idea that there's quite a fixed set of rules kind of connected to the music. You know, we're talking about this particular type of energy and this particular beat pattern. Can you, as a producer, clearly tell the difference between all the different artists? Has everybody got their unique flavour, would you say? Every artist and every producer has his own style. But for me, when I started doing KOM, there was like three or two producers who were already starting doing KOM. But for me, I was a hip-hop artist. I was a hip-hop producer. So I mixed my hip-hop style and my house style and then mixed it together. And then this way, I have a different style from the other producers. The way I do, it's way different from the other producers. But the others... copy each other's style, you know, so, yeah. How do you get from writing hip-hop beats, presumably something around 80, 90 BPM, up to this, like... Basically, if you listen clearly to gum... If you change the pitch of the GOM track, maybe put it slow, maybe around 100, it can become a hip-hop beat. The patterning of the beats for GOM, it's similar to hip-hop. But if you put up the pitch, it's going to be a GOM track. Yeah. So you mentioned there a moment ago, I don't know if people picked up on it, but the fact... that taxis in Durban play a really big role in spreading this music out. Tell us, what is the link between taxis and QAM? Yeah, taxis are a really interesting aspect of Durban. Because actually it's like the promo tool of QAM. For example, I made a QAM track in the night. The day after in the morning I have to go to school and get the taxi. I give my truck to the taxi driver. If the taxi driver plays the truck for weeks, the truck can be a hit all over the city. And also another really interesting aspect is what happens on Saturday night, especially in the city center. There is this taxi rank. Wow, it was crazy when I saw it. It's really amazing because like, I call it rave from my point of view of European guy. Actually, it's like a rave with a lot of sound system because like all the taxi rank pushing the music loud because they got like serious, serious sound system. It's amazing. Thousands of guys dancing. So in summary, you have a situation where there's... Tens of taxis, all in one place, all competing for business through blasting music. Also because the taxi driver needs to play the banger, because it's a way to get clients also. Like, I have the best music, you know, like, come with me. Because I will play the best tracks of the city. Because there's a distinction we should probably make as well. So in Europe, a taxi, usually like a four-seater vehicle, often in South Africa, we're talking about something much bigger. Yeah, they are vans. Like a small community of people, almost. Yeah, like 15 people inside. 15, yeah, 15. Yeah, something like that, yeah. So how else are people discovering new Guam tracks? On social networks like Facebook, Twitter and... Whatsapp group? Yeah, because you just do a link and then start posting on Facebook and then that's how we distribute our music. So for someone getting into the style I assume somewhere like Cassie MP3 would be a good place to start? Yeah, Cassie MP3 did a great job at first. And then they started promising money to people, we're going to pay people. And then when you try to email them that you want money, they don't respond. It's very frustrating because when you go in your account, you can see the money you heard, but you can't take it. So essentially you're in a situation where nobody was being paid. So everybody just leaves. Let's focus on your label for a moment. So we've been talking about this. sprawling amount of music that's out there. There's very little backstories on the artists, you know, very few biographies or information. So you've been enjoying this music and you've been enjoying it from afar, but you decide that you want to start a label. How does someone go about that? How did you go about that? What were the connections that you needed to make in order to get the label off the ground? Yeah, it wasn't easy at the beginning. When I was gone for the first time, people in Europe needed to know that music because it's simple and amazing. So after downloading hundreds of tracks, on most of the tracks there was a Blackberry Messenger pin or WhatsApp number. At that time I had Blackberry, I would start to add people and start to chat, start to asking Facebook contacts and trying to, at the beginning, just to know what's that. The first time the guys just asked me, hey, where are you from? I'm from Italy. From Italy, yeah. You like gum? Yeah. I said, yes, guys, it's amazing. Oh, by the way, you know how to dance gum? He said, no, guys, I play in Rome. They dance gum. It was a really, really, really nice exchange experience. And after that, yeah, I was building kind of relationships. And then I had this friend of mine very close to me that she lived in Rome in the past. She's originally from Soweto, Lerato. Lerato Piri, and she helped me to contact the guys, to explain what I had in my mind. And what was in your mind? What was the pitch you were making to artists? Actually, yeah, I really planned everything. Planned everything to be here now. I had a kind of plan to promote. Also because at the beginning I was looking on the internet and I also found some posts around the internet of some people editing gum, some people, European artists editing gum, or talk about gum, but don't talk about the guys, for example. You know, something like that. I was feeling like... So first of all, my aim was like, I was trying to let them people know who made this music. Sure. Yeah, I mean, it's kind of an obvious issue in the situation we're discussing where questions of appropriation are obviously raised when you... have a European label looking to put out the music of young producers from South African townships. How did you approach this, you know, in your thinking, where you could reach a place where you were kind of being respectful to everybody involved, and you could kind of create a situation where everybody was getting the, you know, the best out of this arrangement? Yeah, it's strange because all the people are afraid about that aspect, but the people don't have to be afraid about underground music movement because now we are talking about underground electronic music movement. I'm saying now to you that we need to be afraid for the future from mainstream artists that now they start to recognize, especially in the United States. You mean there could be a situation where mainstream artists are picking up on this sound and just kind of taking the rhythms of something wholesale? With none of the original message translated? This is the most dangerous thing. I can't say that, but probably it will happen. I will try to protect. And also the aim of the label is the sound is Durban, because I want to, in a way, keep it local. I say to my guys, this is your label also. I mean, it's not something like... I'm pushing here and at the same time we struggle to get the artists here also because that was the aim. At the beginning the people don't understand because there was a lot of my mixes, everybody, because there are many difficult aspects. For example, for the guys it's very difficult to send big files for mixes. No? Is the internet connection just not... Yeah, because the connection in Durban is only on the phone. They don't have internet in the house, so they can't upload big files. When I went in Durban, I got a lot of me. and now BBC are broadcasting mixes from Mafia Boys, from Domino Hour. So we have a completely different... For me, it's a kind of mission also, in a deep way. So, Lag, how did you feel when European labels started to get in contact with you and said, hey, we love your music and we would love to release it? Yo man, at first I didn't believe it. Nobody believed it. I didn't believe that my music is being played out there because even in South Africa it was hard to hear your track being played in Jo'burg or outside Durban. So if people overseas are playing my music, it was like a surprising thing for me, man. So I didn't believe at first that they want to release an EP for my tracks. So I thought that they want to steal my music, maybe release it as their own, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I mean, was that a concern among you? your peers that maybe it was an exploitation situation. You were concerned that they would just take your music, essentially. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I just decided to take the risk and see what's going to happen. And then look at now. Everything is going smooth. There's nothing wrong that's happened. I met Francisco. There is no music being taken. Then I don't know. Everything is going according to paperwork. Francesco, I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about some of your experiences of trying to spread this message in Europe, some of your DJ performances in particular. I'm just really interested to know what the European audience response has been like to Kwon. Actually, it was a good response. My first important gig... was in February at Watergate in Berlin. It was amazing. It was amazing. There's a lot of 4 a.m. and people went really deep into it because it's a kind of hypnotic music, this feeling. But sometimes I was afraid. I was afraid, especially of my country, when I was going to play in Italy. because there's no 4/4 kick, this sounds strange, but I always, when I play I have this energy, so actually I don't care, I mean I don't care. I care about the crowd, but at the same time I'm just going straight, because GOM has this energy, and sometimes it happens that at the beginning, the first two, three tracks, people start like... just stuck but after that especially because of this crescendo there is a strong message so I mean are there other styles of music that you think Qom kind of sits comfortably alongside because presumably you're in a situation where you're you have a DJ maybe playing before you and you have a DJ playing after you so what an ideal scenario is one time I was playing after a set of like in a commercial way then I start with gum and the people was so excited about this big huge quite a bit faster yeah yeah So it depends. But actually, I think that calm is really particular. It's really... So, yeah. Lag, I just wanted to touch quickly on the kind of origins of the style. You'd mentioned that you and some of your peers were producing hip-hop before and it kind of was turning into something different. Do you remember the point at which collectively in your community you guys thought, wow, okay, this is something different. This is something different for Durban. This is something different for the rest of South Africa. When I was producing, nobody wanted to play my music. First house tracks that I was doing. How long ago was that? I think 2010 or 2011. I was 13. Yeah, nobody played my tracks. But when I started to get into home, everybody wanted my tracks. Like, can you please send me your new tracks, you know? So that's where I saw that this new style that I'm doing now is much better than what I was doing. So I continue doing, like, new tracks. all the time doing Qom. And then this way, my name started getting bigger and bigger in Durban. Qom is obviously a star that's very much connected to people's lives and experiences in the townships in Durban. Could you tell us about just your general experiences of growing up in the townships in Durban? Well, it's pretty hard, man. It's pretty hard to get your name out there. And it's really hard to get your name big in Durban because of the big names. They always talk crap about the government. They say that the government is destroying the music industry. Sorry, when you say big names, you mean other DJs in the South African scene? Yeah. They always say that it's killing the music industry, they don't like this, but now it's starting to change because of the big artists now who are starting to get into GOM. They're doing major hits in South Africa, so now they're starting to think that GOM is the future. But back then when you started doing the genre, they didn't like it, and it was hard to get. It was hard to even get gigs in Durban when you're doing gum. If I got a gig, I would pay for free. And then started getting a small amount of money, like 300 for petrol. And then started getting up and up. Gum king is taking over. And then when OK Malum Cool Cat started messaging me that he wants beats from me and then he started writing on social network about my music that he's been performing with my music here in London and he wants beats from me and then he started he wanted a feature. And then that's where the other big artists started seeing that gum is becoming big. So now everybody is trying to get into gum. So it's the case that producers from all over the country and further afield are producing gum these days? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can say that. Even the hip-hop producers now are starting to get into gum. Do you think it's possible for people in Europe, for example, to produce Kwam? Could you see a situation where people in London are making this music? Have you seen that so far? I've seen that. There's this guy called Jumping Back Slash. Yeah, man, he's quite good, man. He's South African, man. South African? I'm not sure, but he's South African. But that guy is really good, man. This was my first time here. white person producing BOM and when you listen to his tracks it's like he's born in Durban or he's like a Durbanite man so it's quite amazing that you can see that white people are starting to get into BOM I have my opinion on this. You can make it. Music is mathematic, okay? So you can recognize the kick is here. You build gum with bricks on Fruity Loop or a kind of sequence. So you can recognize where is that kick, where is that... The vibe is not the same. I'm saying this because I'm receiving a lot of comms, promos from the United States or from other countries. They're good music, but I'm missing something. I don't know what it is. I can't define. But it's different. What, in your opinion, would an outside producer need to do to show an adequate level of respect for the music? you know do you think it's important that they kind of have a dialogue going where they're kind of saying look I'm making this music but it doesn't come from here you got an important point one time I said to this American artist I said yes actually it's a good production but I'm not from Durban. I say, let's share to the guys in Durban. Listen to what they say, if they play, if they like it. Because I think everybody, we are free. You can do a gumtrap for sure. but relate with the originator or the people that invented this music. And let's start to share to a real exchange. And then maybe you know what I mean? Yeah, sure. So think a bit more clearly about where this music is coming from. Speaking from personal experience, when I visited some of the townships in... Johannesburg, you're struck by the difficult situation that people are facing. But what was also very obvious to me was the kind of... just the energy and the raw passion for music and for creativity. So I was really wondering, you know, in the townships and in these communities, how important are music events? Well, in Johannesburg, I'm not going to say because I'm from there, but I've never seen like the proper scene in Johannesburg. But in events, not lots of GOM producers are being put in huge events in South Africa. But the GOM DJs, they play a lot in clubs, in clubs or small festivals that we have in Cape Town. But Joburg, I don't know the scene there, man. For the most part in Durban, where are people going to hear this music? What's their party situation? They play a lot in clubs. Yeah, in clubs. 101. 101 is the best club for a bomb. Two clubs, even Havana. Yeah, 101 in Havana is one of the biggest clubs that play gong. What were your experiences like? Because you visited for the first time six months ago, right? Or a bit longer? You're talking about club? Yes, yeah. Yeah, I went in 101 to listen to DJ Leg. It was crazy, it was crazy, crazy. It was part of young guys' dancing hearts. all night long was really nice. It was a really nice experience. So when you say dancing, we're talking about the benga? Bang. Bang, okay. And break down the dance for us. Where does this come from? Just like I told you, man, the dancing in Durban is one of the best things that people do. The young people like... That's the thing that can put them in the right way, like getting off to drugs and all those things. But dancing is quite a big thing in Durban. So I think that's why Qom is so big, because it has this connection with dancing, because Qom is for dancing, actually. But was this a style of dance that predated Qom? Which came first is what I'm asking. But dancing is something that came first before BOM. When BOM came about, that's where dancing became too big in Durban. You guys are about to embark on a fairly extensive European and Asian tour. Unsound is the first date. You're also playing in London, you're playing in Panorama Bar, Italy. Tokyo, is that right? Tokyo, China. Tokyo, Shanghai, Beijing, and Seoul, yeah. So, I mean, this is very early, essentially, for the international development of the scene and the sound. I'm just really wondering, over the next couple years, say, what is a dream scenario for you? You know, what are your personal ambitions as a DJ and as a label owner? I really don't know, first of all. because the guys in Durban are always creating new style, new genres. Also now Om is moving, there is this new style Scopo, also they're mixing Scopo with Om. So what is that exactly? Scopo is a kind of a house. Maybe DJ can explain better. Okay, Scopo is a similar sign from GOM. but it's more for beats and it's kind of commercial but it has like elements from okay yeah the kicks are just on the face yeah yeah is is less underground is less extreme it's less underground it's more commercial i think but anyway i don't know my perfect scenario my dream actually is to bring the guys over here from south africa in europe So we are working on that actually. We are also bringing Dominoe in Swiss in December and also Mafia Boys the summer season. So actually this is my dream scenario is to bring the guys because also all the guys are their own style of gum. So it's interesting to listen to everybody. And also, my dream scenario, we were talking about that, like, and I think Lag, the gum king, is the one who can do that. So the next step is in South Africa. Something needs to change in South Africa. Something needs to change? Yeah, something like the next step, it's being like mainstream giant in South Africa. So we are working on that. To get like... the big artists the big singers like the singers to to start recording on on if you were in a situation in a couple years time where you have mainstream recording artists singing or rapping or whatever over these rhythm patterns would that make you happy would you say yeah yeah it will make would you like to produce like for pop artists yes yes i would love to do that because it's i will get a chance and i'll get a chance that to get my music being played on radio or being played on tv because you'll never find a bomb track being played on greater because it's just instrumental music Nobody's singing on it, but they all came out of Kool Kid now. He got like four beats from me. So on his new album, maybe he's gonna record one track or two tracks on Insta. So I think that's the next step for Tom. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Getting moolah, moolah. And dressing Gucci, actually. Should be perfect. This is our dream scenario. We're about at the end. Does anybody have any questions at this stage? As gum through your label, Francesco, has gone more outwards, I am wondering, and it's a question for DJ Luck, I'm wondering, because of that, if there is more music coming inwards as well to South Africa, and if gum producers have been influenced by other styles. like British, jungle, whatever, other club music? Actually, not really, because we have to understand this thing that, and this is really interesting, that the guys really don't know our music. They really don't know. Obviously, there is a kind of exchange. After we go to shoot the documentary, I knew there are a lot of people are going there from Europe to shoot. also sharing files. Also, we are going to share files. I'm going to give him a lot of music. I don't know if it's good because I like the purity of GOM because it's the most interesting thing. We are on the opposite side of the world, but we can really feel it. So, yeah. But actually, it's pure. They really don't know nothing about our music. and this is so interesting but I'm interested to see and I'm wondering did you like how you will respond to this later because when you're touring through the world like I know from the footwork artists DJs that came from Chicago when they started touring the world and they discovered like jungle music and suddenly everybody's exchanging samples and It can be interesting to see how hybrid music is going to work with Gunn. Yes, yes. Tonight we are going to listen to the other artists on sound. Also to be in a panorama bar. I think he will be influenced about that. And this is good. It's really interesting what will happen in the future. I mean, are you aware of, you heard the music of any of the artists that you're playing alongside on the tour? No, I don't have any music, man. So I just want to stay and listen to the new styles. Maybe we can try and work with those guys and see what's going to happen. I have another question. I am wondering, in the calm music scene, how gendered it is? Is there also female performers? And how is the relation with the people dancing, like male versus female? Are there differences in dances? No, actually. In Western culture, we are always afraid about that. I don't know why, but because it's a different environment, but there's not any girls producing. It's just boys. But they sing, they sing. They sing, yeah. They like, we call it themes. They like sing this short thing. It's like, what you call? Yeah, like a chop vocals. Yeah, like chop vocals. Like small clips of a girl singing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This artist, this Gemma Beko is always using all his girlfriends. to recording some really interesting vocals. - Nice. - Yeah. - But how about at the parties? What's the ratio usually, male, female? - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's fairly-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, completely. I was just wondering about your relationship with Goon Club All Stars, who obviously have been pushing the genre a lot in London. Our relationship, I'm a friend of Felix. We knew each other before because I had a previous label. We follow each other. And also he was the one who helped me at the beginning because I didn't have any contacts, for example, just to print a vinyl. So he really helped me. I remember when I started, I had a really nice phone call. And yeah, he really helped me. So we are related in a way. But Goon Club also has a different concept because the view is on all electronic music. My label is focused on Durban scene, actually. Okay, so I have a question. Actually, I think for both. It's also a bit about the cohesion in the gum scene. For instance, I'm wondering, because what struck me quite well, I listened to all your compilations. a lot and when Jules the DJ died of TLC fam it was like this big shock because he's quite young artist very talented part of a bigger group and then this tribute song came out by TLC fam and I'm wondering like how is the impact of his passing away in the gum scene is that like something that we have to understand that because The guys actually, they did tracks mostly for their township. So, for example, the RCFM are really famous in Newlands West. They are pretty famous. They are big. There are 23 people in the crew. And they did tracks all together. It's crazy. And Forgotten Souls of the Meshon Boys are famous in Waterloo. The Taks in Waterloo, they play their tracks, so it's different from our music scene. It's very local, it's very local. Giuseppe DJ, I agree, he's amazing. And it's really nice because all these artists had their own... words. It's a word. Jules is different. Everybody are different from each other. That was my aim to show all these different styles. Thanks very much to Francesco. Outro Music
