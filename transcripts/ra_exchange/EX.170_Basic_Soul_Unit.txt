*music* Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Ropline, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. For the past decade, Stuart Lee has made a name for himself in dance music as basic soul unit. His tunes, brittle yet wonderfully thumping, have found fans across club genres, landing on labels as diverse as Dolly, Nonplus, and Mathematics, plus his own labor music imprint. It's made him something of an international concern. despite hailing from a city, Toronto, that's not especially renowned for its electronic music scene. When Stuart came by our Berlin office earlier this month, he explained why he's not expecting to relocate closer to the European market any time soon, and how he balances fatherhood with his life as a musical obsessive. you I was reading kind of a little bit about your history and one story really stuck out something I didn't know and thought was really interesting really cool and that's this Jamaican connection with your music. Why don't you tell that story? Well, basically, my grandmother emigrated to Jamaica when my dad and his brothers were still very young. And my dad was the only one that stayed behind in Hong Kong, hence I was born and raised in Hong Kong. But all his brothers pretty much grew up in Jamaica, so they were used to going to parties. like back in the day, sound systems and all that. And so when I did finally immigrate to Canada, you know, we got together quite often with them. And sometimes even in the house, there would be like dance parties with my uncles and aunts. And from that angle, I was always exposed, this was probably mid to late 80s, to a lot of reggae, I mean commercial reggae, but it's still good stuff. A lot of soul and R&B from the 80s, you know, like Luther Van Jaws, People Bryson kind of stuff. And so yeah, that kind of like... I think influenced me a lot because a kid coming from Hong Kong it was really like minimal not much of a scene there and especially if you're like a native Hong Konger you're more likely to be just like listening to HK pop or whatever and so yeah that really sort of influenced my sort of like slant into soul music which you know, like kind of developed as I was getting into club music as well. Yeah, I can imagine that that's not necessarily a background that kind of a lot of people who otherwise hit a lot of the points that your background does have. Yeah, I think I was really like lucky to be where I was growing up at the time that I was. I mean, I was, you know, like too young to go to. We had a club called the Twilight Zone, which was basically kind of like the, quote, paradise garage of Toronto. But even around that time, I was exposed to a lot of house music, hip hop music as it was coming out, like back in those days and fresh. Like it was just. like something totally new and you know different um so yeah definitely I feel like I was kind of like coming up at the right time do you remember when you first made contact with like dance music proper with house music um I would, I mean, proper, I would, I would have to say like, I went to a lot of, I mean, even in high school, there was a lot of all ages parties. I remember going to like RPM zoo bar and stuff like that. And there was house music, but like to say, I went to a proper party. it would have probably like an after hours kind of warehouse or loft party. Not, not really. It wasn't rave yet. It was like early nineties, 92, 93. And, um, That's where I think I heard proper house music. A lot of Strictly Rhythm, a lot of Nervous, a lot of Chicago, Detroit stuff all mixed together. And that actually relates to the geography of Toronto being in the center in between Detroit, Chicago, and New York. And we also had UK influences too. And so, yeah, I remember going to like these after hours parties. I can't really exactly remember which one was first. There was a bunch of venues, 23 Hop, Victoria Street. Yeah, just a bunch of stuff. And it was the first place I went to. And this is me as a suburban high school kid, Chinese. uh where you know like i was exposed to i mean i'd already known known about the music but kind of exposed to like a black crowd gay crowd mixed crowd and everybody was really like into the music they knew the lyrics sing along breakdown everybody was like going nuts so I would say those days were kind of like the proper first exposure. You describe Toronto as being this kind of nexus. There were all of these different styles. Geographically, it was close or at least at a midpoint between a lot of... different places. I wonder if that's almost a better way of encountering dance music. There's less baggage. Right, right. Yeah, I think it's a plus and a minus. I mean, if you talk to a lot of Toronto people, they would even admit that there's not really a distinctive Toronto sound, at least consciously. because we had influences from all over, because it was a big enough city to have a lot of different parts of the scene. I guess in the early 90s, it was still kind of very together because at that point, it was still all house music. I mean, unless you're into hip hop or reggae or something else. But even at those parts, some parts were still together. you would hear like hip-hop, reggae, soca, house and then later on it was still kind of like if you went to a house party was still a mix of like like I said Chicago, New York, Detroit and you know even UK stuff so in a way it's like we never really had our own sound but we took in all these sounds and kind of maybe like regurgitated them you know i mean and and in a way like a lot of that's why i think toronto's always been known as a place for heads because everybody's just into so many different music were there were there any djs who you really looked up to people whose musical taste kind of informed your own yeah definitely um well the the main store well the first store was um Star Sound on Yonge Street. There was another couple stores. One was Carnival. One is Pledy Records. Pledy Records is probably the only one that's still there that's still selling. Well, the others are gone for sure, but the only record store that kind of still sells dance music, I guess. And I met a few people there, in particular Aki, who runs Cosmos Records Now, which is kind of like a collector's vintage shop. and actually worked at Cosmos for quite a few years. But back then, he was kind of like one of him and Mark, another guy. It was always Mark and Aki that was one of the groups of warehouse DJs. And then another would be PTS, which is Peter Tyrone and Shams. And Tyrone still does a lot of productions under 83 West, which is more kind of like, I guess, like the Jersey sound. But yeah, it was always those two groups and those two always informed me a lot. And then later on, there was Jason Palma and Dave Campbell, who kind of like... took over sort of like around the same time. And I still play with Jason Palma. He's a big influence on me as far as like, I would say Aki and Jason are the two biggest influences on me. They were both house DJs at that point, but they're also very musically diverse. So, I mean, like we've kind of gone through the whole. the floor of like different music we all just love it you know like whether whether it's house techno uh rare groove soul latin jazz afro beat whatever it's they they really kind of set set my direction and djs and for musical taste a lot of guys when they start putting out records on the sorts of labels that you've put out records on at the rate that you've put out records. A lot of guys might decide they want to move to Berlin or London, a larger market. But you've stayed in Toronto, and I get the sense that you're still, in a way, kind of a local DJ there. Yeah. It's, well, I mean, it's partially a necessity because I'm a family man and we have a house and a mortgage and all that. So picking up and going is a little bit hard because, I mean, at this stage, I'm still not really making a full living from DJing or music. And since I'm not the one with the stable income, it's really hard to kind of take off and just go. But yeah, the other point is I love the city and I love living there. So it's, you know, like it would, I would be kind of sad to leave. Although if I was 20 something, I probably would just to go for it and try to, you know, make a bigger shot at it. But yeah, I think it's a great city. It's very multicultural. And like there's a lot of things going on musically. And I the funny thing as far as gigs is concerned is that I have done a monthly with with Jason Palma, as I mentioned, and another friend, General Eclectic. That's more like the jazz sort of thing. And it's our 11th year. So I've been known more in the city for that. And only recently. Because of my productions and such, I think I've kind of reached to the younger crowd. I mean, partially because I don't get out so much anymore because of my age. But yeah, like now I've been playing out a bit more and kind of getting reacquainted with the community. You mentioned that jazz is kind of something that, you know, for a long time you were almost known better for. Yeah. What was your introduction to jazz? Did it come at a similar time to when you were introduced to soul and reggae and all of that? No, I mean, the soul and reggae kind of came first because I was a kid, like I said. hang out with my aunts and uncles they weren't necessarily into jazz they were into like kind of more like boogie like kind of groovy kind of music and um the jazz kind of came later i mean i was into house i was into hip-hop i was into house and what and whatnot and there was a point in time kind of like mid-90s like post that sort of loft warehouse scene just about before rave started And I wasn't really into raves and I wasn't really into the house that was coming out at the time because it was just kind of getting a little harder and I was always more like kind of skewed towards the soulful side of things. It was like a lot of quote like. progressive house, tribal house and industrial house and stuff like that. Yeah, I remember reading that, that the rave thing kind of didn't click with you. Yeah, yeah. And I mean, in hindsight, it's still not really my vibe if I think back to who I was at that time. But I mean, sure, there's a lot of music that I missed at that point that I would have. if I dug deeper, I probably would have dug. But yeah. And then at that point I was kind of digging more into this. Well, like it was a progression, you know, like disco samples that house use and then kind of like blew my mind because it was like all this great, like music, soulful arranged music, organic. And. From there, I got into like rare grooves, soul, jazz, funk and all that. So it's kind of like a progression, I suppose. DJing with jazz, probably a much different thing. DJing house records, DJing techno records. Is that kind of an art all its own? It is. And basically, I mean, you could, it's, you know, there's so much of a range of music you can play with that. And approaches can be so different. You know, you can tackle it from a turntablist point of view, of course. And you can, but more or less, it's like about music selection and music programming and progression throughout the night. I mean, when we, back in those days, you know, like we were kind of like looking to Europe. It was like Giles Peterson, Patrick Forge, and those kind of guys. And they were doing the jazz thing in the UK, Norman Jay and so forth. And so Jazzanova and Jason, who I aforementioned, and Aki actually, Jason, Aki, and a few other guys put together a party called Movement. and invited a lot of those guys over. And so we kind of took a lot of cues from that. It was more about creating a vibe with the music and the programming. In terms of how you started producing, you made your first tracks, I believe, using free software that you got from a music magazine. Tell me about that. Well, I've never been and I'm still not really a gearhead. I've not never been really good at the technical stuff. I mean, I definitely don't use a ghostwriter. But so, I mean, like, and I've always been more of a DJ. I've been buying those records since the late 80s. So I never really, even though, you know, I'm a graphic designer, creative person, I've always been kind of interested in it. I never really spent money on gear. synths or whatever. And so, yeah, it was really only because of the development of software and digital production that I was really kind of able to kind of noodle around with it, I guess. And I got this, I don't remember what the program was called. It was like from computer music magazine or something or other. And basically it was a free program. I put together the track. It was called Basic Soul. And at that point, a friend of mine in Toronto, John Kumahara, was starting this label called Iwanai. And I was like, ah, cool. There's some stuff that I did. Check it out. He was like, yeah, let's just put it out and see what happens. And that was the start of it. And yeah, I mean, like I know a little bit more than I used to, of course, but I've just never really been the technical kind of guy. Did you have much of a musical background in terms of playing music? No, not at all. I think my parents made me take... piano for about a year. I didn't even like get past the first exam. And that was the end of that. And everything is really by ear and kind of clicking buttons and noodling around and kind of. figuring it out on my own. Well, and if you were working as a graphic designer, then I wonder if like familiarity with something like Photoshop almost made making music on a computer seem more natural. Yeah, I think that had a large part to do with it because I'm a visual person. So I didn't really have any troubles with using software, like, you know, using the matrix and just kind of... plotting little notes here and there and uh i'm still fine working that way i try to incorporate some gear now and then but um yeah so i i think definitely that that has something to do with the approach You can sense in your music like and it's sort of in the name itself It's kind of implied this kind of wanting to get back to basics in a way, but but it's not really minimalism I mean, how do you describe the sort of music you make is basic soul unit? Yeah, it's just basic in the sense that it's like, it's what's necessary is there. It's not minimal as far as like a sound palette, you know. it could be full like you know lush synths or whatever but I try not to like use I don't really like use too many effects and stuff like that to to kind of like garnish it and it's really just about the arrangement about the music itself about the groove or about the melody and so that was kind of the basis of it did you feel like at a certain point you kind of started to to hit a stride kind of with your sound Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, it kind of goes in cycles because every time I think I have something, that's my sound. Then the next time you make something, it's like, no, this is just a copy of it. I don't want to do that. And you want to kind of evolve. But I would say like maybe the first time that I kind of had an inkling of the way I wanted to go is. probably when I did the mathematics release on Jamal's label. And he, I mean, I sent him the tracks, and he was the one that actually really pushed me to take it further, go further out, play with the sounds, just, you know, like, go into outer space, just go for it. And so that really kind of helped me go through the process of, like, just figuring out, you know, what's... going beyond just the template of like being inspired by Chicago or Detroit or whatever. So you sent stuff to Jamal Moss. How did you first make contact with this guy? How did you hear about him? Because at the time he was pretty underground. Yeah, I can't remember to be honest. I'm pretty sure I had a few records. I don't remember where I bought it from or how, but it was some of the early Sun God stuff and some of his hieroglyphic stuff. And I think I just got in touch through Myspace when it was still the thing and just said, yo, I really love your music. And then I think he had listened to my stuff and said, cool, I like your stuff. Send me some tracks and stuff. So it basically just started that way from what I can recall. Your sound has been very kind of malleable. I mean, when you think about some of the different labels that you've put stuff out on, it's kind of been all over the place. It's sort of bass music on one end. It's kind of very housey on the other end. I mean, do you put yourself into a particular camp or are you just making tunes? I'm just making tunes. I think it's, you know, like obvious from what I said before, as far as my influences being into house techno, broken beat, jazz, this, that, even drum and bass sometimes. I'm not really an expert in anything. If anything, I probably know more about house than anything else. But I listen to like a bit of everything. So it all kind of filters through. And that was a conscious decision when I was... making music even though I think the earlier stuff was definitely an obvious reference to Chicago and Detroit that I think it was just natural that I was going to do other stuff like I definitely wanted to I didn't want to be pigeonholed and I think that like as long as that kind of somehow subconsciously ties together I'm sure there's you know like some something that's me in every one of the tracks hopefully Is that ever tough when you come over here to DJ? You know, you get booked for a gig and people know the Nonplus record, get booked for another one, people know the Dolly record, and it's different people buying both records. Right, right. For sure. I mean, like, there's been times when... I'm playing techno and people are like, oh, you should play more soulful or I'm playing soulful. And they're like, oh, play harder. But for the most part, it's worked out for the better because I think people kind of tend to know what I'm about now. And, you know, like in my sets, I try to play a variety of stuff for the most part. I mean, if it's a techno party, then it's going to have that slant or if it's house, that slant but I still try to incorporate different elements in my set so mm-hmm I guess occasionally you know your stuff will sort of be put if not in this sort of base bin then sort of in this more far out techno side of things like like with the stuff you've released on non on non plus yeah what do you sort of make of that whole scene because this is something that's probably very different than what you've come up with. In a way, but I mean, as far as the UK goes, there's definitely a lineage of bottom heavy sounds of like... forward-thinking beats and so I kind of you know like I can't say that I'm an expert again but I kind of understand that because I was into the earlier stuff too and so to me like of course if you think about say like drum and bass and even some of the earlier dubstep and stuff like it's actually if if you listen and you know house then it's surprising how many house diva vocals they sample right So there's a lineage. I mean, like from when house development to like techno to hardcore to breaks or whatever, there was kind of like a progression that might not be obvious to people that are into particular segments of the scene. And so for me, it was natural. Like, it didn't feel like it was weird or out there. But I don't know. It's from my perspective, I guess. So it's hard to say. Sure. You put out an album last year. Well, I guess the vinyl came out this year. Right, early this year. So it sort of spanned both years. Tell me about the process of writing a basic soul unit album. Yeah, it actually started probably like five or six years ago. And Jerome from Still approached me, said he liked my stuff, wanted to do something. and eventually we talked on the phone he's like yeah i'd like to do an album and um at that point i was like cool i just you know i was young younger not young and i was like uh it's a cool opportunity i like the label and what he was doing and so we were like okay let's do it and then um i did some tracks and he liked them but then i I think what happened was he had some distributor issues and distribution issues. So it was kind of on the back burner until last year. And in the meantime, I kind of like scrapped the earlier tracks, kept maybe Clouds and Breathe. I think those are the only tracks from earlier and started anew, which I thought was actually better in the end because I had more time to sort of mature and develop. think about the direction I wanted to do the album and with the album as far as my thoughts is like I wanted to make a dance music album I mean it was going to be soulful and deep probably but it wasn't going to be, I wasn't doing, you know, like a lot of beatless interludes and little skits and just because it was an album that, you know, I'm a dance music artist, this is me, right? Right. Yeah. It's almost like a, like a cliche of the dance music album. There's going to be some slow stuff, some beatless stuff. You just wanted to do four, four. Yeah. And, and, and again, like I think I had a hopefully within the same spectrum, different types of tracks. And also the track listing was essential to me because... as a dance music album and not really I wanted to make it listenable of course so it was more like a progression like I wanted it to have a flow and I think that's hopefully ties the tracks together figuring out that flow was that something that came at the very end of the process or were you thinking about that as you were producing? It was kind of like in the back of my mind, but because I was working on different types of tracks, I knew I wanted to do some soulful, some more banging and this and that. But the order really came at the end when I had the tracks and then I was trying to figure out how the flow would go. Almost like picking a mix and picking out, you know, like ordering. programming the mix, I guess. Was there any sense in this process that maybe this was somehow more of a rewarding experience than just writing an EP or just producing individual tracks? I mean, are you keen to do this again? Not in a mean... immediate rush. I feel like if the time comes where I feel like I have something concrete to say that can fit into a package of that size, then yes. And it's definitely a total piece. I think you can ask any DJ producer that's put out an album. It's a totally different thing than putting out a 12-inch because a 12-inch, you're just kind of like putting together two or three tracks of dance music. I mean, it could be abstract, it could be bangers, but it's a shorter period where you can have a couple ideas and you just throw it out there. Whereas I think with an album you really with you know, like at least eight tracks or more You're kind of trying to think of an overall arc or concept and that that's a totally different thing. Yeah mm-hmm, so You mentioned this before You're a family man. Yeah, you feel like you're a little older than a lot of other guys very much in this game How old are you? If you want to say. No, I'm cool. I'm 39. I'm going to be 40 next year. Sure. How is that? I mean, when you see, when you come over to Europe and you're playing this, you know, a rave or you're playing panorama bar or something like this, you know, do you, do you sort of feel like you're too old for it? Do you feel like it's, it's, I mean, what is your perspective on this, on this being older than, than a number of guys who are doing this now? Sometimes, but not really, because I think one thing is like musically, whether you're young or old, if you kind of have the same wavelength, you kind of communicate anyway. So I think it's great for younger people to converse with the older experienced people and vice versa, you know, like keeps the older people fresh, too. And the other thing is, like, with electronic music and club music now, it's like, it's kind of like rock, you know? Like, our parents grew up on it. Well, my dad didn't, but our parents grew up on it, and they're still into it. And it's what we grew up on. So, you know, like, there are ex-Ravens. and ex-house people and club people that still kind of get it and know what the groove is. They might be into a more mature thing now, and maybe some people have written it off, but a lot of people still listen to electronic music. So I don't think it's such a big gap as it used to be. Having a family, having a mortgage and all of that, does that make it tough to take three weeks and come to Europe to play a bunch of shows? Yeah. At first, I wasn't too bothered by it. But, of course, as a family man and as you watch your child grow and you become attached to them. The more I go, the quicker I miss them. So, yeah, it's definitely harder. But at the same time, it's, you know, like I can't complain. I get to travel. I do what I love. And when I'm there, I still love it. And I don't even mind the traveling hassle part of it for the most part. So, yeah, it's a tough balance. But I think, you know, I'd rather have my daughter see me doing something that I really be an influence I'm not going to, I, it's, it's at a point where I know that, you know, and she's starting full-time school, uh, like in kindergarten. So in a few years, it's going to be harder for me to leave a lot. It's at a point where like, I know I can't be the guy that's going to be on the road 24 seven, like, you know, like 52 weeks a year. But, um, I definitely. don't mind getting out there and for her to see that i'm doing something that i love for sure is she a music fan herself yeah yeah it's funny because uh she has a specific way of calling my music especially the stuff with the acid and she calls it boom boom meow meow Of course, like the cat sound kind of sounds like acid. But I think kids, you know, they're very like in sort of like intuitive. They hear music on that level and they feel the rhythm and the groove. I mean, she's into like kid stuff, too, of course. Of course. Some pop stuff. But yeah, she sometimes she tells. me to turn it on just because she likes to hear it. Do you think about, you know, in 10 years, 15 years, something like that, and she's starting to go out to these parties? I mean, I've heard other DJs sort of express that having kids, you know, and then they go out to a party, it freaks them out a little bit. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Maybe it will. But I already have, like, nieces and nephews that are in university. And they've been to my gigs before. And I was like, whoa. But at the same time, it's cool because it's great that they're interested to check it out. I mean, I don't think I've influenced them, like, in that way because, you know, they're not club heads or anything. Yeah, it's cool to have some kind of musical guidance in your child, I guess. I mean, she's free to listen to whatever she wants to, and I'm sure when she's a teenager, she's going to be doing their thing. Like, what is house music, Dad? But I think at the end of the day, it would be cool for her to kind of... kind of like be exposed to this kind of music. That's not, especially in North America, that's not necessarily mainstream radio music. Speaking of children, you also recently started your own label. Right, yeah. Tell me a little bit about this project. Yeah. I mean, it's definitely something I've wanted to do for a long time. I think as any DJ producer dreams of like having their own labels, it's their baby, creative freedom, creative control kind of thing. And it may not be the best time financially to do it, but I think now that I've kind of really feel like I know what I am as far as musical direction and what I like. I thought it was about time after the album and after the few releases that I had. So I basically got the idea and what I wanted to do also was to showcase a lot of local talent. It's not exclusively the local label, but I did really want to be an access point or help. help local artists have some kind of platform to expose what's going on in Toronto. And right now it's being distributed through Diamonds and Pearls, which is in Berlin. And yeah, so just kind of going with the flow and putting music that I like, basically. Nothing, no grand. scheme or concept or anything like that. It's interesting about local talent in Toronto. I mean, for a long time, it just maybe wasn't something that a lot of people thought about. I know recently, at least in mainstream circles, with people like Drake and The Weeknd, there's suddenly this awareness that there is a lot of music in Toronto, and that extends to the underground. Yeah, definitely. I think it was a generational thing whereas before you had the neck holders you had the stickmen and stuff like that back in the days And then, I mean, it's like I say, like with Toronto, there was stuff going on. There were people producing. But I think because we didn't really have a cohesive scene, like, I mean, it's not like people weren't friendly, but we just kind of like looked at things from afar, especially back in the days when the Internet wasn't so prevalent. It was like, oh, like all these guys in Europe or in the U.S. is like gods to us in a way. A few people did put efforts and put things out, but it wasn't like I didn't feel like there was a big drive to be a lot of producers. I mean, maybe there was a lot of bedroom producers. I don't know. But with the new generation, there's there's a bunch of kids that are really motivated that are kind of like, you know, like digging deeper. really trying. I think it's developing. There's definitely potential that if we keep it up, there might be some sort of Toronto scene or sound. I was going to ask if you felt like there's sort of a homegrown sound growing. I don't know. I think it's better to ask you because from the inside, it's really hard to tell. You're so close to it. I think right now, as with a lot of places in the world, there's this mashup of just like bass and techno and house all together. And it's maybe it's the way that we put it together is different. I don't know. But yeah, it's really hard from my angle. I don't. Do you have any sort of. feel for me i'd have to think about it i mean the stuff that's on your label i mean so you put out the first release yeah there was a second release from what was the church yeah there's definitely some similarity between these two records i mean taking two records like that's not really like right a full-on scientific study of the sound of toronto yeah but yeah And then there's other guys like Kevin McPhee, of course. Of course, yeah. Like Gingy and Bordello, Nathalos. And those guys, though, sound definitely a bit different than your stuff. Yeah. Still compatible. Right, exactly. But it definitely has its own angle. Yeah, yeah. And I think maybe down the road, a few more interactions, and I've met these guys and we're connecting and stuff. So who knows? Maybe there'll be a little bit more. Mixing up of stuff, you know, mashing up and we'll see what happens. Do you still have the day job? Are you still working as a graphic designer? Yeah, yeah. Like I said, I still do not make a living from music. Every year is a little busier and just kind of go with the flow. Yeah, especially when you live in North America, it's a bit hard to keep it on the regular. I mean, the market's only so big. There's only like really five or six cities you can play in. And then when I do get the chance to go to Europe, it's a few weeks at a time. So it's really hard. And I mean, I have a feeling that if I moved here, it would be a lot easier. be easier because you know when you're here it's it's it's easy for people to fly from like berlin to somewhere for for the night and it's cheap and you know it's easy to get back and forth but even then there's no guarantee because you know there might be a big market here but it's quite saturated at the same time so In those like five or six cities, you know, in North America where you kind of can regularly get gigs. I mean, have you sensed a sort of ramping up there? Does it seem like dance music is becoming more popular? And I'm talking about underground dance music. Yeah, it feels like it. I've been getting more bookings in the last year or two. And so from what I can see on the underground, I mean, things look pretty healthy to me. And now I've made a lot of connections to promoters and artists in other scenes. So it definitely feels like there's something growing for sure. In terms of your own music, you know, you put the album out recently. You've started the label. Is there anything that... you'd still really like to tackle under the basic soul unit moniker um not consciously like i said um because i don't do it full-time you know i just go with the flow and take opportunities as they come so It's never really been kind of like an objective, like other than playing music, being DJ music, playing music and making music. And that's those are kind of the bottom lines from from a business standpoint. I have been thinking about it because, like I said, it's not sustainable. So I'm just kind of trying to figure out what other. avenues of income can I do with music to make it sustainable, whether it's somehow being involved in, in this like city cultural arts aspect events. I don't know. Like it's just, it's tough. Yeah. It's, it's not, it's not easy to, it's not easy to make a living doing it. this i think no matter where you are yeah and especially not if you have kids and a mortgage and all that stuff yeah and and it's it's i mean i think a lot of people would actually be surprised how many people with quote names out there that don't do it full-time and in general even if you do make it to that point it's like there's no guarantee that you know in six months you're still going to be up there so I think it's always like good to have a plan b my just trying to figure out if there's a plan b that's musically related you know it's I like design and I don't think I would have any problems quitting music per se like I don't think I would ever quit it maybe I would still make music but just less and maybe not be able to travel as much But just, you know, like music is becoming like an over consuming thing for a lot of us junkies. And so after 40 years, of course, I realized this because even when I was young, I never like at that point, it's like you don't even dream about. making a career out of a DJ. Like, we didn't really have a lot of traveling DJs back then, maybe a couple here or there. It's only really become a thing in the last 10 years, maybe. And so to get to this point, I'm like, okay, I'm realizing that this is what is me, like music in some way, form or other, whether it's radio show or somehow I want to be involved. so hopefully I can figure out something to do with my life if I'm not DJing or making music.
