♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Good afternoon, my name is Magnus. Welcome to this live edition of RA Exchange here at Inner City Electronic. Thanks to you all for coming down. Today we've got some very special guests. I'm sure we don't need to give them much of an introduction. Everybody knows, or most people here should know, Orbital. Paul and Phil Hartnell started out in the late 80s, became one of the biggest acts in British dance music. Most of you have probably seen them live. Let's bring them on. Paul and Phil Hartnell, Orbital. Thank you. Thanks. So how are you doing today? All good? Yeah, very good actually. First gig of the year. Where did that sort of love of sci-fi and in particular, I guess, the music of science fiction, television and films sort of first take hold of the two of you? I think growing up in the 70s and being sort of bombarded with the radio-phonic workshop music from kids' TV, kids' programs, TV programs and things like that. the kind of do you remember that lost in space lost in space that was one of the earliest things i remember jerry anderson all of that stuff you know and there's lots of sci-fi you know i suppose because we grew up in the the sort of immediate aftermath of the space race so everything was kind of space orientated and that kind of thing um what else you know they're all the sort of six o'clock sci-fi wednesday films so they'd show all those you know like um Yeah, but I was thinking more films like The Day of the Triffids and The Incredible Shrinking Man and all that kind of thing. You know, it was great. So I was getting to see all these great old black and white classic sci-fis, you know, as a kid. And Doctor Who, of course, you know, more radio-phonic workshop madness. Yeah, and obviously you covered for the All Together and also in your live show for a long time, the theme tune, the D.D. Darbyshire, one grain of theme tune. I should ask you, therefore, at this point, were you proper Doctor Who fans, like what they would call Whovians or just casual? Well, that's an interesting one because I would say I was as a kid because we were, our parents were very sort of strict about family dinner time. You know, you all sit around the table, very, you know, good, good sort of upbringing in that kind of way, except I was allowed to sit and eat my dinner on Saturday night in front of the telly to watch Doctor Who because dinner time was when Doctor Who was on. Bad planning, my parents' point of view. But I used to go and sit in there and watch it. I think it was a free pass for anyone who wanted to, but nobody else really cared. So I used to sit and, you know, watch Tom Baker on my own. Yeah, I was much more lost in space, boys. Star Trek as well let's not forget oh Star Trek look at me look at me all generations it's not really having an influence is it to be fair Star Trek has obviously made an appearance hasn't it in some of your tracks I wouldn't know what you're talking about sample form I don't know what yeah We'll move on. Obviously the kind of sci-fi thing and film soundtracks is one theme. Obviously it's been in your work for a long time. But also activism as well, certainly environmentalism. You know, that's going back to really the... First couple of albums and Impact, I guess, as well, on the Brown album. Yeah. People remember. Now, you played, didn't you, for part of the Extinction Rebellion protests? Yeah. How was that? That was great fun. Well, it was quite fun because the last demonstration I was at was the poll tax demonstration, actually, where I was throwing rocks at the police. right vans was quite funny and then next thing you know the next because there wasn't you know Greenpeace and all that you know Extinction Rebellion came along it was like the non-violent sort of thing because fashion stopped too many sort of political demos that are worthy anyway and all that and there they are they've like stopped the whole play they've stopped Trafalgar Square for like two weeks It's just like brilliant and then you know and then we played a gig there Did a few DJ things to help fundraise for like people got arrested to help legal fees and stuff like that But they you know, they're a bit fluffy around the edges, but they just start in you know, and it's great You know, it's like but you know, and it was like I don't know for us It was like the cause that came along that was sort of picked us up again us for pick me up again sort of going along joining in with saving the planet well yeah it's a bit a little you know a bit a little too late really for us but that's my I guess you you came through at a time when there was that tension between rave culture and the police and the criminal justice act as well which you obviously were quite outspoken about at the time Just to rewind a little bit, to go a bit further back, I'm quite interested in finding out about, we're in Leeds today, so I'm interested to hear about the first time that you came and played live here in Leeds, or the first PA, I guess you mean. So when was that? It was a live performance. PA normally implies miming, doesn't it? Yes. We didn't do, yeah. Top of the Pops was a mime. Everybody mimes on Top of the Pops. I've never been comfortable about that. No, Leeds, it was one of our earliest gigs. We did a little mini tour. Warehouse. With Sasha. With Sasha, yeah. I mean, it was brilliant fun. It was 1990. We stayed at Sasha's mum's house, didn't we? Yeah, that's what it was. It was as if mum was like, all of you in one room. Was that David Holmes' house? No, we did do that at David Holmes' house as well. I don't know if it was Sasha's mum's house. It was someone's house in the spare room when we were all just laid out on the floor. No, it wasn't his mum. It was Sparrow. Sparrow was it? Oh, whatever. Yeah, it might have been Sparrow's mum's house. This is something like rolling in at three o'clock in the morning. That's what it was like, though. Back then, it was the whole of the dance music scene, certainly in It wasn't really about, nobody was thinking about making money. The good people, any of the people you kind of met, like, you know, people like Sasha and their club, it was all about, look, we've got this place. We can play house music at people and everyone's coming. Isn't it brilliant? And come and play live. Yeah, of course. And, you know, that was great. We kind of ended up hooking up with loads of different people around the country, didn't we? Like and things like that and everyone had this same kind of enthusiasm and come on, look what's happening and was really trying to create something. It was these little puddles of this kind of thing that would turn into rave sort of just growing out of what was, you know, nightclub culture before that was pretty much... you know, sort of bad pop disco music and get beaten up at the end, you know. And sticky carpets. Sticky carpets. Well, to be fair, raves had sticky carpets. Don't pretend anything else, you know. But, you know, all of a sudden it was a unification of people being friendly to each other and boys and girls talking to each other and there not being this kind of tension. that used to go on in the nightclubs used to be frightening places before because of ecstasy right and dance music I say let's not just blame the drugs it's not blaming it it's a good thing it came along it did quell the macho So we have violence and that's how violence works. It's interesting when you talk about, you know, Thatcher did have, you say the tension between ravers and the police. I mean, the police just do what they're told, really. And she spent huge amounts of money getting Metropolitan Police coming in and like stopping little squat parties and stuff like this. It's like, what is the matter with them? You know, I can only think that she didn't have a cut of the ecstasy market or something like that up and tobacco, you know, and everything else if you think about it, really. There were certainly a few promoters, weren't there, who were quite thatch right and who had come from sort of more of a background where they'd kind of worked in the city and things like that. Yeah, there were those big kind of raves, weren't they? Energy and sunrise that were very corporate feeling. But you could tell as soon as we walked in, you could tell whether there was somebody that did it because it was the love of music. Yeah, like James Barton. Yeah, look at him. Look at what I'm trying to do. He made us play for time for about half an hour. There was nobody in his club. Play a game, play a game, play a game. There was nobody there. We played our set. Someone else DJed. Then he said, oh, go on, do Chime for us again, will you? At the end of the show. And again, and again. And his mates. And he kind of said, I've got this vision of taking over this big warehouse. He showed me this room upstairs. I want to do a big club in here. And I thought, yeah your first, both of you, your first experience of kind of, well, a rave, I guess, or a party during the kind of acid house era? Because you grew up in Sevenoaks. Yeah, it was local stuff, actually, which was good because that was the DIY ethic, though. That's the fun aspect about the whole kind of rave thing is people did think, have you heard this music? That was the first thing, hearing the music and thinking, oh, that's good. And then where do you go and hear that? Well, you don't. And then sort of the people, you know, people used to do parties in Sevenoaks and Tullbridge. There was a big culture of sort of doing squat parties and in the woods parties and things like that. And so the guys that were DJing at those things, you know, they were obviously kind of alternative DJs. They weren't playing in the sort of horrible Mecca nightclub. they were into house music and rare groove and it just went from kind of public enemies through house into acid house and that's the sort of things that were going on I mean the grasshopper was you know I think it was called roadblock the club there went from a kind of rare groove club on the border of Kent and Surrey into full on acid house thing on a Thursday night really cheap like two pound to get in free if you go in before ten you know and it was like It was brilliant, but these things were just springing up on their own. I used to go to warehouse parties and it was before house. They used to be playing like electro and hip hop and you know proper scratches and all this sort of stuff. Rare groove, that kind of thing. Yeah, but it was a lot of electro and hip hop really to be honest. Well I suppose there was actually rare groove with the Scar and up and down there. He slumped around there. And then that sort of... Then there was the mutoid waste parties... they were fantastic, that artisan lot. I mean, they've turned into what they call now Arcadia lot. That's all the kids or the sons or children of Demutoid Waste. They're an artisan. They squatted this big, huge warehouse at the back of King's Cross. I mean, it's probably a hotel now or something like that, which it pretty much is. But you'd go through a little door, fiver, you'd get in and you'd go over this rickety thing and It'd be amazing. It'd be like this weeping willow from, like, you know when you shave a piece of wood or metal and it all curls up? It'd be like this weeping willow made out of metal and all like this. They'd have a dumper truck, like, chained into a woolly mammoth. It's all Mad Max shit. And they'd have, like, punk band over in the corner and people firing, juggling, you know, and all this. It was like a big smiley face and we just saw it was like like flashing lights and go in there and it's like you're off and then they had clink street didn't they down in there yeah who did clink street amazing we went there one one time clink street i'd ever been to a london kind of grave and there were all these kind of real casual looking guys that i just thought shit we're gonna get crap beating up out of us. They'll be doing a conga chanting ecstasy and smiling and it's like, what the fuck? something's changing around here. Went to the bar, Ribena or Warner. Ribena or Warner. It's like, mental. I can't buy alcohol. You know, it was like, this was, yeah, I know. And that was Mr. C and Evil Eddie Richards playing all this Detroit techno. It was amazing. So, when did the... No, sorry, that was, I was just saying, that's where we had torch glasses. You know that thing? Like, it's here in smoke and you go, trying to see a little LED, like a little thing like that. So then a mate of ours came, you know, I've got these New York little plastic cheap things, like $6 or something. Space Age gifts, isn't it? Yeah. We found that out. So I used to buy the frames and cut them out and strap them back. So we can actually see what we were doing. And that's how that all developed from those, because all you need is smoke and strobes, really, and some music. So was the, were you already, before you sort of had your first experiences of rave and ecstasy and so on, were you, if you... No, I did, yeah, totally, I love it. Of... Well, that culture, as we say. Sorry. Were the two of you already making electronic music? Yeah, I mean, sort of the music had been going on for ages, quite influenced by that earlier pre-rave. It was influenced by kind of things like Cabaret Voltaire, Kraftwerk, New Order, then on to Bobby O and Divine and all that kind of thing, and then electro. house music came along we were like electro and high energy mixed together nice excellent let's have a go and it just kind of just got into into the mix of what we were doing naturally but you know i come from well we both do different generations of punk background so that's where the kind of commentary comes so it's just natural it's like well yeah but house music it's not saying it's just not saying anything about the things that we like to say about so we kind of just bring that in naturally you don't think about it you just kind of see a hole it's like oh yeah that's not happening let's do that then we're an electronic band rather we make music for the dance floor do you know what i mean but obviously influence influences from all about from us from what we love You know, we did our first gig before Chime came out. We did play Chime at our first gig. And we're actually playing tonight an old track that we played at that first gig that we ever did. And we've never played it before since. I've never released it or anything. We toy with it every now and then. We go, should we get that track one day out and see if we can do something with it? And we kind of then always put it back in the box. I think that's what Calvin Harris' new project is like. What would Calvin Harris do? It's like going back to rave. It's like, right, we're going to dig that track out. Hang on. Let's get it out. Yeah, that can be yours. You've put me off now. I'm only joking. I don't know who touched it. I'm not risking it. That's the start of your sci-fi movie. High risk. No, but we just thought, you know, let's drag it out. Let's see if we can do something. And we had good fun with it at the end of last week and just decided to throw it into the set. And so it's kind of interesting. After 30 years, we're playing a 30-year-old track that was played at our very first gig. So hopefully this won't be our last gig. But, you know, it's a nice kind of thing to do. It could be the last part It could be the last party, guys. Let's face it, it could be. Public gatherings are closed. I'm saying it could be. You never know. You've got to live each day. Live in the now, right? Well, let's hope not. Let's just get until tomorrow. Yeah, let's just keep... pushing on. My memory is that obviously Chime was a huge success and the first couple of albums too were successful and also in particular the Brown album and Civilization you were very quickly kind of accepted, I guess, by the rock music press in terms of you kind of crossed over to more than just kind of ravers. Yeah, well, that was it. Yeah, because there was a lot of... Because this is when we go back to... It was called house music. We go, what's... Well, because of our interest, actually, it was... Anyway, da-da-da-da-da-da. I forgot what I was going to say now. I think... I think what Philip was trying to say was that he's got mesmerised by your little cheeky little face. Jesus, I can't take the tension. There's so much energy in this room. That's actually the second glass I've dropped today. Luckily that's not plugged in. Would you say this is going well? Yeah, it's going really well. Do you want this glass of water? No, no, it's okay. I'm just going to remove my phone from the situation. Yeah, where were we? Oh, no, I know, crossover, crossover, crossover. You know? Crossover. Sorry, I didn't remember what I was going to say now. You know, we've got the house music, all right, and we're going, oh, great. I thought it was great because at the time, the Enemy and the Melody Maker and people like bloody disco music and all this sort of thing and we're going it's a little bit deeper than that if you want if you want it to be deeper you know sort of like it's all to do with it's like the prog rockness of the of the instrumental world which has got very similar in prog rock electronic prog rock you know you know indies or rock and roll sort of thing I just think it's because we had riffs and we Stuck in some guitars and, like, a few, you know... Yeah, but it's not just guitars. If you look at tracks like Impact and things like that, or even Lush, it's got kind of really obvious riffs that go around, but quite harmonic and melodic, and it's kind of... You can stand in a field, hear it for the first time and go, oh, yeah, right, I get that. And it's just... It's like listening to... You know, you know when you hear a good rock band like Queens of the Stone Age and you might not know the record but they kind of start and you go, "Oh yeah, that's great, I love that." You know, would you say that there is, I mean, how would you describe the kind of orbital sound? I mean, I could say, okay, listening to your catalogue, there are, you know, strong lead lines, sort of melodies, big riffs, you know, there's a kind of filmic sci-fi thing going on, soundtracks, the grooves, you know, the political... and social commentary, you know, that all comes together. That's the orbital sound. How would you define the orbital sound? I don't know. It's the worst possible question to ask an artist. Yeah, yeah. The words harmonic content come to my mind. If there isn't that, I'm not happy. Do you know what I mean? But, you know... it could be inharmonic as well some tracks that we do it is but it is there's something even if it's a rising kind of motif or something like that it's just kind of If it fills you with emotion, it's got to be emotive for me, one way or another, even if that emotion is the sort of crazy emotion you get from listening to bands like the Cardiacs, which is like, whoa, what are you doing? But it's got to leave you feeling not emotionally neutral, do you know what I mean? If you listen to the song and it's like, don't feel any different, you've got to try and affect change with the music, I think. affecting motion, I suppose. That's what we look for. I go, oh, yeah, well, a groove, a really good groove. Whether that makes you jump up and down or cry or laugh or whatever. You know, could be any of those things. But apart from that, the gloves are off. Do what you like, you know. So was there a kind of a moment, obviously we're now here. At a point where we can talk about 30 years of Orbital. So was there a moment when the two of you kind of went, not we've made it, but okay, something's happening here. Something special is happening. Chime, really, to be fair. We got sort of fired out of the sort of, like, it felt like being fired out of a... human canon, do you know what I mean? Throughout the 90s, it's just like, Chime happened, and it happened really quickly, and then there were six record companies trying to buy it while I was still washing dishes in a pizza restaurant. And then, I had to change the rotor in that pizza restaurant to go on top of the pops. How crazy is that? Saying to Karen, I've got, sorry, I can't come in on Wednesday. And she said, well, you know what it's like. You can't change the rotor once it's done. I said, no, I can't come in. I've got to go and do Top of the Pops. And she just screamed, grabbed hold of my face, went, ah, you know, I'll do it. I'll bloody do it, you know, whatever. And it was just crazy, you know. I didn't go back in the end. There have been a few other moments along the way, though, that kind of in hindsight seem significant. So Glastonbury in 94. Side effect of that. That was a crossover thing. That helped. Because everybody went gagging for it. And Michael even said we were a little bit stuck in the rock and roll sort of thing. Or just didn't understand. I don't know. Whatever. You know, they had people like the Orb and the Shaman, which, you know, but people were just like, oh, well. The electronic sound was going off in little woods and little parties afterwards and things and bits and bobs and that, you know, if you knew all those places. But on a big stage, we just came on it, you know, sort of. through the back door sign and after Bjork, I mean, you got later Bjork people there. It's like, well, I mean, do you know what I mean? It's like really, well. What could possibly go wrong? Yeah, is that really? Yeah, see what I'm saying? It's just like, got there, we come on, we didn't know what, well, we did know what we were doing, but we were playing an album, actually. That was a tour, an album. I in releasing the album so nobody, not everybody knew us anyway, nobody knew it but we had like... I was going to say, you know, normally you do a greatest hits for a festival set, we didn't have a greatest hits, do you know what I mean? And also, it's like even if we did, it's like the first 500 people were our fans, everyone else was just there, they kind of thought, bit of raving, nice one. The whole crowd would just, the whole crowd would just went... It was just magical and it was just one of those gazellig they call it in Dutch, you know, it's one of those moments where, oh it was just brilliant and it was just fantastic and that helped Michael Eadies now going, oh wait a minute, two guys pushing buttons and twiddling knobs and like that, people, that's alright. You know and then the next year the next year they had a big dance thing and now this year was supposed to be closed in the whole dance field which was from us helped the side was supposed to be yeah apparently you know I think you know that you guys come on you used to be so much sharper than that we were until he blew the announcement on them I was not supposed to say that nobody told me I don't know yeah I don't know I don't know if you're not supposed to say it or not. Now you've said it, it's got to happen. This is the plan. It's been fantastic. We've had brilliant things. We've done wonderful things, you know, like over the years. It's just like, Jesus. Another one was the Paralympics. The Paralympics, making Stephen Hawking sing. They gave us his speech. and we've encoded him and he's only got the torch glasses on for him he's such a laugh he was such a laugh he was such an amazing you know he's taking his torch glasses he's put his torch glasses he can't see a thing because his glasses are like that thick you know so he's coming on sitting there like the world hadron collider you know doing that and we're like Paralympics, we've got an honorary member of Orbital for that night and it's just like, it doesn't get much better than that. So are there any other honorary members of Orbital, is there anybody out there that you would make a... an honorary member if you could. I mean, obviously you've worked with quite a few. Madonna, straight away. Justin Timberlake, I'd go for them two straight away. Yeah, yeah. I'd have Kate Bush on the team any day. You know? Yeah. I would have had Scott Walker. Yeah. You know. And you, again... Well, you know, we sampled him. Yes. But there's loads of people I'd have. Yeah. One of the things I find, well, maybe not, well, yeah, interesting looking at the images of that classroom performance, sort of from behind the stage. is just how insanely big your live setup was at that point in terms of all of the equipment. I mean, how has it evolved over the years? Do you still take the same amount of sequencers and drum machines and so on and so on? Yeah, it's the same amount of stuff. It's the method. It's got smaller, though. Equipment's got smaller. Whereas we used to have to take all our big old blunderbuss kind of old sort of vintage synths. Well, they weren't necessarily vintage back then. They are now. But, you know, nowadays you can get like something that's the size of a Jupiter 6 into a box that big. So we take a lot of smaller things, you know, instead of a big old mixing desk, we've got... three little you know controllers to mix within the computer which serves as the sequencer now and the sampler you know so that takes away the big racks of samples but the effect and the freedom is still the same we're still improvised so you have all the bits so you have bass drum you know hi-hat all individual bits like there's no song mode or anything like that there's no backing track so you haven't got there's no fixed arrangement no i've had when we want to sorting out these two tracks. And then I can override it with the little controllers now. It used to be a mixing desk back in the day, but you know. And so if he puts a bass drum in, I can take it out over there. If I want. No, no, no, I don't like that. We have only ever once both taken stuff out at the same time and left silence. Nothing. When that happens, you just have to count. Three, four. Yeah, because... For example, we've got two... I told you about the oldest track. We've got one of the newest tracks as well that we're going to play tonight. We just decided to do this on Wednesday. We just said, should we put a track in? And then we were like, well, that track. And I'd like to put that track in. Should we put both of them in then? And so we just did it and I was kind of... messing with it yesterday, running through permutations and versions and how you can do it. And at four o'clock, I thought, I think I'm done, I'm done. It's like, that's leaving an hour earlier than I normally do. And I thought, fuck it, no, that's good enough. I know, but it was good enough. You don't want to over-egg it, you know what I mean? Because then you sort of fall into a pattern of how you play it. Whereas Start and just watch the audience go that's working. That's working. That's not working It helps you develop an arrangement for them recording or even sounds or do you know whether these tracks? Things out so and I've you worked that way a lot over the years in terms of things being performed In the olden days we did Like when you go back to, well, yeah, because, you know, like one of the tracks we're playing tonight, you know, we had... So the first few years, a lot of the stuff, a lot of tracks would develop out of playing live where you'd be doing something. You know, some clubs would give you 20 minutes. Some you'd get 40 minutes. And, you know, you play somewhere like we played for Evil Eddie Richards in Milton Keynes. And we were playing and everyone was loving it so much they didn't want us to stop. So it's like, OK, let's grab the drums from that, the bass line from that. That's 30 This thing's going through the filter. You know, OK, let's try that. And you just kind of start jamming stuff. And then next gig, you go, that was good, wasn't it? Let's see if we can add something to that. And you kind of do stuff and start building tracks in sound checks and things like that. And then they ended up becoming singles. I mean, was it at that point? Was it a much, when you were starting out, I mean, a much smaller range of kit that you had on stage? Yeah. Yeah, for sure. You know, what, like a 303? Early on, we were using a six-channel four-track as a mixer. 303. 303. Oh, were we naming instruments now? Yeah, yeah. Emacs sampler. 909 drum machine, R8 drum machine. - DX, we had the DX100 in. - Did we take that live? - I don't know. - I can't remember if we used to sample it or take it live. - I think we probably did. - And an SH-09, of course. - Exactly. - That was it. - So I guess that quickly developed when you got into the doing slightly larger tours when you were sort of headlining your own. The equipment developed in a creative, natural kind of way. It wasn't, we're doing bigger gigs, we'd better get more gear. But you could take more of the studio. We set the studio up. To be fair, the first few gigs was literally all of our studio on stage. It's just like, how are we going to play live? Well, everything's in the sequencer. So if we take that and all these other bits, we can just jam with what we've got. Do you know what I mean thing with you. You've got to remember, when you're sending the MIDI sequence to a piece of equipment, you've got all this squiggability about, you know, you've got the sound, which is like you're doing it and like, oh, you know, changing the filters and things, you know, to the actual sound itself, which is the fun part as well, which you can react with the audience and stuff, you know, it comes out raw. the way we do it. It's not all clean and polished. Don't forget, you know, so we... Well, we learn from Tangerine Dream, you know. If I look at Tangerine Dream playing live, it all seemed to be about playing with these huge knobs. It's like an activity centre. You know, babies, like... Exactly. It's like that. But for grown-ups. Yeah. It must have been... I know, obviously, it's all your equipment and all the tunes and sequences that you've made yourself, but it must have still been, you know, when you're surrounded by racks and racks of synths and drum machines, difficult to kind of keep track of where everything was. Oh, yeah. I know. It's kind of instinctive. You know it. Sometimes I'd listen and when you're sort of towards the end of a track and everything's on, you kind of go, is that playing? I can't tell whether that sounds... Sneak it up on the desk. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's definitely there, yeah. But apart from that, I know where everything is. Yeah. I don't normally... go to the wrong thing or no no pretty much nowhere is this i mean is there a kind of a um a psychic link between the two of you i guess as brothers on stage just kind of no no it seems to work so you know Yeah. Just a nod every so often. We smile when it goes well. The torch glides so bright when we look at each other. We can't really look at each other. So here we are 30 years on. It's Orbital 3.0 is your... 3.0. 3.0. Version 3 we're on now. We split up, came back together, split up again. So what can we expect from that? Obviously you're touring, aren't you, extensively in 2020? Yep. Gigs, more music. We've got two new tracks in there already. Yeah, which were, until Wednesday, weren't going to happen. So, you know, that might keep happening. I don't know. We've got a new album coming out. By the end of the year it'll be a whole completely different set. We've got a new album. coming out but we haven't quite finished writing it yet we're still working on that and there's other things we can't talk about at the moment legal purposes legal reasons some of which may or may not have been mentioned today already so just forget you heard any of that okay I mean, what is there? Obviously, you've been hugely successful over, you know, three decades together and also solo projects as well. You know, what is there left to tick off your bucket list? Well, I didn't even have a list, though, in the first place. Do you know what I mean? So it's just like everything for me, you know, like when Chime was saying, I was going to go to London College of Furniture to do a furniture design. and I had two kids at the time and I go, well, you know, can I defer it for you? And they went, yeah. Because we had enough money in advance to keep us going and support the kids and that for about a year. So I go, right, and then that's been it. We've done so, you know, it's just the fact that we're still doing it. we've come back I didn't think we were going to get back together really for this version 3 and it's like so I'm on bonus time so I'm loving it for me when I was about 13 I decided I wanted to be Rick Wakeman you know I haven't achieved the hair quite but you know have you got the train set in and there's two of us in the band so this is it we're stuffed out just mean that that picture of of sort of a man surrounded by keyboards with dino like playing like that it's like wow look at that remember that album i used to have you killed up the foil and rick maintenance all spread around like that you put it like that what's not to love about rick but um Yeah, I don't know. I've still got loads that I could tick off on my bucket list. Working with Kate Bush. You know, that's one. Two or three nights sold out the O2. That'd be nice. Shit. Yeah, I think so as well. I'm with you on that. I don't like that. I don't mind. Make our own little festival. I know, but it would definitely be a kind of... I've got ravers in disguise. I appreciate your concern. My idea Articulated Laurie, right? Ravers in disguise. You can have pampers, nappies or something. But when you open it out, you know, speakers, you've got the stage. And do you know what I'm saying? We can do that. I've got a guy that can have a license. Oh, anyway, that's an old story. He's talking about the Transformers movie. The Transformers, Ravers in disguise, don't you say? We get Arcadia, come in and do And by the time we've had the rave, by the time anybody gets wind of it, you know, we can go, you know, we had a... That's what they used to say. They used to get shut down. No, but Dave knows the places. You know the places. That's true. Phil is referring to a friend of mine, a fellow journalist, who's called Dave, who... Oh, it's Dave, sorry. You could have got away with that. Yeah, there was a couple of years ago, Phil made a kind of unannounced appearance at a rave up a mountainside in Wales, which was very memorable. There were about 120 people there, and he came and got his laptop out and played a... kind of a sort of Ableton type set of semi-live set of orbital classics. It was... Chicken shack. In a chicken shack. Yeah, in a barn, yeah. And there were literally chickens wandering around. There were, weren't there? It was brilliant. It was kind of like a rave, you know, rave revival, wasn't it? Back to... It was brilliant. 1989 or something. So, yeah. It seems to give me trouble. so there you go so live show tonight you've already mentioned a bit about that in terms of maybe playing some things that people haven't heard before do you tend to like going and revisiting parts of the discography that maybe I know obviously there's an expectation now I guess of a certain amount of greatest hits when people come to see you live. But do you like going and exploring kind of album tracks or B-sides or things that people haven't maybe heard in a live set for a while? Oh, totally. But, you know, you've just got to get a balance, and that's a gut feeling, on... overindulging your own kind of crate digging of your past and giving people the tracks that they want to hear. Do you know what I mean? You know, I know there's at least two people in the audience who want to hear Remind tonight, but they're not going to hear it. Do you know what I mean? But... We know as well that we will bring that one back because that's always been a kind of firm live favourite. Whereas, you know, there's some old obscure tracks that I often think, oh, God, it'd be great to do a new version of that. But, you know, you just have to find the space in the set. I guess when you're making a set, you'll go one day, yep, that's where I'm going to play, say, deeper or something, the B side of Chime. The other question, I guess, that comes out of that is also sort of how do you, some artists that have long careers don't always necessarily find it easy to keep themselves motivated. So what keeps the two of you sort of motivated and wanting to create new music? Keep splitting up and joining Derek. It's like a new band. I don't know, it's just like the enthusiasm with the music really. I think if you get bored, you just have to change it up, don't you? Like we both went in and said... They're saying, you know, we're doing the same set, you know, we're gonna mix it up I'm gonna change things around a bit, but it's like what can we do? Let's check a couple of new tracks in that and all of a sudden you go Bing and it will just change the way you play the set because it's changed the dynamic Do you know what I mean? And so that's how you know, you keep it interesting, you know, so we did a run five nights on the trot in Australia with very little sleep in between and the last one was you know you're sort of knackered but you're kind of wired as well I just thought I've got to change this up now you know got to do something and it's great fun you just kind of think I'm not going that's what I normally do I'm not going to do that I'm going to do this I'm going to break it down to the baseline and then see what happens you know it's it's you just that interesting, whereas it might have become boring otherwise to play it the same way. On the tour, because you're doing not necessarily one day after the other or whatever, but you're doing a string of... So you get into a different cycle rather than doing festivals every other weekend or whatever. So you do, don't you? Because you're doing it and doing it and things do develop. I think Chinese whisper. Yeah. Yeah, I feel a little bit like parts of today's talk spiral out of control. I think we've got there. That's just me. That's just you Phil, yeah. But don't ever change. Wouldn't be the first time, yeah, no, high risk. So there you go. So I think we're going to have to wrap it up I think now because we've got another talk coming on very shortly. So could you put your hands together for Paul and Phil Hartnell? Thank you. What do we do now? We get the tea lady to come round and sneak out the side. Thanks. Thank you very much. you
