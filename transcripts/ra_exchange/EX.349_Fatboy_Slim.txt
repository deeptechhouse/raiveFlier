♪ ♪ you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Fatboy Slim. Though you might know the hits, onstage antics and Hawaiian shit, shirts, Norman Cook cut his teeth in an age when DJs were considered just above the glass collector and the club's hierarchy. But by the early 2000s, Cook was unknowingly laying a template for the DJ as main stage festival draw, which later came to fruition in the American EDM phenomenon. Carlos Hawthorne traveled to Brighton to ask Cook what it's like playing with 360,000 people, apologizing to Burial, and keeping up with the new generation of superstar DJs. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Fatboy Slim is up next. Hi Norman, thanks a lot for having us in your house. It's a beautiful sunny day, you can see the sea. I actually want to start asking you just about another of your passions away from music, which is football, and your beloved... Interesting swerve. Yeah, let's start completely away from the chosen topic. Just because Brighton and Hove Albion are, you know, the prospects of Premier League football is very real right now. I mean, are you daring to dream? You know what? I'm a very superstitious person and I cannot actually comment on that for fear of jinxing us. Okay. I have done... Last year. I mean, we've been in the playoffs three times in the last four years and we've become so painfully close. And every time there's been a point where the local BBC news has come around, I've done an interview going, yeah, we're going up. And then we never do. So I cannot comment for fear of jinxing us. Fair enough. But suffice to say, it's very exciting times. How often do you get to go to the games? It depends on gigs. I go to every home game when I'm in Brighton, which is about probably half, two thirds of them. Yeah, it just depends on my gig schedule. And the mood is brilliant in the stadium. Yeah, there's a... yeah a mountaining excitement i there's a mounting excitement but there's there's also the feeling of look look come on we've been here we've been here and we've been disappointed before so yeah yeah you've followed the team for a long time and i guess it before that you know you your love of the city um what what is it about this place what do you love so much i've i've i've answered this question a hundred times and i still have a couple I still can't quite sum it up. I, my sister was at university here when, and I lived just like an hour up the road and so i used to come down and stay with her for weekends and i just thought it's a city where you can just be who you want to be and it's a very tolerant liberal city in the in those days it was really quite heavy gay and i like proper you know clone you know clone pre-aids clone gays and and it was it had tons of nightclubs And a kind of, yeah, sort of liberal attitude to alternative lifestyles and behaviours. I don't know. I just, after two years, three years of coming down here, my sister was down here. When I got a chance to leave home, my first choice of place to go to college was here. And then after three years of living here, there was like, there was no way I was leaving. But it is, it's, I mean, we were the first city to have a Green MP. it's always been a very hedonistic, if you're a DJ or a musician, it's, you know, there's obvious reasons to be here. But also, yeah, just people in Brighton seem to be more tolerant of alternative ways of living or behaving or... What was happening musically when you were first visiting? Or when you came and studied? When I was first... You're going back a bit now. There was a band called The Piranhas. They had a hit with Tom Hark. I mean, you probably weren't even born. I wasn't. There was a label called Atrix Records. Right. And what really swung it for me, though, was a club called Sherry's. And on Wednesday night at Sherry's, it was called Alternative Night. And basically, this was sort of the new romantic beginnings of electronic sort of... electronic alternative music and it was a really big night It was like people would come down from London, you know, Boy George and people would come down from London. And it's in the days of kind of spandau ballet and very much the sort of second wave of British club culture. And before I even moved down here, I used to come down every Wednesday night to go to Sherry's. And you'd hear records, you'd hear, you know, this sort of Depeche Mode. 12-inch remixes and human league stuff, but then you'd hear James Brown and Manu Dibango, and then this record came out called Planet Rock. by Africa Babata which just all of us were like what the hell is this fantastic beautiful electronic noise so I just happened to be in the kind of in the right place in the right time at the right time when when a detronic club music and culture was was really beginning to take hold outside of outside of the gaze because the other thing was I used to go to the gay clubs and hear all the really cool records and then start playing them when I was DJing. Right. straight clubs and they go what's this what's this one of these you know bobby orlando records and uh yeah i mean those days get you know the the the gay clubs were playing the really cool electronic music and and basically what we now call house was kind of came out of the gay culture what do you put that down to is that the kind of connection with new york yeah I mean, in those days, the cutting edge of music was always led by predominantly black, gay artists and DJs. I don't know how that started. I mean, and this is one of the reasons why it took, you know, another question I get asked a lot is like, why did it take so long for the Americans to get EDM? Right. Why did it take them like 30 years to finally get it? And I said, well, there's two reasons. One is the internet. Without access to the internet, you have to be over 21 to get into a club. So your five best clubbing years have been... over before you could even hear this music because it's not on the radio. You have to go to these clubs. And secondly, this music was predominantly black gay music. So it was never going to get played on the radio. It was never going to become mainstream in America because it was, yeah, it was naughty and black and gay and repetitive. And they had that old Disco Sucks movement in the late 70s. And it was, yeah, it was seen as kind of sinful. Yeah, they suppressed it. The devil's music. Exactly why I liked it. You described the scene at Sherry's there. The soundtrack is obviously very varied. And one thing I'll associate with you is that you have such a broad taste in music now. You've brought together so many different styles in your career. I mean, what do you... put that down to? Was it something at home? Where was this such an open-minded taste come from? I think it was just the age that I grew up in. The age that I grew up in, if you wanted to dance, you could either dance to... sort of funk music or reggae music, soul music, well, yeah, funk, soul or reggae. Everything was a kind of melting pot of that. And then they invented electro and hip-hop. And then they invented house. So the thing is, DJs can now grow up and only listen to house music all their lives. There wasn't the invented house music when I was learning about it and when I was starting to DJ. So you had to play different kinds of music because there wasn't one music you could play all night. So I think it's that. I think it's coming from an age before... So people were just less tribal back then. People were less like, I'm into soul. I mean, you did have that, though. You know, people were like, I'm fiercely into punk. Oh, yeah. I mean, you would have, like, northern soul clubs and you would have... Yeah, you would have very specialist clubs, very small specialist clubs. But I kind of dipped my toe. That's a great thing about living from there I could go to the soul clubs pick up a bit from there and I've always been a bit of a musical magpie and I think also my approach to music has always been it's got to have the right rhythm to make your hips move and the right hook to get ingrained in your head And they're the only two real things you have to do. It's not like, you know, in rock music where there has to be a message to it or it has to have a structure or anything like this. It's like if you've got a groove and a hook, that's all you really need. And half my records are just a groove and a hook. So that kind of suits me fine. And it's the things that I latched onto, whether it was listening to funk records. like James Brown records establish a groove and then he shouts the same thing over and over again, you know, or whether it's that or, yeah, I mean, it just took it away from the idea that pop music has to be complicated or have a message or a reason. It's like the reason we go out is to get high and get laid. It's purely about escapism, you know. It's purely about losing yourself in that moment and that collective euphoria. And what you need for that is something quite just tribal and basic. It doesn't want to be you have too many lyrics that you're sitting listening and, you know, it's just, it wants to grab your hips and make you feel taken to another place. Yeah, the music of Fatboy Slim I definitely would associate with that kind of, you know, the weekends here, let's go out, let's rave. Yeah, it's just about escaping. Exactly. Interestingly, like, earlier in your career, I'm thinking about the House Martins, like, it was more political, the message there. I mean, Fatboy Slim, I mean, it kind of feels apolitical in a sense, but I guess just escaping is also a political act, you know, this is No, no, he's completely apos. Okay. What I do now. I was, young and in the house moments I was young I mean Paul wrote all the lyrics so and he is a very he still was a very political man and but in those days that that was what was driving a lot of us it was like it was during the miners strike and Thatcher was you know and horrible things were going on so we were quite I angry and we were quite idealistic and we thought we could change the world with pop music over my career i've kind of had that notion beaten out of me it's like you can't change anything you know the the beatles tried it you know the rolling stones tried it bruce springsteen tried it you know you can't change the world with pop music and i've and i yeah i've like that idealism has just sadly died and I've settled for if I can make people dance and smile that's my role in life I mean had you become less political as a person by the time Fatboy Slim yes I think when you're young you believe you can do everything Of course. Yeah, everything is possible. As you get older, the trials and tribulations of life start sapping that energy of believing you can do anything. And then as you get older, you think, well, if I could just get out and get through today, that'll be enough. So, and again, musically... But music, there was a time when I just wanted to make a record every single day. That's what woke me up in the morning. And I was a workaholic, and that's why I ended up having four acts. Right. You know, when people say, why do you have so many pseudonyms? I'm like, they wouldn't let me release enough records as one person, so I started releasing them as another person. And over the years, that's died down. When you have children, you don't have so much time. That's the reason why young people make better records than old people, because they've got that fire and passion about what they want to say. I wanted to touch on one thing about the Haas Martins. I read it on Wikipedia. it said that the bassist left on the eve of the first national tour so Cook agreed to move to Hull to join them. Did you, so did you join that tour? You straight away, you moved up? I went to a gig in New Cross expecting to watch the band because they were old friends of Paul's, really old friend of mine. As soon as I got there, when I told my name on the guest list, they said, oh, you've been instructed to go straight to the dressing room. I went to the dressing room and they said, right, you're playing bass tonight. you know half the songs because you've played them in the previous band with Paul. Right. We'll brush up on them and we'll try and teach you as many as we can between, you know, the next hour. And I went and they played the first half of the set without a bass player. And then they said, and here's our new bass player. And he only knows half the set and now we're going to play it with him. I'd already been in a band with Paul Heaton, which was a kind together so i there it wasn't it wasn't blind it was kind of i had history with them and a lot of songs I knew because I played them in our previous band. Was it your time with the House Martins that gave you that kind of taste for the stage? No, I'd always wanted to do that. I'd always wanted to be, to do music and be famous since I saw Donny Osmond when I was about eight. playing crazy horses and he had a piano with light bulbs that lit up when he played it and he had a leather jacket with his name in studs in the back and I thought I want a piece of that that's what I want to do for a living and so from eight years on I was obsessed with pop music and told everyone I wanted to be a pop star When I was about 14, punk came along. And at that point, I downgraded the kind of, I want to be famous and I want to be a superstar. And it was just, but now I definitely want to be in music. And even though I'm not the world's best musician, punk allows you to still contribute. and still make records, even though you're not a virtuoso pianist or guitarist or anything like that. So, yeah, no, I've always wanted to do music. The DJing side of it was a complete accident. I don't know if you know the story of how I started DJing. Just when you were younger, you'd go and... I was the only person in Reigate who had all the records. I was a vinyl junkie and I had all the records. Because of that, I'd parties because there was no streaming there was no of course and if you didn't physically have records they didn't get paid so I would get invited to parties just so I brought my records but they the records always used to get trashed they used to get left lying around and vomiting fag butts on so I started saying that I'm not bringing my records to the parties anymore and then one girl said how about if I get my dad to hire these like citronic double decks you can be in charge of your records so you can you know you can make sure that they don't get damaged And you can be like, you know, a disc jockey. And I said, yeah, okay, I'll try it. And I did. And I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed it. The crowd seemed to thoroughly enjoy it. And there was a kind of rapport. And I was kind of hooked. on the idea. But this was playing punk rock records to people. So it was way before there was any idea of mixing or DJ culture or anything. But I did enjoy the concept of playing your favourite records to other people and then having tons of fun and you feeling like you've entertained the room. When did the kind of more, you know, serious dance music, mixing, beat matching, that whole thing kind of enter your world and become a... When I started going to Sherry's. Right. When I started going to Sherry's, I started noticing that a lot of the records, you couldn't tell where one ended and the other one started. And then I'd read in magazines about this thing called segwaying. They hadn't invented terms like beat matching or anything like that. Segwaying, I like that. And then I, yeah, I became quite obsessed, but obviously you needed very speed decks. I had two decks, but they were belt driven. Yeah. And, but I, someone, a man called Barry Page. who is a quite big DJ down in Brighton when I first moved down here, he showed me how you could beatmatch by winding the spindle. Wow. And it was a very, very difficult art to do. And you can only do it with drums. You couldn't really do it with music because you could hear the music. Right. But you could beatmatch like that. And then we suddenly, then we heard about these decks called Technics 1200s, which had a very speed thing where you could actually beatmatch it. And I couldn't afford to buy any, but I would play any wine bar. There was a wine bar where I played there every Monday night for free. I got free beer, that was all. And I played there every Monday just so I could. could practice on their turntables. I would practice for hours and then at one point I had one Technics and one Belt Driven and I could afford to buy one Technics. But you could still do it because you could always... Yeah. Yeah. You actually only need one set of various things. That's true, yeah. And, yeah, it was a... And it was really exciting times because, you know, you would do a mix and people on the dance floor were going, hold on, how has that happened? I'm now dancing to a different record. I didn't even notice. Or I'm dancing to two records at once. And yeah, it was quite a neat trick to have. And then things like scratching and things that people kind of take for granted now. In those days, you really could, you know, have a whole dance floor kind of just look up and go, what the hell? how the hell are you doing that? Was there like a, was there a group of you doing this? Did you have other people into it? Were you like sharing music? Yeah, there was a very small group of people who were doing it. And bizarrely enough, I got invited into that group because when I was in the house mines, they did documentary on us. And part of the documentary was what do you do in your spare time? You know, what's your hobby? And I took him up to my bedroom and I've got my one Technics and one belt different thing and I'm mixing, mixing. And all the other DJs who were doing that, when I did, when I left the House Martins and, you know, indie pop. and started making dance music, rather than going, blah, you've switched from indie pop. He went, you were the one in the house, Mines, who was scratching and mixing years ago, you know. And a lot of people, like Ashley Beadle and Cold Cut and Tim Simdon and all those people, when... When I left the House Martins and started remixing and DJing, none of them questioned my motives because they all knew that I was doing it before. So that was, that was, that was, and, and, and they were, and. It was a very small select bunch of people who were doing it and we used to share, like, how did you do that? Or we would be, if we had a record that no one else had, we'd cover the label. We used to do a lot of sticking labels, covering over so that no one knew what record that was. There was no Shazam. And you'd have other DJs coming up trying to look over your shoulder of what record was playing. So, yeah, we were sort of half-elfing each other out, but certain things were... It's like if you had a record that nobody else knew what it was even called, then you could play that for six months and people would come, you know, people would come to see you just because they knew that you had that record. The idea of... rarity and that you know for kids nowadays is difficult to explain yeah the idea that people that people would come just to see I remember Andy Weatherall doing an interview going I would travel hundreds of miles to hear one DJ play a record and I knew what record you know there was like three records he had that I didn't know what they were and nobody else had them and I would have trouble just to hear him play them so when dance music entered your life did you did it totally take over were you like you just that was your new thing that was the bug No. At first it was a hobby. Basically, I was in a band with Paul Heaton when I was doing my A-levels. I failed them because I was spending too much time in a band with Paul Heaton. And so I had to decide whether I kind of left home and pursued a pop career straight away. Or my parents said, if you give up being in pop bands, we'll support you for the next three years if you want to go to college. Right. That meant I could move to Brighton and didn't have to pay rent for the next three years. So I took that option. But I had promised them I wouldn't be in a band all the time that I was in there. but I hadn't promised her I wouldn't DJ. And so I'd now moved to the nightclub. capital of the south coast and by the end of my degree i was djing five nights a week but but in those days djing was a hobby it wasn't a it wasn't a career you didn't get paid enough i was djing five nights a week and i still had to work in a record shop part-time to pay the rent in those days we weren't we were we were just below the glass collector in the food chain in a nightclub. We were sometimes in a different room just looking through a serving hatch. We didn't have monitors. We weren't, you know, if you ask for monitors, they go, shut up, why do you need monitors? It's like, well, so I can, my anti-beat match, it's like there's a time delay from the speakers over there. They went, oh, get over it, you know. So. DJing was something that Trainspotter Vinyl Junkies did and it wasn't glamorous. We never got any women or fame or money or any of the things that might attract DJs these days. When was it that that changed that you thought, hang on, I could do this forever? for a career um it was when i was when i started to be fat boy slim i was at that point i was still pizza man the guitarist and producer and songwriter of freak power and the mighty dub cats yeah and i was on tour i did a really long tour with freak power and There's 13 of us in a smelly tour bus and we're worried every night if we're going to have enough people to make it work. Sometimes we outnumber the audience. And that whole kind of paying your dues on the road. And then while I'd be there, every few days I'd get a message going, oh, tripping on sunshine, you know, sex on the streets just went in at number 15. After the end of that tour, I was quite burnt out on, and I was a crap guitarist anyway. But all the while I'd been DJing just in local clubs in Brighton. And then I just... started getting these when the Fatboy Slim show started taking off Fatboy Slim records started taking off I'd get gigs as Fatboy Slim and realised that more people would come to see me DJ as Fatboy Slim than would come to see Freak Power as a band. I didn't have to split it 13 ways, travel around on a tour bus. I could just get a train up. And then I realised I was meant to be a DJ, not a bass player or a guitarist. I'm a much better DJ. And people like it when I DJ. And by then, I could... Before, I could only DJ in Brighton because the amount I got paid wouldn't cover my train fare up to London and back. So I couldn't play outside of Brighton, really. But by then, now you could play in London and then there was... Occasionally you could go up north and stuff like that. And I just found that I realised that it's much easier just DJing rather than rehearsing with a band, especially a band where you are... I was kind of the Andrew Ridgely of the band. And it's only because I produced and wrote the songs that even allowed me on stage. And they were great musicians. And I was always holding them back. And I just thought... yeah, why am I doing, attempting that when I've got records in the charts and as, you know, doing dance music and it was around the time of dance music exploding into the charts and all of a sudden no one wanted to be in a band anymore and everyone wanted to be a DJ and I'm like, well, I've already got the chops and I've paid my dues for the 15 years doing this so why not do this? Yeah, it's amazing because you're, first album was Fatboy Slim Better Living Through Chemistry came out in 1996 so you were 33 when that came out yeah which is I mean I mean yeah I guess it's slightly old to the other way you kind of assume that you would yeah it had taken me I'd been 11 years yeah in the industry professional in the industry being in bands and DJing was a hobby Yeah, A, I hadn't realised that I should have been a DJ, not a bass player. But B, like I said, being a DJ wasn't a career. Yeah, it wasn't an option. Unless you had a radio show. I don't think there were any DJs who didn't have a day job. Maybe one springs to mind. I wanted to ask you about him, and that's Carl Cox. So he's got the Brighton connection. You guys are... Yeah, he was a tremendous influence on me Mentor. When I first moved to Brighton, he was the don. Right. He was the king of... So what year would that have been? I mean... 82? 82. Okay, he was the don then. Wow. Yeah, he was. And he was already playing on three decks. Yeah. And we would stand there and just watch a gape. and then he heard me play and I think he gave me some mixing lessons and got me some gigs and yeah and we tried to make tuned together I mean that was the thing he was he was at dawn of DJing but I had by the time I'd left the house Martins I'd used the money to build a recording studio so I had a studio and he had a sound system so I would use his sound system and he would use my studio so yeah we tried making a record together and it didn't quite work but no we've been firm friends since then and But even he, even in those days, he ran a record shop. Yeah. During the day. You know, he, even, you know, even Carl Cox had to have a day job because he didn't get paid enough. Do you, I know he lives in Brighton, do you guys hang out much? We don't hang out, we don't go out for dinner and hang out, hang out, but we are always doing shows together. If, if I'm doing a big show. And I need a big second on the bill. He's always my first choice if he's available. I've been playing for him at Space for years. Yeah, we keep in touch DJ-wise. and we still he's one of the few DJs I'll play back to back with right that I've you know I trust enough to do that with what is that about him that just because we've grown up together musically and we trust you know I just trust him I know what he's doing and why he's doing it and I can communicate with him without shouting in his ear I'm gonna do this I'm like A little drop of, you know, just like eye contact. Someone you know well enough musically and personally to... One thing you guys definitely have in common is that, you know, Cox, you both have this performance element to your DJing and interacting with the crowd. I mean, Cox was always on the mic and... Yeah, it was just kind of a similarity. Well, like I said, he was my mentor. I've always acknowledged that my DJing style is basically ripped completely off. Carl Cox and John Carter. Okay. It was Carl Cox's communication with the audience and looking like he was having more fun. more into the music than the crowd rather than standing there going you all like this it's like I really like this and I think you might do too between that and John Carter's swagger and showmanship and yeah the arm waving and really really hyping the crowd up Yeah, basically, they were my two favourite DJs, and I would watch them, and my DJing style evolved out of those two. Was that... I openly admit that. Sure. I've told Carl a million times. That performance element, was it always a part of your DJing, like from the word go? No. No, A, because in those days no one could see you because you weren't above the crowd. No one really cared. You were just the bloke in the corner playing records. But as Fatboy Slim? By the time we got to Fatboy Slim, it all really kicked off with the Big Beat Boutique. Yeah. But Because Big Beat Boutique had this devil may care wild abandon where the crowd encouraged me to do stupid things. I then in turn encouraged the crowd to do more stupid things and this vicious circle of stupidity and abandon established itself. Yeah, it was the boutique. It was having my own residency, playing to my mates and other people, but playing to the same crowd every week and feeling confident. that they knew me and them just encouraging me to be stupider every week to take more musical risks to be more outrageous in my behaviour whilst I was DJing and like I said it was a two way street I would then encourage them and, you know, fish were thrown about and clothes were taken off. Luckily, the manager of the club let us get away with murder. How often were those parties? That was every fortnight in between. I would play the social one Friday and then the boutique the next Friday. Right. So I ping-ponged between the Heavenly Social and... And the Heavenly Social was in London? Yeah. That's where the Chemical Brothers were, residents. Right, and there was a kind of similar thing going on there? Yeah, well, that was... Like you said about small groups of people, at that point, everybody was playing house. I got a bit bored of house, and I had these weird records. I played chip-hop records at 45. I'd play... Acid Records at 33. And it's just this weird mix of things. And I remember hearing Defunct by Daft Punk the first time. And that was, for me, that's what music should sound like. It was very much handbag, girly house, very commercial. And so I was kind of going back to my love of hip-hop and breakbeats. and Acid House, and all that. Thinking about all the things that I liked, and being more eclectic. But this was all happening back at my house after the clubs. I wasn't really getting many people. The house of love. Yeah, the house of love. I wasn't getting many DJ bookings doing that. And then Lindy Layton, who had been the singer of Beats International, she phoned me up and she said, you know that music you play when we go back to your house after class? She said, there's this club in London called the Heavenly Social where they're playing exactly the same thing as you. And I was like, really? She said, yeah, come on. So I walked in and Tom and Ed were playing Santa Cruz, the first Fatboy Slim single. And I walked up to them and went, this is me. They went, you're Fatboy Slim? And I went, yeah. And they were like, oh. And I instantly had this new family, John Carter, Richie Fearless, Tom and Ed. And we all had come up with this amalgamation of having grown up with the Beatles, then had punk rock, then had rap, then had Acid House, and decided why not put all four of them into one melting pot and see what comes out. break some musical rules, get really trashed to the point where you could put pretty much anything on the song. And if it was stupid, you'd get away with it. And that suited me fine. And so I became a regular at the social and there was another, the Big Kahuna Burger. There was another one at Smithfields. And, but it meant that we had to drive up and more importantly, driving back was sometimes an issue. and the whole reason that we started the boutique down here was because we didn't have to drive up to London every weekend and it was at one point it was going to be called the social on C because it was we just wanted to do what the HMD social was doing I mean again I totally acknowledge that our blueprint we were ripping off what was happening at the HMD social Not necessarily ripping off what Tom and Ed were doing because they'd been doing it in Manchester and I'd been doing it in Brighton and we just hadn't met yet. But in terms of having a club that had no rules, musically, dress code. That was definitely what we got from the Heavenly Social. Of course, from Big Beat Boutique came Big Beat. It's interesting. I mean, it's funny to think of this music being played in a small club because obviously this is like stadium-sized music just in terms of the content. It works just as well in a scout hut, which was the original. But the original boutique was actually, we called it the Scout Hut. It had a really low ceiling. It only held about 350 people. No, it works just as well in small places as big. Can I just say, by the way, that house music was named after the Warehouse Club in Chicago. Garage music was named after the Paradise Garage. You can only imagine how chuffed I was when VB was named after our club. Because until then, it was the genre with no name. Right. I think Tom and Ed put out a compilation called Trip Hop. No, Brit Hop and Trip No. And then it was Chemical Beats, we called it at one point. Yeah, some journalist coined Big B. I mean, how helpful was it from a kind of press point of view and a marketing point of view for having just a sound that you could, you know, ride the wave of? It was fantastic. For the two years that it was groundbreaking and growing and we were aware that something quite special was happening. We used to go and have a drink, a pre-drink. just around the corner from the boutique. And we used to have a joke that it was time to go in when the queue got round the corner, when we could see the queue come round the corner. And then the queue just was getting bigger every week and journalists were coming down and... And we were aware that something, you know, that we were part of this wave. And, you know, it felt like our cavern club. It was like this tiny little place and suddenly Japanese tourists are coming and you can't get in and things like that. That was the most exciting thing about it. But sadly, the whole basis of Big Beat was there's no formula there. There's no rules. You could just break any rule. And the only thing really that it has in common is a big beat. Yeah. Sadly, what happened was once we became popular, there was all this copycat stuff that then established a sound called Big Beat, which actually became formulaic, which is exactly what we were trying to destroy. Yeah. So... There was literally a day where I think me and Tom and Ed went on a holiday together. Well, a whole bunch of us went on a holiday together and we had discussions about all these horrible big beat records. It's like, we don't want to be associated with that anymore. And it's like, what's your next album going to be like? and it's like nothing like big beat and what's your next album they were telling me I need to work with guest vocalists right they said that's how you could develop after you've come a long way And I said, just get away, get off the big beat bandwagon, or get off the good shit big beat because it's going to go down soon. Because it was, it just became a formula. And it's kind of, it was horrible really because... The whole idea was to break the rules and break the formulas and it became a formula. And I've spent a lot of the rest of my career trying to live that down. A lot of people who haven't heard me DJ say, oh yeah, I respect Norman for what he does, but I can't stand the music he plays. And it's like, when did you last hear him? Because if you've heard him in the last 15 years, he does not play big beat records. So, I mean, what did you do? How did you, what was the next direction? Next direction was, I kind of went back to Interesting House. At that point, I think Big Beat kind of burst the handbag house bubble and I think, and upset the apple cart of the house. producers that were just churning out the same stuff and I think it made them think more about what they were doing and records like Born Slippy came out, Underworld were kind of, yeah, sort of listening to what Big Beat was doing, it was like, we can take this into a house thing. And I think, yeah, I think we kind of, we scared a few people and kicked a few butts and got, and Daft Punk, I mean then Daft Punk came along and revolutionized the house music made house music interesting again and different and groundbreaking and like I said the first time I heard Daft Punk it was Dimitri from Delight played at the Escape Club in Brighton and he dropped The Funk and that was the first time I heard it and I was like I have never heard a record like this it's an acid house record at 110 BPM with this really catchy hook that I can't stop singing and nothing really happens in it and you know yeah and that was that was that was kind of and it's like that's exactly how music should be so yeah I mean I think Big Beat kicked dance music up the arse and then Daft Punk then kicked it further kicked house music up the arse so when you've left Big Beat behind or you're trying to kind of distance yourself from it what then happens to your relationship with those classic Fatboy Slim Big Beat records I keep the acapellas of them and I start putting them over house records. I never play them in their original form anymore. Why not? Because it doesn't fit into my set. Tempo-wise, style-wise, I would get really bored. When I DJ, my job as a DJ is to play. the best music possible, not inflict my music on people all night or promote my new album or something like that. But as a DJ with a history of making records, if I didn't nod to the fact... nod to Praise You and Right Here Right Now, they might feel cheated. So I always play Right Here Right Now and Praise You or Weapon of Choice or something in some shape or form. But I would be so bored if I played it in its original form. And it's more fun. Every year I do a new different mash-up. Some people have always thought about you, you know, you talk about the Chemical Brothers there and then thinking about Prodigy, Basement Jacks, like these are acts who've created a show and they've played their hits and was there never albums and sold albums well as you don't yeah we but dance music never did that no of course of course when when they were talking about releasing better living through chemistry i'm like oh don't bother that music doesn't sell you know And it was, in fact, it was a kind of greatest hits. I think we put seven singles out. And they're like, look, you can just do two more tracks. We've got a really fun album. But no, the Prodigy, we have to thank. They were the first dance music act that made an album that sold. But was it never tempting for you or was it never on the table? for you to create a big live show and play your hits and make a band or do something live on stage rather than just DJing? No, I was forced into that by circumstance. I was forced into that by the success of the records, meaning that I was being put on bigger and bigger stages. And I actually remember the moment I played Tea in the Park. I can't remember which year. I played tea in the park and I was like top of the bill in a tent after the Foo Fighters or something like that. And there's just me. I've got me and my manager. No entourage or anything. And I look and it's like a 40 foot walk. across an empty stage to a table with two record players and a mixer on it. And 20,000 mental screaming, lunatic Glasgow audience, you know what they're like, all going, here we fucking go, you know. And I was like, all I've got is this. table and a set of decks and me trying to you know try to follow the Foo Fighters how the hell am I going to do this and so I just on the walk to the stage they all started cheering and I started waving my arms around yeah they started waving their arms around yeah so I started kind of really showboating and trying to make myself as big as possible and project myself as big as possible my manager calls it my James Brown moment. He was like that, you know, I felt like you'd come and put the cape on you and then you'd fall to the ground and I'd put the cape on you again. So that was when the kind of razzmatazz, but obviously having been in a pop band, I had a certain stage craft. I kind of knew how to get an audience going. And then from then it was just. Getting put on stage is that side. It's like, look, we've got to raise our game. We can't just have a table with two record players on it and a bloke waving his arms around. So that's where the visual element came in. The first time we did the beach, we had the... Channel 4 had built a screen there to show the cricket. That was the whole reason we were there in the first place. We were the after party for the test batch. But 65,000 people turned up and it became, you know, people forgot about the cricket. And then the idea of using visuals to augment the show came then one day in Japan. They had a projection screen with my CD cover in front of it, projecting my CD cover as a backdrop. And Mark Jones, bless him. Do you know Mark Jones from Wall of Sound? He rings a bell. Legendary figure in the old days. Well, Wall of Sound had the... Bella Heads and John Carter and Monkey Mafia. You know, dressed in pink. Now always dressed in pink. Yeah. He's a very colourful character. Yeah. He was the first person who had the idea to take my CD that was propped up and insert a piece of paper that he'd written something on. that suddenly became huge, written up in big letters. And I can't remember what he wrote. You, me, none of the lads, big tandoori. Which the Japanese... I can't read English, but it made us laugh. And then we realised that we could write slogans and put them on the screen. So then that whole, my shtick of writing on the record sleeves and writing messages to the crowd. It was years before we could actually have anything that synced with the records because obviously no one ever knew what I was going to play next or what speed I was going to play it at. So my visuals guy would just put generic visuals up, but nothing actually tallied with the records. Until Serato Video SL. Yeah, as you said, you played plenty of big stages. You headlined the other stage at Glastonbury just as a DJ. Well, then I thought, let's really up the game. Then we built the... Right. The cue that I was inside, I was inside the visuals. Of course. But again, you're still. Suspended in midair. You're still just DJing, which, you know, is, there aren't, I don't think any other DJ is ever. I am still just DJing. No, no, but you. To this day, I am still just DJing. But I don't think any, any other act has ever headlined the other stage just DJing. You know, it There aren't, it's a stage for a live act in that respect. So it's like, it's like pre, you know, it's the... I ended up in a lot of places where I was the first person to DJ. Yeah, sure. And yeah, so this, I needed to up my game. There were certain times when I kind of thought this isn't, this isn't worthy. But this is the original model of the, what became the kind of EDM blueprint because that is... just a dj as a headline act and the show and you know that yeah and the djs have to now become younger and better looking and the sex symbols and things like that which we never didn't used to bother us yeah you could be as as old gray fat bald as you wanted no one could really see you and that was one of the attractions of being the dj was that we were we you're not you don't feel exposed because there's always the decks between you and the crowd or you're in a little booth so you always feel quite safe you don't feel like the lead singer that's got to always be you know performing and a lot of DJs in those days were nerdy train spotters but great DJs now you have to be more of a personality you have to be good looking you have to have a shtick you have to you know jump up and shout a and stuff like that, which is great. It's taking the idea of what we do to a more populist commercial. yeah um boundary i mean some for some too commercial yeah a lot of the time well it became it became packaged what you were doing still felt very raw and you were the first person doing it and it felt playful and wild and yeah whereas what these guys are doing is slightly more well the thing i think i think probably the difference between us is that we never took ourselves seriously for us it was like let's see how stupid we could be and if we're going to do a grand gesture it's like in the name of spinal tap you know we're going to build a stonehenge but it's you know with our tongue firmly in our cheek i think some of the edm djs actually believe you know they're rock stars we just we just behave like rock stars because we it was an excuse to what impact did the edm explosion have on your career in america My career in America by that point was pretty much dead in the water because they liked Big Beat. But then when I abandoned Big Beat and went back to house, I stopped having hits and Americans got quite short memories. When EDM came along, they were like, oh, he's a big DJ. Let's get him over. And so initially I did play Ultra and things like that. I'm like, you know what, this isn't really me. And for a few years I tried to keep up with the young'uns and what they were doing and I tried to keep it as big and brash as EDM was without. being EDM but then one year at Ultra I played Carl's structure rather than the main stage and I'm like you know what I'm so much happier in playing to my age group and my crowd and people who understand dance music rather than you know the EDM crowd so I've kind of bowed out of that I also at that point there were so many other things going on in Brazil and Japan and places I mean I'm more popular in Brazil than I am in England and why is that I don't know they just really I just happen to be there at the right time they've always loved dancing dancing is a much more part of Brazilian culture it's the way they celebrate everything and it's so part of it and the kind of Brazilian rhythm is quite similar to house rhythm and I was just the DVD of Brighton Beach for some reason just took off in Brazil it sold more copies in Brazil than it did in the whole the rest of the world put together and they just everyone used to put it on in their house before they went out clubbing and i just became a household name so then they said can you do a big beach in in rio so we did one there and that was bigger than the one in brighton that's 360 000 that went out live on the telly and i just became i was just the first wave of you know superstar DJs did the Brazilians know what happened in Brighton in 2002 did they have a yeah no no they watched it over and over again and over and over again to a point of some nights you know people would moan that I hadn't played super styling I'm like it's not actually my record and they're like yeah Yeah, we can't, well, I mean, technically it's not your record, but it's from the Big Beach 2 video, which is what everybody knows. And yeah, there were certain records like Superstarling that, Superstarling and It Just Won't Do, Tim Deluxe, that I would get lynched if I didn't play because it would be like the Rolling Stones. playing satisfaction was there a process of okay this is what happened in 2002 a lot more people than we expected came down we want to do in brazil we need to learn from those mistakes and take it over we've learned from mistakes in terms of crowd control and expecting numbers and being prepared because we were flying by the seat of our pants with the second big beach here today A lot of people could have died if that had gone wrong. Do you put that down to kind of just underestimating how popular you were? Yeah. Underestimating how popular I was, how much the word of mouth of the success of the first one had gone, the fact that it was the first sunny day of the year and Chris Moyles had decided to talk about how he was going to it all week on Radio 1. And it was a kind of perfect storm. It was like the Woodstock moment where we were just caught with our pants down. We didn't expect. The first one, there were 65,000 and I'd had all these meetings with the police and they're like, don't worry, we've got contingency. plans that go up to 110,000 people imagine that you know we've got enough spotters on roofs and crowd control barriers and medical centers and everything for 110,000 people and quarter of a million turn up the roads are blocked all the way up back up to Crawley that every off-license in Brighton sells out of every bit of alcohol they've got there's not enough toilets, the streets are streaming with piss. It was that moment where it's like, we've lost control of this now. The only reason it happened was because we decided it was more dangerous for it not to happen. That amount of people that are drunk on the streets having a riot could have destroyed our home city. No, we learned those mistakes. So when we did it in Brazil, we had three mobile hospitals going down the beach. We had relay towers so everyone could hear and see the music. And we knew to expect an awful amount of people. And the Brazilians are used to doing that. They've had the Rolling Stones and they've had a quarter of a million people. But yeah, we reckon it was 360,000 people there and it went out live on telly. And so from that day, I became a household name and synonymous with this is what DJ culture is and we like it and give us some more. I mean, this is a difficult question, but what does it feel like to play to 360,000 people? Absolutely petrifying. Absolutely petrifying, especially because in those days, there was still just a table and two decks. If the record jumped, you felt like a numpty. I don't think we even had any visuals. It was me really trying to put on a show to the biggest crowd with the least equipment, the least tools or weaponry. I felt outgunned. I felt really, really petrified, but immediately felt the love. from the Brazilian crowd and that got us through it. I mean, technically it was probably not a very good show at all, but it was a great occasion and it's begat. everything that's happened since the number of Brazilian DJs I've met who said you're the reason that I'm a DJ I mean all around the world that's one of the things I'm proudest of of my kind of legacy within dance music is the number of people who said you're the reason I became a DJ. You know, I liked heavy metal and then I saw you and thought actually that's more fun than heavy metal or, you know, I was a guitarist and then I wanted to become a DJ. So they're the kind of notches on my bedpost. Every time someone says that to me... I just go to my tour manager, ka-ching. Another one bites, another one, another one, another soul. Of course, shows like that made you very famous. And A Celebrity is an interesting one with you because actually originally you shied away from associating yourself with the Fatboy Slim Monica. But then, of course, things blew up and you became very much in the public eye. What's your relationship like with celebrity now? How do you feel about it? I've still, it's never been why I wanted to do this. But at the same time, I'm not saying it's a necessary evil. It's just part of the job. It's something that has good points and bad points. You and your mates get in free-to-clubs and things like that. Tons of people are nice to you and do things for you. On the downside, if you do anything bad, it ends up in the papers. If you have marital troubles, it becomes everybody's business. So there's ups and downs. I think I was lucky because until then, I'd kind of kept under the... I've managed to sort of not get dropped. in at the deep end I'd started with the house at Martin's where we were really anti-fame and then gone the faceless DJing route where no one knew I was Pizza Man no one knew that I was the Mighty Dubcats no one knew I was Fatboy Slim at first but by the time I cocked it up by having really big hits and marrying Zoe Ball, by the time I cocked it up, I was kind of ready for success. I mean, that's one of the things about EDM DJs now. There's 18-year-olds who have been suddenly thrust into a lifestyle where everything's on the plate for them, where they're... famous and and i worry for them because they haven't learned the pitfalls uh and some some of them i worry about their behavior it's like i you know i took 20 years before i got what you're being given now you know when things aren't going so well in the in the public eye what's it like living inside that inside that bubble I never complain. I never complain because you live by the sword, you die by the sword. If I didn't have the press, I wouldn't have all this. So it's a price I have to pay. One thing I did want to ask you about, which was a funny one, when The Sun ran that story saying that you were burial. Oh, yeah. In 2008. It was just as he was approaching. He'd been nominated for the Mercury Music Prize and they... I bet he was so pissed off about it. It was either you or Aphex. Apex Twin. Yeah. I think... Did the sun approach you at all? No, I heard about it. Somebody said... No, I think one of my friends actually believed it. All my friends thought I was burial. It was only just because I had been quite famous for pseudonyms. But again, this is a pre-internet age where you could release records for years and no one ever knew what you looked like. You weren't in the mainstream press. You weren't making pop videos. You weren't doing anything that would make you famous. So you could just be whoever you wanted to be. uh yeah and burial could be burial and probably the only thing that ever stopped him being burial was the the shame of being me the shame of everyone thinking he was me well i think the only thing that would force him to i think that story uh yeah forced him to come out and say just please not please don't not that um how has i just like to apologize publicly to him by the way for that How has the fame game changed for you since the rise of the internet and mobile phones and selfies and all that kind of thing? Is it more annoying now than it used to be? Selfies can get annoying after a certain amount. of time or selfies. Because before, people go, shake your hand and say, I like what you do, or go, oh, I'd love to get an autograph, I wish I had a pen. Sadly, we haven't. Or, I wish I had my camera with me. Now, you do get clocked by everyone, and I don't mind doing it, but there's a point where I've got this look that I give my tour manager. And he says, Norm, we really need you in the dressing room now. And so that side of it is nice. I mean, I like to keep it at a level of fame where I'm recognized by people who like me. It's really nice. It really is. It's wonderful when someone comes up to you in the street and goes, Norm, I'd just like to shake your hand. I lost my virginity to your record or I met my wife. for one of your gigs or something like that things like that really really that never gets hard or you're the reason I started making music or something like that the downside of it is where people recognise you whether they like you or not and you can walk past the building site and go hey my god you still get that or where's the wife or you know yeah Yeah, not so much. I mean, I've spent, since me and Zoe got together, I quickly worked that one out. And since then, both me and Zoe have attempted to stay out. You know, we've never thought it. We've never done OK Magazine. We've never done reality TV or anything like that. We try and keep ourselves within the parameters of the job we do. We try and keep ourselves out of... you know, high street fame, which on the whole works. Like I said, I'm, I do, I'm, I hate it when people go, Oh, Oh, it's hideous being famous. It's so, it's just ruined my life. You know, I would never complain about it because, because the, the upside is, is so rewarding. And just the fact that. I'm 53 years old and I've never had to do an honest day's work in my life. I've been able to do what I would do as a hobby and get paid for it and never have to, you know, never have to pluck chickens. You mentioned that, uh, So the memories are a bit hazy for you because there were a long stint of hedonistic years for you. I mean, how long have you been sober now? Eight years. Eight years. When was the peak of your partying? Probably about seven years ago. No, sorry, a year, not seven years ago. No, a year before I gave up. No, I've always been... I've always been a partier. Probably around the time when Fatboy Slim got really big. It's interesting because most people are starting to wind down around that time. No, it was probably sort of between my 30s. Yeah. I was really... I mean, someone described me as always the posh and becks of the chemical generation. But yeah, we were enjoying everything we could until it started to not be fun anymore and hurt more as I got older. And then I started worrying about my health. and was in the end happy to have stopped doing it, knowing that I'd left no stone unturned. I've got no regrets. It's like, I wish I'd just done... Oh, God, actually, I did. I've heard you say that drugs brought out your creative side. Yeah. I think they do. I think certain drugs do unlock a part of your brain that is suppressed. The kind of infantile or absurd or surreal part of your brain that a lot of the time you suppress because it's infantile and absurd and surreal. So specifically for making music, you would have certain drugs that you'd take just because it brought out a certain... I'd never take drugs while I was actually doing it. Okay. It would be, the general thing would be taking drugs over the weekend whilst DJing and then having the after party. And then come Sunday, not being really able to do very much, like drive a car or anything like that. But I could still operate the studio. And I would have all these... memories and ideas and vibes just going through my head from the weekend and so sort of Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday I would get them all down on tape and that would then become the soundtrack for the next weekend. When was the turning point when did you realise you had to change? When I realised that bits were starting to fall off. What do you mean? Physically. Well, probably mentally as well. I mean, you're working at times longer and longer. When you're out, you're having to do more each day to cover up that you were still hurting from the day before. And just by then I had a son and me and Zoe both at the same, fairly much the same time just said, you know what, this isn't funny anymore. Just, you know, and one of us is going to get ill or it's going to start, you know, he was still young to realize what was going on, but it would change him. We just, you know. I've done enough. I never want to be a poster boy for sobriety and go, it's all part of being at one with your audience. You have to be on the same wavelength. Luckily, I've found a way of doing that. sober i i get as high as them yeah just i there's a maybe it's just kind of there's so much shit still rattling around in my brain doesn't take much for it to come out again Because I do definitely become a different person. I've become an irresponsible 17-year-old party lunatic when on stage. Was there a case that you just never wanted to stop? You just wanted to carry on and on and on? Yeah, I suppose so, yeah. Over the years, I'd built up a dependency on it. Do you feel like addiction or abuse, however you want to term it, is it something that's not talked about enough in dance music? Was it more prevalent than people... might like to think or like might to accept I think for most people addiction takes time yeah you have to do something for 10 20 years before it becomes so much part of your routine so it's probably not talked about by your 18 19 20 year old DJ superstars they've probably talked more about people from my generation of actually you know what I think I've got a problem so many DJs sadly again because I'm tabloid fodder when I went into rehab it was on the papers a lot of DJs I know have quietly that's what I was thinking yeah but yeah this is Like tinnitus, it's an occupational hazard. You do this for long enough, eventually there might be collateral damage. Let's talk about now, 2017. What are your listening habits day-to-day these days? My day-to-day listening habits are spend half the day trawling through all the stuff I've been sent. And if I've got through that, then I go on to Beatport. and just looking for new tunes to play on my set. Because what I want to play, there isn't really a go-to place for it. There isn't a genre in it. You know, like in Beatport, there's minimal tech house, techno. house yeah there's all these so i don't i'm sort of always in the middle of you know there isn't a genre so i have to check every single genre so i do an awful lot of just flicking through that i get sent an awful lot of stuff by all the companies and so i go through that and at the end of that working day uh the last thing i want to listen to is electronic dance music so then i'll put on some scratchy old blues, reggae record that will clean my palate ready for the next day. So you still find a lot of times listen to music just for pleasure? Yes, but I don't, I can't, I, Again, one of the risks of doing this full-time for a living is you stop listening to dance music purely for pleasure. You start listening to it with a professional ear rather than just an enjoyment ear. And you start thinking, that's good. that's a good idea, note that, or fuck, I wish I'd done that. You know, that's great. And you start analysing records rather than just enjoying them. And over the years, yeah, when I listen to dance music, I'm thinking, is that a good dance record? That's my job. My job is to pick the good ones from the bad so you don't have to listen to the shit ones when you go to a nightclub. Yeah, it has kind of... It means that when I want to listen to music for pleasure, I don't listen to electronic dance music. At least you do listen to other types of music. Yeah. You're not just like, oh, no more music. Well, sometimes. Sometimes I was like, yes, please, football. At West Limb these days, what are your goals? What's the idea? I've got no more goals, no goals apart from to carry on doing this as long as I'm enjoying it and the crowd is. That these days takes, you know, I have to work quite hard to compete with the young ones. I'm not so savvy with social media and, you know, ways of selling things. So, again, I have to work quite hard to keep up. But I enjoy more going sideways rather than up. You know, I kind of got bigger and bigger and I played to huge crowds. And it's not so much fun as playing little clubs. So now... I try and vary the gigs. I try and play really big gigs and festivals, but I also then try and play really small stuff. How small will you go? Like 50 people. Really? Yeah. And recently I've been experimenting playing longer sets because then I can go more on a journey with myself and not just play my favourite two hours worth. I can experiment more. Going to new places, just going to new countries that I haven't been to. Just to do, just to do, to play interesting places, do interesting things and keep, yeah, to keep my interest in it. And, yeah, not... I think I've been to the mountaintop. I've, you know, I've done everything you can do. I'm not... I can't try and keep up with the, you know, features and daily getters of this world. I'm quite happy to... to just maintain a level where I earn a happy living and I get to travel around the world turning people on and looking at their faces every night and staying young by absorbing their sweat it's like a vampire instead of in their blood I just absorb their sweat and and and you know that keeps me young because that's what's interesting is that your your fans actually are they do just get well not younger and younger but they do stay young no you know what they're just they they stay exactly the same I look up every night and have done for 30 years and they're all exactly the same age the ones down the back might be getting a bit older but they stay down the back The ones down the front are always the same age and it's testament. I have to make sure I'm still entertaining them. I'm aware that I'm a heritage act, but I don't want to just play a heritage set. I want to be, you know, still current. And that's why I still put in the hours. Some people say, I say something about going through tunes. They're like, you go through your own tunes? I'm like, I have to. Who else could I trust with such a vitally important job? I mean, these days, DJing used to be about whether you could beatmatch you know, on two 1210s, whether you could take out a bit of the record that was no good, you know. Now you can do your own re-edits, you can press the sync button. So the art of DJing is just picking the records and what order you play them in. And so I take that very, very seriously. and I have to keep up. Yeah, I was watching your set in the John Peel tent at Glastonbury last year, and people were absolutely loving it. The tent was rammed. Well, that's the showbiz end of the thing. That's where we do... Yeah, that's when we're using the visuals the most and confetti and things like that. And I'm using hand signals and I've got a crew of five. But then equally, three days later, just me and my tour manager will go off and play some underground club in like 10X. I play 10X very, very regularly just because I love it there and I can try out new... tunes. See, something like that, I can only play the big tunes. I can't experiment. I can't take any risks. I can't drop a new tune. Because you can play a tune on a Tuesday afternoon here and it can sound... Good. And then you can drop it on a big system and it sounds okay, you know. So you have to try things out. So if I only ever played those big shows, A, I'd end up playing the same set every night and it would get very boring. So I like to mix that up with... playing smaller places, playing longer sets. I'm taking it to extreme playing a four-hour set this year, which I haven't done for 20 years. Where's that? In Germany. It's called... Oh, it's the Melt Sleepless Floor. Yes. I'm playing the first four hours of that. Wicked. I like to keep exploring new places and I also like to keep challenging myself so I don't just trot out the same old thing. Like I didn't do a boiler room for ages just because I thought a lot of them look quite dull they're really good as a calling card of if you're a new dj yeah and you and you people want to know if you've got the chops or what style of music you play it's a really good way of checking you out it's like everybody knows the all i can do you know i've got nothing to gain all that might happen is i might fuck up for it or it might just look really dull or You know, I can't show boat if there's no crowd in front of me, if the crowd always behind me, how do I perform to nobody? And so there's all kinds of reasons why I didn't do it. But Blessing the Boiler Room kept at it. And in the end, we worked out that if I played a three hour set, that would be different. And if I played in the round at a club I knew really well, the old Zap Club in Brighton, which is, you know, is that we could do a good one and I think we pulled it off I was talking to I was talking to Dan eats everything the other day because we're going to do something together I think we're going to play back to back and I was like Yeah, you're one of a select few. You, Carl Cox, Armand Van Helden, the only people I trust enough to play back-to-back with. Because I do get on really well with him. But I was just chatting about what I play, and he said, if you play like your boiler room set, he said, well, you'll be fine. Yeah. so in a way it was my calling card that I don't just have to play what I played at Glastonbury I can actually play deeper and moodier and not so wham bam thank you man here comes another I mean you mentioned there that you you know you personally use social media much and that's kind of you feel slightly uncomfortable with that whole world but I mean this it's not that I feel not that I don't use it it's that I feel I feel uncomfortable with it I just find it difficult to keep up. Right. I do social media, but I kind of get somebody else to do it for me. I feed them stuff and they put it up. If the people at your gigs are 18, 19, then they are the internet generation for whom social media is a huge part of their life. You need, Fat Wisdom needs to have that presence. It needs to be a thing. Yeah. So he does have a presence. He's just not quite so hands-on. Right. he's not quite as hands-on as he should be, possibly. I don't think many acts of your profile would be doing their social media. I think it's more important to spend my days going through records and finding really good records than to be tweeting the whole time. That's old school priorities. Let's talk about your music. Will you ever make another album? Probably not, because by the time it takes me to get around to making an album, the idea of an album as a way of selling music will be redundant. Right. I think streaming and everything, the idea of packaging tracks together as an album, it used to be because that's how much you could fit on a piece of plastic. And that dictated the length of the album. Or you could do a double album. And everything was based around your whole market. campaign was based around building up to selling that album nowadays people are just doing things and they're dropping them the next day on the internet yeah they're going straight in they're not you know and people are whether they're buying off iTunes or streaming they're not streaming the whole album they're just cherry picking the tunes they want so I don't think people By the time I finish the long-awaited difficult fifth album, they won't be releasing albums anymore. What was going on around the period, kind of two or three years after Palookaville, when that fifth album, in theory, could have materialized? Why didn't it happen? Because I was, I felt like I'd been on a bit of a treadmill, just doing album tour, album tour. And one of the great things about being a DJ is you don't have to do album tour, album tour. So I wanted to get off that treadmill. So I started wandering off and doing things like writing the musical with David Byrne, Neil Ives Love. branched out and made my duets album the ill-fated Brighton Port Authority which was yeah just me and my mates it was the duets album apart from I can't sing so there were none of them in duets it was fine every song has a guest artist so we had Iggy and David Byrne and Justin Robertson and Ashley Beadle all my old mates who can sing Dizzy Rascal Dizzy Rascal Bootsy Collins lots of people I've worked with over the years or people who are mates of mine who I knew I could sing so I made the PPA album which didn't set the world alight And around that time was that I actually think I went into rehab the week it was released. Right. So I wasn't even around to promote it. So that was, yeah, that was when I was possibly struggling, struggling with alcohol. I mean, right. I mean, creatively, when you get in the studio now, do you feel as active? Do you have as many ideas? That's why my output has gone down to one single every three years. I used to be so prolific, but tons of things have happened, like my political thing. Over the years, I'm now a father of two. A lot of the time I'm a single parent, so I don't have the time that I used to have. I used to love buying cheap old drum machines and cheap synthesizers and seeing how much I could abuse them and buying 303s for 20 quid and thinking, why don't you distort it? Why don't you do this? And blowing it up. And I liked the fact that every six months you could afford to buy one new piece of kit and then you'd learn how to use it. You'd learn the crap out of it. And now faced with a laptop that has all of that and more in it, the infinite range of what I could do just scares me. I just look at it and I just go, you could do anything. And I don't know where to start. And then I hear my daughter crying in the next room. And next thing I know, another day's gone by and I haven't made a tune. But also, again, after this length of career, I don't feel I have to write music unless I'm inspired. Of course. You know, and when, and with something like Eat Sleep, Rave Repeat, I felt it and I felt, yeah, this needs to come out and with Where You Is, I felt it and when I've got a bee in my bonnet, a fire in my belly, you know, whatever cliche you want to use, when I've got that, I'll do it. And also, I think, When I physically become too old to be doing the late nights and the travelling that I do right now, then that's probably when I'll have time to go back in the studio. I'm not turned on by making music with a laptop in the way I was turned on by... sitting in a studio and twiddling knobs and going why don't we plug this through this or you know we don't feel like I'm breaking boundaries and rules and doing well why not why not get into a studio it's still there next door it's still there gathering dust the last time I used it in angle was with the Rizzle Kicks right and they openly laughed at me when they saw what equipment I was using And to this day, when they're ever asked, what was it like working with Norman? They always go, you wouldn't believe how antique his studio is. See, I mean, you know, your career is doing as well as ever, as successful as ever. Why has Norman Cook Fatboy Slim endured for so long? A number of reasons. I do think I do have some kind of talent, an ear for a hit, be it an ear for writing one or just hearing somebody else's and thinking, that's good, I'll play that when I'm DJing. I do think I've got a talent for it. I also have an absolute love... and passion for it which means that I just refuse to give up and there have been years when you know there's been times when my friends have turned around to me and said maybe it's time you you know got a proper job you know this isn't really you know this isn't happening for you I'm like I don't know let me just you know and there's been times when I've been that close from from being bankrupt And so it hasn't, those 32 years haven't all been hits. There's been a lot of misses, you know, and, but I've just stuck at it. I refuse to do anything else. But I think it's my genuine love for doing it. Some people, if they want to do something to earn a lot of money, once they've earned that amount of money, they lose their passion to do it. I haven't lost my passion, even though I've earned enough money probably to retire on. I don't do it for the money. I do it because I really love it. It keeps me sane, it keeps me driven and I feel that personal connection. I think that's one of the reasons why the studio doesn't turn me on so much. because that's just me sitting on my own. When I'm DJing, I've got all these people around me and I'm communicating with them and I'm making them happy and they're making me happy. And that's the most fantastic job to have. I don't take it for granted. And yes, I'm going to squeeze every drop out of it that I can until somebody comes along and says, come in number... 58 of your time is up I mean the thing is none of us know what the retirement age is for a DJ Carl doesn't Pete Tong doesn't well I was I was I was looking at none of us you know basically the only the only DJs from our generation who stopped are Frankie Knuckles yeah they're the ones who died sadly with Mancuso yeah I was looking at I think Dianton Aguilera's Yeah, Danny Taggart tried to retire and then he couldn't get away from it. ♪ Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy ♪ ♪ Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy ♪ I love.
