Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. You're probably aware that your favorite producers and DJs aren't alone in managing the nitty-gritty of their careers. Much of what these folks working behind the scenes do, though, is likely a mystery to many beyond the tight circle of agents and managers who work in it. It's in that spirit that we invited Alma Porich and Alexandra Lindblad by our Berlin office recently. They're partners in Backroom Entertainment, an agency that handles the likes of Dixon, Monty, and Dixon. and metro area. Their roster alone would give us plenty to speak about, but we instead kept the focus on the agents themselves, what they do, how they do it, and how all of that has evolved over the course of the agency's nearly 20 years in the business. you you So you guys run Backroom Entertainment, which is a booking agency. You represent a number of artists that people almost certainly know. We're not going to talk about that necessarily today, but people probably don't know who you are. So I thought a good way to start would be to just... maybe have each of you tell me a little bit about your backgrounds and how you got into being booking agents. I started very early with 15, 16. I started to do tour management for bands and also doing bookings already. And my booking agent career as it is now started in 94 when I went with a friend of mine who became my partner at that time, Katja Gobin. We went to have the first rave organized in Germany. Chile for the Sun Eclipse. She organized it. She took me with her and it was with Derek May, Zico Bredezone, Ricardo Villalobos, Stacey Pullen, blah, blah. So we were there and that's when she told me, listen, I made so much contact with different artists. I have them all now set up, don't you think it would be clever to take this other contact and start an agency? And that's when we decided to do the agency. That was 94 and in the same time I started to work for Groove Magazine. So I took the advantage of working for Groove Magazine to do groove club tours. So I got to know a bunch of artists through that. But also we started to... be big fans of Detroit and Chicago artists and at that time there was nothing but a fax machine that kept us staying in touch with these people all over the world. phone, which we were like too shy to use. Actually me, maybe Katja not, but we looked at the records that we liked and we contacted the people by fax and they wrote, eventually wrote us back and we booked them. So that was the beginning of my agency. It all started with a fax machine. Yes. That's pretty great. Yes. Alex, what about you? Well, I... came into the game in 1999 then. And I was a music lover since ever. And since I stopped my school, I always wanted to do something with music, but I was never sure how to enter the game. I knew there was labels, I knew there was distributions and so on, but... I always needed to earn money and basically for me to do like a career via a major label was never an option. I never wanted to do, I never wanted to promote music that I don't like. So I started just like a normal business career and started to study and I started then working in a record store in 1998. And in 1999, Alma came up to me and offered me that job. And when she said to me, just like, do you think it would make sense for you to start working in a booking agency? Quickly, like, presented me what it would be the job like. And I just thought, like, wow, that was actually what I wanted to do all my life. So that was on a Sunday that she proposed me to check out her office and what she would do. And that was Sunday after a big party on a Saturday. We were quite hangover, both lying at the lake. And she said, yeah, come by on Monday. So I come to her office on Monday, which was at Groove Magazine. And she gave me a very quick... introduction about what it is to work as a booking agent which she did in two hours and basically I think the reason why she wanted to have me so quickly into her company was because actually the next day she was going on tour with Ian Pooley, her artist back then. And she didn't have a phone that would work in America. And we didn't have a computer back then. I mean, we only had like a fixed computer. So she was just like, okay, so there's this and this tour that you need to finish. There's the radio program that you need to do for a national radio. There's some Benny Kassim. still unclarities with some reflex artists that you need to check. And basically this is the tour schedule of my American tour. So you can reach me every night in this hotel. And I'm gone now. Bye. And she left me. And I was just sitting there. And I was like... All right, so I have to organize this all and I have to get into this job now very quickly. And actually, just like she came back after three weeks and everything was done. Yes. So Alma, you needed someone to stand in for you while you were off in America. I was always used to have a partner, actually. So it was one year that I split from my old partner. And it was clear I need another one. And yes, as she describes at that time, everything was still not working. Mobile phones in America would have been different. And yeah, I just always, I never felt I want to work alone on the, how do you call this? Yeah, you just didn't want to take decisions alone. You didn't want to be the only manager at the company. No, exactly. I don't like the idea of being that, no. So this agency that you formed in the wake of this rave in Chile in 1994 is what became Backroom Entertainment. Yes. Yeah. So you guys have now been around for almost... 20 years next year is the 20 year anniversary yeah um how has being a booking agent changed over that period of time yeah it has changed a lot yeah so i think at the beginning it was basically fans talking to fans and no matter what like would it be a dj a producer a promoter agent we were all really really into the music and more exchanging the information that we had and one was the promoter and one was the agent but there was not a we were all in one ground I would say rather and so in a being a booking agent that time was more giving the promoter the information who is coming and who is hot and who is doing good music. And they would believe it. They would be like, okay, whatever you say, we're going to book it because of course it's going to be like that. While nowadays... promoters they want to just book the headliners all of them they don't believe what the agent tells them about new artists mostly not they're really bored by that part to listen to that so I think yeah we became from the times where we were all really just into the music and providing the good stuff to the clubs now we're just more more or less service agents you know so if i look at the amount of releases and the amount of artists and agencies that existed let's say end of the 90s you still had like a clear overview of like the amount of releases coming out every week. You had the fax lists from the distributions. You had the DJs that would go and tour. And you would have in every country maybe five or six agencies. Promoters definitely just like, it wasn't an amount of artists that would tour that was like overviewable. Nowadays you have like thousands of artists, thousands of agencies and everybody's trying as hard as possible to get there. piece on the market and yeah that makes it so difficult nowadays it's hard to separate the the high quality acts from the low quality acts i think it's very easy it's just a it's a quantity issue you just need to listen to it i mean just like and that's then sometimes yeah i don't know for us it's very natural to separate yeah high quality or low quality artists i think maybe it's a little bit also the problem of the club people jumping too much on the train of okay we need headliners we need something that gives us more people, a bigger crowd, but then they run into this bad competition. where all the clubs want the same and you can't really present good quality acts that are not that known. And I think maybe there is where the concept goes wrong. Too many clubs just think like, okay, I do a club and yes, I want a big artist so I get a lot of people coming. And then we had this talk before, Alex and I, and then all of a sudden... This one club suffers because everyone wants to go to the other club who is big. And then this club can't exist by smaller artists. And I think there is a way to avoid this by having a good club crowd, by good... by providing a good sound or you know why you're going there. It's almost like a family thing. You know, I go to the club and I will have a certain quality of music, no matter who is playing, and that's why I'm going there. Instead of, oh, I'm going there because such and such is playing there, and next night I go to that club because such and such is playing. And I think that is what is... what got lost and in my times in the beginning of 90s that was still there you would go to a club because you believed in the club program and you didn't care about is it a big or a small artist really very few clubs have basically developed to have a crowd which just goes there because of the club and of course I mean this is a long it's a hard work for it's mostly visionaries who are behind that and it's not like only the booker but it's a visionary who says I have this room and I want to create something in this room and I want to have a special audience and there's going to be special drinks and there's going to be a special light And if people realize this, then they will come even if just like two residents will be playing. And I can just like this, maybe five clubs in Europe, which have this attitude. Yeah, a lot. It seems like a lot of clubs have in a way almost. come more like concert venues. They're bringing in a program. Often it's coming in from another country or at the very least from some other city, from some other scene. This whole concept of the headliner, it kind of sounds like what you're saying is maybe that is one of the real big developments that you guys have witnessed. But Berlin is different. That's the thing. Berlin is the only city where this is different, where there's not such a pressure to have these super high name-dropping lineups because at the end of the day, there's so many people just coming because of the nightlife every weekend. So they have a more loose situation. to bring along as well people that are just friends and good DJs. I think also the difficulty compared to earlier days is you had different styles of music and there were different clubs for the styles. And you would know like, okay, in Istanbul, I know this is the deep house club, this is the techno club, this has totally changed. There's one city, maybe big or small, and they're like five, six clubs. And then on top, maybe five promoters doing different parties in these clubs. So you have a huge amount of people coming to you wanting. All the same artists, all the same. There is no difference anymore. And that is something I don't understand. So you're totally lost with one city and 10,000 requests for, and you're like, okay, what is the reference of your club? Oh, this is the lineup. Yeah, that's the same as the other club. Show me the pictures. Oh, okay, that's a nice venue. You don't know how to categorize it anymore. That has changed. Yeah, and in the end, then personality counts because then if you find the passionate promoter, the one you click with, the one where you have a similar taste, and that's then the one where you go, where you think like, okay, you know, we've... share one vision and yeah so it's getting harder to fit artists with the right clubs yeah you don't know it anymore unless you go there and you figure it out you don't know and everyone wants the same stuff with our agency at least I don't know how it's for others everyone wants to have the same everyone takes everything from from minimal to techno to house, it's all happening in this one club and they're all concurrents, they're all in competition with each other. Yeah, but at the end of the day, that's the new ones or like the ones where we, sometimes, you know, we get a request for maybe one of our more eclectic DJs and then they say, you know. These and these and these acts have played there before. And I may just, like, call one of them and say, like, hey, how was it? And they tell me, yeah, super nice guy, took me to a great restaurant, had a perfect night. Yeah, that's then about it. So these days, when you're trying to decide where to send one of your artists, or you're getting requests in for this artist, and you're trying to decide which one to take, I mean, how do you make that decision? If you have a deep house artist, and there isn't one club that's reliably the great deep house club, how do you make that decision? What venue do you send that person to? I sometimes really have to go there. So is that a big part of the job is traveling and seeing these places? Yes, you have to. I think, I believe you have to. I mean, if you, otherwise you are lying to yourself and to the artist because there is no other way to find that out unless you were there. Or as Alex says, you have a good reference. Somebody says, okay, really, I was there and that is the right club for the other artist. Yes. Yeah, but we do that effort. I mean, I think it's very important to select just the right club for the artists, especially for the ones who can select. You know, I mean, if you get like five requests from one city and you need to do that decision, it's very important that you make the right decision. because, yeah, that's what your job is all about. So sometimes, yeah, you just like, you either ask like someone who has played there or you either go yourself and wait until... Half a year later and then you book him there, right? something else that Plays into this whole headliner thing is like emerging talent, you know if you sign somebody who's not as big as your biggest artist How do you get that artist in the door at some of these clubs? How does that process work? How do you promote people who are not so well known yet? As Alma said, it was easy before because they really listened. I mean, just like I can tell you a list of numerous clubs who would call us like once a month and say like, hey. You know, just like who is hot, who should we bring next month? But that was a long time ago. And nowadays actually, like some of the promoters still listen. I think just like, yeah, like some of the like really important clubs who we go a very long way with, who know that we have a really, like, or that we go the same taste. We have the same taste and then they sometimes listen. Yeah, but it's hard. I think one good thing is if that artist is connected to a bigger artist and we can take this reference, we can say like, oh, you don't know much about him, but already such and such artist that you know is raving on about him and says like he's really good. And if this emerged like the small... artists can make the bigger artists to help him to talk about him. That's basically the door opener. Yes, we are not, we don't have the power too much anymore. I mean, I sometimes do it. I did it with a band that I had. I just mentioned the name so often that the people would look at me and see the name and like be, you know, already in shock. Like, please don't say this name anymore. I cannot. This is a way to, you know, this is like hardcore promotion. But everyone hates you after, but everybody knows this. Yeah. Everyone knew the act. Well, and I'm sure that artists don't want your services for you to be like nice. They're wanting you to sort of step in and promote them, you know, to be an advocate for them. Yeah, but at the end of the day, I mean, you're not the only, I mean, you have a row of artists. So, I mean, just like being the agent who hangs on the phone and kind of gets on the nerves of... of the promoter it doesn't help because at the end of the day he's not going to pick up the phone anymore when he sees your number yeah so um it's better just like to just send a link of the live act or or a dj set and say like hey listen but i mean actually the best method is just like and if If it's really that way that one artist likes the other artist, the next time he goes there and plays there, he's like, hey, you know, you need to book this and this person. He's really great. And that's the only chance. Something else that's a big kind of buzzword these days in this music industry is like brands. You know, you're not exactly a label. You're not exactly an artist. You're sort of this. amorphous thing that has a reputation for something. Maybe it's a sound. I mean, with an agency like Backroom, is that something that you guys kind of have to consider? Does it help you to get your artists booked if you're kind of known for a certain sound or a certain aesthetic? Does that play into what you guys do at all? I think by luck. and maybe just by not even trying to go there, we went there. And nowadays everyone tells us like, well, you guys are like a brand, like you stand for one style. And every time I look at our roster, I think like, is it really only one style? I don't think so. But it's our personal taste. And I think our branding is our personal taste matches so well. Alex and I can blindly add artists without even, you know. Talking to each other. Yeah, we are 100% sure it's going to be a good. choice from the other person and it's it's not one sound because I think also we are too old to have only one sound right yeah it would be a little bit strange if we would be just in one style but yeah a lot of people now this year started to tell us hey you guys are like a brand but we don't want I mean just like we didn't we just didn't push it that way I mean, we're very, I mean, we want to be actually persons in the background. Yes, yes, yes. Absolutely. And I, yeah, just like we were never this kind of persons who said like, we need to make. regular backroom parties, put our logo on the flyer, let's do a record label. I've been approached a few times just like by a distribution who said like, Alex, why don't you do a label? You have such a good taste. And I'm like, oh no, come on, let others do that job. You know, just let me be a small booking agent. Yeah, just be specialized instead of branching out and spreading your talents thin or something like that. Yes, totally. No, we are absolutely understatement with branding stuff. We don't like that at all. And we did last year, we did two backroom parties and it was our first ever after 19 years. We said, okay, now we want to do a party. And we were so surprised about how amazing this happened. Okay, this needs to be cut out. Oh, it's fine. Yeah, we were so surprised how amazingly this developed. Because, I mean, at the end it was over 2,000 people. It was an amazing crowd. And yeah, we used the Stadtbad wedding for it, which was back then like a totally new venue. And yeah, we just saw all the people who came. I mean, I think this is a little bit of the mirror. Then we saw like, oh, this actually all the people would come there. Do they only come because of this and this artist or do they come because of us? I think there we got a little bit into this, oh, how much are we a brand and how much is it backroom being, you know, the trigger point here to get people in or is it certain artists? And I think, yeah, by luck, really by luck, we have a taste that translates into a special style. But I would always say we don't have one style. We are not. like disco house hats and not electronic and not trans. I think it's pretty much all over the place. If we hear somebody playing and we are totally euphoric about it, we would take him into agency, if he fits or not. You guys have mentioned this a few times, that you feel like you have a particular taste. Do you think that's something you could put into words? Can you say what that taste is? I think... for me it's a certain energy that artists give you know maybe maybe you can call it deep but I think it's a certain energy it's like something that you feel comes out of no yeah but I mean if you think about I mean just like the sort of disco we like the sort of house we like the sort of techno we like is always in a certain velocity and it has its deeper. Velocity is a really interesting word. What do you mean by velocity in a musical sense? Yes, Alex, what do you mean? I just don't like it too fast. So you're talking about speed. I just don't like it too fast. No happy hardcore. No happy hardcore. No, it never existed in my... Sure. So first and foremost, when you guys are picking artists, you're looking for that sort of intangible sound, that kind of artistic quality that you think fits. Yeah, but the personalities as well is super important. If it doesn't personally click, and if we don't have the same sort of humor... And yeah, just like personality is just like the next important thing. But I think it never changed since 94 to now. It never changed that we would listen to something and say like, oh my God, what the hell is that? Who is it? In which agency is he? Can we have him? Like, I think that is... But we never stole people from other agencies. No, but can we have him means like sometimes, I mean, someone, them were not in agency when we found them and also because we listen to music we know it before it gets big so most of them i mean metro area we took them with the very first record they ever produced Todd Terrier was... Todd Terrier, Lindstrom, Prince Thomas. I mean, they had a very little agent in the UK. Rahm was there. Yeah, Christian and Frank as well, same. I mean, yeah, none of them was like at a big established agency before we took them from the beginning. Henrik, Henrik Schwarz. Yeah. Are you looking for a certain work ethic in artists as well? I mean, with all of these guys, they've gone on to be quite big. I'm guessing that they were down to do shows at that level. I guess basically what I'm asking about is kind of the nuances of that personality. You're looking for a sound, but you're also looking for certain qualities in their personality. I have to say there are certain limits where I say I cannot represent you for your demands. That is there. That I can say, okay, I represent you. That means all your needs and wishes will be delivered by the promoter or by the festival or whatever. But I experience it that there is, yeah, there is a border where I say like, okay, sorry, but this I can't communicate because I'm not behind it, you know. So this is one ethic I would say I have definitely in myself. Yeah, if it's a diva without reason, then just like that's something I really just like can't. Yeah, represent. There was a more weaker time, I don't know when that was, but a beginning of 2000 where the artists were all pretty much taking us as service people. You remember, Alex? Where we were feeling very down because from being part of the... scene we became like oh please check this and this and there was no personality involved like no personal touch And we felt very bad. I remember it changed again. Maybe we sorted out our roster in the right way, got rid of these people. I don't know, but it changed. There was a time where you got mails that were like just demand and like, okay, you do that because you get money for this. Please do it. I think that's something that we are not looking for. So you're looking, oh, I'm sorry. And something else, what I have to say is just like if I hear. And sometimes other agents or people will say like, hey, you know, I mean, just like if you have if you're presenting DJs, you have to get phone calls all over the weekend and you have to stress and check out things. I don't know why it is that just like we are actually pretty well organized, but as well, just like the matter of fact that the people we work with. I mean, they don't get completely lost and messy. So there's no one who has to be picked up by an after-hour not knowing in which city he is and he has lost all his papers and he doesn't know what his name is. Or doesn't get out of the hotel. So it's easier life. We have actually quite well-behaved... Nice people. Kind of sounds like what you're saying is that you want it to feel like sort of a collaboration in a way. Yes. You don't want it to be a situation where you're just working for the artists, getting the artists these gigs. fulfilling a certain role, you're kind of helping them where it's your place to help and where it's something that they couldn't do, but they kind of have to hold up their end of the bargain as well. Yeah, I think from... I don't know if Alex is that way, but I think I would have always liked to be an artist and therefore I'm seeing myself as a companion from them rather than an agent. There was a time I said I'm rather a bad agent even. for them but I understand them from their point of view I always I can always not take things too personal when they want something but the same time I feel the same way so this is maybe why I'm not And I'm still the fan. I still like what they do. So I don't want to be treated like I'm just this agent sitting somewhere in an office and doing the work. That is a little bit devastating for me. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's like basically I was always surrounded by artists, but I was never like properly an artist myself. So I knew I was good in doing the business things, but I knew that my head would actually work relatively artistically. So I understand them very well, but I know the business side. So, but yeah, I feel as well, just like more like, yeah, to the artist connect. and then talking to the promoter. Yes, exactly. That's the difference to other agents sometimes too. They feel more connected to the promoter and also to marketing people, to radio people. I think we always feel the most connected. Sorry for all the promoters who listen to that. That's how we feel to our artists. Sure. I would imagine that that's part of what you guys have to sort of deal with when you're doing this, is being careful about becoming too close to certain parts of the business. You want your allegiance to truly stay with the artist. And that's probably a really important thing with doing this job. Yeah, totally. This thing that you guys had mentioned about... some artists coming with really wild demands about what they think that you guys are going to do. Is that something that has also really changed over the 20 years of doing this? Well, what has changed is that the newcomers are nowadays, they're not themselves knocking on the doors. but it's their managers. So it's before, like somebody has like one or two releases and he has a manager and the manager is going to try and sell me the... The artist, this is actually the new thing in the last two, three years, that just like every artist is trying to do it through the way of a manager. I don't think there were high demands or something. It's sometimes really ethically to say some didn't want to do certain countries. or they want the best hotel, but in the best hotel, the best room, and then he's in the best hotel, and you need to sort out the best room, and you say, like, okay, this is where my limit is. I cannot... come to the promoter and say stuff like this right what oh yeah and then just like some newcomers as well negotiating their slots yeah something like this sometimes we say yeah yeah so but i'm not really happy to play this in this time I mean just like of course I'm happy to negotiate slots if it doesn't make sense um but if it's if it makes sense and somebody just put wants to put himself into a better light And basically, just like it's understandable why the promoter doesn't want to give him that explicit slot. That's where I'm saying, like, come on, just like be realistic. This sort of goes back to that point that we had touched on a little bit earlier about emerging talent. I would imagine that you maybe occasionally come across artists who are pretty new, you know, maybe you have a couple of tracks out. Have gotten a couple of big DJ gigs. There's a little bit of a buzz going. Do you ever have to sort of like talk artists down and sort of come up with a longer term plan instead of like, all right, we're just going to go full on for big gigs right away. Talk down, yes. Maybe Alex has something like this. Too high expectations, kind of, you think, yeah? I think, no, mostly this artist would come and say, like, okay, let us know, what can we do? How can we push this career? And I always say, there's nothing we can do. Seriously, there's nothing. All you can do is put out a track that... is the bomb or something i don't know what else is there there's nothing else you can do either this or you really gotta show everyone talked about but there is nothing to push it and that's maybe where we talk them down and say listen yeah i mean there's all these kind of like So managers then call it target plan for the next year, the target plans. And basically at the end of the day, I mean, just like if somebody demands an artist and he gets the slot, the right slot in the right club or he gets a residency, it's not, it's... It's beyond our control. I mean, it's great if it happens and we can try to make it happen, but we're no magicians. We're only agents. So, I don't know. If I look back on the careers of the people that we handled since 10 years, I mean, for those, we didn't do any target plans. It just happened. I mean, it just happened from month to month, year to year. And they grew slowly, but surely, but consistently as well. And I think that's just very important. If I look at some people who shoot up in one year, and then they're like the number one stars. And I wonder if they're still there in five years. And a lot of the people we represent have been just like growing within the last five, six, seven, eight years, slowly but surely. And I hope they will be still there in 10 years. So is your job not so much, it kind of sounds like your job is not so much to grow the career of the artist, but to sort of just facilitate that, to sort of take requests in, to see how it makes sense. You're not coming up with the game plan for the artist. That's not necessarily your job. No, we are not so much artist development if it comes to... really taking action into developing the career. But if you are on our roster as a smaller act, it can be that you create attention by just being there. So we say if I see an artist, like you said, who just had a few releases and I can see the potential in him, all I tell them is, come on, we have you on our roster. People will see your name and we feed the news on our homepage and Facebook site. So eventually people will get more and more sight of who you are. And one day it might. hit them to book you. That's pretty much it, right? I mean, if we look at the amount of acts that we took in the last years, I mean, just like a lot of them grew. A lot of them, like, hired their profile and are now like a constantly booked act. And, you know, we're not the youngest anymore. So sometimes I really think like, okay, do I still know what's hot in the business? But then still, I mean, just like it's an instinct. I think we just pick the right people. But it works. Often enough, it doesn't work. And we're afraid sometimes to take in people because... Sometimes it's just like I'm so afraid to see it once again that we take in acts and there's nothing happening. And after a year I have to say, well, you know, I'm so sorry, but... So by nothing happening, you mean... there isn't interest being drummed up. You're not able to fulfill gigs. One thing I'm curious about is when you're signing artists, are you looking for people, though, who do want to get progressively bigger and bigger gigs? I mean, what if somebody comes to you and says, I just kind of want to stay right where I am. Yeah, mostly this is the artists we have. They say, I just want to be where I am. We don't want anyone who's like saying, in one year I want to be King Kong. No, and especially I think there are better agents for this kind of people. I definitely think so. You know, they are doing more for them in terms of... bringing them to podcast radio shows, to promote them on special promotion parties. What do I know? If it even makes sense, that's the thing. Yeah, but we don't even, you know, for us, anyone comes to us is suspicious who starts to call us twice, three times a week and ask for the progress of their career. That's like, okay, you're in the wrong age. for sure. Now we don't do that. We don't do that. Alex, you made this point about managers, this being sort of a new thing. And this is not the first time that this has come up at this table, actually. And it's something I definitely wanted to ask you guys about. A few months ago, we had a guy in here, Mikael Stengel, who works with Boiler Room and helps to run a lot of more experimental events. And he said some things that I thought were really interesting that sort of speak to this professionalization of the industry. He says a lot of the music that we love and that we're involved with and that's still actually quite niche has become so professional. He goes on to talk about quite often, the bookings did not happen because I could not match the financial reality of what I do with the expectations of the booking agent. Whereas I'm pretty sure if I had spoken with the artist, it would have been a lot more It wouldn't be a problem, which is obviously part of the whole process. And he sort of is talking in this interview about wanting to kind of become more one-on-one with the artist. I was really curious to ask a booking agent about this. That is something that I wanted to say earlier about when you said, what are you telling? the artist if he wants to get bigger I had a lot of new artists that I first took in the agency and then after a while I said I think you are better off without an agent at that certain stage because everyone, when I come as an agent, you know, I almost mess it up because people are like, oh, I really like his music, but oh, he's coming with an agent. Come on, like, you know, I would do the deal. And a lot of times they would ask them by mail or Facebook and then I would mail them back. So like, yeah, I'm the agent. Thanks for your interest. And they're like, oh, what an arrogant idiot, you know, I don't want to I think on a certain stage of your career, it is, yeah, unnecessary to have all this. And you're better off to have a direct contact, exactly as this guy says. Exactly. He's totally right. Michael is definitely right with the smaller acts. Because, I mean, at the end of the day, I had it as well so often that, like, people contact me or they contact the artist. And then there's such a small budget in the pot where I say, oh, come on, better leave me out. Anyway, that guy wants to have a personal contact with you. going to sort out your flight you don't have to have a contract you know just like leave me out it's rather destructive because they even if they call up a club and say listen you know or the promoter they know from somewhere and say listen I did this in this track and they're like oh nice would you like to have me play I think they have a better chance than us breaking it over but basically I don't if if He meant like the bigger range artists. I don't know. I mean, basically, we only negotiate the prices that our artists like kind of like say that they want to have. I'm not that chart just like trying to get more and more and more and more for the acts. No, just like I and the artists as well. evaluate a lot in between like a high quality 300 capacity event and they would come for much less than they ask for a 700 capacity whatever bigger club with a bigger higher entrance fee or whatsoever but i think even the bigger artists what he mentions they i had a lot of our artists would um with him especially or with other good people just talk privately directly and say listen yeah okay we can do that and come on, please clear the organization stuff with our agent. I think that is totally legitimate. Absolutely. So it sounds like kind of what you're saying is... the time to sort of join an agency like yours is when you sort of no longer as an artist have the capacity to handle all of this stuff that has to go on. You're getting so many bookings coming in. Yes, I think that is the right. Yeah, absolutely. That is when you should go. Yeah. But it also sounds like there's risk in too early getting hooked up with a manager or something like this. Absolutely. Come on, absolutely. I think so too. Yeah, I mean, it's just another branch in our business. So, I mean, the hope that somebody will pop up as a big act and somebody wanting to help him. I mean, it's absolutely legitimate that there is these people. And I mean, of course, I mean, just like there's great managers who help the artists just like to really get step by step bigger, which we wouldn't be able to do as agencies because it would be as well beyond our work field. And I mean, which the artist as well didn't want to do. And especially if it's a good manager who's well connected with all sorts of labels and who can get him like great remix deals. And then it's absolutely useful. Yeah. I think there is a common hate of manager language to say that. You can be right. It can be the best manager, but managers have a language. If they call you like, oh, my God, come on. Speaking in like buzzwords or something like this. But the managers that we work with. we really like. Yes, but I mean, just as a common sense, there's like, you know, everyone would say they're like, oh my God, this manager. It's like advertisement agency people talk. There's a manager language. I guess we have a language too, but I just had a big discussion with a big festival promoter and he's like, man, back then, I mean, we had to talk to the booking agents and now we have to talk to the managers. as well and then there's the press person of the artist and so it's so many people who are nowadays involved it's just like half a circle for every artist so going back to things that have changed um as you guys have been have been doing this you've mentioned a few times um you know people coming out with music and you get really into the tracks that they're coming out with. I mean, this has sort of become a barometer of somebody's, of a young artist, a young DJ's success is the music that they're producing. Is this a new development? You always hear it's impossible to just be a DJ nowadays. Is this something that you guys have witnessed? It is possible. Yeah. I think back early in the days, Katja, my former partner, was coming back from the States and she came and said like, okay, that is the craziest DJ and he's the only DJ that I've ever seen. And that was DJ Trax. And we got him over. And he was succeeding. And I think, should I say Dixon as well? Of course, Dixon is only a DJ. I mean, he created Innovisions, he created a brand, but he's only a DJ. And I think so. It is possible, but you have to have a lot of... Atta is only a DJ. Yeah. Is it harder to sell somebody who's only a DJ to clubs nowadays? It's not harder to sell, but it's basically, it's harder to stay on that high level. I, yeah, there's, it's easier to be forgotten easily if you don't have like follow-up productions in some, yeah, just like for some people. I witnessed it a few times. for only DJs that they were really big like six, seven years ago who are not that big anymore. Yeah, I wonder who those DJs are. only DJs are I don't even know anyone Jeff K for example Jeff K for example but he came back but there was a time that he was struggling and now he's back but there was a time that he was struggling because he's only a DJ looking forward maybe to the next 10 years the next 20 years however long you guys want to do this Is there something that you would really like to see change about the industry from a booking agent's perspective? Yeah, I would like the club, the promoters to change again and to be more into the content of their nights. That's what I started the conversation with. I think I wish they would be more into the... the program instead of the headliner and instead of just looking for the competitors just being real in why they want this party to happen and look for the smallest details to be correct in this one night or in this one club and you just enter this club and you think like okay everything is here everything here makes sense you know as you said Alex like the light the bar people the bar the drinks everything that is please in every city please one of these clubs absolutely Yeah, I mean, if it would go back to the passion of music solely, it's the passion of music and everybody would do their best to get like the best sound system. And that's the thing. Everybody comes nowadays and says like... I have a function one sound system. But it doesn't matter if it has a function one sound system, if it's not properly leveled, if it's not equalized perfectly, and you don't have the perfect sound inside, it doesn't fucking matter. So yeah, the passion about music, if it would come back a little bit more, that would be great. Thank you. you
