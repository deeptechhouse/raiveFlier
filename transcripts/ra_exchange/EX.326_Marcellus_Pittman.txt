Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. This is our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling, and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is our final recording from the Deck Mantle Festival conference back in August, a conversation between R.A. Stephen Titmus and the highly respected Detroit DJ and producer. Marcellus Pittman. Pittman has been releasing distinctive deep house records since the late 90s, but his name began to widely resonate when he started working with Three Chairs, a kind of Detroit supergroup whose members include Rick Wilhite, Theo Parrish, and Moody Man. These days you can find Pittman pushing only the finest in Detroit dance music at clubs around the globe. And indeed, when we spoke with him, he just stepped off an eight-hour flight with no sleep. We wanted to thank him for being such a good sport in allowing Stephen to grill him on the ins and outs of his impressive career. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Marcellus Pittman is up next. Bye. Welcome to the second in the series of our discussions at Deck Mantle Conference. We've got a really packed schedule for you today, but now we've got Mr. Marcellus Pittman, Detroit's finest. Greetings, greetings. How's everybody doing? So how are you doing, Marcellus? I know you had a tough flight over here. Oh man, I am sleepy. Running on empty fumes right now, so bear with me. So obviously we're at Deckmantle Conference, but as the festival, this is not your first time here. No. You were here 2014. 2014, yes. That was the most amazing time we've ever had. We did like eight hours, I think, something like that, but it was magnificent. And when you say we, that's free chairs. Free chairs, yes, sir. And for people who don't know, that's yourself, Rick Wilhite, Fiat Parish, and Kenny Dixon Judah, aka Moody Man. Yes, sir. So tell me about the set because that's obviously some pretty serious, heavy-hitting DJs right there. How'd it go down? Magic, man. Straight-up magic. Just straight-up magic. We're just doing our thing, the Detroit thing. In terms of meeting those guys, you knew those guys a long time before you actually joined. free chairs. How did you meet them originally though? I met Theo first and I met him at this place called the Billiard Gallery back in 1994 and through Theo I met Kenny first, then Rick last. And so I think around 1998 is when they first came out with the three chairs double pack. And I was there with them when they putting the finishing touches on it. Like I was always there with them. you know, as the fifth wheel, as you would say. But I would do parties with them, and it was all four of us all night. And so they finally decided to ask me. I wanted to be in three chairs, and I was looking around, talking to me. Yeah, you motherfucker. So ever since then, it's just been us four. But we decided not to change the name since it's like musical chairs when we play. Yeah, that definitely makes sense. And I heard that actual sort of initial ask was pretty informal. What, were you playing Tekken around their house or something like that? Yes, yes. A full round of Tekken in Kenny's house. Like, that's all we would do. Listen to music, drink beers, smoke a little something and play Tekken. So who's the best at Tekken in free chairs? See, that's hard, man. Kenny is really good with a character called King. Like, King does these moves, like just ridiculous moves, and Kenny knows how to do all of them. Like, you got to stay out of his way with King. Rick, he's... good with he's all right theo he's good with uh law and a couple other players And I'm good with my boy Byron. Man, I haven't played it in so long. You seem to recall the characters very well, though. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, man. It was serious business, man. Well, we can't talk about tech in the whole day. Right. I know most of the crowd would be up for this. But going back to Three Chairs, you know, you mentioned the musical chair element. And one thing that I always find interesting about those records, it's not always even clear who's made what in the group from the records. Can you maybe tell me about what instance does it become? Okay, we're going to work in this way, me and Kenny or me and Theo. Is it just, you just don't even put your thought into that? No, we don't. think about it. But the last Three Chairs album, Three Chairs theme was all four of us. And this was before the 9-11 happened. This was like days before the 9-11. Well, I suppose really the ethos of it is quite interesting that, you know, it's just four guys in the group, but you don't always know who's done what. You know, that's not the way usually a lot of groups work. You know, people like to shout about, you know, I've done this. Oh, no, it works like that. But it escapes me because I'm jet lagging right now. So I'm scatterbrains. Well, maybe another flip on it is, you know Omar S on a particular record and you know that's a TOM record or it might be a rotating assembly record you know what point when you and Firo make a record together it's like okay this is definitely Free Chairs you know what makes a Free Chairs record a Free Chairs record it's when we decide to do an album or a 12 inch basically it's real simple it's not like we like I get together with Theo and like okay yeah we're gonna put that on three now because him and I work together a lot like we have unreleased stuff that like we don't like we'll never you know there's actually a T.O.M. album that never saw the light of day so And most of the songs we don't like. Is that stuff you've even tried playing out or are you just straight up not happy with that material? Well, the reason why we don't like it is because most of the songs Omar wasn't featured on. It was just mostly me and Theo. And then maybe like three or four songs with Omar. But it's mostly... Theo and I. I mean, some of them aren't good, but we just don't need to have all three of us, you know, in the collaboration. So we decided not to put it out. And one thing just generally, it seems like Detroit as a music scene is very tight. You know, it seems like there's a lot of unity within that scene. Is that wrong from the outside? Yeah, that's very wrong. Okay. As far as the techno, it's real clickish sometimes, you know. especially with the techno guys. The techno guys don't really talk to the house guys and vice versa. But the hip-hop guys are coming to both our functions. For instance, Jay Dilla back in the day used to come to the house functions. Eminem, everybody used to come to the house functions. You know, the house people going to techno. You'll find certain people like me, like I like all kinds of music. Well, maybe that's just you then, because you seem to get along with everyone pretty well. Yeah. Maybe, yeah, maybe it's just me. Yeah. Yeah. So interestingly, though, Detroit as a whole, obviously, I'm European, but Detroit music's had such a humongous impact on, you know, our culture, you know, whether it's Motown, you know, Jay Diller, techno, you know, is there something specific about the city that makes these amazing, you know, completely original musicians, do you think? It's the hard work. The blue collar mentality and the Great Lakes is the Rust Belt. Like Motown, you know, just hard working musicians, dirt poor, you know. Yeah, man. It's just hard work, man. And is that something that every Detroit person is raised with that? I guess from their family, everyone around them is working hard. You feel like that's the way you've got to approach music and your art. I don't know about other families. But my family, they worked hard. My mother and father. We're musicians. My mother played the piano. My father played the bass, and they're both singers. My father's father, he played the drums and keys as well, and just a whole bunch of family members that are musicians, so I naturally picked that up. And what made me... want to do it was the radio because the radio back then was just a one you know you had mojo the wizard of course everybody mentions them but they don't mention uh duane in the mix bradley and there's this jazz station where it's now defunct but um My favorite DJ, her name was Rosetta Hines. And she would play these tunes called mystery tunes. And a lot of it would be Larry Hurd and his group called Kiss the Sky. But she would play that stuff. And it's just mystery O tune, mystery A, mystery B, mystery C. You're like, man, what? You know, what is this? You know, but to me doing digging, you know, I finally found out it's Larry Heard. No wonder, you know, so. It's radio, man. Radio and TV. Yeah, I've read that Detroit has got a particularly, certainly back then, had a very particular style of radio broadcast that wasn't the same in other American cities where they were more likely to mix rock music with urban music. They didn't have the same formats. Is that something that impacted your style of DJing? Oh, man, yes, yes, yes. Particularly Mojo. Like, who is allowed to play 17 minutes of just Star Wars? And he'll just talk over it and just talk. Just like, wow, this dude is amazing. And 17 minutes. And then he'll play, let's say, Knee Deep, Problem in Funkadelic. from start to finish. Like, wow. You're allowed to do that on a radio? You know, and wow, that was a big influence on me because if you notice, I let songs stretch out as well. I like, you know, let the song breathe. You know, I like to get to what I call the orgasm. Let the song get into that orgasm part. You know, don't take it out. two or three minutes into it. And then once you get to the orgasm, you take it out, you're like, oh, no. Like now, you know, like Mojo would play Prince's I Want to Be Your Lover. And the good part is that the instrumental part towards the end, now that they play it on the radio, that's the part they take off. It's like, oh, I knew they was going to do it. We need Mojo back. You know, so. And I don't think perhaps everyone in the audience would know who Mojo is. Like, it's probably worth. explaining you know what his whole feel was it's really interesting you know he was this kind of shadowy figure you know people didn't necessarily know he was and he had this amazing voice yes amazing voice if he was in here today i will we don't know what he looks like all we know he's a short black guy and a voice that's it But Mojo was highly influential in Detroit radio and for all electronic artists and DJs. He broke a lot of tunes back in the 70s and 80s, as well as the Where's Your Butt, Mojo. Two totally different entities. Like, Mojo was everywhere. You could not name a genre that he did not play. And a lot of us loved it. I wish he was on to this day, but it is what it is. So when did you start DJing yourself after listening to the radio, you know, and obviously getting inspired by that? Well, I used to collect records before I got my first pair of turntables in 1992. You wouldn't believe how far I walked to get my turntables. And it wasn't Technique 1200. It was Gemini BD-10 belt-driven. Like, these things are so light. It's the cheapest pair. I had them, though. I was determined to get my turntables. In 1992, my mother helped me get them, and my cousin, Sean Pittman, rest in peace. They helped me get my first pair of turntables. And when I got them, my cousin, Sean Pittman, bless him. But he brought a turntable. I knew this was coming. You help me pay for the turntables, and then you want to buy it. I'm like, ah, I see what this is. So, but we used to let them borrow the turntables and stuff. And we used to practice back and forth. Like, back then there was, I don't know if you know booty music. They used to call it booty music. We used to do that, man. Man, that was fun, spinning that stuff. fast paced you know two live crew and stuff like that yeah yeah yeah two live crew MCADE and all of that stuff. We used to play that stuff, you know, like plus eight. You have to play it fast. What did your mom think of that music? Because it's quite rude. You know what's funny? When I was living with her and I would make my tracks in the basement, you know, she listening. But I would play, I don't know if you're all familiar with Glenn Underground. But I would play his music. This is Glenn Underground. Next week I'll play a different Glenn Underground. I like that. I'm like, why do you like his stuff more than mine? So, I mean, but she was glad to see that. And my father as well, you know, so. But I kind of pressured my dad to play some bass on my tracks, but that remains to be seen. So, but yeah, she's proud. So you and your cousin, he's stealing your turntables, you're learning how to DJ together. When did you first get to a point where you're playing music out for other people? St. Andrew's Hall. St. Andrews Hall would be the equivalent to Paradiso like when I first walked into Paradiso like actually my very first international gig was here in Amsterdam at Paradiso in 1998 But there's this place in Detroit called St. Andrews Hall. It looks exactly like Paradiso And that was my first gig. There was three floors. They call it three floors of fun. The first floor was alternative music. Second floor, hip-hop. Black Moon, Tribe Called Quest. Third floor was Mike Huckabee and DJ Billy Bob. So you already know what that is. But I used to play the hip-hop floor and the top floor with Mike and Billy Bob. And that was... 1995. What was the vibe like in that club? Was that a popular spot? Yes. Oh, man. Three floors of fun. You get in with the free passes, man. Man. The 90s was really fun as far as partying because it was just free-spirited, you know, young kids. you know what I mean, ravers, the rave scene, man, you know, and everybody danced. Nobody stared at the DJ. It was just dancing towards the speaker, you know. Now it's dance towards the DJ. Like, I don't know how that concept came about, but. Teacher's zone. You know, so. So at Three Floors of Fun, you're on two of the floors. Were you mixing house and hip hop at that time or would you kind of separate the two? Separate the two. So when did that become a thing where you would like mix between different styles a bit more? When I stopped giving a fuck. I stopped caring. I stopped. You know, music is music to me. You know, like I make hip hop. I make all kinds of music. So if I make it, why not play it? That's when I stopped caring about, okay, I'm just going to play hip hop all night. I'm like, no, man, just play some music, man. And a part of that was hanging around with three chairs, you know. They were like-minded. We're all like-minded individuals. So, yeah. Well, I heard one of the first times you met Theo, you went record shopping together and he saw you going to all the different areas of the shop and he was like, well, what's the deal with this kid? Well, actually, he used to work at this place called Melodies and Memories. Our friend Howard Thomas, DJ Fusion is what he called himself. But me and Howard would go in, and we would just search, just all around the store. These dudes, yeah. So we became tight after that. Like I said, I met him at... the billiard first and then i didn't know he worked at melody so i'm like oh man what's up man and we just started going everywhere man everywhere in the rock section country everywhere you know just searching for stuff you know and it's just cool we just it's cool after that man And obviously Theo is slightly older than you. Did he give you a few tips back then on like digging for records and kind of searching for stuff? Or did you have that down already? Yeah. I mean, well, he would not really tips, but he would just give us records like, man, you need this, you need that, you need that, you know, it's like, okay, sweet. You know, him and I, we think alike when it comes to music, like, I'm like, yo, yeah that and we do that to each other so yeah and when did the relationship change to you making tracks together i guess night of the sagittarius is one of the your first collaborations with theo how did it go from hey check this record out to hey why don't we make a track together oh you're making me dig deep man okay i think it's when Theo got into an accident. I went to his house. If he was okay, you know, he was cool. Usual wild Theo. And I saw that he had the SP-12. I was like, oh, man. What's up with that, man? I'm touching these. Hey, man, I got something on there, man. I was like, man, you need to let me make a track, man. I was like, man, maybe next time, you know, when I'm done with this. So I'm bugging him next week. Hey, man, what's up with the SP-12, man? Let's make some tracks So we finally made some tracks and Night of the Sagittarius was one of them. And a thing I really love about that track, it's got like a super loose feel to it. Almost feels like there's almost like happy accidents in that track. Would that be right? You know what's funny? Wow, it's funny you said that. Before it was called Night of the Sagittarius, it was called Happy Accidents. so wow that's wow i don't know why we caught a night so this said maybe it was because of me and it was it was some weird stuff going on in the studio like I was trying to make some hip-hop stuff, sneak some hip-hop in. And Theo, it was like this pool type of thing. And we made a mistake and switched one of the MIDI plugs. And the sweet beat came on. It was like, whoo! It's like, dude, record that. Record it. And we did, and we lost it. So we had to make some more stuff. Like, we made tons of stuff that would never see the light of day. You know, because we were like, eh, that one's all right. It's okay. That one's sweet. Nah, I don't like that one. You know, but, man, we got a lot of stuff. And is that something partly to do, by the way, you know, you're using drum machines and things like that and recording stuff on the fly, you know, that obviously leads to creating more volumes of stuff that you're less able to edit and things like that. Yeah. Editing, I'm not really good at editing. Theo's a better editor than I am. But what was the question? My brains are scattered. I think the original question was, you know, did Night of the Sagittarius come out in a way you didn't expect it to? But I think you answered that. Yeah, okay. So we're all good. Yeah, perhaps another track that I'd really like to talk about that I'm a massive fan of is Somebody Out There. That was another happy accident, if you will. I was making a hip, and I didn't like it. I had that certain element, the acid sounding, the bass. And that was going in the hip-hop track, and I muted everything except that part. I was like, wait a minute, man. Let me try to work something out with that. It worked out. the slow, slow out. Like, oh man. Let me do something with that. And it worked. I didn't think people was going to feel it. But Three Chairs, 2005, 2006 in Chicago, Smart Bar. Very first time playing that track. When the bass part came in, I never heard a... raw like that from a crowd ever not mean ever to this day, man, like, they were screaming so loud, you can feel it in your chest. And, like, Theo and the homie Jamie, 326, like, man, what the hell is that? It was like, I was surrounding, like, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It was like, fool, you got to give me that, give me that, give me that track. It was like, yeah. So it was like. this is what I'm coming out with on my next EP. Hence the other side, Chicago Nights. And that's the ode to Chicago for the beat tracks they used to make back in the day, like with Virgo and Vince Lawrence and all of those guys. Amazing. And Jamie also did the edit as well, I suppose. And Theo put it out as well as part of your album. So I guess that was ringing in their mind, that reaction when they reached for that. An interesting thing to me about a record like that and a couple of other tracks like something like The Mad Underdog, they've almost got like sort of a scary sort of horror kind of vibe to them. Yep, that's because me and my brothers were horror fans. We loved horror flicks. I used to love the music on there. like cheesy scary movies into the the most scariest ones like the howling like the howling scared these shit out of me when i was younger like we would look at movies like them you're like well we stand up tonight You know? Because we were, like, scared out of our minds. But, yeah, man, we were little kids, man. We looked at horror. That was our thing. Like, our mom and dad were like, yeah, we're going to take you to see Star Wars. We're like, no, we want to see Friday the 13th. What's wrong with these little boys? And, you know, and just the music, man. The music was amazing to me. Like John Carpenter's stuff. Ridiculous. What's your favorite horror movie soundtrack then? Halloween. Yeah, Halloween. What is it about it that makes it the one? Just the movie intro. Man, I love it. I love it, man. Gives me chills sometimes. Another one is... Wow. I would say Friday the 13th, but I liked Mike Myers more. Creepshow. Creepshow 1. The music in that was real good. It was kind of cheesy, like vignette type of movie. The music in there was sweet, man. So. I just want to quickly talk about your DJing. We talked already that you play a lot of different... styles and um you know saying that is one thing but doing it is a very different thing you know do you have particular techniques that can say get you from a theo parish record to a talking heads record in a few tracks you know do you have a way of going about that you particularly try and do it or do you just jam the next one in it goes both ways sometimes i i just let the music play out then go into another one like now i'm bored of just that's so boring just mixing just to mix and then go one song to the next one then mix into the one song i'm getting bored man So sometimes just let it go out. Like I do weird stuff, just slamming in, you know what I mean? Or just, like I said, let the song play out and then just go into the next one. Just all type of things, man, doing doubles and stuff, you know. Like I used to back when I was a kid. a teenager like it's all kinds of things but just like the straight mixing now is i'm really bored One thing Charisma was saying to me the other day is that he always tries to find a logical link to the next song, whether it's, you know, an example in one record speaks to another, or, you know, there's sort of like a musical story going on. Do you subscribe to that kind of idea? Yes, I love it. That's why Detroit loves Charisma. I mean, they love him. Like, every time he comes, it's a sold-out show. Because of his eclectic style of playing, you know. And I'm sort of the same way when it comes to that, but just slightly different. He's also pretty amazing on a CDJ as well. Yes. Well, he is. Yeah. I have no clue what to do. I just push play. On the CD. I'm more of a record player. I mean, no offense to any of those guys that play it. That's what they do. I don't have a problem with people who play laptop and stuff. Personally, I just like to play wax. You know, like some of my friends, you know, oh, man, you can't play no laughter. I'm like, let them do what they do, you know what I mean? You know, that's their thing. You know, me, Marcellus Pittman, likes to play vinyl. That's just me. And I recently just got into the USB stick because of some... incident that happened to me earlier this year air canada and let me say do not i repeat do not go with air canada don't do not ride with air canada ever on my way to a party in london which was actually Theo and I were supposed to play. But I had other two gigs in the UK, which was Leeds and I think Wales or something. But on my way there, they lost my records. So I had no music. I had no music. And I'm freaking out like, oh my God. And so... My friends Jamie326, Spector, and Zarnel, Theo, and my other homie John C. hooked me up with some music and sent it to me via WeTransfer. And I had to get a USB stick. I was like, uh, dang. USB stick? So, you know, I load the music on the USB stick. I have no idea where the music is. I don't know you can, what do you call it? Like put it into folders and use record box and stuff like that. Right. I had no idea, none of that stuff. So I'm playing with the USB stick. you know, playing a song and I turn around and I'm like, oh dang, I got no records. And I just keep doing that. I'm like, oh man, I keep forgetting I don't have no records. Do you ever have problems with vinyl playing in clubs? Because sometimes... The turntable's on set up, right. Yes, yes. You go to certain clubs and the turntables are full of caked up dust. It's like they don't care. The people put the beer bottles and stuff on the turntables. They don't care. The clubs, you know, they... They don't care about sound. All they care about is that bar. And, you know, I think Nicky Sayano said it the best. The only reason you have a club is because of the music, not because of the bar. If you have a club because of the bar, then you, what's the reason for a club? You might as well just own a bar without a DJ booth. You know what I mean? You can make a lot more money that way as well. Well, you can, but the club where you hire a DJ or international DJ because you want people to hear good sound. Most clubs don't have good sound nowadays. And that's a fact. You know, even clubs in Detroit. I mean, it's everywhere. It's not just overseas. It's everywhere. Just generally, how does it compare playing a gig in Detroit today compared to Europe? No comparison. It's much better over here. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I love the East Sider till I die. But it's much better over here. How so? It's just not really the kind of scene or the momentum? The momentum, people here are more into it. Y'all spoiled over here, man. Detroit right now is coming back right now, so there's a lot of clubs and stuff coming out. I did a party last Sunday. at this place called Mortar City Wine. And man, that was the most fun I've had in a long time. Like people danced. Like I haven't seen that in a long time. And like I said, they cared about the sound. You know, I was like, wow. this is dopeness, you know. But over here, it's a good sound most of the time, you know. But, yeah, here, Europe, in general, it's way better. Nice. Well, I think that's a very nice positive note to end this on. Ladies and gentlemen, Marcellus Pittman. Thank y'all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Thank you.
