Thank you. 🎵 Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Nightmares on Wax. Inspired by the sound system culture of his native Leeds, George Evelyn started out building makeshift speakers out of spare TV parts and discarded shoe boxes. With Kevin Harper, he went on to form Nightmares on Wax, a DJ duo that evolved into the production team known as the Nightmares. for eternal war pits like Aftermath, I'm For Real, and Dexterous. They eventually went their separate ways, but Evelyn went on to develop the soulful stoner electronica sound most people associate with nightmares on Wax today. More than 20 years and five albums later, It's a sound he continues to pursue, working from his home studio in Ibiza where he's lived since 2007. On a recent trip to London, Evelyn sat down with Carlos Hawthorne to try and make sense of his long and winding career. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Nightmares on Wax is up next. so Yeah, George, so thanks for agreeing to do this again. Listeners might like to know that we've already had a run through. a practice of this interview in Ibiza. I think you know your questions now. I think I might know my answers now. Yeah, the recording got messed up. So yeah, here we are, take two. What brings you to London, man? I'm here playing at XOYO tonight. Yeah, it's been some tunes, a little hook up with the label and stuff. and then I'm heading to Oslo tomorrow. So it's my first DJ shows of 2017. How's the year been so far? These last few weeks? It's been amazing because I've been on holiday. But actually, I've just been finalising the album, doing the final little tweaks on the album, which I'm looking to deliver in the next couple of weeks. So yeah, starting fruitful already. You've not been paying attention to the news much? Yeah, but I'm not really into mainstream media, so I like to do my own research, as it were, because there's a lot of noise out there. I mean, thinking about times like these, I know you're a very positive person, but kind of, you know, these are difficult times and sad times, depending on how you look at it. I mean... Does that kind of thing inspire you to make music? Yeah, but also I think it's a good time to recognise the human spirit. I've had this conversation with a few people over the last couple of weeks who disagree with me. They don't believe in the human spirit, but I'm like, how can you not believe in the human spirit? Whatever's represented on the news doesn't represent the globe. People need to wake up to that, I think. And also, I think the media plays a lot in... hijacking people's emotions, as it were. Obviously, there's a lot of shit being said and a lot of people are being singled out for ridiculous things, so there's a response to that. But the way I find positivity is that people are actually standing up and saying something now. when other administrations or other powers that would be in charge, I think we're all victims of being lazy because we think somebody's a nice guy when atrocities have been going on all along. So I think that a wild card, which I'm going to call him that. comes into our reality to wake us up a little bit, you know, whether them policies are whack or not. I just think that it's important for us to all stand up and all to be together. And it takes shit to hit the fan to do that. Yeah, I mean, I've read a lot about, you know, people say this is an important time to be creating art and that's one way to kind of combat all this stuff. You kind of go along with that. Yeah, I think I've said many times before that you can map music with social issues and social times. And some of the greatest music ever made was when some of the greatest social pressures were going down, do you know what I mean? Which is why people talk a lot about the 60s and stuff like that and the amazing music that came out then. I could say the human spirit responds to that because that's where you tap into the truth and your truth generally comes from your feelings, do you know what I mean? So when we're all cosy and we're all sat back... and everything's hunky-dory, you can create. but I don't think it resonates so much. Do you know what I mean? These days you live in Ibiza. I mean, do you find the island an inspiring place to make music? I do. I do find Ibiza inspiring to make plays but I also have recognised the need to travel to the city. It's just a different energy and, you know, I can make music at home and it's wonderful. But then when I come back to the city, whether it's in London or in Leeds or any city, for that matter of fact, and I listen to what I've been working on, I can hear exactly what he needs. Do you know what I mean? And there's definitely an element of being too blissed out when you are in a paradise like Ibiza. But, you know, it's an amazing hub to be creative and connect and do things with people or on your own. But I think that... The urban element of life is so important, do you know what I mean? Because I could be shouting from the rooftops or the mountains of Ibiza of what I'm expressing, but am I not connecting the city? They could be like, well, what's it on? Do you know what I mean? So I think the balance of both is really important. Do you have a kind of a group of musicians and Ibiza that you bounce ideas off and show your stuff to? Let me think. There's a couple of guys. Paul Powell, a guy who used to be Misha Parrish's bass player. He's a guy I've had play with me. And my neighbor, this 18-year-old kid called Marlon Lopez, he went to the same school as my daughter. He came and did some shows with us last year. I've got him in to record on the album. I think it's important to have young blood and that next generation of people around you, do you know what I mean? But then I've also like, I still connect with some of the foundations, what I would say people I've worked with over the years, a guy called Chris Dawkins, amazing guitarist from Leeds, LSK from Leeds. Do you know what I mean? I just think that these people are kind of, we just all hold something very similar. Let's just call us novelists. Let's put it that way. Your relationship with Ibiza stretches all the way back to the late 80s. It's a long time you've had a kind of, yeah, close relationship and love for the island. I mean... Why did you first go there? It was on a total whim of a friend recommending me and Boy Wonder, who I started out with Nightmares and Waxwave at the time in 88. We had a bit of cash and we were like, we want to go on holiday. So it was like first time getting a passport, first time getting on a plane. And this friend of ours said, you guys should go to Ibiza. You'd really love it. So we booked a flight. I think we had like £70 each. And we ran out of money after three days. But 88, it was the summer of 88. And that was our first experience in Ibiza. You know, no money, lots of parties, lots of San Miguel. dehydrated in the sun, walked back from amnesia, you know. Nice. And you'd visit regularly through the 90s? And then sporadically through the 90s, I did a couple of gigs there and then visited there, obviously, the holidays and stuff like that. And then this relationship started with the island and it wasn't until like, I would say, 98. I think when I could actually afford to hire a car and travelled around the island. And I'd just been two years previous to my father's homeland, which was a place called St Kitts, a really small island in the Caribbean, which I'd really loved. And when I saw Ibiza, it reminded me of it. And I was just like, wow, do you know what? This place is amazing. I was just like, and that really, I thought I'd been to Ibiza. You know what I mean? And then I just fell in love with it, or I should say weeded me and my wife fell in love with it from like, do you know what I mean? And it was kind of like, even I look back at some of the videos from back then. There's even little hints and suggestions about living there. We had no clue about living there, but just some of the vocabulary that's in some of these videos, it's just like really bizarre. And then like literally in 2005, came back from Thailand, thought I was living in a dream home in Leeds. It was amazing. I had a studio there and everything. And then we were like, what are we doing here, man? This is just bricks and mortar. This is not, you know what I mean? It's like that's not you, really. It's just things. And obviously the weather in England. I had a four-year-old daughter at the time. It was just like, do we really want to bring our kid up in England? No. Do we want to stay in England? No. Where do we live? A beefer. Should we move there? Yeah. And then 18 months later, we were gone. We'd moved. It really was that easy. And even though it's like the biggest move of my life, it was easy. I felt like I've, and I still feel like I went home. I don't feel like I left home. I feel like I went home. You said recently there was the attitude in Britain that you didn't like. You didn't want to bring up your daughter and kind of. Yeah. I just felt like when you've got a four-year-old kid, right, and you want to go out for something McDonald's and all these other places that sell dodgy food. I'm like, this is not about family. This is not about, like, at the time, it might have changed in England, I don't know, I don't really care. At the time, there was nowhere to take your kid for something to eat. There was nothing that was family-oriented. I felt the community spirit was diminishing a little bit as well. At that time, it was all about... Bosnians and this and that. There's always got to be somebody, hasn't there, to blame. It was all that. That was all the rhetoric at the time. And it was just like, you know what? Maybe there's something else. I spent 36 years of my urban life living in this country. maybe there's something else and if Ibiza doesn't work then we'll go somewhere else it'll be a stepping stone out of here but I also think in life you've got to reinvent yourself just in life it's good to challenge yourself and you know we we didn't fly we drove we left you know I mean and we were like it was so important to drive and leave and that was like it's emotional but it was a wonderful thing to do because we did it as a unit That family that left, I don't know what happened to that family because it's not the family that exists today. Yeah, you've said that. You've said the George that left Leeds is not the same George now. What are the key changes? Probably not being so aloof. Probably not having, I believe, such a massive ego. I think all the things that probably carry through yourself from being a teenager that you think and are not. Do you know what I mean? But if anything... Just stripping yourself of everything that you've kind of thought you knew and rebuilding it again. I'm not saying it was easy, do you know what I mean? But Ibiza winters teach you that because you can't get away from yourself. And I hear stories about people not being able to handle the winter because it's too quiet. But I just, you know, I love it. It's like the best kept secret for me. It's given me a lot of healing, given me a lot of growth. I'm still growing, still learning. And, you know, and it's allowed me to be able to tap into the joy of living, you know, and appreciate and have a lot more gratitude in my life. And it was important for you to still be very close to, you know, what is obviously a very thriving music scene. Yeah. I mean, but that's, people laughing when I say that, that's just a coincidence. I didn't move there for that. Honestly, do you know what I mean? So why not somewhere else in the Mediterranean or Portugal? Well, we went to mainland Spain. We went to Andalusia. We went and looked at these other places, but they were just, they had culture, but it was a singular culture. Do you know what I mean? And being well-travelled people and that, we were looking for multicultural. We were looking for... things to inspire and to thrive off. And I thought that some of these places were a little bit stagnant and they had old traditions, which were nice. but I didn't feel there was a shift and a change in some of them places. They just didn't really connect on a soul level. You know, loads of people have said it before that Ibiza is a really special place, do you know what I mean? And it's not until you live there, you know, it can be special and you go for two weeks or a week and have a life-changing experience. But when you live there and you really connect to the island... There's nowhere like it in the world. Do you know what I mean? And I've travelled all over the world, you know, to beautiful places and there's just something about the energy there, the people that I've met there. I met a woman that moved there that had never been there with two toddlers. She'd never even been there. She just went and left. And then she's been there ever since. And I'm like, that's an amazing person, man. That's strength. Do you know what I mean? And everybody you meet that lives there has got a story that's pretty incredible. Do you know what I mean? So, yeah, it's just very on an energy level and on a... People level, it is a very special place. You can be anonymous, you can be popular, you can be whatever, you can disappear. It's just a vortex of everything, really. During the summer, how much attention do you pay to the kind of club scene and what's going on in the north, in the south, sorry? Yeah, I pay attention to it. Do you know what I mean? But over the years, I've changed. Like if I go to a club, I'm going specifically to listen to somebody You know, like, obviously, you know, you go to clubs and you go to clubs and you go there and you talk a lot of nonsense and you didn't really listen to anything. You know what I mean? You're chewing the fat with somebody in a weird awesome way. Do you know what I mean? You know, but now, you know, because obviously my time is pretty precious as well because with a lot of travelling that I do and the amount of time that I'm in clubs, do you know what I mean? It's nice to know the party's down the road. Do you know what I mean? It's 10 minutes away. And that's the thing about a biefer. You could be in absolute silence or in absolute chaos within 10 minutes. I do pay attention to it. I do go out. Do you know what I mean? But like I say, I'm very, it's very sporadic the way that I do it now, you know. Of course, you're running your own parties there. You have been almost since you moved there, basically. Well, yes. I'm trying to remember now. I think this year will be our eighth season. And we're at Las Delias. We started in a restaurant called Aura in San Juan. Totally illegal. And we've built from there, really, a free party that's developed into a club night. But yeah, I mean, like, it's a labour of love. Do you know what I mean? I love doing it. It's something that's grown with Ibiza, you know, when we started the parties and stuff. And I say we, I mean, Neged, I mean, Chauvel. Wolfgang Hafner, do you know what I mean? And then all our guests as well, Daddy G and all these people. When we started, the reason why we started was in response of the lack of diversity in Ibiza. Because when I moved there, even though I'd been going there for years, I couldn't believe what wasn't there. That just baffled me, do you know what I mean? And it's changed a lot now. You know, you can't say... Unless you go to a b-fair and you just see the main headlines of things in a b-fair, you know what I mean? You probably wouldn't think it was diverse, but the diversity is there. There's so many little hidden gems and so many little things going on, little club things, you know, which is what was needed. And live music is obviously more popular than ever there, which wasn't there when I moved there. So we wanted to bring the live element into the club. So that meant DJing with a percussionist, a drummer, an MC, and let the crowd become part of the jam, which hence the name Wax the Jam. And that's how it started, really. Do you know what I mean? And then obviously Beefa Rocks kicked off, and they do amazing live shows as well. And then... More and more over the island, there's more live music and more interaction with the crowd, you know. Yeah, it's definitely totally different to anything you get in the kind of more mainstream side of the island. Very different crowd, more family vibe. You see kids running around. Yeah, I mean, I've got people saying to me it's the original Ibiza spirit because you've got somebody from the age of 16 and somebody from the age of 70 in the crowd, which when I was going to Ibiza, the clubs were the clubs were like that you did see like if you want to call them freaks but beautiful freaks that be on the dance floor and all that sort of stuff women in the 70s guys and I must admit there's not much of that now because I don't know whether the VIP tables have taken up all the dance floor space A little dig there. No, I think you've got a point. I mean, what are the, you know, over the years I've been going to Ibiza, Wax to Jam, sometimes you run it more regularly, sometimes you scale back. I mean, this summer we did three or four, was it? We did four. I mean, that was kind of sort of... pushed we were pushed in that direction because of the amount of touring i was doing and with the celebrating the 25 years of nightmares and wax and being out on the road most of the time it was just impossible to do a weekly and then that ended up being the best way to do it because now it because it's become an event that people look forward to and it means we can focus more on the night like you know doing a weekly like anybody in club world i'll tell you is is a full-time job do you know what i mean so we're kind of running with that format now um we're doing one a month uh last alias wax the beach is a spin-off from that as well which gives me the opportunity to do one off at beach parties whether that's at camaras or or wherever else on the island and stuff. Do you know what I mean? That gives me a bit more of an open opportunity. But I think we waxed the jam. At least we can let our fan base and people know that they know at least one time in the month there's going to be that event and we're going to bring something original. Yeah, thinking about Ibiza, the club scene in general, I mean, you mentioned that there are plenty of alternatives. I know Mark Barrett... doing something you've got pikes it's always doing interesting stuff pikes is great man yeah um yeah i mean i hope that just grows and grows you know i mean that while one side of the island goes in a very in its own direction you know space is now highly b-sized and it's going to be doing its own thing it means that you know the rest of the island can maybe push in the other direction and open more things up and yeah i mean i i see it this way i mean like people do complain about how the commercial direction that the clubbing world's going in. But it's the same as music. Yeah, to me, I'm like, well, as long as you've got that happening, let's say there's the whole EDM boom thing and that idea of that taking over everywhere, which not really, but you're always going to have an underground. And that's what we're about, aren't we, at the end of the day? Do you know what I mean? So as long as that shit's happening, that's all good, I think. Do you know what I mean? Because maybe somebody will go to one of them nights or maybe somebody will listen to that type of music and never even thought about venturing into the other world. It's a doorway, isn't it, at the end of the day? for the people that are not so, I don't mean it disrespectfully, but are not so clued up. Do you know what I mean? There's got to be a doorway somewhere. Do you know what I mean? So I'm not against any of that shit. Do you know what I mean? I just think that it's too easy to complain. Do you know what I mean? If you don't like something, do something about it. Do you know what I mean? Put your own night on or do something. or make your own record if you don't let your ear in. Do you know what I mean? So it's like, do something about it. Sure, I guess the problem with Ibiza is things like putting on your own parties, that kind of stuff. It's harder than it is elsewhere. There is a monopoly from these clubs. There is behind-the-scenes politics. And the grand scale thing. But to me as well, it just means you've got to be more creative and you've got to try and find them You know, people come into Las Dalias, yeah? And they're like, pretty respected people in the club world come to Las Dalias, come to our night, and they're like, I've never heard of this place. And I'm like, well, you're in the oldest nightclub in Ibiza. This is the first ever nightclub that was built in Ibiza. And you've come in and played in here. You've been coming to Bifa for how long and you've never heard of it? That's great. At least it can open people's eyes to this is the foundation to the actual club world that exists at the Bifa today. This is where it started. Do you know what I mean? And we love the fact that we're there because, like we said, the spirit of the Bifa is in this building and in the people. Do you know what I mean? you know, you can focus on the south of the island and focus on the four major clubs or whatever, do you know what I mean? And think you've been to Ibiza, but Ibiza's got so much more to offer. Do you think there is a kind of fight back from the authorities and from the locals who are maybe a bit sick of... I mean, the different agendamentos have different views, do you know what I mean? But I mean, like... I keep hearing things about them not liking tourists. I'm just like, how ridiculous is that? That's like saying, I'm really hungry. I don't like the person that's feeding me. Just, you know what I mean? But I don't know. Ibiza's a funny place. It's a difficult one. Sometimes it goes completely on the left side of being free. and then it makes a decision and it completely suffocates everything that you've just created. Do you know what I mean? It's like, it's a bit, I don't know, because some of the decisions are so wild, like, you know what I mean? It's like one minute they're behind it and the next minute they're against it. It's just like, you know, it happens with the beach bars and everybody, you know what I mean? It's like telling people that they have to put plastic sun It's like, what? So you don't want a really nice one. You want a really plastic one. What's the sense in that? Do you know what I mean? And that's, it's hard to understand that mentality. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, definitely. So obviously you can tell from your accent that you're not from Ibiza originally. You were born in Leeds. Slightly Yorkshire, if you think. Yorkshire, but you're senior. When I visited Ibiza to do the interview around we did it in your beautiful studio um looking out over the hills um what was the first place that you made music i mean it's a bit of a trick question actually because the first thing that actually did in a studio was a mega mix right people know what mega mixes are Sounds funny saying it. Basically, we got like a, me and Kevin, Boy Wonder, we started out with, we got like a government grant, which give us a day in a studio. So we basically did this mega mix on a reel-to-reel, a studio called Whole Place in Leeds. And it was like a 12-minute mix we did of all this compilation of tracks. And then we went to Huddersfield and had it cut on an acetate in Huddersfield. That was the first recording, but it wasn't really our music, if you know what I mean. It was a mega mix. I mean, tell us about the leads that you grew up in. Well, I'm from like... It's funny saying it. I'm from Burley in Leeds, Burley Road, but people class it as Hyde Park now. I don't know why, but I don't know why. But so I sound from Hyde Park as well. So basically in my neighborhood was sound systems, reggae sound systems. Was it a predominantly black neighbourhood? No, totally mixed. Totally mixed. Lots of Irish, lots of Asian, lots of West Indian. Do you know what I mean? Obviously English, Scottish, do you know what I mean? But it was like that actual neighbourhood was really mixed and then we were... We had the influence of the university as well because that's in our neighbourhood as well, so a lot of students. So it's a very vibrant area, especially being a teenager and gate-crashing student parties and good stuff like that. But basically, me growing up was basically, there was a youth club called Bellevue Youth Club, which there was a juniors and a senior youth club. But in the senior youth club was the reggae sound systems. So I was too young to go in there. So I used to sit outside and listen to the windows rattling, listen to the bass rattling. But a really close friend of mine, his brother was the head of one of these sound systems called Messiah. And the basement where they used to build speaker boxes was across the street from our school playground. So when school finished, I used to go to that basement and watch them build speaker boxes and that was my introduction, unbeknown to me, into the whole sound system world and just being fascinated with speakers and bass and shit like that. Was that where you kind of pinpoint your earliest love of music coming from or was it earlier than that? Probably earlier than that because my dad had two gramophones. One in the kitchen and one in the lounge that we weren't allowed to touch but we did touch when he went out. I broke the stylus on one of them and tried to replace it with a safety pin. How did that go down? With a belt, basically. I even laugh at it now when I think about it. I tried to replace the stylus with a safety pin. So I was creative, right, from an early age. A creative blagger. But yeah, so my dad had... I had 45s and stuff. And, you know, my dad was really, my dad was into a lot of jive and swing and stuff like that. Obviously, reggae was in the house. And, you know, through my sister, who was a disco dancer, who used to win competitions and bring vinyl home. She'd win a 12-inch if you won a dancing competition or a tape. You know, so I was influenced from that. And my brother used to bring these. tapes from this other guy in the neighborhood and stuff so i used to sneak and listen to that on his go blaster when he was out so it was around me you know but i would say that the sound system part of my my friend close friend dennis at the time and just that was that's really actually in my mind because there was a reggae album by a producer called scientist a dub album that came out and all his artwork is cartoon covers So being a kid, you're attracted to the cartoon covers or green sleeve records. You were attracted to the sleeve on that because we used to sit there and go, that's me, no, and that's me. And, you know, bags that to be me and all that kind of thing. The affiliation was there with the cartoons, but then the records, the affiliation. So then I started collecting, and that was when I was like nine, ten years old. And I didn't realise at the time that that was the first producer I'd even become a fan of or even was collecting an actual artist. But I didn't realise that at the time. You know what I mean? I was just doing it sort of thing. Did you ever get involved in, so you were like, you were building the sound systems as well? You were helping out? Yeah, well, basically where we lived, there was a warehouse where they used to repair TVs. There used to be a TV company called DER. All the other kids, we all used to go there in the skip. They used to throw all the old TVs away and the valves that were in the back of the TV, we used and throw them at a wall because they used to explode. So all the kids were doing that. And then I was like, there's speakers in the back of these, there's speakers in these TVs. So I was just like, right. So I started taking the speakers out and getting a shoe box and making speaker boxes out of shoe boxes with these TV speakers. So I'd have like, let's say like eight speakers wired up to one Fidelity turntable or wired up in my room. And that was my sound system. And I called that sound system Echo 45. That was the start. Nice. So how old were you when you first got into breakdancing? 12. 12 years old, so I think that's right. Was that your sister's influence? No. To be honest, I'd heard Rapper's Delight and stuff and that, but it was still disco sort of thing. And then I was body popping a little bit because of Jeffrey Daniels from Chalamet. But then it was that Thursday in, I'm sure it's 82, and Buffalo Gals, the video, came on on top of the Pops. That changed my life. That was it. Literally, the next day in the playground, you got turned up at school and there were circles, and it was like, this is it. And that was it. I was full into it. It was just like, my life changed totally from that video, from that song. It's amazing, there's quite a few of those top of the pops moments. There's the famous David Bowie one. Everyone sees and they're like, that changed my life. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It shows how important it was back in the day. But as well, they got a video where you got graffiti, not seen really that. You've got the dancing, do you know what I mean? You've got scratching. It's like, it was all there. It was just like, wow, somebody did that with a turntable. It was just like, do you know what I mean? So just like, it was just, Yeah, you know what I mean? Yeah, changed my life. So, I mean, what were the next steps? How long till you joined the Solar City Rockers? Probably about 83, because I was still with some of their school friends at the time in Leeds, and then we all fell out over a speaker. Basically, they had a Jumbo sale at school and there was this speaker, like one speaker was there. It was like a 12-inch speaker or whatever. And I went home and I begged my mum, begged her, begged her, begged her, begged her for five pounds to buy this speaker. Like, you would not believe, I begged her. And then I got the speaker. And this was like a big step up from a TV speaker. And like, obviously everybody wanted a piece of the speaker because we were in a sound system together, but it needed like repairing or fixing. And I was like, they wanted, these guys, part of my crew wanted to take the speaker out. And I was just like, no, you can't take the speaker out, man. It needs, it needs like sort of servicing. That night I went to Tiffany's where we used to go breakdancing on a Monday and stuff. And the next day I came back and none of them would speak to me. Basically, my crew fell out with me. Who I thought was my crew, over the speaker. And it was quite a tough time at school for me then. It was just like, wow, these people I've been with since primary school are now just being shit, really. Do you know what I mean? A bit of bullying and all that kind of And I was like, the person was like, as we used to say back in the day, the person I was tight with was the cock of the school. Do you know what I mean? So everybody did what this guy said. Do you know what I mean? So it was just like, it's quite a traumatic time for me. But at the same time, it... took me in a different direction do you know what I mean I still had some friends at school but then like my sister was aware of like what I was going through and her boyfriend's cousin was a breakdancer who lived in Bradford and she was just like this guy wants to know if you want to come and join his crew so I was just like so it was for your sister yeah that was true gotta give a props then sorry And then basically I met this guy, Darren Pascoe, and he asked me if I wanted to come and join his crew. And basically I went over to Bradford and we had to chip in 50 pence each to rent a badminton court. And that's what you used to get, like two hours to break, something like that. And that was every, let me get this right, every Tuesday and Thursday. And then you go battle on a Saturday outside shopping centres and stuff. A full crew of us walking down with a roller liner ready to take anybody on. So you'd battle just, you'd go to someone's city and just battle one other crew. Well, basically, we would do battles in Leeds, battles in Bradford, but then there was like the West Yorkshire Breakdancing Championships that happened in a venue called Queen's Hall. It doesn't exist anymore. And at the time, we were sponsored. We had a manager, a guy called Jerome, and we were sponsored by a hair salon called Moda Pelle. But the tracksuits that we had... We're like these bad boy grey and like red tracksuits. We're like these red pleats out the back of them. And then we had like a guy called Jason had graffitied this like canvas suitcase that said Soul City Rockers on it. So when we turned up to battle, we just dropped this suitcase at the middle of the dance floor and everybody stepped back. we did our shit and we won the competition. I still got the shield at home. The West Yorkshire Breakdancing Championships 1983. What were you breaking to? What was I breaking to? I was breaking to Al Nafish, Planet Rock, African Bombard, Soul Sonic Force, Clear by Cybertron. Wanakis what else obviously Herbie Hancock Rocket Imperial Brothers a lot of things on cutting records it was electro really you know I mean like we had things like hip hop on wax volume one two and three which were like mega mixes but on vinyl That's going to be my keyword now. And basically, and, you know, breakdance electric boogie, you know, all these instrumental break bass tracks, and then also these electro. tracks that obviously now people look at as like early electro house and all that kind of shit. But yeah, all pretty high energy stuff really. It was mostly off boomboxes, it wasn't DJs at the events? Well, a bit of both. In the clubs, obviously DJs. Do you know what I mean? But yeah, boomboxes, ghetto blasters as we called them back in the days. Sounds like there was a really healthy climate of competition. Well, the thing is, is that that transition from being into reggae sound systems into... the whole hip hop world was so similar because everything was about being bigger and better in reggae sound system. It's all about bravado. And this is the thing as well. He's like, this is why, why I love hip hop. Do you know what I mean? The actual true foundations of it is the bravado was about fantasizing about being adventurous. Do you know what I mean? And. Them fantasies can take you anywhere. You could brag about anything and whatever. You weren't actually it. And everybody knew you weren't. Do you know what I mean? But being braggadocious and having bravado was all about that. All right, there might have been young ego there, but it wasn't in any other way tainted. Do you know what I mean? It was all for fun. Did you look to New York as this kind of... Haven of this place. Yeah, New York was totally like the Bethlehem of hip hop sort of thing. Do you know what I mean? Especially the Bronx, do you know what I mean? So, and the dream of going there and this, and I used to listen to, the pirate radio that I used to listen to was Radio Caroline, which was out on a ship in the North Sea or whatever, because they would play like three. tracks maybe and you'd try to find out what they were and same with John Peel you used to listen to like two hours of John Peel waiting for him to just play something from New York you know and then you'd go on a mission to try and find it do you know what I mean so because there wasn't a there wasn't a platform for it do you know what I mean and it wasn't until like probably 85 85, 86 then, the more, obviously they had pirate radios in London and stuff like that, do you know what I mean? But there wasn't really still an outlet for it, do you know what I mean? Because it's so new, you know? Going back to the competitions for a second, I mean, did this kind of intense competitive atmosphere, did it ever spill over into, were there ever fights, was there ever anything like that? Do you know what? No. Amazingly, no. You always got an idiot, do you know what I mean? But realistically, it was just like... Was that respect? You know what? I don't think we were even conscious enough to think like that. I think we were just in love with this thing that was happening. Do you know what I mean? And you were just being swept by this wave. And everybody... I mean, the one thing that I look back on, like, if I get... If I get drunk now and I end up breakdancing, then I realise how fit I used to be. Because I get up and I'm like... Like that, do you know what I mean? But I'm like, I've never been in the gyms and all that sort of stuff. Or even like, you know, when I was younger, I wasn't crazy about being fit. But I look back and I'm like, oh my God, I was super fit, but I never thought about it like that because the love overpowered everything. Do you know what I mean? Like breaking was just, and hip hop was just everything. Do you know what I mean? Like Do you know what I mean? So many tools to express yourself. And like, because I was already fascinated with electronics and all that sort of stuff from sound system. And then all of a sudden I'm like recording snippets of tracks on a cassette. Like a few seconds of that track, a few seconds of that track, a bit of dialogue from that soundtrack. Do you know what I mean? I was sampling, but I didn't know I was sampling. But that's what I was doing. It was like push button sampling with a cassette deck, you know? So it gave me all these outlets to express myself. And then obviously emceeing. And I was never really a graffiti, I can't draw. I was never a graffiti artist. It wasn't really my thing. I tried, I tried. I took some spray cans out of my dad's garage and sprayed my bedroom wall. And I got beat for that. I'm above my bed. Yeah, you mentioned emceeing, DJing, breakdancing, you know, later, a couple of years later, you'd be producing. I mean, was it normal for kind of everyone to be doing everything? None of it was normal. Like I say, it was literally like... A wave of something just came in and swept everybody up and those that kind of stuck to went along for the ride. Do you know what I mean? I meet people now, like, and they have the same stories as me, whether it's DJ Shadow, do you know what I mean? People like that. And we've all got the same story. Do you know what I mean? It's just like, it's funny. It's just like, wow, there's other people in different parts of the world having the same, like right break dancing is my thing i'm gonna put all my energy into that you're also doing the sampling and the dj and everything you just wanted a bit of it all yeah well i think as well out of it you're trying to carve out what is your what's your power move do you know what i mean because that's what it's like in breaking i was like head spins was my shit everybody knew my head spins with my shit but you don't know that until you actually try it everything do you mean i popped a little bit but i wasn't a great body popper but you don't know and then and then whether you try a bit of mc you try a bit of djing and be trying a bit of scratching along the way you're carving your craft you're not aware of that but like a charlie monk Looking back on all your breakdancing experiences, are there any that really stick out? Yeah, I got one that was, I mentioned earlier, Bellevue Centre. And there was a guy called Marvin Flowers who was an amazing dancer. And he actually ended up being in an advert for a local denim shop. And we were all really... jealous because he was body popping on an advert anyway there was a breakdance competition in my local youth club and I was battling against Marvin and he got up and he did this he did this move into this head spin and he spun like forever and I was with my homeboy T at the time and And I was just like, I can't beat that, man. And the team was like, come on, George, you can do it, you can do it. And I was just like, I can't beat it. It was so like, I was like, and it's like, come on, you can do it, man, you can do it, man. And literally, you've got everybody, your whole community there. Do you know what I mean? And you've got to go up after these guys, just I could just hear everybody screaming. That's what I read. Do you know what I mean? And then, like, eventually it stopped spinning. Do you know what I mean? And everybody was going crazy. And I did, like, probably the best head spin I've ever done in my life. And I'll never forget that moment because it was just... like I was so scared but I went into the fear you know so at some point you kind of start to grow out of breakdancing I've never grown out of it yeah no basically what happened then was because obviously No, that's it, obviously. At the time when the whole breakdancing thing was happening, there was these monthly events that were happening up in the north. Actually, all over the country, they're called all-dayers, which basically, you know, some promoter would hire a mecca club, like a glitzy club, on a Sunday afternoon. The thing is as well, what I need to bring to light as well is that... You know, like the music that we were listening to is specialist music at the end of the day, whether it was dance music, urban music, disco, funk, whatever it was, it still wasn't in the general nightclubs. And to get in them nightclubs and play music was so difficult, man. Do you know what I mean? So this guy had found a way of like, well, you're closed on a Sunday. So can we have Sunday afternoon, 12 to 12? bring DJs up from all over the country. Do you know what I mean? You know, pretty like relevant DJs at the time and stuff like that. So all the breakers would go there as well. Do you know what I mean? So you'd have a room that would be like... It'd be jazz fusion and then you'd have a room that'd be rare soul and then you'd have the main room and in that main room you would have hip-hop, disco, funk, early pieces of garage like Chicago House and stuff like that. I saw Adonis, I saw the whole Trax family perform at Rock City. I saw all that shit. Do you know what I mean? That shit was like something else, you know, Master C&J and all these like... Lisa, Liz Torres, all these guys that were all like on these original house labels all came to these all days. So we used to go to these, cause this was the only outlet at the time to be able to go and like break in an actual club way that the music, like you were good when you were going to these night, these, these all days, you knew you were going to hear shit you'd never heard before. Imagine that feeling like you're going to hear something you'd never heard before. Do you know what I mean? And there were one a month somewhere in the country. One month it might be in Manchester, one month it might be in Bedford, one month it might be in Doncaster, one month it might be in Leeds. Literally, they moved all over. So we'd go down on a coach. Coaches would go down, man. And most people on them coaches were all dancers. Not just breakdancers, you know? Yeah, I mean, not just tracks that you've never heard before, but whole genres of music, like styles. Yeah, literally. Do you know what I mean? Like, literally, you'd be like... And everybody would take whistles and foghorns with them and stuff like that. And, you know, like, we didn't drink, man. We didn't drink or anything. We just peel our music and dance. That was it. Was that what kind of opened your eyes to the whole DJ thing? Yeah, well, again, it comes back. I could bring the sound system thing back around because a DJ would represent a crew. Do you know what I mean? So whether it was a DJ from Bedford or a DJ from London. that DJ would have a crew connected to them, do you know what I mean? So that just related, do you know what I mean? So which born out of our break crew was Unique 3. And then obviously I was kind of with that for a little while. And then I met this guy through a friend of mine, a fellow breaker. I met this guy, John Hanlon, who had two turntables. And he was the first person I'd ever met that had two turntables. And he had a reel-to-reel and he had a double cassette recorder. And he was already doing these little mixes, mega mixes. Basically, we basically connected both our record collections together. He was more from like an indie rock, Leeds golf background and stuff. He had a few, you know, bits, but he also liked hip hop and electro and stuff. And then I combined my funk, soul, hip hop and reggae connections and stuff like that. And we started doing mixes together, these mega mixes and stuff. And we did this one particular mix and John turned around and says, oh, it sounds like a fucking nightmare. And I went, yeah, on wax. And then he was like, maybe we should call ourselves that. And then I was just like, yeah, maybe we should. And then he was like, it sounds a bit negative though. And I was like, no, it's to turn out our wildest dreams on vinyl. and that's how Nightmares of Wax, the name was born. And I basically did these mixtapes with John for about 18 months. And then John kind of, it's really weird. Something happened and he disappeared and we never saw each other again. And then Kevin, we're going through some stuff in Bradford. He wasn't really in Unique 3 anymore. And then I was like, do you want to come over to Leeds and let's do Nightmares of Wax together, man. Let's do And when we started doing mixes together and stuff like that, and that's how Nightmares and Wax as an actual crew started. Do you know what I mean? And that was like, I think that was like 80, 85. Were these kind of mixes and bringing in all these different sounds from goth to funk to soul, whatever, was that your way of staying ahead of everyone else? Well, I mean, like even... It was funny at them times, we were like, you'd hear a record and you'd hear somebody scratch one, two, three, four on the record. And you're like, who's that? And you find out it's James Brown. So then you start buying James Brown records. Do you know what I mean? So we used to look for cuts. We didn't look for breaks because we didn't know about breaks then. We looked for cuts. So me and Kevin used to dig for cuts and then out of the cuts, we discovered the breaks. Do you know what I mean? And we were on that tip when we were 15. Nobody else were on that shit. Do you know what I mean? So then we started going record fairs and flea markets and shit like that and digging for records like that before anybody else was doing that shit I say anybody, but from a UK point of view, do you know what I mean? Or up north anyway. That's how my record collection started to grow because I started to discover Curtis Mayfield, Kool and the Gang, but the old shit. Do you know what I mean? And then I started to find out that these were foundations of hip hop. These were where these breaks were coming from. Do you know what I mean? And that was it then. I was already on the verge of being a vinyl junkie anyway But this was just like every Thursday Leeds market straight down there. I didn't even know how much anything was. I just dig for stuff. But now I look back at the things I paid 50 pence for, man. Wow. But eShops was springing up all over, you know, Manchester, Sheffield. Yeah, well, we used to go, because we started DJing in a club in Leeds when we were 16. Like, there was only one alternative club in Leeds, and that was The Warehouse. And then there was a student night. the phonographic and then there was another student night called Downbeat and me and Kevin had been invited to come and like play there. We got a 20 minute set so we got 10 minutes each to share and we smashed it in 20 minutes and the guy asked us to fill in for him, a guy called Rob Wheeler and then we filled in for him and then anyway he ended up moving down to Brighton and we ended up being co-owners of the club night. By the age of 17, we were running our own club night in Leeds, which was totally, totally unnerved of, especially being, you know, two young urban kids in town. There was only one black DJ in town, and that was a guy called Roy at the Warehouse, who's legendary. And there was a guy who did some other commercial stuff, but, you know, everything else. was your typical rich DJ. Do you know what I mean? At them times, they were no... Unless you went into the hood and you went to do a blues or an after hours, but actually in town. So here we are, two 17-year-old kids, man, doing a club night, a student night, which was rammed every week. Do you know what I mean? So we were getting paid. All of a sudden, we were getting paid for what we... what we loved do you know what i mean so what did we do every monday pick up his wages go straight to manchester and spend it all on records and we used to go to these places where everybody were getting at that time everybody was selling all their disco everybody was selling all their funk everybody was getting rid of it all we were buying it all like by the bucket load man do you know i mean and then you go to like vertwin virgin had record stores and stuff like that and they were selling loads of shit like And we just cleaned up, basically. You know, you're painting a picture of a young man who's just totally obsessed with music. You know, back then, electronic music wasn't a viable career, it didn't exist. Like, you know, it was an option, basically, in the way that it is now, anyway. What did your family think about it all? Get a proper job. You could do that stuff, but get a proper job. That was my whole dad's thing and like my brother as well. I used to pretend to go out for interviews. I used to dress up and that and pretend to go for an interview because I had to. I wasn't allowed to stay in the house. I mean, at that time, you know, I was living with my brother and that. I'd like, my mum and dad split up when I was 13. My mum went through a rough patch. I went to live with my brother. That didn't really work out, so I ended up being homeless. I ended up living in a hostel for nearly two years, which was probably the best two years of my life because... I took over this hostel and started running legal parties in this hostel. So it all worked out in some way. Do you know what I mean? So, but I had to literally, I literally learned to like look after myself very young. Do you know what I mean? And yeah, I remember cooking my first meal for myself, not being at home and shit like that. Do you know what I mean? and a tin of Irish stew and some boiled rice and some hot pepper sauce on top. Yes, I mean, as well as being a kind of, you were, you know, engaged in an alternative scene and a very underground scene that not many people knew about, you're also kind of being subversive at home. You know, you were, like, sneaking out and doing these things. Yeah, well, I wasn't sneaking out. It was just, like, nobody got it, nobody understood. But why would they? Because it was still, like, we're experiencing this wave of, like... this just this wave I can only describe it as a magical wave happening why why it's not everywhere do you know what I mean but it is as a kid why as an adult or why is anybody older than you're going to even get where you're coming from do you know what I mean and first of all, you look like you're dismantling a turntable. You know what I mean? It's like, what are you doing? Are you making these weird noises? Do you know what I mean? It's like, why isn't everybody going to get that? And also, you know, my dad worked in a factory. You know what I mean? And my mum was an accountant at a bingo hall. You know what I mean? It's just like, they know work. Do you know what I mean you know you need when you're going to get a job basically and he was like that right up until a year before he died do you mean but he came and saw us in concert the full live show and shit which was good so nice oh what so it wasn't just a case of you starting to earn money and then being like okay this is obviously a thing now no it just didn't get that just culturally didn't just didn't get it do you know i mean because work is work If you're not getting your hands dirty, you're not really working. Do you know what I mean? Which I get, you know what I mean? We are very blessed to even do something you love and get paid for it, do you know what I mean? But I can't say there was ever a moment that I thought about career at all because it was just like the love was so much and the music was just too important. Do you know what I mean? And the thing is, you couldn't stand still. Do you know what I mean? Because you always wanted to get the latest shit. Do you know what I mean? You needed to make sure you had the latest shit. And then what did you do when you had the latest shit? You soaked records in a bath and peeled the labels off so Nova Cruz could see what you were playing. I mean, how crazy is that? So at some point you and... Boy Wonder, Kevin Harper get in the studio and you make some of the most timeless dance music records ever made. Records that have influenced countless producers, countless techno producers, dubstep producers, everything. Still Play Today, Dexterous Aftermath, Case of Funk. Listening to those records, what memories does it bring back? Just magical moments, man. I mean, like, because Kevin lived in the hostel with me as well. We got our place together. I remember buying a knocked off four track cassette recorder and a knocked off Roland SH-101 keyboard, begging my mum to lend me some money again to buy a Casio SK-1 keyboard. I mean, Kevin just started messing about and then Kevin came up with this bass line. You know, I was always a sample man anyway. I come from the hip-hop, a bit more hip-hop sort of background, so I came with the sample snares and stuff like that. And I remember us just making these demos. We made about three demos. We were like, should we play these down at the club? We should try them out. And it's like, yeah, man, let's play them. Do you know what I mean? So the first thing we did was a track called Let It Roll first white label that we released and we played this track Downbeat and I remember me and Kevin literally hiding behind the DJ booth because he was going off do you know I mean and it was going off in such a way that we were like we had excitement joy fear we had all these mad emotions because I just had a feeling I never ever had before or we had a feeling we never had before And we couldn't stop laughing. Do you know what I mean? Because we must have rewound it about 10 times. But we couldn't stop laughing because it was literally going off. And then we were like, shit, man, we should get a record deal. We should try to get a record deal. And we were dropping this, like, so it was like dropping, it was like dropping the dub plate, like, but on cassette. You know what I mean? Everybody wanted to know what the fuck is that tune? Do you know what I mean? And we were like, sus, do you know what I mean? And then we had, like, rival crews used to come to our night. They hated us, but they always came to our night, right? And then we was in a kebab shop, actually. at the end of the night, one of these guys from the Shriver crew came up to Kevin while we were stood in this kebab shop, and he goes, that's not your fucking tune. You guys are lying, man. That's not your fucking tune. And me and Kevin just stood there smiling. Do you know what I mean? This guy was being all aggressive up in Kevin's face and then left. But it was like the biggest compliment. unbeknown to him that he could have given us and we were just like this dude's the shit innit we need to so we wrote to everybody sent the cassette off to everybody and everybody said we even went took a trip to America and everything and that was a record buying trip we went to some labels profiles select records and a few others and everybody said no and I was like you know what I think we need to put this out ourselves So I borrowed 400 pounds off my brother. There's a lot of borrowing going on in this conversation. Borrowed 400 pounds off my brother, pressed up 2,000 copies. I've got to say as well, just even trying to get something pressed, back then I didn't have a clue. Do you know what I mean? So I got in touch with this pressing plant called Making Records. It was in London. And they were like, so you're going to master it? You're going to master this? You need to master it? I'm like, what's that? I didn't even know what mastering was. They're like, right, we'll book you into a studio and you can master when you come down and you can deliver. And it's a cassette. It's a cassette. That's all I've got. So I can only afford for one of us to come to London. So I came to London. They booked me into the studio and I was like 18 years old, totally clueless. And it was Abbey Road Studios that we mastered the first releasing. I didn't even know what Abbey Road Studios was. Do you know what I mean? I then found that out afterwards. And the engineer, I just kept saying to the engineer, more bass, more bass. And now you just probably thought, who's this little jumped up shit? He doesn't know what he's on about sort of thing. basically mastered it there and then we released it in July 1989 July the 16th 1989 I hired a car didn't have a driving license used my friend's driving license I literally drove to a record store in England and sold them all in two weeks. Within the first week, it was mad. I'd turn up at the store and the man in the van who used to bring the vinyl around would be like, have you got that tune? I'd be like, yeah. Every time I'd be at a particular record store, they'd just be the right people in there. Do you know what I mean? To be like, when I came to London, it was Red Records and it was Trevor Anderson It was Trevor Nelson who was serving me. Do you know what I mean? And then Paul Anderson comes in and then Dave Durrell comes in. And do you know what I mean? It just ended up being the right people there when they're there. And it just kind of went crazy from then. And all these illegal raves are happening as well and stuff like that. So you go to the raves and there's 10,000 people and your tune's being dropped and shit. And we were just like... And then it goes in Sheffield called Fun Records and the guy working behind the counter, Steve Beckett, was like, "Oh, we've been hearing this tune down at occasions, "a club night in Sheffield." We're thinking about setting up a label. We should exchange numbers, which we did. Anyway, that was Steve Beckett from Warp Records, and they were about to release a track with no name by Fortune Masters, the first Warp release. And he rang me up three months later and just said, would you want to remix that Dexterous? And we was like, yeah, yeah, all right then, which we did, and that got released in December 89. and went into the top 40, which was just like, no, sorry, it didn't. It went to top 75 as a 12-inch, which apparently had not happened before with a 12-inch record. And that was the start of a one single deal, which became a three single deal with Warp. So we were like the second signing on Warp. You know, those records, they sound so futuristic still. You know, I imagine there wasn't that much consideration going into those sessions. You just were me. in music but did you want to make something new did you want to make something that you hadn't heard before yeah but we also knew what we were influenced by we were influenced by you know the detroit that was happening it was influenced by electro that we've been obviously been breaking to guy called gerald was from a crew like remember gaga gerald was a was a breaker and popper as well from manchester we knew you know i mean and we were from across the Pennines. So somebody's dropped a tune from a crew across there. We need to drop a tune from here. It's all about that. Do you know what I mean? So, and Voodoo Ray dropped and obviously it was such a massive tune, but it was also a massive influence for us. And we actually sampled it in the actual original poverty records release of Dexterous. There's Voodoo Ray in the background. We sampled it. Do you know what I mean? We didn't, Yeah, I mean, but that was also a respect to what was happening from that side. And then there was like, obviously the Sheffield crews doing their things. So there was still a crew mentality behind the music. Bass was obviously super important. You know what I mean? I grew up around bass. It was since like, who's going to have the loudest bass and whose track's going to be? Because as well, you know, I go back to never thinking about a career. You know, the ultimate goal for us was for our tune to be played in a club or another DJ to play your tune. Nothing could top that as respect. Like nothing. That meant everything. Do you know what I mean? It wasn't like... Chat position, DJ buzz chat, none of that things. It was literally somebody played your tune in a club and it went off. You can't, that's it. That's the ultimate respect. Do you know what I mean? There's no beyond that, do you know? I guess that's the first time that you can share things in that way. Like, you know, with breakdancing, you could try someone else's move, but I guess it's still your move. Like this is, you know, someone else is literally paying you the respect of playing your music. It's your identity. Yeah. In a way, do you know what I mean? And it's just like, it was 100% experimental. We know what was important in the club and that was drum and bass. That was the important element of the club. Do you know what I mean? That's what everybody got down to was the beats and the bass, you know? You shifted 40,000 copies of Aftermath, which is a huge number for the time. The sound really blew up and then almost as quickly as it blew up, it kind of disappeared. Yeah, well, I mean, do you know, I mean, like say here you've got two young kids doing shit and then all of a sudden it's just like, do you want to make an album? It's just Do you know what I mean? Whether that's record company, whether that's publishers. I mean, all right, magazine stuff, you can document what's happening. But really, like I say, I keep saying this wave was happening and we were all just going along with it. There weren't really any dance albums. So we were doing an album. So what we're going to do, we're going to just do everything that's ever influenced us because we're making an album. We might never make an album again. So that was going to be the ultimate experiment. And me and Kevin knew what we were influenced by. Do you know what I mean? It wasn't like straight up this, that or the other. Do you know what I mean? So we were like, let's throw everything in it. But that also became a melting pot of like influences that then obviously influenced me later on and influenced Kevin later on. Do you know what I mean? It was almost like throwing everything up on a board and it looking back at you and you're going, oh, wow, well, I could, you know what I mean? I could take something from that, I could take something from that. And even like, I don't like the terminology, but like. It's like the first stages of trip-hop and all that shit's in that album. Drum and bass is in that album. And it's just like, but we never, you know, we weren't ever conscious of that. Like I said, we were just expressing. anything and everything that ever influences, which is why we called it A Word of Science, first and final chapter. It's an experiment. And then the album came and it was like, went completely over everybody's heads. Nobody got it. Do you know what I mean? Which is cool. Then we went through a funny time because then Italian House happened. I remember that. Everything started to go really like, don't get me wrong, some Italian house is good, but it was just, everything went really cheesy. Pianos. Piano. You know what I mean? It all went. like that and then where were we and all that it was kind of and that's when things I think just even on a club scene anyway started to diversify do you know what I mean everything had been in one club as far as the house music culture was concerned everything was in one club and then at that point in like 91 sort of it start to diversify you know yeah it's an interesting period that 91 to 95 because you know you make this album which is has a lot to do with the records you've just been putting out these bleep and bass records you and kevin working together and in 95 is your next album or the next nightmare is on wax album it's you on your own without kevin and it's a very different record i mean you can hear that you can definitely hear the bits in it yeah smokers delight but it's a It's a chilled, it's, you know, full smoking. It's a kind of hip hop influence, funk soul. What were you doing in those four years in between? What happened? Well, basically, we did the Kesa Funk EP. Again, that went over people's heads, but people riff about it now. And then... Is that frustrating? It's just, I kind of, that's just been the story of my career, really. People get it eventually. Yeah, it's just one of them, isn't it? I kind of, I can laugh at it. So we did that and then we did Set Me Free, which was more like how Chicago based sort of 12. And then Kevin was going through a bit of a rough patch and stuff like that. And then we kind of, we grew apart and we parted ways. But I must say as well, I'll just take it back. While we was making A Word of Science, I was making Smoker's Delight because I was going to do it as a completely separate project. Basically, I had this epiphany while on acid. I was back at a friend's house listening to KLF, the Chill Out album, as you did back then. And I was just like, you know what? I'm going to make my own chill-out album, but I'm going to do a hip-hop chill-out album, and I'm going to call it Smoker's Delight. That was it. I made that decision on a night trip he made off at a friend's house, and I'd already started rolling with it. A couple of the tracks that we're working on ended up on a word of science, which was Night's Interlude and Playtime and, you know, not Playtime, sorry, Ease, a track called Ease on there. So I was already working this in the background with the idea of doing something completely as a separate project. Then when we came in parted ways, I'd already been playing some of this to Steve and Rob when we'd been going to Southport Weekenders, listening in chalets or... after parties in Scotland, after raves and stuff, I'd already been living this album with all my friends and all the people. And then me and Kevin parted ways and Steve was like, so what are you going to do with this album, this Smoker's Delight thing like that? And I went, you know what, I want to do it. And he was like, well, why don't you just do it as Nightmares then, like that? And I was like, right, okay. Do you know what I mean? So basically went to work on completing it. Completed it in 94 and it took a year to clear all the samples and stuff. And then it was like... Warper said to me, do you want to, are you going to do this live? And I just said, yeah, without even thinking about it. And they were like, all right, great. So then I had to kind of put a band together. But also, because I was working with Robin Taylor Firth on the Set Me Free release, the keyboardist and stuff, I brought Robin into the fray into doing Smoker's Delight as well. So it was like... I was getting more musicians involved. I've got a bass player called Hamlet Luton from Leeds. He came in on that. And then Chris Dawkins, the guitarist, came in. You know, so I was opening it up from a production point of view. But, you know, like, that album was so dear to me and my friends. We lived that album before. like five years before anybody had heard it kind of thing, you know what I mean? So all the titles are all connected to stories and different places and stuff like that. So it was a really personal album. The most shrewdest thing I've ever done in my life because I just acted upon an idea, you know what I mean, that I wanted to see through, do you know what I mean? Literally, we released the album, WAP thought it was going to sell 4,000 copies. And literally six months later, when we took the live show on the road, it just kind of went ballistic. And again... Totally clueless and oblivious to what was really going on. Do you know what I mean? And just went along with the wave. Was Kevin okay with you keeping the name? Yeah, because I'd been Nightmares & Wax prior to that and I'd invited him in to be Nightmares & Wax as well. So that made me and Kevin are super tight now. Do you know what I mean? So, you know, but yeah, I mean, Kevin's my biggest fan. But yeah, it was an interesting because I think Nightmares and Wax was a little bit lost as well. I don't think we knew where our place was in the club. My burning desire was there to do this. I mean, we always had hip-hop influence in our house tracks, but I definitely wanted to go more deeper into my hip-hop roots. Yeah, it's clear that's come through because you could have started putting out House and Techno 12 Inches and gone a completely different path. I still love club music and I still did at the time, but it just was going off in so many different places. I don't think you should ever follow. I think it would have been a mistake to follow. Do you know what I mean? And I was not, we'd never followed before. It was like follow this long road, if you want to call it. It's been the most beneficial and fruitful. for as far as my heart and my soul is concerned in music. You touched on Warp there and I think it's interesting that they released your record, you know what I mean? I was looking just on Discogs now, the records released around it, B12, Apex Twin, Richard H. Kirk, Orteca, Electroids, like IDM, some quite gnarly stuff there, difficult, you know, and then your record is just like nestled in amongst it, which is like, again, their part but an interesting move on their part they could be like no we're doing this thing this isn't for us take it somewhere else like why do you think they were so behind it i think because they've always believed in my music you know obviously we're friends and we're close and stuff but the reason why warp is so successful is because it's like what they're here and what they're attracted to they allow it to be they don't go in there and try to change it do you know what i mean and And, you know, I get in the industry, you have visionaries and they go, you could be the next this or you could do, they don't do that. They see what's there and they allow it to flower. And that's been my experience. And I think that that's been the actual main ingredient to their success is that if you look at all the artists that they've signed, they all flourish in their own way. Do you know what I mean? And that's because they're not tampered with as such There's never a pressure to put a record out. Do you know what I mean? And I don't think there ever should be. Creativity is not something that you just flick a switch and order it like a pizza. Do you know what I mean? It's like, it's something that needs to come naturally and when it comes naturally and you have the space and time to express it, then you're going to get good quality shit. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. I mean, it probably also helped they had artists of music at that time yeah there's some people that can deliver like diarrhea man and it's good shit yeah was there was there like a like a family feel among those artists did you guys ever hang out I would say in the early days because again we were all you didn't have a clue in the early days. So we were all doing a lot of, because we, you know, obviously a lot of interest from the world, basically Japan, everywhere. So a lot of times you'd have to come down to London and you'd do like full on like press days with everybody when WAP was in Sheffield even, you know, like. You might have Japanese journalists coming over to spend a whole day with Warp so they want all the artists there and that's how we kind of connected. But we also connected doing gigs and stuff like that. I can't say it's like that now because the label's so vast that there's so many artists on it and we all live in different parts of the world. Are you still in touch with AFX or Ortec or any of those guys? No, we're kind of like passing ships in the night. Yeah, I people always say, oh, quantity, not quality, but they've actually done both. You know, they've got the quantity, they've also always kept the quality. When you talk about, you know, like just talking about the transition of Nightmares going into, you know, the music shifting and everything and Warp embracing that, I think the label has had to go through that itself. Do you know what I mean? You think about it, it's an incredible story with what started out to be known as a techno label. is now just a great music label. How do you actually, don't ignore your past and don't neglect what's built you, but also embrace the new and come across in a way where you can deliver. like amazing music, but you're still Warped Records, you know what I mean? Yeah, that is what's so impressive. I mean, at the heart of that is the owner's tastes, you know? But you see, it's actually so rare to see an artist, a label, have kind of, you can see their taste is the same now as it was 25 years ago. You can see the same with you, you know? So many people, something happens along the way and the music changes. I mean... How do you feel about your own taste in that sense? I actually feel mine's more about remembering. It really like, because like, you know, I talk about that, the younger days of like digging for new stuff all the time. And you can actually like inundate yourself with that and that kind of lose the essence. I've definitely been there. Do you know what I mean? You're like. you lose the essence. And the thing is, is like when you get back to the essence, that's the most important part of it. Do you know what I mean? You can express musically in whatever style you want, but there's still a certain essence in there. You know, obviously I embrace new music and I listen to new music and stuff. Do you know what I mean? But, you know, to me, it's like, I know what my essence is. I know what my foundations are and I know what into that and I'm not too concerned about what's new then I know that it's going to be it's going to be authentic I think that you can definitely go down the rabbit hole when you get sort of like inundated with all new stuff It's good to be contemporary, it's good to be forward thinking, it's good to have all these things, but what is your essence in music? And I'm just talking about me personally, and I know that I've drifted away from that in the past, whether that's making music or whether that's DJing. Do you know what I mean? And I feel that I'm in a much stronger place now because I recognise the sovereignty and the craft in what it is that I've got just out of the stories I've been telling you today. That shit's sacred. I hold that stuff really dear to me when it comes to making music. So whether I'm in a studio or whether I'm DJing, it's a ceremonial practice of me expressing what's sacred to me. I think what must happen, you see a lot of DJs, what must happen is that, you know, yeah, you always seek the new and you play to a lot of crowds of people who love you. And, you know, there's never any negative feedback. People love these music. And over time, your taste changed to one point. You'd be like, oh, so-and-so now. I can't believe he's the same DJ as the one from 20 years ago, you know? Right, yeah. It's like when I moved there, literally before I moved to Ibiza, I was like not doing gigs. I was just like, I'd had enough. I was burnt out because I'd toured and gigged that much. actually like you know what I kind of forgot and lost the essence when I got to Ibiza I was just like shit I don't have to change anything I do I just need to do what I do and in turn that helped me remember so I'm forever grateful for Ibiza giving me that it gave me a blank canvas and then It wasn't like I needed to reinvent or needed to reshape or remould anything. I just had to just do me, do you know what I mean? But it's easy to forget that in that world out there, you know? Thank you. Thank you. I'm not sure. The feeling is real and there's love. Thank you.
