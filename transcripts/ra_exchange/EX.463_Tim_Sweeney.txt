Thank you. Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. When it comes to dance music on the radio in the 21st century, few figures loom as large as Tim Sweeney. He, of course, is the host of Beats in Space, the hugely influential radio show on WNYU that just hit 20 years of broadcasting and is just shy of its 1,000th episode. Having been mentored by the likes of Steinsky and the DFA crew, Sweeney grew into a respected DJ in his own right, but despite his busy schedule, he's still been broadcasting every Tuesday night at 10.30pm for all these years. This exchange was recorded live earlier this month in Sydney before a 20 years of Beats and Space party. and sees Lorna Clarkson lifting the lid on the influences and experiences that made Sweeney into the vital figure he is today. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Tim Sweeney is up next. *outro music* All right, so my guest and I tonight have a few things in common. We've both been doing a radio show about 20 years. Our radio shows are both on a Tuesday night. There's just so much in common. It's like we're speed dating in public. That's weird. I know you're married. It's okay. And we probably both prefer to be sitting in a studio than in front of a crowd of people. Yeah? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'm certainly sitting with a man who's more used to being in my seat as the interviewer, the facilitator, and the introducer, the host. He's been presenting the incredible Beats in Space radio show for now 20 years. And in that 20 years, he's noticed... an 18-year-old's passion project into an internationally respected platform for excellent music, new and established talent, a record label and an enviable DJ career. He's an excellent curator. He's quite an excellent human. We've now spent a couple of nights together. chatting, and he's the boy who never left university. Welcome, Tim Sweeney. Thank you. Thank you. I love the idea of never leaving university. How do you get to do that? It's a good question. Yeah, well, starting out, I guess I, after I graduated, I kind of... To keep doing the radio show, I took a class in the School of Continuing Education to kind of, I just found whatever was the cheapest class to never showed up, just to go and keep doing the radio show. because you needed a student ID number to keep doing the radio, and I didn't want to quit. So I did that for a while until kind of the student management stopped asking. And then, you know, hopefully they still are. okay about it. I'm always on edge with whether they will kick me off. It's kind of, I never know. The students who are running it, every two years kind of changes, so it's a different 20-year-old who is bossing me around. So do you have a kind of system of backhanders, like, you know, keep them sweet? I buy beers for them and things. Yeah, that's good. I find young students really do like beer. Yeah, yeah. Hey, you can get into the show. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, you know, you just try and be nice and hopefully... get along and someone there in the management knows what's up. us what was your original um degree uh i studied music music technology was my yeah but that was how you know i connected with dfa was i had to do internships and so my first internship was with steinsky who is kind of like original hip-hop guy of New York. And after working with Steinsky, I met the DFA guys at a bar and I just asked if they needed any help and then started that internship. But it wasn't that simple. It was a little bit more like there's more kudos there because you were actually DJing. And you were playing some pretty awesome music. I was DJing. Yeah. I mean, my thing at Plant Bar was I was opening DJ. I wasn't allowed in the bar yet because I wasn't old enough. Of course, because New York is 21. It's 21, yeah. The only way to get in, yeah, I was playing 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. before the parties started. I mean, they would be getting in lots of names into this small bar, definitely way smaller than Frida's plant bar. So I would meet. a lot of people or listened to a lot of DJs there. And the bartender was Luke, the lead singer for The Rapture. So he liked what I was playing. I mean, he was the one who gave me the gig there. I brought in a mixed CD and gave it to him. And he was like, yeah, you can come in and play before a party. And he said, after listening to me, hey, I like what you're playing. I think you would like... you know, this guy who's producing our record, Tim Goldsworthy from, from Moax, you know, cause you're playing a lot of Moax records. And I was like, what, Tim, like you, you're working with Tim Goldsworthy. You know? So I was like, next time Tim comes in, you have to introduce me, you know? And so there was one night, I don't. I don't know. I think it was probably Shit Robot was, Marcus was DJing that night because he was one of the owners of the bar and, you know, regular on the weekend. And I think Tim and James came in and were probably partying a lot that night. I know. Yeah, yeah. And... I went up to Tim and just told him I was a huge fan. I definitely snuck in the Steinsky thing because I was like, I worked for Steinsky because UK people always know about Steinsky, but US people never know about Steinsky. So I knew Tim would know about it. oh, you really worked for Steinski, okay. And then, yeah, he was like, okay, come in on Monday to the studio and we'll talk more. And, you know, I went in on Monday and then that was kind of 2000, you know, early 2001 before Twin Towers, you know, they were still there. And, yeah, I remember I was supposed to like, you know, we, yeah, I would just. go in every day and kind of sit in the studio with Tim and James before it was before the record label had actually even started they were just the production duo and they were I don't know working on amazing remixes and it was super fun yeah so you've got a few records to play on the show I got, yeah, definitely there was a lot of early records from that to play on the radio show. That was amazing. I mean, mentally... are incredibly important when you're starting, especially in a creative career. So what did you get from your internship from Steinsky and then also from DFA? What were your takeaways from each of those experiences? Yeah, I mean, Steinsky for me was the real New York character. I'm from Baltimore originally, so when I moved to New York, listening to Steinsky and his stories, he had a huge record collection, but he had a story about each record. He is all about sampling, so he had all the records that every hip-hop... artists had ever sampled. So, you know, I had to go through, like one of the projects with him was I had to go through and, you know, his big songs were the lessons and he had to do a performance. of it live so he needed to find all the original samples and so I had to go through all the records like one of the projects for him was to go through and BPM records for his DJ sets so I just was listening to everything and just BPMing it and that was like just a how did you do it yeah because this is for the internet people this is not bpm.com yeah no he had a little box he had a box and you would just kind of like sit there and tap you know and then i would just like write it down on a sticker and put it there and uh i mean it's good to have i still put bpms on my records too so you know it's a good thing but it was that project was like such an eye-opener for me just going through his records because he had also a lot of different styles of music. And he was also into spoken word records and since Dr. John passed away, he was such a huge New Orleans funk. blues jazz fan. So he put me onto all of that, the meters, and it was just kind of like, okay, you have to listen to this. Oh, you like this? You need to listen to this. And that was kind of how I was at DFA too. It was kind of like, oh, you haven't heard this? You need to listen to this. And so just kind of like homework for me. You know, you'd go in and I'd have all these records I would need to go home listen to or go find or whatever. So with Steinsky is, you know, that influence with those records from kind of like a New York standpoint. But he also did a radio show on WFMU, which I think was, you know, I had to edit some of that of his or, you know, listen through some of those. And that was a big influence on me because he put so much effort into his radio shows, editing everything. And, you know, one of the projects... was that he had was called he had a you know a voicemail machine at the time and he would leave the phone number for people to call in, but he would have a question for people to answer or some kind of question that people would answer and he would put together a collage of the answers. It's what influenced me to start the Beats in Space hotline number, but I don't really leave any good questions for people. yet to leave good answers with, but it was listening to people's answers that they put was something that was huge for me to hear listeners. It's that thing of not reading what people are typing, but it's like to really hear someone's voice about how they're feeling about something. It really hit me. So it was something that influenced me for my radio show from Steinskiga. I was just like, okay, I need to do something. I need to use that somehow. Yeah, because doing radio can be a very one-way kind of process. You're in a studio, you're often alone or maybe you've got a guest and you're talking to yourself. Sometimes it feels that way. Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. So is this your way to kind of close the loop, to kind of bring people into the studio with you? Yeah, I mean, you know. It's like having people leave the messages is also a way of, well, one, while doing the radio show, you know, I don't have time to talk to people so long. And you know this as well. Like people really like to talk to you for a while. Like, well, late night, especially. you get a lot of people who like to talk for a long time, who maybe don't have a lot going on. So they talk to you for a long time, but there's really good stories. I had lots of old Paradise Garage goers and just like, yeah, people with crazy stories. And I wanted a document of that. So it just felt... I was listening to them, but it just felt wrong that I couldn't re-listen to it or remember everything that they said. And so that's why I started the number for people to call. But it doesn't really work out the same because if you're not talking to the person and ask, you know, even if I wasn't really asking any questions, they were just talking to me. It's still not the same on a voice machine. And then sometimes it goes wrong. And then sometimes it goes wrong, yeah, yeah. You get someone who maybe just wants to call a little bit too much. Yeah, yeah. Well, you always get those people. But yeah, I did have, you know, one guy, Victor from Washington Heights, who called a lot. Pretty infamous now, I think. Yeah. And he stopped calling, though. So I don't know where he is. Yeah, yeah. Are you worried about him? I'm a little worried about him. I've shouted him out. It's kind of like a back call, you know, I'm like, Hey, Victor, where are you? You know I always feel like he'll leave a message whenever I said his name, and he stopped doing it, so it felt like Batman's gone, kind of, yeah. But, yeah, he originally called and was really mean and kind of threatening to me, and I worried about my life for a little bit. And... Yeah. But... It ended up being, it was actually on a night RA was there, they were recording, and Juan McLean was in the studio, and I finally had him on the mic. you know, we did an interview on air. Yeah, I was wondering why you decided to do that. I don't know, just for the fun of it. Just to see what happens. Well, because I'm comfortable with Juan McLean, and I was just like, okay, if Juan's there, he'll... Although Juan just, like, took Victor's side on everything just to kind of... to egg him on. But yeah, it was just, I don't know, something different to do. But that kind of changed the whole atmosphere and he became nicer, maybe more boring. But I guess my life felt... Better. And you're still here. I'm still here. We're thankful for that. And Victor, I don't know. Okay, so your very first radio show. How did you even get the show? Well, I... went on WNYU when I was in high school. I went up to New York and I emailed someone at the radio station who was doing a show that I thought maybe I could get. It was this guy, Neil Alin. I said, you know, I'm coming up to New York. Can I play on the show? And, you know, he asked for a mixed CD or, you know, something to check out. I think it was a tape. So I sent him something, and then he was like, okay, come on. And so I went up there, and yeah, I was super nervous, but I wanted to do radio because I had done in high school, I went on University of Maryland, like cut class to go do a radio show there, and it was like, okay, I really like doing this. This is what I want to do. And so when I went up to New York and got on WNYU, I was like, okay, I really love this. I want to do this. And so I did it twice that summer on Neil's show. And then when I got into NYU, I emailed the radio station. I was like, okay, I've been on the radio. you know, already on FM, like, how can I start? So they kind of, like, I started right away because I had already done radio on their station. So I kind of, you know, the only thing is, yeah, I had to come up with the concept, and, you know, for the radio, they want... They didn't want anything too broad for what you were going to play. It needed to be specific genre, and I wanted to do a lot of different genres. So that was where I kind of butt heads with the program director about what the show was going to be. going to be and you know I ended up saying one thing and then expanding it later is kind of how I've done it. You know this the time slot 10:30 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. is like the dance music show but I kind of and it is focused on dance music but I feel like I could do anything I wanted on it. What do you think your filter is? So, I mean, dance music is incredibly broad. It could be anything. But you've carved out a particular style and taste level. How would you describe that if you had to kind of put it in some sort of words? Yeah, that's a very tough question. Yeah, I know that's why I'm asking it. It's really hard to answer that. It's just what I enjoy and that is kind of just whatever I'm thinking is interesting. And, you know, a lot of times I also need to just... do something completely different just to stay interested in the show. Just to keep... Because it can be too much. You can get too much into RA lists or something like that. No offense. It's very important and very valuable. Yeah, yeah, yes, it is. But sometimes I'm just like, okay, I just need something else because I also feel like... There's just a part of me that is always kind of whatever gets put up on a pedestal, I want to find whatever is not on that pedestal. I feel like... there's something else out there. So you're kind of always looking under the radar. As soon as something has a spotlight on it, you might try and divert. Yeah, and that could be to my detriment, you know. Oh, I don't think so. I think you're doing pretty well with it. Thank you. Yeah. the radio show started out very much you DJing, playing lots of music, but where it's at in 2019 is from what I can tell, you're not on there a lot at all. I mean, it's, it's definitely changed a lot. And that's something I'm kind of last year was a kind of big experiment for me with that, where I was kind of. I basically didn't play at all. And I was actually trying to test whether that would affect my DJ gigs or whether that would... I don't know. It was kind of like testing how things would work if I didn't play on the radio show. Because I always have this fear, like, I play on the radio show, everyone knows all the records I want to play at the club. And it's like, you know, you don't have those secret weapons that everyone else, they don't do the radio show every week. So they don't, you know, no one knows what they're playing. And so I was like, okay, if I take that away, what happens? But I felt like I didn't get any DJ gigs. So then I don't know how well it worked. But I really definitely miss doing the radio, like doing it every week, having that mix every week forces you with listening to new music and finding the best stuff each week. Otherwise, you can become complacent on what you have. I definitely feel, you know, I've been trying to change it now this year where, you know, I want to bring it back to like one guest and me, but it's still been, I still have a hard time saying no to something that I see that is like a good two people thing together. At this point, my goal is at least once a month that I'm going to play. But yeah, I want to put it back where I'm again. You're in there. I'm in there. Yeah, somewhere. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, because I don't feel like as a host, I have a good time being there and listening to the DJs. That's why I have them on. I'm curious about what music they play. I want to get inspired by what they play. But yeah, I also have this urge to play stuff. And the show isn't so built around me interviewing them. So that part of it doesn't, you know, it's like quick on my talking. So this is the most you've talked for a very long time. Yeah, I'm having issues right now. You seem to be doing really well. Thank you. Just saying. I'll have another drink. You mentioned the fact that a lot of people approach you. I was curious what the tipping point has been for you in having to actively go and seek people to... bring on to the show yeah i mean it's definitely changed but i feel like it's with promos you know you get sent all these promos and you know there's a very small handful that are actually ones that are really good. And the rest, you really have to search. If I go to the record store, it ends up being those records that I'm most excited about that you find. So for the radio show... with the guests is kind of in a similar vein. I get hit up by the booking agents or PR people. Sometimes it'll work out and I'll be like, yeah, I totally want that person on. I didn't know they would be up for it. But then a lot of times I'm just looking at the club listings, who's coming to New York. And I reach out and say, hey, you know, I would love to have you on the show if you have time. Or it's like I... I play a record. It's some record or a label that I like. And I just reach out to them and I say, hey, if you ever come to New York, I would like to have you on the show. Please let me know. And so that's the kind of usual reach out for me is just to kind of just tell them I'm interested. And then they tell me their schedule. But back in the early days of late 90s, early 2000s, when maybe Beats in Space wasn't known to anyone, who was the first person you got on the show that you were just like, yes! Well, I think it was the first person I had on was the one I had. I mean, I was a big Solid Steel listener. It's a Cold Cut fan. Yeah. And I had DJ Food come on the show, I think as the first guest. And at the beginning, I kind of lied about the show because... Because it wasn't like... NYU has two stations. There's an FM station that gets all across New York City, New Jersey, up to Connecticut. But that's only Monday through Friday, 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. And then the other times, when I started, it was called 800 a.m. So it was just an a.m. station that would only reach the dormitories. So no one was really listening. So when I started for the first two years, it was just on that 800 AM. And I kind of just had to tell people I was on FM radio. You know, like, just a lie. Messaging the truth. Yeah, it was a little lie. But yeah, DJ Food were really nice about it and, you know, came on. I was really excited and I think from there it was just that was the kind of starting point where tell other people hey I had this person on and then they'll be like okay he's legit or you know like that's how you kind of snowball effect of getting artists on the show so when it goes well it goes well and that's amazing but we all have radio fails. So what's been the biggest cringeworthy moment in your radio career? I mean, it's probably been being too drunk on the radio. It was really... I remember falling on the microphone before, but... I think that was with Super Pitcher at some point. It was for New Year's Day or New Year's Eve and definitely drank too much. I try and make those fewer and fewer now times. It's the risk, though, of a late-night radio show. Yeah, it is. Besides that, it's more, it would probably be more, yeah, guest. interviews where someone doesn't want to talk and it feels like pulling teeth or you know to to get anything out and i mean it's kind of rare now that happens and i think also if i feel that vibe now i know just to like just stop it and you know not try any more questions and just go back to music or next DJ or you know so that's kind of stopped now and yeah so I don't think it I don't know there's nothing too bad anymore No, I don't have any, you know, it's all up on the radio. It's all up online anyways. I don't know. There's no secrets here. Is there anyone, you don't have to name names obviously, but that you were excited about having in the studio, but when you met them and had them there, you were just like, I will never, ever have them in again. Yeah. Can you talk around them? Or the situation without telling the person? I would prefer not to, but... it's just, yeah, it happens and you can get bummed out on, on some people and it's hard. That's hard because yeah, you know, you really like everyone's music and you don't want someone you've met to, to kind of go against how much you love their music. So if, if I get that kind of vibe, I try not to talk to them as much. And, and, you know, you just try and keep your space and then, and you hope things will change or you don't know what the situation is too, because like, you know, people are touring, people are tired. I mean, I want people to want to be there, but you know, sometimes they don't want to be there. And, and it's just kind of, you just don't know what happened to them that day or that week or whatever. I give them benefit of the doubt. I'll talk shit about them later. I don't know. But maybe not on the microphone. Not on the microphone right now, but afterwards. You once said in an interview that you'd love it when people bring drama to the show. You would love that. Has that ever happened? Not as much as I'd like. It's just a thing I talk about with friends at the record store. Because on the hip-hop stations, there would be a lot more drama happening, like beefs and stuff. So we were like, Dance World needs more beefs happening so I could be reporting about it and be fun. Yeah, there isn't really that much drama to report on. In electronic music. Yeah, it's a little bit sad. So you don't have those people that are kind of... causing drama or I don't know yeah it was just it was something where it was like it would be fun to have more of a talk show where you could talk about people and it doesn't feel like the dance music world is ready for that i know because you actually said you would be willing to get rid of the dj mixes and swap it out for talkback radio at night yeah i would like to do that i would like to do just yeah sit there with someone and shoot the shit you know and like i think it would be fun but um i mean obviously my ratings would go way down But it would just, I don't know, I think it would be fun to, I mean, especially for late night radio, like just doing like a talk, just talking about stuff with someone is kind of what late night radio is about. So you could be like an agony aunt for electronic lovers. Yeah. Yeah? No, I would. I think I really wanted to do one where we would call up people about their love life and help them. I thought it would be really fun to do something like that. We are going to have a Q&A at the end. If anyone's having any relationship issues, just save them until the end. We'll get there. But, you know, I always needed a good, like, it wasn't just me in the studio. It would have to be a crew then, you know, a round table of talking. Panel of experts. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was fun. One of the things I love about your radio show, and it's not what you can listen to, but it's the wall of Polaroids. When did you actually have that idea started? Was it from day one? That was not from day one. That was, yeah, originally I was using just, yeah, regular press pictures or the first website. had no pictures. I always go to A1 Records in New York. It's kind of my regular Tuesday night or day rituals to go to the record store there. So I'm friends with those guys. They've been around for a long time, early 90s, and they had been taking pictures of DJs or producers who come in. They put some on the wall, but they kind of just took them and stored them. And my friend Jeremy, who works there, was like, man, you should be taking pictures of... the people coming in to your show, because you're getting all these different people coming through. I was like, you know what, Jeremy? You're right, I should be doing that. I'm going to take your idea. I'm sorry. So, you know, it was really, it was from A1 that I was like, okay, let's do this, you know, have them. It's just another way of, for me, was... another way to make it more personal. One, the photo's more personal of the moment, and also you get their signature, so then it's another way of just seeing something about the artist of like, okay, they have terrible handwriting, or this person's an artist. They do cool stuff. And they really don't photograph well. Yeah, these people don't photograph well. These people, wow. how does he do a photo like that? You know? Yeah. I don't know. It's, it's interesting, but yeah, it didn't start until I guess maybe now it's almost 10 years of doing it or it might not be even 10 years, but it's a lot. I, now I have a lot of photos at home and, uh, you know, it's like documenting that is another project. Yeah. Cause I was going to ask. where is the wall? Yeah, the wall, I mean, the wall that everyone takes it in front of, of Polaroids is actually just of students at WNYU. So it isn't any, any of my ones. I was, caught out. Yeah. I was sucked into it. Everyone, every DJ comes in looking at it and then like, yeah, there's no one there. So that you would know. But yeah, I mean, I just take them, all the Polaroids back home and put it into shoe boxes and, you know, it just kind of stays there. But no, I mean, we've been. I did do one Polaroid show at a gallery in New York and we put up like 800 along the walls. It was pretty insane and it was actually amazing to see everything and to see all the Polaroid, how people change. I mean, you saw also the Polaroid film changes, you know, just how people getting older. Yeah, it's an interesting thing to look at when it's all really out in the open. I'm interested in your label. Firstly, why you decided to start a label, because it's difficult. It's hard work. It's certainly not for the money. someone who is consuming a lot of music all the time, I imagine it's like, how do you choose what to put on a label? Why did you start? Why did you do it? Yeah. Well, I mean, I think I started it on the 10th anniversary of the radio show, or the idea came, I was talking to Tim Goldsworthy from DFA about what I could do. for the 10th anniversary and he said you know you should start your own label in so many words and um so i was like okay you know what all right let me do this yeah for me uh a big part of it was the visual side like you know with a record I love the artwork of it. And I think, yeah, also for me, I've been working with musicians and DJs all the time, but I don't get to work with artist-artists. And so with the record label, I finally was able to do that. able to go into another world which I found difficult to tap into because it's like well I don't have these connections although at the same time that visual art world is connected and people are friends with each other so it's like okay like Eddie Ruscha who I released Secret Circuit you know knows a lot of the art world so it would be like okay you know here's this person here's this person and then you know again it's like how I started the radio show that things kind of snowball and so for me yeah I just wanted to have something super visual I mean actually when I started I wanted to have all records that I could just hang on the wall you know as art pieces so that's why All the early ones, they have a sticker on them, but the sticker's like a vinyl one that you can just take off without it ripping anything. And then it's just the visual art. There's no writing on it or anything because I just wanted it to be something, a piece of artwork. I guess that's something that you're losing nowadays with the MP3s and digital things. So it was just, for me, I love looking at artwork and I just wanted to get in there with that. But with choosing music... It's another thing that I get sent a lot of stuff. And so it was just kind of, there's a lot of unreleased things. And I was like, okay, I want to see what I can do. Let's see what things I can release and that I get sent that I really like that should get out there and see what happens. And yeah, it's a lot of work and there's no money and it's a headache, but it's fun. Well, sort of fun. Yeah, I want to keep doing it. It's definitely like you get, it's like a little baby and, you know, it's hard if it doesn't go the way you want. You know, you get really into a piece of music and if everyone else is not into it, it's hard. You know, like it's frustrating. Look, I want to leave enough time for questions. So I guess I wanted to ask. When you first started this whole journey, what was it you wanted to achieve? So 20 years ago, little 18-year-old Tim, what was it he wanted to achieve? I just wanted to do a cool radio show. I wanted to DJ and I wanted to be able to travel, which I have been able to. But I don't think I had a rule the world mentality. Now I do. No, it's just kind of... I think I just started... I wanted to do something. I wanted people to hear it. And... you know, that was kind of it. Like, you know, that's why I started putting things online was to get people to hear it because like I said, I was on the 800 AM and there was no one listening. So I put it online so that people would listen. And, you know, I guess nowadays it's the same thing. There's just so much out there and it's trying to, you're just trying to get it into people's ears somehow. Well, now that we're 20 years down the track, what is it you want to achieve now? Because back then you were mentored by some incredible people, so they helped set you on a path. What's your advice to a generation who are teched up in a way that you weren't back then, who can communicate in a second in a way that you couldn't back 20 years ago, who might want to be following in a similar path, but they're... in a generation and a time that's incredibly noisy because anyone can do it. So what advice, I guess, if you were to be that mentor now to someone else, what would you tell them? Good luck. I don't know. It's hard. I would say, I mean, for me, it was just keeping at it. Like, I just did the radio show every week, a new show, keeping at it and not quitting and, you know, not going on vacation and just... Is it true you've never missed a show? Not true. Yes, it is true. I mean, that is true, but it's not true anymore that it's all been live. But it's definitely, yeah, I have had a new show every week. But now coming to us. Australia is a little bit harder to do the radio show live. But I'll be back this Tuesday to do the radio show live. So I'll fly out on Monday and be really out of it on Tuesday night to do the radio show. And then I'll fly to Russia the next day and then I'll fly back. So, you know, yeah, it's just kind of one of the doing the radio show live is just a lot more fun. And it's yeah, it's more special. You know, I think that is one thing I've thought about for the 20th anniversary on changing things like, you know, it would be cool to come to Australia and do the radio show from here. You know. or go to Europe and do the radio show live from someplace there. My issues are that I'm on a college radio station with, it's just me doing the radio show. I don't have a producer, I don't have a team, and there's not like... Someone who can really help out with if I wanted to do it from here and be live on the radio in New York. It's logistically very difficult. It sounds more glamorous than it is. Yeah, yeah. But so, yeah, for me, it's just then been trying to be there on the Tuesday night. And, you know, not every artist can be there on a Tuesday night either. So I have to record people whenever they're in town and then air it. But I just, I always try and get people to be there on the Tuesday night. So it's just more fun, more like a... Doing it live is a, you know, you're on edge. Something could go wrong, and it's more fun that way. That's why I don't have people send in any. In the beginning, I had people send in mixes, and now everyone has to do it live at the studio because it's just... I want people to mess up. And so what I'm hearing from that is, I guess your advice to someone coming up would be, be committed. If you could see it through and be in the moment. Yeah. Those are good. Those are good. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Remassage your words. I've got two more questions. Okay. One is. Beats in Space in 2039. What's it going to be? I don't know. Gray-haired Tim. It's a good question. I would like to still be doing it. I just have to keep it still interesting for me. find a way to do that, which, yeah, where I don't get bored by dance music, or maybe I'm bored by dance music then and doing something else. But I think I would still like to do radio. It's fun. I mean, it's... I think it started DJing in my basement in Baltimore where you're just by yourself and then being on the radio where you're just by yourself but you have... this crowd listening, you know, you can just kind of do whatever. Swapping out your parents for hundreds of thousands of people. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know. There's like a freedom to it. Also, with being on college radio, I don't have to worry about ratings or if anyone is listening. I assume no one's listening when I'm doing the radio show, so it's probably pretty true. But yeah, I think if I didn't still do it in 20 years, it would be kind of the same thing. I'd probably be grumbling about... somebody else's show is doing better than mine or, you know, yeah, whatever, you know. Okay, so for anyone who's not across it, you've just recorded and released your 993rd show, which means your 1,000th show is on July 23rd. Yes. Is there something special planned for show 1,000? I'm still working on that. But yes, I would like to do something special for it, but I'm still working on it, so I can't say more than that. We'll see. I hope I can, yeah. I don't know, putting a lot of pressure on that one is difficult, but, you know. So we just have to listen. You'll have to listen and see what happens. Yeah, sorry guys, I tried to get our heads up. Yeah. If you have ideas, I'm still open to that. Find Victor. Yeah. We could find Victor. Tim Sweeney, thank you so much. This has been a great chat. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Hi, Tim. Hello. A friend of mine told me that you were responsible for curating the soundtrack for GTA San Andreas. Can you talk about that? Yeah, that was my job out of school, out of NYU. I got hired at Rockstar Games to do that. I don't know, yeah, it was kind of just weird luck on that one. Where they were looking for someone, they had done, what was the GTA before that? The Miami Vice one. And they had done that all, I think it was mostly Terry Donovan, one of the main guys from Rockstar Games, did that soundtrack. So he was super busy now that GTA had blown up so much and then they need to hire someone. So they kind of. reached out to people in the music world and I ended up going in for interviews and got the job as a young 21-year-old. It was kind of crazy, just a lot of work putting together. I don't know, it was the eight or ten radio stations for that game. But it was again something where I enjoyed finding all this different music. I kind of related it to my DJing because I could just go to the record store. Now I had an unlimited budget from Rockstar Games to go buy all the expensive records. So I could just go buy whatever I wanted and I just kind of put playlists together for them to say, hey, these are the... They gave me a genre and everything had to be up until 1992. And so I just had to find the best music from that. Can you remember the genres? Yeah, a little bit. Like R&B rock. Yeah, there was like two hip hop stations. One was supposed to be like modern hip hop, which was like 1990 to 1992. And one was like old school hip hop. There was like a rock station that had Guns N' Roses, was a big thing. There was like, I think there was a more indie rock station. There was a country station. That was interesting to me because I had never done any country music before. I was going to say, was that like a learning experience? Yeah, that was a learning experience to like find cool country music. And I think there was a... house station. I think there was a reggae station. I don't remember anymore the other ones. There were a lot. But it was a big learning experience. Also, one story I always have from Rockstar Games is not from San Andreas, but from Midnight Club, another racing game, is we ended up licensing music from Underground Resistance for that game. And if you know the story of Underground Resistance, they had this thing where they hated Sony because Sony... had sampled or put out. Knights of the Jaguar. Yes, yeah, exactly. I remember it well. It was a big issue to try and get them to put out something on PlayStation. And we ended up, I was talking to Mad Mike and... He was just... It was awesome talking to him. I still remember him. I had never met someone who cared so much about the community. cared about Detroit, like part of the deal was, you know, Rockstar helping out the community in Detroit. And that was for me like, okay, you know, more people need to be doing this and caring about more than themselves. It was, yeah, I don't know. It was kind of special that, you know, he would do that. Anyone else? Got another burning question? Hey, Tim, big fan. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for being here. Appreciate this. Been a fan for ages. I remember the first time I heard about your show was like 2005 or something. But what I was going to ask is like, we obviously can't listen to like the radio, like you live, like in Australia, right? Well, you can actually. I mean, online, yeah. Well, we can now. There's a lot, yeah. We can now, but like what I mean is about your show was like a friend of mine was like listening to it on podcast on iTunes right right yeah and so I guess like for a long time the only way that we were kind of engaging with like your radio show was through pod like through iTunes podcast like yeah I just wonder like how much is that like That's a pretty significant way that you've got a broad reach, right? Definitely. I mean, that is how I assume most people are listening to the show. I think listening live, yeah, while the radio show has a big reach in New York, I don't know how many people are listening to the radio anymore anyways. And then there's online, but it's a late night show. It streams online, but it's really only, no one in Europe's listening because it's too early in the morning in Europe. It's okay for Australia for in the afternoon. Yeah, it is really the podcast the next day when I put that up that everyone listens. like podcasting back when you started was kind of wasn't super no I mean yeah when I started it was I was doing real audio file it was before mp3s was real audio and yeah I kind of I converted those to mp3s later on but it yeah in the in the beginning I I don't even remember how I would do it. Well, I would have to re-record the shows in real time because I would record the shows to cassette tape at the very beginning and then to DAT tape. And you would have to record those into the computer and I would spend hours kind of having to... record it back into the computer and then edit it, which at the time, 20 years ago, would take a really long time. I mean, it still takes a long time editing the two and a half hours. But yeah, I mean, I was as good as a student at that time, I guess, you know? Yeah. Anyone else? Hi. Was there like a moment or a special situation where you realized you really had listeners or a crowd that listened? Yeah. That's a good question. And the thing I always say, I think it was around 2003 or so, but it was when I played, it was a DFA, I had that remix of Relevé, yeah, by Carl Craig. And I played that on the radio show, Delian Gavin's Relevé, the Carl Craig remix. And I had that before everyone else. And I played it on the radio, and the DFA guys said, you know, if you play this on the radio, just make sure you talk over it so that no one cuts it out. And, you know, whatever, post it. So I talked over it. And the next day when it went up, I just got... People were super excited about the track, but they were so angry about me talking over it. And so I was like, okay, this is pretty amazing. A lot of people are talking about this. There's people listening. And I didn't... That was kind of like when it hit me, that was kind of... Also, people from all over the world were really listening. I was getting messages from all over the world, but I still don't think anyone's listening. But at that point, it felt like... Maybe some press places talked about it even or whatever. It kind of hit, okay, there's listeners. I've still always assumed there's not that many. This is just how I do the radio show and keep doing it. I guess maybe lower expectations. you know, it hurts less when you find out about things. But, you know, I just assume no one is listening and then something else happens and, you know, I'm like, okay, they're listeners. It's a nice surprise. Yeah, it's a nice surprise. Yeah. I'm here doing a talk in, yeah, Sydney. Yes, you are. So it's cool. Anyone else? Do you actually know how many listeners you have? That is another good question, which is no. At least 50. Yeah. Well, one, I don't know how many people listen live because to do that you need Arbitron is the system to do the live FM radio thing to know how many people are listening. And Arbitron costs a lot of money and we're a college radio station. it doesn't matter how many people are listening so they don't i think a commercial station could know and tell me but i don't know any commercial radio people to to tell me how many people listen i don't know how many people listen streaming live at the time i don't have that access oh come on you can get that yeah what do i i'm really telling you that i don't know very much um You know, I keep the number. I don't know. Maybe some people see it, but I don't put on SoundCloud and MixCloud the numbers of streams that happen because it annoys me when there's someone big on the radio show. And everyone listens to it, and someone's smaller name person comes on the radio show, and they don't get the same amount of plays, but I think their sets are way better and should be, you know, I want it to be at an equal level. stop putting the allowing people to see how many plays happen because I think it just that helps I don't know I don't know if it helps but it's just I think it keeps it more fair because it just I mean actually it's really personal because I hate it that no one listens to my mixes and then you know like I don't know Well, they will be tonight. So for anyone who doesn't already know, Tim will be DJing here tonight. Yes. Up there, swapping the microphone for the decks. Well, I don't know, maybe use the microphone in your sets as well. When I get really drunk, I used to. I don't do that anymore. So if you are hanging around, then he will be on later tonight with 82E as well, DJ. So that will be amazing. And it's going to be a nice long set. You're going to take it in all different directions. Excellent. Thank you. And thank you all for coming out and listening. Thank you. It's funny to do this. I've never... done a talk and I'm very not I'm not very good at talking in front of people I know that sounds weird but it's again radio thing is you are by yourself or with you know two other people so speaking in front of people is uh difficult you did very very very well thank you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
