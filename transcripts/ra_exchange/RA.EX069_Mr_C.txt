Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Rapper, DJ, producer, pop star, club owner, actor, and a fair few things I'm probably forgetting. That's a thumbnail sketch of Mr. C's strange and wonderful CV. The outgoing London positive L.A. resident is quite possibly electronic music's most celebrated Buddhist. I caught up with him to cover all of these things, and the true origin of his stage name, earlier this month in Berlin. As I've read, you keep saying that you have an ego the size of a bus. Yes. I'm working on it. I've been working on it. Been working on it for a long time. Since I was a teenager. You found out or you had the self-awareness when you were a teenager that you had an ego the size of a bus. Yeah, I mean, I've always had an ego the size of a bus. But the self-awareness. The self-awareness. Yeah, well, yes, I started meditating when I was 17. Learned about Buddhism, transcendental meditation and stuff like that. And one of the main parts of Buddhism is to... release yourself of attachments so I learned very quickly that I have an ego the size of a bus. Where did you learn about Buddhism? My stepfather when I was 17 gave me a book and he said you need to check this out. It's a book it's like the power of the subconscious mind and yeah I read the book I was like oh that's why that happens oh that's why that happens and that's why that happens. and got into it immediately and started meditating immediately. into it. 17 seems like a very... Yeah, most people are in their 30s or 40s before they discover this kind of thing. Why do you think you were ready already at that point? Not that you... Well, because it came to me. Things come to you in life when you're ready for it. Otherwise, it doesn't come at all. If you're not ready for something, you don't get it. We get what we need in life. And I think that's true. everybody and I was I was ready for it you know and embraced it and continued to use this philosophy since then it's almost 30 years yeah I keep seeing on your Twitter the OM and that was one of the reasons why I wanted to ask you about it specifically because OM is the sound frequency of the universe yeah or God for want of a better word Are you religious or is it just a spiritual thing? It's spiritual. I'm not religious. Buddhism is as close to a religion as I could get, but there's still rules, and I don't do rules very well. So I'm not religious. It's spirituality, but it's Buddhism that I'm kind of into, and shamanism. It's kind of something between the two, I would say. But it's not religion. It's a technique for getting through life. What are the rules of Buddhism? Well, there's two main rules. It's basically to come to stillness every day, twice a day, which is meditation. It's concentration on nothingness. And the second rule is to renounce everything, which I have trouble with. The coming to stillness, when you first encountered dance music, Acid House, was there this idea that, did it immediately connect that these two ideas were possible? More than immediately. I was always into dance music before Acid House. I was into disco, which is the same thing. It comes from that. And I always knew there was a certain power in music, in tone, and in percussive sound. I always knew that there was something about percussive sound that altered your brainwaves from the normal... I found out later that it was your brainwave from the normal beta state into the alpha and theta states. thus releasing serotonin neurons that throw you into the world of the other or the world of ideas. And I always knew that to be the case. I didn't know that was why, but I knew that there was something empowering about rhythm. I mean, just from the way I'd listen to music on my headphones and go off on one, and I was all coming around half an hour later, whoa, where was that? And I wasn't asleep. I was in a trance, and I don't like to use that word. But I was in a transcendental state of consciousness just by listening to music, and it's happened to everyone. sure you yourself have been listening to music and you've gone off into this thing and it's not quite sleep and then all of a sudden the music stops and you're like whoa where was that When was the first time it happened for you? Do you remember? As a kid. As a kid. And, you know, I was always into altered states of some kind. Right from, like, high school, I was, like, into solvent abuse and stuff like that. So I was always into altered states and psychedelic states of consciousness anyway. So I always leaned towards a music that would have that. Like, when I was... like 15, 16, I was into old school electro, the whole body popping thing, because it's no different to techno, is it? It's the same thing. It was always there for me. That was my style of music that I liked. I like black music. I was brought up on soul, funk, disco, reggae. So electro was an obvious evolution of the funk. Where did you first hear this stuff? On the radio? On the radio, yeah. And just on the streets, you know, like I'm a street kid. And, you know, you hear it on the streets. You hear it, you know, the elder kids are listening to music. And like London has always been a center for dance music. It's the dance music center of the world. And it always has been. It was great in the whole disco thing in New York in the 70s, but if they'd have seen how London embraced it, they would have been shocked. Everyone I know, pretty much all my pals I grew up with, were all into funk, disco, reggae, dance, black music. So it was just always there. It was always around me. I remember from my earliest days... being four years old and me my twin sister and my brother is a year old and we're walking around in circles thinking it was called dancing and listening to black music that my mom would play so was your mom the the person in the household who was bringing stuff in well she as a young as a youngster yeah as a child for sure um yeah she she would always listen to music of some kinds there's always music around Do you remember when you first started taking an interest? I've always liked it, ever since I was a little kid. But even just like, I guess more of a concentrated interest, I suppose, would be a better question. In 1979, when Rapper's Delight by the Sugarhill Gang came out, and that was one of the very early rap songs, I knew I wanted to be a rapper. It was like from that minute, I was like, learned all the lyrics, rapped along with the song, you know, and I knew, and I got into old, really old school rap at that age, at 13 years of age. I knew then I wanted to be involved some way in music, and it was as a performer, as a rapper, I didn't really consider being a DJ. until I was 21, until after I'd made my first house record. Why was that? Why was DJing? You wanted to be the center of attention. Yeah, that was part of it, for sure, yeah. But I already got a lot of attention because I was a very well-known rapper in London for years before I was a DJ. So I was always up there hanging out with the DJs, on the mic, rapping, getting the party going. So that was always there for me anyway. I didn't get that much more attention being a DJ but after making my first record which was released in August 1987, the record I made that with Evil Eddie Richards and Kid Bachelor did the mix down on it, I did the vocals and I knew I wanted from then I wanted to do more than just the vocals, I knew I wanted to make the music. I mean, I thought the best way to do this was to DJ, to really get to understand the way crowds react to certain things and certain sounds. And I was always into the sound. Mixing was immediate for me because as a rapper, you know the breaks. You know when to bring things in. And, like, you know, mixing was immediate. It was like I'd been doing it forever the first time I started mixing. It was just like that. Um, That was a big that for me that was a part of it learning about how the music worked But it was also the magical journey I knew that there was this hypnotic thing about drums and rhythm that sent people into a trial a transcendental state and that you could take people on a magical journey and there was always like you know even from when I was a kid like 14 15 years of age going to discos in London, you don't need ID in London, and I'd go to clubs, I started clubbing at 13. So by 14, 15, you know, there was many times when it was electric on a dance floor and everybody would be like, you know, disco music and everyone would be going for it. I knew then that there was something special about music and it could be done. So by the time I started DJing in 1987, I knew that house music was going to be what I was going to be spinning and electronic house and techno. And I knew that there was something very special and powerful about the rhythm and about the frequencies of electronica that I could... used to influence people. It's like dancing is like a mantra. When you're in a, in a dance, when you're dancing and you're on a floor and you're not thinking, it's like meditation. That's what meditation is. Meditation is to not think. It's to clear your mind of thoughts and go to nothingness. Well, this is what happens when you're on a dance floor, pretty much. But when you were rapping, uh, early on, it seems like That might take people away from the trance. It gets people excited. It increases the energy. Yeah. To get them to a place. Not with the rap, no. I think the rap was more about my ego. The rap was more about my ego. The rap was about, hey, look at me. Do you remember who first gave you the chance? Or did you just go up and said, I'm going to get on the mic? Yeah, I just got to DJs. The first time I ever rapped in a nightclub, I was 16 years of age. I was in Tenerife in Playa de las Americas. And I was in the And I just went up to the DJ and I said, let me do a rap, mate. And he's like... "What, you want to rap along to something?" I said, "No, I don't rap along. I'm a rapper, I've got my own lyrics." And he's like, "Really?" And I go, "Yeah, come here." And I start rapping in his ear. And he's like, "Wow, yeah, get on the mic." So that was my first time in a nightclub. And ever since then, it was like, "Yeah, just go and put it on the DJ." He'd And they would always be not sure and I'd rap in their ear and they'd be straight away, take the mic, take the mic. As soon as they heard me, it was like a proper old school club. sound of rap hip-hop style of rap. What were you rapping about? In the beginning same old bullshit that the rest of the rappers were rapping about. It was early rap was about having a good time it was about all the ladies in the house the ladies that I know it was all about having fun there wasn't much you know my fat gold chain it wasn't my fat gold chain it wasn't gangster it wasn't any of that it was about fun and rap started in New York with loud mouth DJs getting on the mic saying, "Hey, yo, come on everybody, let's rock the house, let's rock the house." And that's the attitude I had when I started rap. But I was also writing, you know, I was very inspired by Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five. The message, like a very poignant song, inspired me. So I had what I called reality raps. as well so that I'd be rapping about more conscious things as well as just party stuff and look how fabulous I am. At a certain point house came into the picture I guess it's it was an evolution of course. And I read recently that it was very important to you to have been a milkman to your development as to figuring out what you wanted to DJ in a way. Because you were able to go out. for a year every night. It was good. I mean, it was my last inverted commas real job, you know. It was, yeah, and it was very convenient. Like London back in the mid 80s to late 80s. closed at 4am, so I could go to the clubs till 4, party, enjoy myself, go home, put on my milkman's jacket, go to work, load up the float, get out, knock the milk round out by 10, 11 in the morning, and then sleep all day. Sleep, wake up at nine o'clock at night, have some food, go out. So it was kind of perfect, like as a rapper and musician. And it was something, I got to a point where it was like, okay, when I wanted to become a DJ, it was like, I can't do both jobs. I have to make a decision here, what I'm going to do. You know, I wasn't making any money from rap. It was fun. go up and get on the mic, it weren't about being paid. I mean in the later stages of that in like '86, '87 I'd get you know maybe £50 you know. from expenses or something like that but there was no pay in it so I had to have a job so to give up my job was a big deal especially for my mum because I come from a super poor family like really poor working class so like my mother was like what the fuck are you doing we can't eat records you know what are you doing So that was an issue. But yeah, it was a good job to have. a night owl what uh it was just it got to be too much stress you had to make a decision or did you have something like a residency or something no it was like it wasn't even too much stress it was it that if i was to move forward with music it had to be 100 full time all my effort all of my conviction and all my love with no other boundaries and that's how i've always felt about but you weren't working on anything at the time you didn't have that like one moment that okay now i can leave it i mean you just when i released my first house record in 1987 i was still a milkman okay so you had something on vinyl yes and you said mom you can't eat this but it is something it is something yeah She supported me. She backed me. It was one parent family. That's hard. She backed me and supported it. Who were the DJs that you were looking up to? You mentioned Eddie Richards. Eddie Richards and Colin Favre were my two heroes. Kid Bachelor. On radio, Jazzy M, The Jackin' Zone, mid-80s, amazing. Jazzy M turned London on to house music on the radio. And Jasper the Vinyl Junkie, I used to work with him as a rapper as well. Before that, I worked with other people, but for house music. Those were the people who, for me, Jasper the Vinyl Junkie, he used to play everything, he was eclectic. Jazzy and pure house music with the Jack in the Zone and Eddie Richards, Colin Favour. I would rap at the Camden Palace, which was the main nightclub for electronic dance music through the mid-80s, before it was called house. And they were the DJs and they were both like always proper mixing back then when people didn't know what mixing was and For me that was where it was at. So I became like their rapper. I was the resident rapper What was the big thing about their the way that they DJ was that they were mixing that they were mixing yeah that was a big first you know like for me like before house it was you know they were mixing these guys were mixing like old school electro with like new wave first wave new wave and it was everything you know it could be you know like frankie goes to hollywood relax into planet rock by africa bomba and you never knew what was going to happen And there'd be those moments in the palace where I would be like, you know, I don't really like that. Being into black music, there'd be things I'd be a little bit not sure of. But once it really, you know, once it got to sort of 85, 86, 86 I think was a defining year. Jack was born, you know. The word house really started getting banded around by then. and the guys were really pushing that sound in a big way in 86 and 87 so for me those were big years as a rapper that rapped only on house in 85 I made a conscious decision not to rap on disco anymore and to change my lyrics to rapping about jacking and about house music and about the beats. So my lyrical content changed. The style of rap changed for me. And you were DJing after... 87. 87, okay. And was that getting just Eddie? and Colin saying, why aren't you watching them? No, well, I kind of knew how to do it anyway. I mean, I remember as a kid, like, trying to mix together disco records at my friend's house. Yeah, my pal had two turntables, no pitch control, belt drive, and we used to push them. And we was always into it, you see? Like, that's the way it was when you're a street kid in London. Yeah. We was into it. So we would try get records in, like not hold mixes but have some sort of a, you know, put one record into another, quick cuts, scratch and cut. So it was always there. So when I started to, you know, took it on professionally, it was easy. All of a sudden I've got a turntable that's got a precise pitch control. Hello, how easy does it get? Come on, you know? So... It would get easier later. And also, I didn't rely on anyone else, like, to get in. Like, I wasn't, like, asking Eddie and Colin. Can you get me a DJ gig? On the contrary, I organized my own parties and booked Eddie and Colin to play with me and kid. And that was how it went. In February 1988, I started a night called Fantasy and it was proper, full-on acid house club. And my resident DJs were Eddie Richards, Colin Favour and Kid Bachelor. who I played alongside with. So, you know, it's like, that's how it works. They were my pals. You know, I went to school with Kid Bachelor in North London, you know, so that's how it works. And it was like, I'm doing parties. These are my boys. You're playing. End of. And I'm playing with them. So, like, you know, by the time it got to spring 88, everyone knew I was DJing. And I already knew all the club owners and club promoters, you know, because I was rapping for them. So I could say, hey, book me as a DJ. They're like, I thought you was just a rapper. I'm like, you think my rapping's good? You HVME mix it up, bruv. And they're like, really? I'm like, yeah, do you want me to give you a tape? They're like, yeah, sure. Next week, give them a tape, they and put me on straight on the fly at Mr. C because everyone knew me anyway as a rapper. When did you decide to go by the name Mr. C? When I started to write rap. Really? I was 16 years old. So by that time already people had been... saying that you were a guy who took the piss so much. Yeah, well, there's lots of stories behind the name C. The truth, I'm a big Chelsea fan. Mr. Chelsea. Well, when CB radio was illegal in Europe, it was fun to be on. All the kids would be on CB radio, and there'd be night... clubs CB nightclubs where they want to play disco and we'll get dressed up in our casual wear and go out do you know what I mean it was it was a big scene for CB radio it was it was directly linked with dance music, with disco, all the lads, everyone had a CB radio. And you have to have a silly name. Because I'm a Chelsea fan and I live in Arsenal area and all my friends are Arsenal, to take the piss, to wind everyone up, Chelsea Boy. And that was what I called myself. So when I started to rap, it's like, rappers have stupid names. I need another stupid name. What can I do? I'm Chelsea Boy. I thought I was a man. I still haven't grown up. It's like all these, you know, 30 years later, I still haven't grown up. But I thought, yeah, from a Chelsea boy to a Mr. C. And that was how it came about. But I've used lots of different stories. You know, it is an affectionate term. Like all my friends are calling me a cunt all the time. It's like, you know, come on, Mr. C. You can't stop it Well, I think I saw that on a chat show on television on YouTube today. Yeah, it was with Melissa from Melinda Messenger. I thought that's a great story to be laying out for something like that. When I did an interview with The Face magazine in 1992, and I was on the front cover of The Face, with a six-page feature, and the first question was, what does Mr. C stand for? And I'm like, cunt. And they're like, we're journalists, we will... print, were you right, cunt. So, you know, already it was in there and I'm taking the piss. And then I said, it was an affectionate term for my friends, but I've used all different stories. I was in Utah once touring with the Shaman, Salt Lake City, and I did an interview with the Utah Review, which is huge. newspaper and stuff there and they asked me what does the C stand for? Okay, we're in Mormonsville let's take the piss and I will see as in physics C is the speed, the velocity of light so therefore C is equal to light and if C is equal to light, I am the angel of light, Lucifer, banished into darkness. How'd that go over? We had a picket outside the event. There was a demonstration outside the event and it was hardcore. It was one of the best gigs of the tour. It was fantastic. Tell me about Clink Street. Clink Street. That was really where I cut my teeth. I think, you know, I did parties before that. I was doing my own fantasy parties up until that point. And I was playing at the odd thing here and there, the wag club, you know, just trying to muscle in where I can. But Clink Street was where I really cut my teeth. you know, it's week in, week out. The guy that organized it, Paul Rip, Paul Stone is his real name, he came to Fantasy and he was actually looking for Kid Bachelor. And out of respect, he knew that it was my night and he's come to me and said, you know, I was looking for like Kid Bachelor to play and I wanted to talk to you about it. And I'm like, well, why don't you... you get the whole firm. And he's like, well, who's the whole firm? I said, if you're looking for DJs, it's Kid, Colin, Eddie, myself. He's like, well, I thought you was just a rapper. I'm like, I'm going on in a minute. Have a listen. Do you know what I mean? And from that, at the end of it, we became mates and he started doing the Rip Nights, which meant Revolution in Progress. we were the, four were the residents, so it went from there. And that was where I really cut my teeth. It was raucous. Why do you think it holds such a, you were about to say it's raucous. It was raucous. I mean, It was the first real acid house, proper underground, you know, New York garage, Chicago house, acid house, Detroit techno. A lot of different things. A bit of old school electro thrown in for good measure. Let's have it. Do you know what I mean? And that was, it was the first place in London that was really doing that. I mean, I was doing it with fantasy and there were places doing it, but. It was the first thing that really captured people's imaginations. My fantasy night was a Monday every two weeks. So that wasn't like every week on a Saturday. It started in May 1988. And the first party was great. It was like, you know, two, three hundred people. The second party was like five hundred people. And then the third party was just... It was madness. There was people from all different walks of life, every different race, colour, creed that you could imagine, all coming together, getting out of their minds and dancing in this dark space with just a strobe light and a sound system to crazy-ass music. And it went from deep as shit New York vocal garage through Chicago. house through acid through Detroit techno why do you think though that aside from the music what were the circumstances that made it such a bigger thing was it just the right time good yeah No, it was the right time. You know, Thatcherism, the Conservative Party, Margaret Thatcher was really taking a stranglehold. We was entering into a recession. There was so much going on that house music had been coming through anyway. People were into house in London in 84, 85, 86, and into this new style of music, you know. So it was building anyway. And then all of a sudden this new love drug appeared on the scene. In London it appeared like in 1986. So by 1987, people are intrigued. By 88, it was full on. I think the ecstasy, the LSD and the music combined, along with all the circumstance of going into a recession with a right-wing government, caused this new culture to be born, rave culture. And then you have it every single week on a Saturday in a big place. Yeah, for the first, through May and June, it was every Saturday. By the end of June, we started on a Friday and changed the name to A Transmission, which was Acid Transmission. We tried to keep the Fridays a bit harder than the Saturdays because Saturdays was just open. You could play everything from like 116. BPM deep instrumental garage New York house to 130 BPM balls to the wall techno from Detroit and everything went yeah with a transmission we tried to keep it a bit harder but it was they were similar and then by the end of July we was doing Sunday as well there at Clink Street and it was called Zoo Because it was full of animals. By then, the people that were still going were animals. And it was mental. So, you know, we'd do like Friday, we'd close up at like 8, 9 in the morning, 10 in the morning. And then start up again Saturday night and do the same thing, go through. till 10, 11 in the morning, start up again Sunday night. And that was how it went. And it was the whole summer. Yeah, the summer of love. And where around the corner you had something more pop, balleric and fluffy with Danny Rampling's Shoom, which was also good. It still had the ecstasy. Was there a competition at all? None. No, it was a completely different thing. The Shoom crowd was very white. boy, pop kind of bass, still everyone high-ends, it was all still very lovey-dovey. What we was doing was altogether more dark and dangerous. Black people, white people mixed, it weren't a white boy thing, it was black. music that we were playing garage music deep house is black music and that's like that the disco roots of house music in London is black so there was a very mixed crowd a lot of black faces and that gave gave it a different edge it was more underground there was no pop involved there was no you know There was no bubble gum. There was no bubble gum there at all. It was underground, forward-thinking, innovative, black dance music. Well, it's interesting to look at the careers of everyone now. You're still... on that underground tip yeah i've never changed i mean well obviously i did the shaman but even then with the shaman we were a special band um we were a pop band but not like any other when did you get involved with them it was it was 1989 um basically colin and will uh moved down from scotland to get involved in the acid house scene uh the manager charles kosh moved down first to get the band a publishing deal and a record deal. He came to Clink Street, saw this Acid House thing going on, contacted the boys straight away, Colin Angus, Will Sinner, and said, listen, you're supposed to be a psychedelic band. You need to check out Acid House. It's unreal. They came down, checked it out, stayed, squatted. changed their blueprint from psychedelic rock to a psychedelic acid house. It's interesting how clearly there are connections to the, you know, what the ideas behind it were exactly the same, I think. Yeah, psychedelic rock and acid house had exactly the same idea. It was about being as innovative as possible. musically with the tools you have at hand to help people on drugs enjoy themselves. How did you get on with them the first time you met them? Oh, it got them great. They were nice guys. They were just regular guys in a crowd to me. It was just like whatever. They were just a couple of guys in a crowd like everyone else. No big deal, you know They come to party quite a bit. They would see them at the events didn't think anything of it really and I liked it that these guys were doing in a band called The Shaman. Of course. I read Carlos Castaneda, The Yakai Way of Knowledge in 1985. So I was interested somewhat in shamanism and altered states of consciousness. I've always been into that. And the band, the name intrigued me. And I thought, great, this is great. A new dance band. They're fusing... rock and dance music and they're embracing the dance music with it. I mean, people say that Happy Mondays and Stone Roses were indie dance. Well, they're shit. They were rock bands. There was nothing dance about them. The Shaman, on the other hand, was an acid house band with rock overtones. Yeah, big difference. The name must have intrigued you. It did. Immediately. It did. It did intrigue me immediately. And it was in 1989, they'd written this track called Move Any Mountain. And they hadn't been mixed down, and they asked Paul Oakenfold to do the mix down on the EP, on the 12-inch. And they said they wanted to consolidate the song with a rapper. and Paul was sure there's only really one rapper you're gonna use a rapper for house it has to be Mr. C there's not really anyone else that's gonna fit with what you're doing Mr. C and they're like a great idea even Colin said to Paul why didn't I think of that you know so they asked me to if I wanted to get involved well the manager asked me Charles and he said Do you want to get involved? And I like the name of the band. Move Any Mountain is about positivity, about what you can do with the power of your mind, which I'd already made a song two years before. My first song with Eddie Richards in 87 was called Page 67. And it was a spoken word song where I spoke for seven minutes about transcendental meditation, positive thinking, and what you can achieve with that. That was my first tune, Deep House song. If I'd have done a rap on that song, it would have been the first hip house record ever released. It would have beaten its percussion. by mdoc by a good six months so um you know for me uh move any mountain was the perfect song it was like okay um i knew it wasn't really it was a bit white for me but i thought that with my input and my my writing i could bring a lot of street to it and um I felt good about doing it. I felt good about doing something that was slightly outside of what I was into. So I went for it and the track became a club hit. How much input did you have in terms of the writing on subsequent stuff? I mean, obviously it was their band. Yeah, well, Will, sadly, we lost Will in 1991 in Tenerife. Before that, I mean, with Move Any Mountain, I wrote the raps. Okay. It's a given what's the subject matter. This is the subject matter. Great. Just what I'm into. I'll write a rap. Boom. Done. I wrote the rap. They were delighted with it. End of story. Subsequently to that, I mean, like, there was, the Shaymin were touring in 89 and, or in 90, and I wouldn't even be on the tour. Yeah? Like, and they would have, like, the raps wouldn't be there or they'd just have a sample of my raps playing. And the reason being was because they were just starting to build up, they didn't have the money to pay me what I would, the 200 pounds I used to get in 1990, or 250 pounds, was out of their price range. And that was my bread and butter. I lived at home with my mother until I was 26 years old. I was still a pop star and I was still at home with my mum. because my mum was badass. They couldn't afford to pay for me and the same fee I would get for DJing so I couldn't go on tour. It was that simple. And it wasn't until May... May '91 that they asked me to join the band as a full member, both Will and Colin. I said, "Okay, if you're gonna cut me in, you're gonna give me a cut on it and you're gonna cover whatever, but I'm not gonna stop DJing. I'm still gonna be doing my thing as Mr. C. I'm still gonna be playing underground house and techno." and this is how it works. And they're like, great. And I became the DJ on the tours as well. Perfect. Made sense. Saving money. Yeah, so it all kind of worked out. And then once I became a full member of the band, well, basically, I was asked to become a full member of the band. Two weeks later, Will Sinnott was dead. Very difficult time. Hit me hard. I didn't have it because my family and friends didn't know Will. I'd got really close with him. There was no one I could share that loss with. So I was very upsetting. Also, the Scottish contingent of shame and fans. a certain Glaswegian contingent that really hate me. They saw me as some sort of a replacement for Wilson. I was the downfall of the shaman, even though it only got bigger. You know, that was the opinion of some. Well, of course, they got into different music, started making different music, and they had this new guy. You know, I came in and put in the input of dance music in a big way. you know rhythmically the band changed once I became a full member my job was the rhythms my job was you know play some of the music my job was to write the raps and like Colin and I we struck up an agreement If I came up with a song and it was my song, I'd get the larger percentage of the royalties and both writing and, well, the shame and royalties was different. We had a contract and escalations and everything else on that. But as writers, songwriters and publishing, that was how we worked it. If he'd come up with a song, it'd be his song and I'd get like 20%, he'd get 80%. So that's how it worked. And Colin is a genius. Colin Angus is a genius songwriter. Unbelievable. And his ideas were out of this world. Is that what you learned from him the most in terms of music? The songwriting? Yeah, absolutely. The songwriting. And I learned a lot from him spiritually. And I learned a lot from him academically with psychedelics and stuff. You know, he's an intellect. He's a super, super intelligent guy and amazing at everything he does. And it's like, you know, I was lucky enough to be around this guy, Colin Angus, who I could learn from. So definitely my songwriting took a huge leap forward once. Whose idea was it to get Terrence McKenna in? Colin. Yeah? Yeah, Colin was the main man. He's the captain of the ship. He's still the captain of the ship, you know, like any I get asked anything I'm like from the manager Can we put this do with this sync with one of these songs? What's the governor say? If the governor says yes, we do it. He's still the captain of the ship Do you know I mean he he was the founding member of the band I joined later on and I have I've got have that respect for that the respect for his songwriting and I don't even have to have it because I have that passion for it, the respect for him, you know? And that's how it went. I was very involved. I'm a musician. I love chords, harmonies, melodies, bass lines. I play keyboards. So I had a very, very decent input. in the writing. The band ended in 96? 98 actually. 98, okay. Our last record was an album that we called UV which stood for The Ultimate Voyage. and that came out on Moksha Records and it was a farewell to the fans. We didn't promote it, we just put it out, I think it sold something like 10, 15,000 copies only, which was nothing after doing 1.6 million Bostrom albums. But it was like, the real fans picked it up and it's actually... pretty sick album yeah it's like some really really really good shit on there um you were still djing in between you know, while you were doing the show? I never stopped. I mean, like once I got my first paycheck from the Shaman in 92, I started Plink Plonk Records. At the time, through 91, I organized the illegal warehouse parties release in London. In 92, we did the drop parties, which was with, no, that's a lie, I did the harmony parties. which were illegal warehouse pies. '93 I did the drop pies, which was with the label Plink Plonk. Plink Plonk was drops, Plink Plonk. So we did the pie that was called The Drop. Then in 95, every year I changed name. Why were you changing names so much? Because they would get too popular. All of a sudden we've got 1,000 people trying to get into a fucking warehouse for 700 people. I don't need that headache. Go away. It's like, no. So I changed. - But at the same time you were in the Shaman, like, quite popular. Couldn't do anything about that. - It was very different. It was like, Mr. C was a schizophrenic. It was like one side of him was this pop star, and an absolute in-your-face pop star, and the other side was underground DJ legal warehouse party from over there. And they were very, very different. Like, you know, there wasn't really Shaman fans coming to my parties. They didn't really know about them. Did you, was it tough? Was it a conflict for you to turn on the rock star? No, it was very easy. I've always been a show-off. That's what shamanism is. Get high, dress up, bang a drum and show off. So you were running enough parties and doing enough things in 98 to, like when it ended to... feel busy. There wasn't like a moment where you're like... No, no, no, absolutely. You know, I opened The End in... Well, of course. I was going to get to that. Oh, I didn't realize it was even... That early? December 95. So you had plenty to do. I was a pop star. You know, Mr. C's opening a new nightclub. You know? Yeah. Pop star from The Shaman opens nightclub in London. You know? Tell me about this guy, Leo, comes up to you and he says, I have this idea, but I don't have enough money. wasn't quite like that no so it was kind of like that what happened I mean I knew Leo from when he was a 16 year old raver in a woolly hat in 1988 you know and he basically His father's an architect, one of the best, really amazing architect. His company's called PKS, Douglas Paskin. And he got commissioned to turn a space, a basement of a building in the West End into some sort of a space that could be used maybe for as a venue of some kind or something. He told Leo about it and Leo's like well said to his father Why don't can't we do something because he was organizing illegal pies himself Leo He was always into it, you know, and he was just a promoter back then and Basically the father said no don't be stupid. We don't have the money. We don't have the to do it and Leo was telling my friend Paul who I did the harmony parties with in 92 a DJ called Unique he was telling him and he said well have you spoke to Richard and Leo was like duh no I haven't calls me up I've got someone I want to talk to you about I'll come over I came over to my flat and we started chatting about he said I've got this space I said let's go and have a look We went and had a look and it was like, you know what? We have a lot of vision, a lot of money, a lot of hard work. We can turn these underground tunnels into something. And I put my money where my mouth was and we went for it. How long did it take? We started building in 1993. It took a couple of years to build it. And the first night, it was all worth it. The first night, at the end of it, I wanted to cry. They ruined my fucking new club, the Cunts. It's like, we did the, it was called The Beginning. The promotion was to have free drinks all night. It was free, everything was free. Yeah, it was invitation only. It was called The Beginning. And it was amazing. It was like. the who's who of dance music in London was there. Do you know what I mean? Like, you know, at the very mind, I was a pop star. So, and also an underground icon at the same time, you know, underground DJ promoter. So the who's who of dance music was there, you know? And yeah, people were going up to the bar, getting drinks. you know taking them over putting them on the table or something oh which one drinks mine i don't know i'll get more whole fucking dance floor in there they wrecked the club and yeah we gave away 30 000 pounds worth of alcohol that night and i think it was all glass so all this glass was on the floor getting ground into this amazing there was a yeah we changed that immediately we went plastic we still had glass for people that said can i have a glass please we gave them a glass but we went pretty soon after that, yeah. The end, I think, is still fresh enough in people's minds that most people will know something about it. But for you, what are two or three things that people may not... know about it? It's history that we're worth sort of bringing up. I don't know. I mean, like the end, if it was the end changed London. When we opened the end, there was just these West End nightclubs for Sharon and Tracy, you know, and like getting good music in there was a nightmare, which was why it was all illegal warehouses everywhere, which was great. But there wasn't a proper nightclub. dedicated dance music club for underground dance music and that's what the Inn did. We built a club that was unlike any other. We put a full suspended wooden dance floor, we put air conditioning, we put a drinking water fountain. All the other clubs, you couldn't wash your hands when you took a piss because they didn't want people drinking the water. They wanted them to pay for it. I'm like, fuck that. Here's a water fountain. Drink as much water as you like. We don't want people getting dehydrated in our club. Drink. It didn't hurt our bar sales in any way, shape or form. So we were the first club to really get it right and do it properly. And that became the blueprint for modern London and therefore the world. Do you think that... Because you were so involved and Leo was so involved in the building management of it, that's why, you know, all of these details. Absolutely. It was, yeah, it had to be a sprung wooden floor. It was on a little hydraulics. So seven o'clock in the morning, your legs didn't hurt. You're dancing on wood and it's on hydraulics. You know, it's like, that's the way to do it. Air conditioning, good drinks, friendly staff, everything done meticulously. The best sound system in the world. Amazing intelligent lighting rig. Everything done, purpose-built dance music nightclub for underground dance music. No cheese, no crap, no commercial bollocks. No cheeseball DJs, all the big names. The big names that were playing were the good ones. You know, you're Carl Cox, you're Laurent Garnier, you're Darren Emerson. the good ones in the 90s they were the ones that were doing it and you know we'd book you derrick you detroit chicago new york england some france some you know a bit of germany do you know what i mean the good shit and that was how it was there must have been moments you keep saying underground there must have been moments in which that put you in a situation where you might have wanted to go more mainstream or just because, well, just because of the money issues. Like I remember you saying in another interview that there were a couple of times when you almost had to shut down. Yes. Because of, yes. hadn't made that compromise. - Would rather shut down than make that compromise. Would rather shut down than make that compromise. I'd rather eat glass. - What were the most, like, is there anything that you can talk about? - Well, it was just really hard. You know, when you spend like, you know, that amount of money building something, you know, it's... And you're doing underground music. And it's hard. The club wasn't full all the time. You know, when you're doing, you've got to do something week in, week out. What were the, was there a particularly slow years? We nearly went under after the first year. Yeah? Yeah. We was on the edge of bankruptcy after the first year. You know, but we kept going we managed to keep it go keep it afloat and it was really I mean it all started to turn around when um leo's sister zoe became managing director why because she's brilliant and she really knew what was going on and we had a fantastic team the team at the end were brilliant but when zoe took control you know leo was a good director yeah but not in the same way zoe was you know leo was a good managing when you know but he's very artistic And, you know, he's more of a musical director than a managing director. Zoe had already had experience with restaurants and stuff like that. So she was able to apply that to the nightclub. And that was when it really started to take off. I mean, we was nine years old before we broke even. in that project. When we was three years old, we spent almost as much again building AKA. Why, why are you throwing so much money into this project with no profit? Because we believed, because London is the dance music capital of the world and it deserved to have the best club in the world simple When you decided to close it was 2009 yes, January 23rd 2009 why did you make that decision and very easy we was given an offer that we couldn't refuse a company bought the property so we had a new landlord we had a 25 year lease on the building for three years this company the granny out of us to leave so they could build luxury apartments and we're like no no no we're caning it now sorry we you know we're like it's like we've taken us this long to break even and we're caning it we are not closing forget it um when it came to it was august 2008 they come to us and said look in january you're going to have eight years left on your lease we really want to build this is prime real estate we really want to build um we'll give you eight years profit at your best year to leave all right okay We left on our own terms. The club got better every year. For 13 years, it got better and better and better and better. And then it closed. Legendary status. It couldn't have been a better closure. The whole way that we did it was absolutely perfect. The whole closing. It was incredible. And it gives the end legendary status. We closed on our own terms. We didn't have to slog our guts out for how long. And another thing was the following month, after signing off the deal, the credit crunch kicked in. Yes, there is a God. Not only do we have to not work our bollocks off for eight years to earn this money, we would never have been able to with the credit crunch coming. we would have but you know yeah yeah so yeah it's a perfect ending it's like the end of a romantic story Before it ended you'd already sort of started I guess taking acting classes? Yes, I started taking acting classes way before it ended, yeah. I knew that I couldn't DJ forever. I'm not a little kid anymore. And I'm young for my years. I'm still into the scene. I love to dance. I love to party. I like to party hard. I love fashion. I love being around people. I love spinning records. I love music. DJing is a passion. But there comes a time in your life where you say to yourself, Do I really want to be hanging out with a bunch of 16 year old kids and that's how it is sometimes There's some clubs that you go to and everyone looks 16 It's like, "Whoa, what am I doing here? I don't even want to talk to these people." It's strange. The first time it happened to me was in Italy. I was at a club and they were kids. It wasn't adults. It was kids. And it was like, "You know what? What the hell am I doing here?" And they loved it. I played and they loved it. I couldn't communicate with anyone. It was children. Is this why it's become even more important to you to throw your own parties? To have your own brand to sort of say... I've always done that anyway. I've always done that anyway. I guess now, especially. No, no. I mean, I've always... I do Super Freak for the same reason I did Release in 91 or Fantasy in 88. Do you know what I mean? It's the same thing. I put on parties because I want to help people to come and celebrate and make a living while I'm doing it. You know? Tell me about the acting class because it sounded like a very intense... Very intense, the acting class. But I knew I was going to get into acting at some point and I... I did an interview, I can't even remember what year it was, it might have been 2001 or 2002, I'm not even sure. 2003, I did an interview in Mixmag and they said, "So what are you going to be doing in 20 years from now?" And I said, "I'll be swanning around the Bahamas in my yacht." And they're like, "Okay, so how are you going to get to that?" What about like musically? What are you going to be doing with your professional career? I said, I won't be DJing anymore. There's nothing worse than being an aging DJ. It's almost as bad as being an aging rock star. Do you know what I mean? It's like, no. You know, there's got to be a limit to that. This was almost 10 years ago. Yeah. Yeah. It was 10 years ago. Yeah. And I said, there's got to be. I know. And to me yet but like I said so basically I'm going to be an actor and they're like really I'm like yeah sure I'm going to be an actor and I said you know like Anthony Hopkins is gonna be like gone that he's my hero and I said Anthony Hopkins will be at some point he'll die there will need to be a replacement like for this sort of method acting like this sort of intensity and that replacement is gonna be me and they're like really like yeah damn right they took it as I was winding them up My tutor read it. He's into dance music. And he's making a film. The film still hasn't been made, but we might be shooting next year. It looks like we're inches away from getting the money. It's quite a big budget. It's going to be like four million pounds. It must feel like almost even worse than building a nightclub, getting films funded. Yeah, it's a nightmare. Basically, he's called me and said, I've read this interview that you want to be an actor. Is that true? And I'm like, yeah. And he's like, well, I'm a teacher and I've got a movie. And if you want, if you'll be, take a... a good role in my movie, I'll train you. I'm like, great. What's the acting? He's like, it's called the spiritual psychology of acting. And I'm like, yes, there is a God. It seems like, yeah, everything comes around to these. Yeah, you know, and it's basically Stanislavski and Buddhism. Hello, that's just what I am about. And I started learning. I trained. Over the course of six years with him there was a year in the middle when I lost my mum of cancer I took out from acting classes and I I cancelled all like pretty much 80% of my work I only did what work I had to survive in that year and didn't really get back involved until a month after she'd gone. Luckily, with my Buddhist beliefs, I was able to get back in a month later after I lost her, rather than maybe years of depression and mourning, because my mum was my best friend. Badass. Yeah. So yeah, I took a year out in the middle, but it was five years of weekly classes. What was the first lesson? The first lesson was, I don't remember. You know, I really don't remember. I think the first lesson was talking about Method and Stanislavski. I mean, like John was like, you know, talking to me about Buddhism, but I'm like, you know, hello, preaching to the choir. Do you know what I mean? We don't really need to discuss the Buddhism that much. You know, I meditate. I'm into, you know, transcendental meditation. I'm into positive thinking. I'm into some sort of psychology. So we got straight down to the nitty gritties of the acting and started. He's a teacher. We started from day one of a course. What's the most, been the hardest thing for you to get your head around with the acting? The hardest thing was finding purposes, the psychological part. Psychiatrists have troubles finding purposes within people. Yet to be a good actor, you have to be the character. Proper method acting is you are the character. So you need to find out what happened to that character when they were a kid as to why they make these actions. So if I'm going to be a character who's a really angry character, for an example, Why is he angry all the time? What's pissing him off? Every action has an objective. Every objective has a purpose. Every purpose issues from an event that happens in your youth or childhood. And they sit there in our subconscious mind. We don't know they're there in the chamber of invisible thoughts. There they sit. Controlling our lives. Giving us this purpose to be loved. Or purpose to be powerful. My purpose was that I found. Was the purpose to be held in awe. You know. And I had to learn to deal with it. that you know and that's why for me starting to learn acting 10 years ago was a revelation like it changed everything for me it changed my DJing it changed you know and it was great having a purpose to be held in all that I didn't know about when I was wanting to be a pop star and wanting to be a famous DJ and wanting to be a rapper and wanting to do all these things great but when you're an actor and you're being the character, there's no room for any delusions of grandeur. There's no room for any inferiority complexes. These complexes have to get out because as soon as you think, oh, a delusion of grandeur is the camera on me, you're no longer the character. It's back to Richard West. So you have to learn how to do that. You have to learn how to find these purposes in yourself. and finish your thinking on them and get rid of them before you can learn how to do that with a character. So that's what I learned to do. How did it change your DJing? I wasn't DJing so that people would go, wow, isn't he amazing anymore. I was DJing so that people would celebrate life. changed everything. You know, like I had this... I think more opening DJs could get a lot out of that. I had an issue. When I had this ego thing with this purpose to be held in awe, for me, I was like, you know, I was kind of pissed off. You know, like, why wasn't I on the same wages as Carl Cox and Danny Tenaglia? Why am I only a thousand pounds and not five thousand pounds? You know, like, why am I... And, you know, like, my musical integrity is second to none, yeah? Cutting edge, forward-thinking, innovative, electronic dance music. No sell-out. My mixing, perfect. It doesn't get any better than mixing on turntables than what I did, yeah? As far as I was concerned, I was perfect and it was all about my ego and it was all about this purpose to be held in awe and it held me back. Perfection is... a limitation and it was after I was able to let that go this perfect DJ got better and it was like uh why didn't I see it years ago especially being Buddhist you know why didn't I find this purpose all those years ago inside me and it took me learning to act to find the purpose to be held in awe inside myself and to finish my thinking on the event that gave me that purpose. Where do you go from here? Where do I go from here? Well, I've started teaching. I have one class left on Tuesday in LA. My first course is finished. It's called Meditation, Creative Visualization, and Positive Thinking is what I'm teaching. I've started writing a book about what I'm teaching. and I'm very excited about that I'm already a quarter of the way in I've just been writing it for a few weeks just on airplanes I write at no other time and I'm really excited about that so I think there's definitely a future in teaching for me and definitely in writing as well this book I'm really excited about it's you know there's books about Buddhism there's books about meditation there's books about the law of attraction and positive thinking there's books about karma there's books about psychology and there's books about all these things there's books about psychedelics there's books about dance culture there's books about you know all the states there's no book that covers them all in one hit concise short to the point no bullshit this is a guide to how you should live so I'm writing it And I'm enjoying writing it. You have an album that's done? Or you're reworking? I'm working on it. I thought it was done. But I sent it to a few people and it was rejected. one person, I really like this track, that track and that track, but the rest of it's not really me. And another person, well, no, it's not really for me, but I like it. And then... my closest, Ellen Alley and loved it. And I was that close to be pitching. That would be the perfect label for this album. But the office wasn't sure. They like it, but they weren't 100% and they can't do anything they're not 100% on. And I thought, you know what? It can't be good enough. So I took a step back. I detached myself from it. And it's pretty sick, the album. It needs things. And I need to go back in and do some more work. Basically, the work that I really need to do, I need to add... It's music, the music is really musical, there's chords, strings, melodies, it's very acid house, lots of vocals, but it doesn't really have the micro samples, trippy noise effects are missing. And also, I think it can be a little bit more jacking. And I think once I get that right, people will be all over it. So I need to do that before this album's going to be finished. And I'll do that in the coming four, five, six months. You mentioned in another interview, lyrically at least, it's pretty political. It's political. Well, the album's called Smell the Coffee. It's political, it's also spiritual, and it's about humans waking up. Wake up to the shit that's going on around you. Wake up to what's going on around the world. Wake up to being controlled. Wake up to poverty. Wake up to so many things. Especially us ravers. We live in a rave bubble. We're stuck. We can't see beyond what's going on on the weekend. They don't care about what's going on in the world. Do you think dance music ever had that? Absolutely. With the shaman, that was what we was all about. And yes, in 88, 89, 90, it was very political and it was very spiritual. Why did it lose it? I think it lost it to the drugs. But saying that, drugs can be very spiritual. And there's always people around that are in... to the spirituality side of dance music, which thankfully, sadly, most of them are into trance, which is a bit of a bummer. You know, the hippies, you know what I mean? So no, I thought for me it's time to, you know, I want to do a vocal album and if I'm going to do a vocal album, I'm going to talk about what I'm into and so I'm going to put the world to rights. Fuck it, why not? And that was why the album's called Smell the Coffee and the titles are like Open Up, The Future, Interaction, Step It Up, Wake Up. smells good, synchronicity, you know, so there's a lot of good titles in there, of tracks. So, and it really covers a broad spectrum from 112 offbeat, 116 deep New York garage, to 126 techno, dark techno with vocals, to old school electro acid. It kind of covers a real broad range of music, but it all sounds like me. It's a real vein running through the whole thing, both with the concept of the lyrics and the music. But it needs to be better. It's not good enough. What other things are you working on? I'm working on a shitload of stuff, actually. I just had a release with Get Physical as the sycophant slags. That's a project I've been doing for the best part of 10 years now with one of my best friends, Adult Napper, from New York. Yeah, Doc Napper and I always have a lot of fun in the studio together. We've got such different energies to each other. What is his energy? He's the lord of darkness. He's the dark lord. And he's super smart. He's one of these people that always regards himself as an underachiever. He's always pushing. He's quite intense character, but full of love. full of knowledge, he's amazing, he's my best friend I think in the world, one of them, and yeah, so it's good to work with that, I'm a piss taker. I also do vocals, so I'm able to do some lyrical content like Poker Flat released a year ago, which was kind of a piss take out of the minimal scene, which was good because it upset loads of minimal people. The whole Sycophant Slags thing is a piss take. The title is a piss take. Yeah, I mean, you know what you're getting into immediately. Yeah, all of the titles of the tracks are piss takes. So we had the latest release, Anti-Sailing, which was on Get Physical, which is why I'm playing for them tonight at Watergate. I've got a new EP that's just about finished that I've done with Appendix Shuffle, a track called Something Strange. He lives in California as well. Yes, he lives in LA, yeah. This track is sick. It's going to be a monster. There's the original Appendix Shuffle mix. I just completed my remix a week and a half ago. Then there's an Adult Napper mix. There's a Mike Shannon mix. there's a Mikael Stravostan mix and there's an Afi Youssef mix as well as mine and Kenneth's mix as well. So it's going to be a nice package, six really good mixes and that'll be out at the end of January, beginning of February. So that's right around the corner. I've also done a couple of like few remix projects. I've done a remix of a track off of a Dalton Apples album with Omid 16B. Really beautiful track that will come out as a single. I've done a remix for Afi Youssef and an edit and added loads of drums to one of his other tracks which will be an EP. I'm actually going to try and shop it because I'm way better connected than Afi. So yeah, I've only sent it to two labels and I'm still waiting to hear back. So if I don't, if I get negatives, then I'll send it to others, but it's deep as shit. Actually, I sent it to Steve, but he said it was too deep. So fair enough. Or maybe I should send it to Dial. That might be the way forward, because they're deep. Do you know what I mean? So yeah, there's that. I want to do some more solo stuff once I've got my own album out of the way. I've started a new project with Afi, Afi and I together as well. We've just done a track called Special Box and it's deep as fuck, like chords, pads, and then like four minutes in, kicks into Acid House. It's nuts. I'll give that a go later on for sure. It all comes back to Acid House at the end of the day. Yeah, man. Acid rocks. That's what it's about. So yeah, that's my musical projects at the moment.
