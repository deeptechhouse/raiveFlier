🎵 Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Aaron Coulthate and I'm the news editor at Resident Advisor. For the past 20 years, James Harrison and Dominic Capello have spent most Saturday nights behind the booth at Sub Club. They started Subculture at the famed Glasgow Night Spot back in 1994, which makes their residency one of the world's longest-running house and techno nights. Both were already ingrained in Glasgow's nightlife before Subculture started. Harrison ran a sub-club residency called Atlantis with slams Stuart McMillan and Ord Michael, while Capello had developed an early passion for electro and breakdancing. When the duo popped by our London office in late December, they were in a jovial mood and it was little surprise. They were at the end of a milestone year that saw them play some of Europe's key nightclubs, as well as celebrate the 20th anniversary of subculture. you Subculture celebrated its 20th anniversary this year. How have you guys gone about celebrating? Getting drunk. That's how we celebrate every Saturday. Every weekend. We celebrated, we had one night on the 20th and then the rest of it's just been kind of flogging out of the toss. This year's been pretty busy for us because I think kind of off the back of doing the, what do you call it, boiler room. We noticed our crowd getting a bit younger and it seemed to get younger and younger throughout the years. And we've also had a really busy year. This year as well, we've been away loads, you know. We've been in Croatia a couple of times, Bitha a couple of times, and guesting here, there and everywhere. If anything, away too often, I would say. I mean, looking at three of the gigs you guys have played this year, in terms of just club shows, there's been... trail, there's been panorama bar, there's been warehouse project. Do you feel like you're at a bit of a career high now in terms of the places you're playing? No, I think we always played places like that, you know, just on and off, but... We were always reluctant to go away on a Saturday, or both of us anyway, and also the club was reluctant to let both of us go away. So it used to be either I would go play Panorama Bar or Harry would go play Trout or whatever. And it was always, you know, but this year it's been more on both of us doing it together and the club have allowed us to do that. So that's been the main difference. But we've always played those places. But generally... Yeah, we always did it separately. Separately. Because the club always liked at least one of us being in the sub-club, just for the stability thing. But this year, obviously, there was too many opportunities in the club. very nicely let us do our own thing yeah let us go away together yeah that's it because very rarely I think until this year we'd never been away together on a Saturday had we no once I think maybe once but it used to be we were only I was allowed away maybe seven 10 Saturdays in a year Yeah You know And this year we've done Was it 8 Was it 8 Saturdays a year Or 6 Saturdays a year We used to That was the whole thing But then we did 7 weeks in a row there Yeah yeah Like Harry says It's too much You know We prefer Coming back to the club But We've done it this year I don't think we'll do as many No All those gigs were great You know what They were all kind of Dynamite gigs But our residency Is pretty special You very rarely get a night that's okay. They're always pretty amazing. And what is it that makes that residency at Sub Club so special? I think it's a mixture of friendly people you know, friendly faces, the staff, the bar staff, the sound, all the people that work there. We all know each other. The people coming down, you know most of them, or you know a lot of them. It's almost like going to your local boozer and seeing your friends, but you get to play the records. I think in bigger places, maybe, I don't know if this is the case, but... You kind of get a sense of, you know, when you come to London, if you go to Fabric or somewhere, yeah, you get to play to good, big, busy clubs, but they don't feel as intimate. I think loads of people in the sub club know each other because it's mainly people from Glasgow. It's not tourists or whatever. So you get that kind of, it's like your local vibe, you know? And having had a residency that's stretched for 20 years, how have you kind of noticed that the crowds change? You've kind of touched on that. You've noticed you're playing to younger crowds this year. It's always the case. Quite often people who came when we first started, you know, come down and go, geez, the crowd's really young tonight. And you go, no, you've just not been for a couple of years. It's always probably been that kind of age group. It's just that when you're there every week, you don't notice it changing. I mean, my children were born when I started doing that, and they both come now. But the time just flies by. When we're there every week, you don't notice it as much. But as Harry says, friends will come down. say the crowd looks a bit younger tonight you ask what is the due when you first come down and they were saying 17, 18 the crowd always has to replenish itself if it doesn't you wouldn't last a weekly night 20 years you know because what happens is people are students they go out every weekend they leave they get their jobs They come down now and again, then they get a mortgage and they enter into grown-up life and they come down now and again. So we always need the younger people coming down who have got that sort of energy that come down every single week and want to party mixed. with the people who have just started getting jobs and then the older crowd and you'll get nights, like maybe a big birthday night or whatever with that whole crowd mixed together and they mix together seamlessly. Yeah, really well. Tell me a bit about what was happening in your own lives when you started that subculture residency in 94. I was at college. I was at the School of Audio Engineering, doing sound engineering. I was still DJing. I was DJing at the subclub for warm-ups and stuff for Atlantis. It was the night that was there before we took over. Harry was still doing Atlantis. I was a resident there for four years before I started doing it with Dom. I did it with the two guys from SLAM, Orton Stewart, Soma, and we did it together weekly for four years, but at the end of that four years, the numbers were starting to go down. We had, like, three and a half years of being really mobbed, and then they started another night round the corner on a Friday. which kind of killed our Saturday vibe a bit. And so the numbers started dropping off and dropping off. And then we got Dom in. We immediately, I mean, I was kind of really quite scared when we started the Saturday that people might not come. But the numbers just went right back up and we were really busy again. I take complete credit for all of that. Dominic, you had a midweek residency at Sub Club first, is that right? I wouldn't call it a residency. I DJ'd, I think it was once a month on a Thursday, we did. And it was with Mike and Paul organised it, who then ended up owning the club. And it was with various people. But I didn't really, I had done bits and bobs, you know, DJed Thursday nights, Wednesday nights, and DJed all over Glasgow. The main thing I did at the time was, it was after parties called Desert Storm. And that's how I met Harry. And that's where Harry first heard me DJing and that's where it kind of, these were the big after parties and special places after the clubs were shut. This one was in a castle, there was ones in Loch Lomond, there was ones in, they would find empty buildings in Glasgow and just roll in electricity and just have these parties. It was brilliant. And that was what I used to do with them all the time and that's where I kind of started to get noticed for doing any of the big DJs who were all playing in the clubs. It was all young guys that were coming through that obviously wouldn't charge them any DJ fees, but you were still DJing to 600 or 700 people, you know, and it was amazing. Pretty much playing until the police came. Were you doing those parties on your own? Well, I was DJing. I was doing it with a guy, Stevie Donaldson, and there was a couple of other DJs for... Desert Storm but it was a guy Keith who got me in he was running Desert Storm but they ended up during the the Balkan War and stuff they went over to the Balkans and took the whole thing with them and DJ'd there and stuff like that for people and for the for villages and stuff like that and then they never really they never did it back in Glasgow after that they all went away their separate ways but we The police killed it. The first couple, the police would maybe take two or three hours to turn up, but then they start looking out for you. In any queues, if people wondered about Glasgow at five in the morning, they're going to get noticed. So it killed it. But at the time when it was going, it was amazing. And what kind of records were you playing at those parties? House, just pure house. House and Techno, just like we would play. When you go to after parties now, it's quite druggy and stuff, but it wasn't. I remember playing things like Richie Rich, Salsa House and Love Dancing, you know, Underground Solution and stuff like that. The whole place was going nuts. And before that, you were playing a lot of blues records. Yeah, yeah. I started playing blues when I was 17 in a bar. It was a guy I worked with. with he DJ'd in there and I used to make tapes up for work he said you've got a big collection of records why don't you come down one night and just have a 20 minute shot and he did a Thursday and I went down took some records and the guy who owned the bar said right you've got the Thursday and he moved my friend to the Friday night and I was 17 I wasn't even allowed to drink in the bar they used to give me lemonade and I was just playing that's how I started playing and what was your It was just, blues was just something, a guy I kicked about with, a guy I hung out with, John, and he had a bit older brother who had an amazing record collection. One night we were in the car on a Friday night and he's got Muddy Waters on and I'm just like, I've never heard anything like this in my life, what is it? And the next day, I just had such a big record collection even at that age and I just thought, I don't want to listen to any of soulful bluesy raw sound and so I went to Virgin and bought three albums and then it just kind of went from there where I just used to buy an album two albums a week and just get obsessed and you were you're a breakdancer too well I wasn't very good but I was I kind of stood at the sides I was more it was again it was a big thing at our school was breakdancing stuff so we all used to do it in the corridors in school and stuff but it was the music I loved you know the music the early electro music all the electro compilations and stuff and all that music coming from America that was the first imports I bought when I was about 14 we used to go to a place in Paisley and buy all these records that were all for America early Cybertron Houdini all that sort of stuff I never bought any from America they were all in the streets and compilations I used to buy the 12 inches that I'm up at that was my first introduction to electronic music And Harry, before you were doing the Atlantis parties with Slam, you were DJing before that as well, if that's alright? Yeah, yeah, I started kind of, I worked in the oil industry in Aberdeen, and I started Mo' Night, but a friend of mine had started a reggae sound system in East School Bride, that would be kind of late, mid to late 70s, and I started Mo' Night in Aberdeen, and then when I moved back to Glasgow... I started Moon Knight and the School Bride. It was a bit of a disaster. Then my brother's friend, Ewan Dale, was a resident at the sub club. The sub club was going at that time. That would have been about 1986 or something. And he was going on holiday and asked me to take his place on holiday. And then they asked me for... for my phone number at the end of the night. And then I ended up just kind of doing it on an occasional basis if somebody was away or whatever for a few years. And then I did different nights for different people. I did a Sunday night in another club around the corner from the sub that got quite busy on a Sunday. And then the sub club... came to myself and the Slam Guys in about 1990 or something and asked us if we wanted to do the Saturday nights which we did fairly unsuccessfully for a few months and then Stuart McMillan of Slam and myself did the Stone Roses gig at Glasgow Green And off the back of that gig, we pulled a massive crowd. From then on, it just stayed really busy. So tell me a bit about that gig. Were you just sort of playing a DJ set before the Stone Roses came on? Yeah, yeah, it was a tent in Glasgow Green. I think it was just after they'd done the Spike Island thing. And in all honesty, Stuart and I didn't know who they were. We were like, who are these guys? Because when we arrived there, there was like massive big queues and we were like, what is going on? Never heard of them. And that's interesting that obviously a lot of people in that crowd picked up on who you guys were. Was it like as instant as the following weekend, the crowd? Yes, it was. It was like that. You know, it was like everybody came after that gig. So we had a big queue. So we went from... really having about 150 to 200 people that had come to other things that we'd done between us to suddenly just getting a... Well, before that, I did a thing called UFO with Stephen Sleepman. in Tin Pan Alley and that was kind of acid house. Is that not with Lars? I did it with Lars Sandberg, you know, Funk The Void, myself and John De Silva from the Hacienda. We were, and Adrian Rennie, we were the residents there. I think I must have done that for about a year. Then the sub club guys came and asked us if we wanted the Saturday night there. And we took it and just, but I think the Stone Roses gig was a kind of catalyst for, you know, getting us busy. And it sounds like there was a couple of really good years there before Slam's Friday night party sort of started to impact on your Saturday nights. Three and a half, I would say, yeah. We would do the queue every Saturday. And do you think they were some of the earliest examples of like the... Glasgow crowd kind of really showing a love and appreciation of like of Good House and I was there every week I was just a partner yeah I was there every week it was amazing but even before the the kind of house thing took off say maybe late 80s or whatever you know and house just got played occasionally You know, it was just part of the night. You know, they'd placed, like, early Detroit stuff, but you'd also still be playing James Brown and things as well, you know. And tell me about the early days of your residency together, of Subculture. You said it got off to a fairly flying start. Yeah. Well, there was three of us initially. There was Oscar Floney, who now lives down here, and a wee plug for Oscar there, who's got a club in, what's it called? Something Market, Broadway Market. No but he He left To come to London How long was Oscar there? A year maybe Yeah Yeah But he got off to a fairly Flying start didn't he? Typical He got off to a flying start Was really busy for the first Six, eight months And then It weaned away For a bit I think it was just when the students went away, typical, you know, in Glasgow when the students go away. You'd get a quiet summer. A quiet summer. And then we were all panicking. And then because it had been so busy, we had hardly, and it's weekly. And then all of a sudden there was loads of other people opening up. monthly nights putting a guest on so four weeks out of the month we'd be up against someone else who's putting someone else a guest on and people would think alright there's a guest on somewhere else we can see Harry and Dom next week or we can see them the following week because we're always there so I think we took you know that kind of killed not killed the crowd but we started using more guests because initially we didn't really did we put a guest on for the first year it was just us for the whole year and then we started it and the first guest was Stacey Pullen and he was only 17 Stacey he came and stayed at my mum's we got him addicted to iron brew that was good but that was our first ever guest I get after that. You know, there's lulls over the 20 years. There's been lulls. Even the lulls are amazing compared to a lot of other things, you know. Doing a weekly night. Going to have the odd quiet night. You know, we had one this year which I was gutted about with Juju and Jordache on live and I was dying to hear them and they were really excited about playing the club and it was just one of those weeks where it was still a bit quiet. still excellent they were brilliant but I don't mind if it's just me and Harry because we're used to it and sometimes those nights are the best nights because People have got a bit more room to dance. It's not as hot and sweaty. And people just kind of let loose a wee bit more. But because it's a guest, they were excited about coming to play. I actually felt bad for them the whole night. But that was the only night I can remember this year. One night. I don't think we've had what we used to consider a quiet night, you know, compared to more recent years, you know, where we're pretty mobbed most every week. When you started flying out US guys, you said Stacey Pullen was the first guest. What were the logistics behind doing that in those days? Kenny Larkin not one of the first. Kenny was second. Kenny could do mix at the time. But we just loved his tunes. They had a brand new record case with all brand new records and we were like, oh no. He's never used these. He's never played these records before. The logistics, we didn't, to be fair, that was Mike and Paul would do all the logistics, you know, get a hold of them. Used to be, most guys when we started, they didn't have agents, we'd just get a hold of them through their record label. you know just phoning up the record office we wanted to book Stacey Pullen and then we got to know Derek May and the guys that worked at Transmat and Stacey came over and then eventually agents managed to get in and that kind of changed the game a bit one of the first agents was a guy what's his name Eddie Richards Dynamics Dynamics he did all the American DJs but we the title of our first guest was Stacey Pullen Kenny Larkin Alton Miller Eric Rugg yeah and that was some of our first guests but we'd maybe have a guest on once every six weeks then we took it down to once a month yeah and then we kind of did a couple of months because I remember old flyers that we had where we started doing like Ashley Beedle and putting on quite a lot you know in terms of the US got us could have been the first time they were coming out apply in the UK it was yeah a lot of them the first time Moody Man played I think in the UK played with us again it was only that was a quiet night it was between Christmas and New Year no one had really heard of him and he came down he was brilliant and then the second time he played there was like a cure on the block you know it was just like Stacey we were always busy at that time when Stacey played so that didn't matter but a lot of guys we broke maybe too early you know some guys nobody Offhand I can't think in my head But there was a few I remember a few guys That were That became massive now That we put them on And no one had heard of them And there was maybe 150 DJs in Yeah And it was all Trainspotters Francois Kevorkian That wasn't us That put that on It was like 40 people To see him or something 40 people to see Francois Kevorkian On a Sunday in the suburb Yeah And what year was that? Early 90s Yeah It was Kevin Mack success rate in terms of the parties you were throwing but it wasn't these things weren't guaranteed and maybe there wasn't enough we never put on guests really to pull punters we put them on because we wanted to hear them yeah basically because we liked them it was nothing to do with oh will they pull no you know pretty naive I know when you think about it now sometimes you go oh we could put on so and so but Everybody's just going to go, who's that? Whereas then we didn't really care. We just thought, this person is amazing. They'll be really good. As the 90s developed, how did the Glaswegian party scene develop? It was funny It changed House music became a bad word Almost for a while in Glasgow When Jungle came in I remember still laughing At a lot of these Muppets The Jungle house DJs Who sold their house records So they could buy Jungle records And this was the future As soon as I heard Jungle On a tampon advert I knew it was fucked Do you know what I mean? Techno as well I mean When we started doing the Saturdays Glasgow was becoming Techno City Aye aye I think the Slam guys were up About 146 beats minute or something at that point you know what I mean it was like you'd go on and at plus eight you couldn't mix in your first record because everything got so fast didn't it and we weren't really like that we've always kind of been 120 I mean when we were going mental we'd be up at 126 28 what we thought was techno is probably still regarded as house but things like one atkins and stuff we'd still play all that sort of detroit stuff but it's not fast, you know? It's soulful, it's funky. So that was the stuff we would play. But as I say, a lot of Jungle guys, a lot of younger guys were coming into the record shops and they weren't buying house music anymore. And we were still playing house and they were thinking, why? You know, they'd kind of fallen in love with house. But like everything, there would be two choices, whether to stop playing house or just stick with your guns. And we just stuck the whole thing came back around again and then you had like the prescription guidance set up music, Derek Carter, all these sort of guys, Matt Farina, Sound Control, all that sort of music started coming out. Kind of revitalised a lot of the, you know, the house scene in Glasgow. And when did you guys first start to get gigs outside of Glasgow or outside of Scotland? I had a residency in London from about, I don't know what year I started it, 91, 92. I think I started... No. When did Plastic People start? Started in Oxford Street. 96, 95, 96. Was it? Maybe, no, because I did the Millennium there. So it would have been there, but I was seven years or something, I think I was there. Was that with Kenny Hawks? Yeah, I did it with Kenny. And how did that come about? Weirdly, a guy that we knew from Glasgow, Tim Barr, was editor of a magazine called Generator. And he put me in the front cover of it. And off the back of that, this guy phoned me and I actually thought it was a wind-up. I thought someone was winding me up, you know, offering me this gig in London, da-da-da. And I was, who is this? Do you know what I mean? I thought it was like a prank phone call. And then it came to be I went down and then he said, do you want to come back and do this monthly? And I was like, yeah, cool. So I did. And he was putting me on with Mrs. Woods and people like that, guests that were like really the opposite end of the musical spectrum. And I was thinking, this is a bit bonkers. And then one week he put me on with Kenny and I was like that. It just turned out that was a really good week. they get a good write-up and time out or whatever. So I said, I think we should just stick with us, which is what he did, and we ended up doing it together for years. And it was a monthly, and which night were you going down? Fridays, Fridays of Fire in Oxford Street. No, it wasn't a monthly, it was a weekly. It moved to weekly after that? Well, I did it monthly for maybe about six months. And then it went weekly. And so I'd fly down on a Friday night and fly back on a Saturday afternoon. And did you develop a crowd there that were coming every week? Yeah, it was really good. It was a tiny club, but you got a really good vibe. And I'm still in touch with loads of the people that used to come to that club as well. Yeah, it was really good. And also I had a record that was a kind of minor hit round about then as well. And off the back of you know and at this point were you guys traveling together to to play gigs or that was that was obviously separately yeah we always always said always separately harry people that like to have music we've different musical styles although they complement each other when we play but we have a different style so some people wanted harry's thing and other people would want my thing and they would book us separately and we played different clubs and was there a point when you started to find yourself becoming more professional in that you were treating DJing as your job, your full time? I think at that time we were, mid 90s we were and then we were travelling. It's all I've done since 1990 it's the only job I've had, it's all done It was pretty much I was 24 when I became resident of the sub club and I was professional since then we were travelling and stuff and then I had a kid when was that? 2000 No, I had 2,000 and I stopped travelling as much because I just hated being away from my kid. When I was not in back loads of away gigs, eventually people just stopped asking. And I would maybe do the one or two. I used to do the food club in Leuven, which I loved doing. I used to do that quite a lot and that was probably one of the only gigs I would... got away for, maybe that and basics and stuff like that, a couple of English things, but generally I stopped travelling, because just every time I was away, it was just brutal, my daughter would be in bits and stuff, now she doesn't even notice I'm gone, so travelling again, you know, it's great. When was Jasper born? My son was born a year... that we would have, oh no, the year started slam, 1990. But yeah, I kind of went away. I look at old diaries I've still got and I was away loads to places like Forfar, Aberdeen, you know what I mean, Manchester, places all over really. I kind of amazed at how much I was actually doing when I look at it now because at the time it didn't necessarily feel like it. And what kind of changes have you seen the sub club go through down the years? It's more professional now. Yeah, it is. It's probably, yeah, more professional. It used to be, we were all kind of a bit naive and sometimes, you know, you'd be hunting, trying to find a decent needle for the deck and stuff. No, they'd have a jar of old broken needles in the office. So if one needle went, they gave you old broken ones. Try this one. Try this one. I I have things like that but it's just what they actually think about it now you know now we've got a sound guy and it's like very professional and everything but 20 years ago it was kind of just bring your records in and try not to spill beer on the decks pretty much And have there been a lot of behind the scenes changes in those? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, well, obviously we've got Sound Guy and Sean in, we used to have someone doing the lights and stuff, and obviously just even the bar staff and stuff, you know, in the sub club you used to, you'd be lucky if you managed to get a cold beer 20 years ago. That's right, yeah. Me and Harry used to have to get pint glasses with ice because the fridges were rubbish and just, just that Everything was spent on the sound, you know, and just getting people in. And now the sub club, you're not waiting too long for a drink. The drinks are cold. Everything's run perfectly behind the bar. Everything's run perfectly up the stairs at the door. The sound's bang on. The only people who can make a message is usually me and Harry. I wanted to ask you about the licensing laws in Scotland mean that if it's just you guys playing on any given night, you're playing four-hour sets. Is that right? Yeah. Well, we play two hours each, yeah. We always usually do an hour about. We do hours about. So it's 11 till 3, but it just depends who's starting. It's created a certain style of DJing because it's more dynamic, more intense. When you hear other guys coming, they maybe spend an hour and a half trying to get what they're saying and they're set. Whereas we pretty much need to do it instantly because you've got such a short night. So you're more or less instantly going into a peak time scenario. No. Not peak time But even just the way You play your deeper stuff No link records You know Everything has to be good Every track has to be good You can't spend four minutes On some beats And a couple of sound effects That I'll hear a lot of DJs do Just so they go From one record to another You used to talk about Mixing tunes Oh yeah That's a good mixing tune You know what I mean So it would just be A kind of breathing space Tune Because with a shorter night, I mean, in 1990, Glasgow had the European City of Culture or something and had a five o'clock license. So there was that thing where you could do that. You could take your time. You could take your time on a night, whereas with a three o'clock license, it's just a different dynamic. You know, really, you want the dance floor by midnight. You'll warm up until then and keep it. But you want people on the dance floor by 12. Usually, I mean, I don't play beats sometimes till... quarter past, 20 past, half past 11, so people come in, there'll be soundtrack here, there'll be a solo, and Harry will play old solo reggae and stuff. So it's not you come in and it's like going, it's not like that. The volume, we keep the volume down, so people come in, they're chatting, and you can just feel the energy building, the sounds building as the tempo builds, as the beats start to come in, and it kind of coaxes people onto the And that's the difference. What would you be looking for in records that you'd be like, yeah, this is going to work for sub? For a peak time? Yeah, in terms of the house records you're buying. I think I always just try and buy records I like and then try and put them in a way that will be translated to people that have never heard it before. I think that's, I never listen and go, oh, that's going to rock and dance for it because... sometimes that doesn't work you know you think that track's amazing I'm going to play that and you play it and maybe the position I've played it or the time I've played it it doesn't quite work as well as you thought and then there's surprises there's tracks you've listened to them in the house and you think it's pretty good I'll play it tonight you play it and it just comes alive in the club and the whole place goes nuts So there's always a surprise. All you can do is just buy what you like, buy records that you like, think they're good, and then just play them in a way that other people can relate to. I mean, we probably both do the same thing as well. You know, there's certain records that you'll buy and almost in your mind you go, that'll be good at this time. This is that time of night record. You know, that's last hour sort of record. That's, you know what I That's the kind of crossover record, just from warm-up. You almost slot them in your own mind into what time of the night they'll sound good at. And if you're not doing that set that week, it can be frustrating because you've got a great... You don't get to play it. You don't get to play it. Yeah. And how did you find that, you know, from playing together every Saturday night, how did you find that your DJing style as a duo developed? Again, you don't think about it. It's just natural. I think it was just like Harry's doing one thing and it's been going well. I will link onto that for a couple of tracks then try and take it in another way. And if Harry's really been banging it out, I'll maybe soften it up for a bit and then go another way and vice versa. I think you just kind of feed off each other. You don't want to do it. You're kind of gauging the night from the dance what's happening by the way that the other person is playing. You know what I mean? You get a sense of how it's going and then you're maybe there for the last 15 minutes of someone's set or maybe you're there the whole time but you're talking and keeping an eye on things. And you're watching and listening. And you're trying to compliment. You don't want to come off someone and go... bang, this is a big change. You want to kind of glide off someone else and into your own thing. And you don't want to do the exact same thing they've just done, you know, which just sounds boring again. So, but you're thinking, I would like to hear maybe a, I'd like to hear a really good techno track just now, and Harry's playing a really housey set, and then I'll go on in a couple of tracks later, I'll play a big set of house techno track. other times you're thinking I want to bring it down now when Harry's come off you know and bring it down for a bit so you're just constantly thinking people my friends are you know used to it but they stand trying to chat to you in the club and you're kind of one ear listening to them one ear watching you know listening to Harry and watching the crowd so you're kind of not really listening to people and you're just always feeling what you can do when you go on you're just feeling it the whole time you're just thinking You don't really switch off from it while you're in there. Have you found the longer you guys played together that you were making better selections in terms of the records you were pulling out? No, I think... I've always done it. It kind of seemed to come fairly natural. I think it just came from the very beginning. And I think if you've got half a brain and you can DJ, then you can always feed off another DJ. You know, some guys will go, and I just want to do my thing. And I could understand that in some ways, you know, just want to do their thing. It doesn't matter what's gone before. It doesn't matter what's coming after. They do their own particular thing. But we, it's more a team than, you know, than just the individual, you know. It's like tonight we're doing the dance tunnels with Optimo. But because we played with those guys so many times, we can just do three records about all night and then... as it gets nearer then we'll go two records about one record about but because we've all known and been to each other's nights so often it's effortless and it's actually it's enjoyable because it's a challenge it's exciting you never know what they're going to get left with because you don't know how they're going to leave you but you've got to make the night complete it's not about you making a wee statement in the middle of someone else it's about the night it's about making the night work rather than Ego. And how much did you find that you were going to play other parties, going to other cities and seeing residencies, seeing DJs who were residents and picking up little bits that you would take back with you? I think you do that all the time. We put on guests and sometimes... Everybody you see kind of gets something from it, but it's more like you absorb it. You're not consciously, oh, I'm going to do this. But you're often surprised at the way other people do things, like Sprinkles played for us a couple of weeks ago, and we were both like, that is amazing, because he played so good and so deep for so long that probably we wouldn't have... have done that we would have gone right we're hitting two o'clock here yeah we need to take up a gear but he didn't but it worked brilliantly and so you you kind of get stuff from different people all the time It makes you realise that just because we do it one way doesn't, and it works that way. There's a hundred ways to skin a cat, you know what I mean? Yeah. But as for listening to other residents and stuff when you're away, it's actually quite, the guys at the food club were always good. That was Roel Benmans and Jafla, who's now Mugwump, I think. Yeah, yeah. They were like, probably too, they did a proper warm-up for you But you go a lot of places and the residents are just like, young guys and they're just trying to play all their big tunes before you go on as loudly as possible. So it's kind of... They don't necessarily do a warm-up. They don't, no. You're like, what are you doing? There's four people at the bar and you're playing... Catch me on the... You're like, get a grip, mate. Why do you feel like a residency or why, you know, residents at clubs I think they're important because we do it. I think it's important. I think it's different in Glasgow where we're allowed to build. It's like Harry says, there's not a lot of tourists. It's not a massive city. So you come to the sub club, you come in there because you want to be there. It's not like you've walked by it. in the middle of the town centre where you don't get random people just coming in off the street or that's a nightclub. So we get to do our own thing. The management gives us breathing space to do that. They don't force us into trying to do something that other people are doing. So we've been allowed. to just do our own thing. And luckily enough for us, over 20 years, people seem to have found we like that. Do you know, it's almost like a restaurant or something that you have a set kind of menu and we know the dishes that people sort of like or something and people come because you're guaranteed a certain thing there. You know, that type of a thing. And how much do you find that your sets differ from one week to the next? They differ all the time because you might be playing with guests, the records that you happen to have bought that week, you know, remind you of old. an old, like you were saying, new groove thing or something. So you go, oh shit, I forgot about this record or that record. New stuff reminds you of old stuff and so it kind of influences where you go and also you might be playing with someone that's more banging. So you think, how do you give them a half decent platform so that you're not trying to steal their thunder? You're just trying to take it to a point where they can come on and do their own thing. And every week, again it boring because you do play every week there's certain records that you really like and you want to play them most weeks there's maybe three records each of us have got we've probably played five times over the last six weeks but it's very rare and you buy so much music so you want to try and because we don't get a big set time some weeks I'll go down Harry's playing like a disco more disco sort of stuff some weeks you go down Harry's playing more acid house both of us will change it you've got such a massive amount of music to play in such a short space of time every night that every week is different I mean you can come down one week and love it and it's maybe more your thing and we were playing really banging and you think it's going to be like that the following week it won't it can be completely different it can be completely different you know we just for our own sanity it changes but there's still there's still some semblance of you know a sound that's there that's always there but we can branch off that severely or less severely depending on each week How would a perfect night for you guys at the sub club unfold from the start to the finish? I think the 20th birthday party we did in April was pretty much like that. He started off, did I start? I think I started and it was like starting off with a Tangerine Dream building up into like James Brown, some soul funk. hip-hoppy stuff and then things like Not My Dream Bell and just older stuff because it was a 20th night so just deeper house and then just from 11 to half 11 people are just coming in as I say they're coming in the excitement you can hear it big queue people are buying their drinks they're chatting to each other they're all catching up so you keep the music low and it's just throbbing away in the background and it just gradually builds as the club gets busier take the volume up and every now and again during the break I track take the volume up a wee bit and things are just building so subconsciously the club's just getting busier the music's getting louder it's getting more intense and it's starting to pick up speed that'll peak about two o'clock and then two o'clock the whole place is you know that's everybody's in that's going to be in the place is going it's hot sweaty and then from two to three it can go one of two ways you can take it it for a bit and then some party tunes you know some old classics at the end with some old disco and stuff like that and then everybody leaving singing songs and being happy and can't wait for the following week I think that would be pretty much What are the downsides of having had such a long running weekly residency? I don't know Harry's bad jokes he repeats them You like them There's always new people though because the crowd's changing you can reuse you can recycle your jokes I don't think there is many downsides We've been travelling so much recently we go we've got the best job in the world. I wouldn't want to be Dixon jumping about here, there, or Keith and Johnny Optimal guys. You're just like, that is a job you're doing. We're actually doing something that is really cool and we get to do what we want. We don't have to... None of theirs isn't cool, but what Harry means is that it's too much of a hard work what they do. They're all travelling five countries in a week and stuff. We, 15 minutes my mates are there the beer's cold the music's good the sound system's good wake up on a Sunday quite happy you know what a night everyone's a winner get tired of that And do you find that it's ever like playing together so often that it puts strains on your friendship in any way or it's always been like you've just had this right dynamic behind the booth? I think, don't get me wrong, we do each other's heads in now and again, but it's like a married couple, you know, it doesn't mean you don't love each other. No, I couldn't think of anybody. It's kind of like that, but you just think, who else could do that? Who about your productions you've both sort of dabbled in productions but I'm sort of interested you guys haven't released a collaborative record before you've just been on your own is that right? Yeah well we tried to do some stuff with Graham from The Revenge and the tracks were sounding really good but then Graham's been busy he's becoming a father he's become a dad and so that's kind of been put in the back burner I do tracks with another guy but because we stay in different parts of the city as well, so Harry's in the west and I'm in the south, so Harry will make music with guys that have got studios over that side and I'm with guys that are close to my home sort of thing. I've got a studio just round the corner and I make stuff with a guy called Lee. We just put something out on Don't Be Afraid. a couple of months ago and we've got other stuff coming up and Harry's working with the guys from Meodora and stuff aren't you Rob from Meodora I started doing stuff with and I do stuff with Graham and the Revenge so we always do stuff you know with other people but we did we went in for a couple of weeks and we did stuff we got some ok stuff yeah we were just doing looping stuff up with 909 using the 909 as an external trigger and doing like samples and stuff and it was really good He's been walking with Sister Sledge as well as us. Yeah. So he's been a bit busy for us. Dominic, your seventh sign label put out some really interesting records from the US, House Guys. Is it still... up and running? It's still up and running. We only put one track out this year, mainly because I've been so busy. Again, I've been getting sent tracks, but I've just not liked any of them. So I only liked one thing, or one EP worth of stuff that I get sent this year. So I'm not putting stuff out if I don't like it. So we put a thing out with Brad Peterson, who's had stuff out in Moods and Grooves and stuff like that in Detroit are putting vinyl out again it's been a nightmare at the pressing plant as I'm sure a few independents have found so it just went out a couple of weeks ago but I'm happy with it we've got a great distributor Clone who don't hassle us although we've only put one record out this year but our record sales have been amazing over the years I didn't realise because I very rarely speak to anyone who has a record label but we were averaging a couple of thousand vinyl which is apparently pretty good this one I don't know how it's doing but it's really deep Larry Heard style house track you know it's beautiful proper deep house but that's that and hopefully some more people send me some good music and I can put some stuff out next year and you guys have done three mix CDs three official mix CDs yeah one I wanted to ask you about was the 20 years underground mix for Soma in 2008 what was the what was the reaction to that at the time you just do things in the moment really I don't really overanalyse or think I can't even remember that's when Graham was in Newton Place I was living in Spain at the time it was one of those ones it was damn tricky but we just put together a list we sent each other an email of tunes we crossed off the ones that we'd both you know thought of and then we just got a pile of them all together and put the mix together it was pretty much as simple as that wasn't it you know just get records you Did you find that at the time, like the release of that, created a discernible boost in bookings? No, no. No, not at all. Even though it was really good. Do you know, it's just like you coast through it. We've both had moderately successful records and successful records and it just comes and goes. And I think when you're doing it a long time, you don't really get too excited about, oh, this could mean this. And we don't want that anyway. It's not like I'm doing this so I can get loads of gigs. We do it because we like the music. We put it together. and we get a chance to put tracks on it, you know, that we like. That was pretty much why we did it. We didn't do it for money. We didn't do it so we could get gigs. We just did it because... That's what we do. You've done loads of things that people go, oh, that's amazing. You've done an RA mix. You've done this. You've done whatever. That'll be good. And you kind of go, yeah, it might be. I don't know. It's just things just come and go. Who reads yesterday's papers? And Harry, last year you were joined behind the booth by your son, Jasper. Yeah. What was that like? Oh, I think he was... been there way before that was he not two years ago maybe maybe Three years ago? Yeah, it was really cool. No, three. I think the first time Jasper played at a club. Well, easy because I was just saying to Dominic the way he was here, it was really weird. He was touring the States with Jackmaster and he said, come over to the house, I've just bought loads of stuff because for years he's just been nicking my records. And so I went over and I was saying to Dominic, it was amazing the stuff that he'd bought. More than 50, 60 or more percent of it was stuff that I'd bought as well. So I think he must have just absorbed. And also he's been coming to the sub since. 17 or whatever or 18 and he was there I think he said he went like two years or something without missing a Saturday you know so he's been there all the time so when he gets really busy I reckon we should get some of his wages totally but you know quite often we'd go to the pub at night or Graham the Revenge had his studio in my house for a wee while as well and we'd just stay up late at night and just play records back to back so we've been doing this for years years it's kind of effortless And you think he's got a bright future in front of him in terms of DJing? I would hope so. You can never. I mean, there's so many amazing... We know a lot of guys that have been big at times and now they're back doing their day jobs or whatever again. So realistically, fingers crossed, yes. It's such a fickle business. It was never a career option when we started. Now it is. Now it's a strategy and a plan and whatever, whereas we're at... pretty unstrategic and unplanned. It just kind of happened. But you found that that's kind of worked out for you? It's worked out okay for us and I hope it works out for Jasper. He said in an interview that I read that he aspires to be a resident at Subculture. Could you see that ever happening? One of those days. One of those days, maybe. I know. Join the queue. I know. Everybody's asked for that job. And how long do you guys see yourself? Like you said, it's now a career option for people and you started. in this game well before that was something that people thought about too deeply how long can you see you guys keeping on DJing sometimes you get the fear and you think god what if something happened like at one point there was a fire in the building next door to us and water damaged the sub club, our venue, and all of a sudden you went from, oh God, what are we going to do now? Luckily, we operated at different venues for what, five years? I thought, yeah, something like that. Was it as many as that? When was that? That was just after a millennium. We only get back in, what? 10, 12 years ago maybe. You know, and so we operated our nights, you know, it was ourselves and Optimal were the main nights at that time and we just operated from different venues for about five years till we get back into Jamaica Street again. Sometimes you get the fear and you think, what if, what if something like that happened or the people decided to sell it to a company that didn't like it. I've been through about five or six different owners. of the club but I don't know you just deal with it as and when it happens I don't see why you can't DJ it's not as if you know The only thing you need to worry about is your ears. You know, your ears going. That would be pretty much it. We've always had a pretty consistent taste in music and trying to reflect what's new and current of the time with what we feel from the past is relevant to what's happening now. And it's just something that we've always just done. It's just been second nature. Yeah, but you don't know. None of us know what the future holds in store. Well, well, well. Well, well, well. Oh my god, you ain't moving, you ain't moving, you ain't dancing, girl. You ain't dead. You ain't dead. You ain't dead. you
