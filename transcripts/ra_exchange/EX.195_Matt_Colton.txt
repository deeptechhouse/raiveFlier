♪♪♪ Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothwein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Mastering, where the finishing touches are put on music. before it heads off to manufacturing and then into record shops is always a bit of a dark art. But there are a handful of practitioners who manage to achieve some level of fame for it regardless. Matt Colton is one of them. After art school and a stint in radio, he found himself in a mastering apprenticeship in London and soon realized he'd found his calling. Though he, like most mastering engineers, works across genres, he's become a byword for wonderful sound and fantastic vinyl cuts in dance and electronic music worlds this longtime fan of the genres is happy to inhabit. I sat down with Matt at Alchemy Mastering, the West London studio he co-owns, for a chat that shed light on his field. *outro music* you Your career in mastering starts in about 1997, but I'm curious sort of about what led up to that. I mean, when did mastering sort of first get on your radar? Well, I started working in 1995 at the age of 19. I'd done a year at art college prior to that. which I kind of didn't really harbour major desires to be an artist. I kind of more wanted to start a band and become a successful musician and I thought art college might be a cool place to meet those kind of people and I loved art. kind of creating stuff and that kind of thing but anyway so I did like a year's foundation course at art college and I think the final nail in the coffin of my potential art career was when my tutor at the end of the year when I said to him you know he was he was kind of like you know you should go to Central Saint Martins and do a you know do a do a degree in fine art and that kind of thing You know, I said, if I do that, you know, what am I going to be at the end of it? And he said, you'll probably be an art teacher like me. And I thought, yeah, thanks. But, you know, that didn't really appeal. So I kind of bummed around for about six months. And then I ended up getting, I mean, now it would kind of be called an internship, I suppose. Back then it was... I think it was called the Youth Training Scheme, YTS, which was basically a position in a radio station whereby they kind of paid my travel and, you know, gave me enough money to buy a sandwich every day kind of thing. And I started there. And basically I was taken on. It seemed bizarre at the time, but I was taken on to write radio commercials in the commercial production department. of this radio station in Somerset, which is where I'm from in the southwest of England. And I think really after about three months, it became apparent that I probably didn't have enough life experience to write radio commercials. And you're talking about actually putting the script together for these things. Yeah, yeah. So, you know, they asked me to write, you know. the garden center is having a sale on lawnmowers you need to write a 30 second script for it i was 19 i didn't own a lawn i had no interest in getting a fucking lawnmower so i sort of struggled with that but we also made the commercials in-house and instantly you know i'd been i'd been playing in bands from the age of kind of about 11 years old and um You know, from the age of about, I guess about 15, you know, me and a couple of mates were programming. We had, you know, computers like Amigas and Ataris and that kind of thing and like really, really basic MIDI synths. And, you know, we do kind of programming and make tracks that way. So, you know, I was really interested in kind of technology side of recording. or making radio commercials wasn't exactly, you know, maybe exactly what I wanted to do. But even so, you know, there was a studio, it had microphones, it had three tape machines in it, it had compressors and EQs and it had a desk. And so I kind of, I sort of started to weedle my way into actually making the commercials instead of writing them. And that sort of became my role. in the radio station. You know, I was the guy that made all the commercials, made all the jingles, you know, recorded all the voiceovers and that kind of thing. And, you know, I got into other sort of stuff about, you know, when there was an outside broadcast, I'd be, you know, the presenter would be off at wherever, Shepton Mallet, Sheep Fair or whatever it was, you know, and I'd be in the studio pressing all the buttons kind of thing. And then I got my own show and, you know, I had a show for a year on the radio station. And we got, so I was there for two years. So sort of after I'd been there for about a year, we got an audio editor workstation. We got Sadi, I mean, it's possibly even Sadi version one. It might have been like the first version and version two, 2.0 or whatever. I can't remember now, but it was, you know, a basic hard disk recording system, which was absolutely amazing because. you know, all of a sudden you could like automate the level of the music bed behind the voiceover. I'd mixed all my commercials and all the trailers and everything. You'd mix them all live. So if you had two pieces of music, three voiceovers and, say, five sound effects all to get in in the right place in 30 seconds, you'd mix it on the fly. You'd fire stuff in off different playback mediums and you'd have to do it all. And if you messed up, if the last sound effect was in the wrong place, then you just rewound the tape and started again. Yes, all of this stuff that we take for granted now, the computers are so integrated into the process. I think it's hard to really picture how big of a game changer that must have been. It was amazing. It literally blew my mind and everyone else at the radio station. And all of a sudden, just like the kind of standard, just the quality of the work that we were doing in the commercial production department kind of leapt. exponentially and we could just be so much more creative. You know, so that was really cool. But in the meantime, anyway, so this was between the ages of 19 and 21. And I met a guy. So I had a show on Saturday nights and there was another guy who I knew worked in London during the week and he had a show on Sundays. You know, he used to he lived in Devon in the southwest of England, sort of at the weekends. And he was I guess he's probably about 10 years older than me, maybe just under that. You know, so we were kind of, you know, we'd like go out and have beers and that kind of thing. And he was a really cool guy. And we went down the pub one time, you know, one weekend, like before my show or after his show or something, I can't remember what. And, you know, he got a phone call on his mobile phone. And at that point, it was pretty cool to have a mobile phone, to be honest. You know, it was probably the size of a suitcase. But, you know, he kind of took the call and, you know, it was a bit like... Okay, so you two want to book me for two weeks in June. I'm on holiday then. Can you see if they'll wait and we'll do it at the beginning of July? He finished up the call and I was like... the fuck do you do for a living you've just said that you two have to wait because you're on holiday and you know you'll work with them when you get back and don't get me wrong i'm not like the world's biggest u2 fan but in 1995 they probably were the biggest band in the world you know what i mean that was um you know and for a kind of 19 20 year old kid from somerset this was like fairly mind-blowing so He said, well, I'm what's called a mastering engineer. You know, I do mastering, which I'd never heard of, you know. Before the internet, mastering wasn't really that widely known, I don't think. And even after the internet, people know that it exists, but probably not exactly what it is. Well, exactly, yeah. But back then, I'd made demos, I'd been in recording studios, I'd done recording, and it didn't even cross my mind that what you took out of the recording studio wasn't finished, do you know what I mean? So even back then I had no idea. But anyway, so he kind of explained to me what mastering is or was or whatever. And, you know, he was kind enough to say, why don't you take a day off work and just come and hang out in my studio in London for, you know, a couple of hours and you can just kind of see what we do. So I took him up on the opportunity and sat in his lovely mastering studio in London with the biggest pair of speakers I'd ever seen and all sorts of esoteric... you know, looking equipment, vinyl cutting lathe and, you know, big desk, lots of buttons and lights and, you know, knobs and just kind of banging techno records coming out of the speakers the whole time. And, you know, I was just totally in awe and it just thought this, you know, I can't believe that this guy gets... paid to sit here and listen to this music and you know have all this you know, all this gear to play with and stuff. I just thought it was the coolest thing. So you got it right away. Like the concept as he explained it to you. And then when you, when you sort of went to the studio and saw it. No, no, no, I had absolutely no idea. Well, got it as in, as in like, uh, it made sense, like this stage in the recording process, like kind of intellectually made sense to you. Uh, well, yeah, I mean, It's probably difficult for me to fully remember exactly what I thought about it. But yeah, I mean, you know, essentially the concept of, you know, everything needs to be collated into one master recording that is then sent to the factory. And then all the copies that go to the shops are made from that one master disc. You know, if it's a vinyl record or... you know, master tape as it was back then if it was a CD release. Yeah, you know, that kind of all made sense. I'd just not thought about it, you know, it just hadn't, I had no awareness of it. So, well, just to take it back a step, you know, my old man had said to me, you know, when I was kind of on the dole and sort of scratching around and bumming around and, you know, a little bit sort of aimless in life he said to me, you know, you're going to be working for a long period of time. You know, you're probably going to be working until you're 65, 70 years old, you know, maybe even more. Who knows what's going to happen in the future? You know, it's the vast majority of your life is going to be spent at work. And it would be great to be rich, but it's a lot more important to be happy. So you're better off finding something that you love to do because you're going to be spending most of your life doing it. If you get rich doing it, then, you know, that's double bubble. You know, you sort of win. always. But anyway, I kind of, you know, it was, it was sort of really at this point, you know, having seen, you know, my friend's mastering studio, you know, I knew that I wanted to work in music and this seemed like, you know, I wasn't going to make it as, you know, there'd been times when I'd hoped to be like a professional drummer and that kind of. thing and you know I kind of realized that I probably wasn't going to make it as a musician but clearly there were other kind of avenues that I could work in music and I could get all those kind of things for myself in terms of enjoyment and being kind of a part of the music industry you know without necessarily having to be the star up on the stage do you know what I mean So, yeah, so I asked my friend, you know, I was like, well, OK, great. That's it. I want to be a mastering engineer. Thank you. How do I go about it? Like, where do I get these jobs? And, you know, he was like, to be honest, there aren't any jobs going. You know, it's virtually impossible to get into. I don't know kind of how you would. go about it maybe look in the back of the music week magazine which is like a weekly industry paper you know and see if um see if anything comes up and you know i was still working at the radio station at the time we got music week every week which was great So the next, you know, the next copy came in, I sought it out, looked in the back in the sort of classified section and lo and behold, you know, trainee mastering engineer position available right to this PO box number. So, you know, I kind of sent all my stuff through and, you know, and sort of ended up getting the job basically, which was at... studio called Porky's Mastering in Soho in London. And yeah, so I kind of, I started there at the age of 21, you know, moved from... Somerset up to London and yeah, just started, which was fantastic. I was a 21 year old, working in the center of Soho, so much going on, massive kind of culture shock and eye opener and yeah, started work. Tell me about that traineeship. I mean, where do you begin? What's the first step in learning? how to master well i mean i guess it kind of it's different depending on who sort of teaches you and and it would be different now from how it was then but where i started at that point in time porky's consisted of one main studio which was shared by the owner and another engineer called paul and in that room they did cd and vinyl work And then they had two sort of ancillary rooms, which were CD only. And there were two engineers who operated those two rooms. And I was taken on by the two guys effectively doing the CD work because they wanted a sort of extra pair of hands. And, you know, I mean, initially, obviously, it's a lot of making tea and watching. And listening as well. Well, and listening. Yeah, exactly. You know, seeing what people are doing. And, you know, I think one of the advantages that I had was they used a system called Sonic Solutions in the main room, which I knew nothing about at all. But in the two CD rooms back then, they actually... They'd just started to use Sadi. And so I kind of came in and to a certain extent, I probably knew more about Sadi than anyone else in the company. The way I had applied it in my previous career was different from how you apply it as a CD mastering engineer. But in terms of, you know, generally knowing my way around it and, you know, how quick I was using it. I was probably, you know, in fact, usually people would ask me questions about it. Do you know what I mean? You know, even though I was essentially the tea boy. So, you know, that probably helped. But yeah, I mean, there was just a hell of a lot of just kind of, you know, sitting and watching and listening. You know, I'd used EQs and compressors before. you know, went in the radio station. So I kind of knew, I knew what an EQ did. I knew what a compressor did. You know, I don't think I was very expert in using either of them, but, you know, I kind of knew in theory, if you want to make something more bassy, you add some more bass with the EQ and that kind of thing. But, you know, I remember speaking to Paul Solomons, who was the kind of like the main engineer there and a guy who sort of taught me most of what I know, I would say. And, you know, I remember saying to him at one point, OK, I get. like how we change things. Like, you know, I've watched you and, you know, you say like you put a track on and you're like, okay, we just need to tighten up the bottom end and just, you know, maybe get a bit more presence out of it. Like, and I understand, you know, roughly like how you're doing that. What I don't understand is how you know that you need to do that. He was like, well, it's simple, you know, put the tape on And then if I think it needs more bass, I'll put more bass. How do you know? Like, how do you know that you think it needs more bass? Like, this is the thing that I'm struggling to get. And he was like, well, look, I've listened to a lot of records. The more records you listen to, the more obvious it becomes to you. But there's no shortcut to that. You know, there's no like. All you can do is just keep listening and keep listening and keep listening and keep listening. And the more you do, the better you get at it. I would imagine a lot of people would walk into a room like this one and immediately kind of look at all these different knobs and all these different boxes. And the first thought they would have is that's the hardest part about this job. But maybe not understanding that just being able to hear things a certain way and being able to translate that. into work that you do with these boxes and ways that you twiddle the knobs is maybe actually the hardest part, the part that takes the longest. Absolutely, yeah, yeah. And in fact, speaking to Paul Sullivan's the guy, I mean, speaking about who I worked with at Porky's, who taught me a lot. We were talking a couple of years ago and I was saying to him, you know, I do some lecturing now and that kind of thing. You know, not very often, but every now and then I'll do a talk or something. And he was saying he lives in Bangkok, or certainly did at the time. He was saying he'd been approached by a school in Bangkok to see if he would be the sort of mastering lecturer at their university or whatever it was. And he turned it down and I said, well, that's such a shame because you taught me so much and you have so much knowledge. I think you'd be really good at it. And he said, the problem with trying to teach mastering is there actually isn't a massive amount of technique. You know, there is some technique, don't get me wrong. It's mostly about the listening and there's no shortcut to it. And you can't teach someone how to listen. They just have to do a lot of it. You know, the technique wouldn't take that long to cover. But knowing the techniques of mastering isn't going to make you a good mastering engineer. So you're absolutely right. You know, the kind of button pressing side of things, that's not like that. It is important. Clearly, it's clearly it's very important. But it's the decisions that you make that really are the kind of fundamentals of what we do in terms of if you're going to change something. You know, why? Why have you made that decision? What, you know, what are you hoping to achieve? But anyway, so sort of getting back to my kind of traineeship as a mastering engineer. I think it's probably still the case that, you know, you kind of pursue this similar sort of course, which was, you know, I was kind of let loose on like the compilation album mastering first off. There's no clients in the room. All of the recordings are things that have already been mastered. And basically you just have to string them together in the right order. you know balance them in terms of loudness so that things aren't kind of you know too far apart but you don't really you're not looking to change the sound of anything particularly because you know these are all pre-existing masters that have been through that process and approves and everything else And through that, that's kind of a good way, it's a good introduction to listening to a lot of different kinds of music and stuff that has been released, has been mastered. Someone has said, yeah, I like the way that sounds. it was kind of a good grounding in terms of listening to a lot of stuff. And probably a good introduction to this whole idea of creating something that's like a whole, you know, out of a bunch of sort of disparate pieces of music. Yeah, exactly. Very much so. And also as well, like whenever, whenever anyone says to me, you know, what is mastering? The first part of the answer that I usually give is to discuss the sort of technical aspect of creating a master that needs to, you know, a CD master or a vinyl master or a master for iTunes or whatever it is. Usually there's a certain amount of technical criteria that need to be adhered to for that master to be successfully manufactured from. And, you know, it was a good introduction to that as well, you know, understanding about metadata and subcode and that kind of thing, which is all sort of vitally, vitally important. And it's good. It was a good way of kind of learning that without having to worry too much about, is this track too bright? Is it too dull? You know, is it loud enough? Is it too loud? Do you know what I mean? I didn't really have to worry about the sort of creative side of That was really the sort of first stuff. And then we were lucky back then. One of our clients was Trojan Records, who, you know, obviously big reggae and dub catalogue. And, you know, they reissue a lot of stuff from their catalogue. And, you know, and I kind of got involved in doing all of that. The only thing that I knew about kind of reggae or, you know, dub or kind of sound system culture before I started work at Porky's was Bob Marley. Do you know what I mean? And, you know, all of a sudden, you know, you've got like some obscure, rare IROI recordings or... whoever it is, you know, toots or whatever, and you're hearing all this stuff. And all of a sudden, my eyes and my ears, you know, were being opened to just this wealth of music, which I possibly would never have, you know, really kind of got into before. You know, we used to do, we had another, it wasn't my client, but, you know, I'd do some work for them. We had a big Northern Soul catalogue. label you know so i'd be hearing all this like you know all these rare northern soul gems and it was just amazing you know just to have this like you know all of a sudden you feel like you've tapped into you know the music matrix and all this stuff is kind of just being given to you to listen to it was it was just a wonderful wonderful experience These days, you are probably best known for working on dance music records and electronic records. When did you kind of tap into that? Well, pretty early on, I'd say, really. In my early teens, I was kind of into metal and rock music. And then in my later teens, I got more into the more independent side of alternative rock and indie. So bands like The Cure and Nirvana. came through when I was in my late teens and the whole kind of Seattle scene and that kind of thing. And it wasn't really until I was kind of 17, 18 that dance music really had any real effect on me when I went to a club. for the first time and all of a sudden it made sense, you know, which it didn't really make sense to me prior to that. You know, I mean, apart from Apex Twin, bizarrely, you know, I bought Selected Ambient Works when it came out, which was kind of before I really got into electronic music. I absolutely loved that record, but it didn't make any sense to me. It was like music from another planet, from another world. But I liked it. But, you know, I started going out clubbing and then, you know, just stopped listening to anything that had like any kind of live instruments in it, you know, for like a couple of years. And so when I started at Porky's in 97. You know, I was just only, you know, on day one, I was kind of only interested in electronic music. But like I say, it was great because all of a sudden I started hearing all this other stuff. But, you know, my kind of passion at that point in time, I would have said would have been, you know, house and techno. And speaking of Aphex Twin, at least on Discogs, the first credit on the first... page that you get is for a reflex record. It is. I farted by frequency. Yeah, I love that. I love that. As you listen to it, there's a link to a YouTube thing. And I remember doing that record. It's the first record that I got a credit on in terms of my name, which was one of the proudest days of my life when they gave me that finished copy and it had my name on it. Probably like a lot of people, I'd grown up reading the credits on the back of album sleeves and just looking. And assuming it was this kind of glamorous world, you know, the music industry, studios and all this kind of thing and just wishing I could be a part of it. And when I got mastered by Matt Colton at Porky's Mastering on the back of I Farted by Frequency, I was kind of in that world. It tickles me to this day that it's a comedy hip hop record about breaking winds. And, you know, not something a bit cooler. And I love the fact that it's the first thing that comes up on Discogs. You know, that just kind of amuses me. And was that a CD release or a vinyl release? Well, it was CD and vinyl. But what happened with Reflex is for a lot of their stuff, they started, they'd still do some stuff with Paul, where Paul would do the CD and the vinyl. But a lot of their stuff, they'd do the CD with me first and we'd compile it and, you know, EQ everything and sequence it and, you know, get everything sounding how they thought it should sound. And then... the vinyl would be cut from my CD masters, you know, from my sort of compiled, well, you know, we'd put it on deck. It would be like a compiled sort of vinyl cutting master from my sessions. So it did, I should think it came out on vinyl, but I would have only done the CD part. But I was kind of like the originator, if you like. Yeah, so they started working with me very early on and we kind of became good friends and we did a lot of records together. And that was, I think, working with Reflex from such an early age really shaped my... view on what is right and wrong in a recording in terms of like they'd bring me stuff and you'd be like is it supposed to sound like that and they'd say yeah absolutely that's exactly how it should sound and after like a couple of sessions you're like okay cool i get it it doesn't things don't have to sound it's not necessary that we're trying to make things sound as polished and as smooth and as good and as right as possible because that's not necessarily right you know sometimes things can be fucked up and maybe it sounding wrong is better than it sounding right you know Because wrong and right are the wrong words to use, but you see the point I'm making. Yeah, it seems that it's more about understanding intent than about trying to fit one sound. to everything. Yeah, exactly. And that was kind of like a big sort of light bulb moment really. And also, you know, working with, working with people like that, that loved, well, still do love what they do, you know, and kind of were just pursuing their own path and were being successful and, you know, had their kind of integrity. intact. You know, that was very, very cool. So really from the get-go, I guess, you know, electronic music was kind of a big part of what I was doing. And I guess the other thing that happened was, as I said to you beforehand, the rooms that I was working in within the company were CD mastering only rooms. And this is before no one was delivering anything digitally. Download didn't really exist in any way, shape or form at that point. So it literally was CD or vinyl or cassette. We used to do the Cassette Masters as well in my rooms. But the vinyl cutting lathe is such an interesting piece of kit. And there was a couple of other things. You know, I used to see how the clients kind of, you know, were just in awe of the engineers that could cut vinyl because it's, you know, it's quite difficult to understand from a sort of layman's point of view how it all works and stuff. And I thought, you know, that was, you know, that was kind of cool the way people were looking up to these guys. I thought, I wouldn't mind if someone looked up to me like that. Well, it's an incredible piece of equipment. I mean, it's right behind you now. It looks like something you would find in a physics lab. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. You know, it's old. You know, they're like classic cars. They haven't made them since like the 1960s or something. Well, a bit later. So this is a Neumann VMS-80 that we have here. And this model was launched. in roundabout 1980, hence the number. I mean, the last design was the 82, which was a modification of this. And they stopped supporting vinyl in 84, 85, I believe. And Neumann were the last company making those. So, you know, we can safely say sort of 84, 85 was really when, you know, vinyl stopped being supported by the manufacturers of equipment. So, you know, the machines are old and they're esoteric, they're temperamental and they're absolutely brilliant. You know, they're wonderful. horrific when they stop working you know you can have some real tearing your hair out moments and you need to know clever people to get them fixed but you know there's something like magical and wonderful about them And the other thing that, as I said to you, I'd be doing the CD master and then handing that tape to another engineer to cut the vinyl and that pissed me off. It's like, no, no, I'm the mastering engineer. I want to do... I want to do it all. You know, I want to learn everything. I don't see the point in there being a piece of kit in the next room and me not knowing how to use it. That seems nuts. I want to learn everything, you know. And also I want to see the whole release through. You know, I don't want to have to trust it to someone else. Not that I'm incapable of trusting anyone else or, you know, arrogant enough to think that only I can do. a good job on it, but more it's kind of like, you know, I want to see this thing through and kind of wrap it all up, you know, myself. So Paul Solomons, he was the sort of main engineer that, you know, he started teaching me how to. cut vinyl and that was a very slow introduction. Is it quite a steep learning curve learning to use one of these machines cut vinyl? Well I think two things one is it's easy to you know it's fairly easy to burn out the cutting head if you don't know what you're doing and if you burn out the cutting heads you know you're going to be looking at a bill of sort of three thousand pounds or something to get it rebuilt. Expensive mistake. It's an expensive mistake, you know, and you're going to be without that cutting head for like two, three weeks or whatever. So a very expensive mistake. Yeah, it's not the kind of thing that, you know, I mean, I've burnt out a couple of heads in my career and it's absolutely mortifying because... you know, I mean, nothing pisses you off more because you know it's going to cost a fortune and it's going to be a nightmare. And how do you burn out the cutting head? Is that something that you don't take the proper precautions with the sound? Yeah, well, essentially, yeah. I mean, usually it will be, well, two things. If you try and pass DC through it, that will quite possibly damage it. But that's more difficult, but it's normally just an excess of high frequency. You try and drive too much HF through it and you'll just burn out the coils. So my introduction to it was very slow in terms of just, again, a lot of watching, a lot of listening. And the first things that I cut... Paul would have EQ'd them and then I'd be like doing the actual operating of the lathe, you know, so, you know, just learning, okay, the kind of, you press this button, that happens sort of thing. And I would say, you know, it probably took... you know, two years for me to kind of feel comfortable around a cutting lathe. I mean, I wouldn't say, I mean, that's not two years of like every day, you know, cutting records all day every day, but bits here and there we'd be doing stuff. And at the end of that two year period, I wouldn't say that I was cutting good records. You know, I could cut a side and it could go to a factory and they could turn it into a record. there wasn't a lot of brilliance going on because the thing that I find with mastering is that you know the difference between doing something like really well and just being able to do it is you know the difference is great in terms of how things sound but usually it takes like some kind of you know like a light bulb moment in your head where you work out ah right okay well hang on oh so that's doing that do you know what I mean I've cut a lot of records and I think now you know I'm sort of reasonably reasonably good at it do you have a sense of when you started to hit a stride with mastering for vinyl records um I don't know if this is just me, but I've often found that every 18 months or something, there'll be a period of like a couple of weeks or a month or whatever, where I think, oh my God, I fucking cracked it. I totally, I'm totally owning this process. I'm really, really, you know, I'm a good mastering engineer. And then usually what happens is, you know, something will then go horribly, horribly wrong. And, you know, you realize that you don't know it all. And, you know, you remember the meaning of the word hubris. Do you know what I mean? I've often found that, you know, the times when I think, yeah, I'm absolutely fucking owning this shit now. And that's when the next week you realize that you. cocked something up massively which is really good you know it's really I maybe it's just me but I find it's good for keeping my own kind of ego and arrogance in check But really, I guess it probably wasn't until, you know, maybe kind of five years ago when I started at Air, you know, joining a studio like Air Studios, you know, that is one of the best recording studios in the world, you know, staffed by some of the best staff of recording studios in the world. You know, when I joined there, I felt like I belonged there. But, you know, I was nervous when I started. You know, there were some very, very, very skilled people there. And I thought that I had it in me to be one of those very skilled people. But, you know, I was kind of, am I good enough? I think I am. But, you know, shit, now I am going to find out because if I'm not good enough, there's going to be people around who will know and they will tell me. But, you know, that didn't happen. And I kind of settled in and I I think, you know, the vast majority of people who work there kind of respected what I did and, you know, didn't see me as some kind of like chancer or, you know, faker who sort of bluffed his way in. You know, I was kind of there on merit. I guess it was kind of at that point that I started thinking, yeah, OK, well, that's. Yeah, I don't think I know everything and I don't know everything now. There's a lot more that I don't know about mastering than I do know about mastering. But I guess at that point I kind of felt like, yeah, okay, I'm not bad, maybe. So Alchemy is your own studio. Yeah. When did you kind of decide it was time to break off on your own, do your own thing? So Alchemy is owned by myself and two other engineers, my two business partners. And we formed this version of Alchemy 18 months ago. Alchemy has been going in various different guises for many, many years. But it was really, I guess it was probably about two and a half years ago, maybe three years ago when I was at Air. And I've kind of always wanted to work for myself. You know, I'm really stubborn and... I like to make my own decisions governing what happens to me and my life and all the rest of it. And not that I always think that I'm right, but I'd rather make the decision myself, even if I get it wrong, rather than have things kind of placed upon me. Do you know what I mean? I'm not arrogant enough to think that I do know everything and every decision I make is the correct one. But I'd rather just make them myself. So, you know, it had always been in the back of my mind. I wanted to have my own studio. And, you know, it was really kind of two and a half, maybe three years ago. Various things were happening at the time at Air Studios. It was up for sale. You know, there's questions over, you know, how much support the owners wanted to put into it and that kind of thing. You know, I'd been speaking to them and I was kind of looking to, you know, expand our department and I was looking for various things. And, you know, I was doing a lot of business and I kind of felt like, you know, I should maybe be having a little bit more control and various other things. And, you know, they were honest with me. They felt that they were quite happy with the way things were. And so, you know, I just kind of thought, well, I kind of got two options here. If I'm unhappy, they've told me that things aren't going to change. Either I stay put and accept it, you know, and sort of wear it or I do something about it myself. So I decided that I was going to, you know, go out on my own. And I felt that I probably knew. enough people who would consider cutting records with me that if I set something up, they'd give me a go. You know, they'd kind of try us out. And, you know, assuming I did a good job, obviously you kind of hope that a few of them stick around and enough to make a business. But I'd worked for a previous incarnation of Alchemy in 2007, so I knew Barry and I knew Phil, who were my business partners in this version of Alchemy. And they'd found this property that we're in now, which was, you know, kind of derelict and, you know, occupied only by pigeons and rats and, you know, holes in the roof and all the rest of it. Damp and, like, just horrific. building really in West London, but it was a great space and we were kind of chatting and they were just like, you know, well, instead of going out on your own, you could come in with us, you know, and we'll just do it, you know, the three of us and you're going to be pretty autonomous. You know, we're not going to tell you what to do. We'll run this thing equally. And that seemed like a really good idea because one of the concerns I had about going out on my own was, you know, I'm a workaholic anyway, I know that. Would I ever stop? Would I ever go on holiday? Because if it's just me, if I want two weeks off, I have to close the studio for two weeks. That's difficult to do. Whereas if there's three of us, there's other people around. There's other people bringing in money into the business and everything else. People who can deal with stuff in your absence. Yeah, so we decided to do this and, you know, we've been slowly developing the facility as you see it now. We've got, you know, my room's been up and running since, you know, pretty much day one. We've almost finished the second main mastering room that will be fully operational in the next couple of weeks. And, you know, we'll start on rooms three and four, so fairly soon after that upstairs. Yeah. And no regrets. I mean, one of the best decisions I've ever made. And, you know, touchwoods on the whole, we've been extremely busy, had some real successes, done some really good work. And, you know, I think a lot of people kind of like. what we're doing yeah it's not obviously it's not all you know a sort of blissful upwards trajectory there's bumps along the road but it's it's been good it's been good for me and uh yeah and the the clients seem to like it too i mean you've really assembled a pretty impressive crew of labels who come to you for work pretty good crew of artists who come to you for work Kind of raises a question, actually, something that you brought up before about this difference between making something perfect and having something really sort of fit its intentions. Yeah. And kind of looking at some of the people that you've worked with recently. I mean, Lies is one label that you've done work for. Yeah. There's some pretty crazy stuff that comes out on Modern Love that you do a lot of work for as well. I mean, this is music that doesn't sound perfect. Yeah. You know, with a Lies record, it's going to sound pretty nuts. Yeah. I mean, how do you approach that? Like, if you have a record that sounds kind of noisy, that sounds kind of crazy, how do you make it sound right? really know is the short answer I kind of I think to a to a large extent I think I kind of get with that aesthetic and which is why I do a lot of it, you know, that kind of, you know, fuzzy, fucked up, you know, kind of weird stuff. That all kind of comes to me quite a lot. And I guess it's because I, you know, the records that I do that sound like that resonate with people. And so therefore I must kind of get that, I guess. I mean, for me, I don't find that any more challenging than, you know, doing a classical record or, you know, a piece of pop music that's like perfect and pristine. And, you know, I don't I don't see the distinction. My kind of philosophy, if there is one which, you know, I don't have like an overbearing philosophy, but. I just try and understand what are the intentions of the people releasing this music. Music creates an emotion within the listener. And so I just try and understand what is the emotion, what's the intention, what are we trying to make people feel here. And I just try and get on board with that. And then can we enhance that? Or at least if we don't enhance it, let's make sure that we don't kind of take away from it. Let's not detract from it. When you've got something that's fucked up, it's distorted, there's loads of hiss and it's all over the place. I could go through and I could de-hiss it and I could kind of, you know, probably, you know, give me a day and I'll have it sounding, you know, like fairly polished. But that's not the intention. That's not, you know, the artist, the label, they don't want the listener to be hearing a piece of polished music. They want them to be reacting to something that's... the opposite of that so therefore that's my that's my brief you know let's not tidy this up let's keep it raw do we make it rorer do you know what i mean maybe we do maybe we go maybe we go more crazy with it do you think it's possible then like for a mastering engineer to sort of have a signature sound I would guess that probably most engineers would say that they don't have a signature sound and certainly most wouldn't want to have a signature sound. Now, whether people who, you know, view their work agree with that or not is different. One thing that I've noticed is that, you know, one of the reasons that you're here is... because of the work that I've done in sort of certain specific electronic fields, but I'm known in other fields, completely different fields. You know, I do, you know, I do a reasonable amount of kind of vinyl reissues from tape, for example, you know, from recordings from the 60s. which have got nothing to do with techno or electronic music or anything like that. And the people that work with me from those fields, for example, would assume that I'm best known for that. Do you know what I mean? So it's kind of people sort of think if they know me from their particular circle that, you know, I kind of exist solely in that circle. But it's probably the case that I exist in many other circles in a professional capacity. But, I mean, for me, I guess what I try and do, yeah, I try not to impart too much of myself if I can. Although everything that I do is obviously run through the prism of my hearing and my brain understanding what I'm hearing. For me, it's important to remember that it's not my record. And it's not my name on the front cover. I'm not the most important person in this equation. And so I tried where I can to really just deliver what the client wants. And if that's something that I don't agree with, then we'll have a chat about it, you know, and I'll give the client my opinion. If I think that there's another way that's better, ultimately it's, it's their call. So if someone wants, you know, I don't. I wouldn't have thought that people think, you know, I'm like the go-to guy for loud or the go-to guy for quiet. Do you know what I mean? Or whatever, you know, I'd hope that, you know, if you want something loud, people would say, yeah, Matt can do that, but he's not necessarily going to cremate the track. you know, he's going to aim to give you what you want, you know, so that, that would kind of be my hope. It's difficult to know whether that's what people think of me or not. You know, I just keep trying to do what I do, you know, keep improving my facility as, as much as I can keep learning about what I'm doing. And yeah, you just. like try and make each record as good as you can and you kind of figure that people will hear that and if they like what they hear then maybe they'll get in touch and see if you want to do a record with them kind of thing So like word on the street, what you always hear is vinyl is back, sales are up, everybody wants their stuff out on vinyl. Is that something that's been borne out in your experience on sort of this side of the process? Yeah, I mean, it's great. First and foremost, because it's great for me on a personal level because vinyl is my favorite way to listen to music. I think it's great because it's brought physical product back. which, you know, there was a whole bunch of people that, you know, of a certain age, let's say, and, you know, even older people who used to own physical products who then sold it all and, you know, everyone was just kind of playing MP3 files and that kind of thing and, you know, record sales fell. who'd have thought everyone was listening to stuff that sounds like shit and people were buying less music. I mean, you know, I wonder what the equation there is. Now people are buying more vinyl and people are buying more and more vinyl because they're enjoying listening to music more. You know, it's not fucking rocket science. And if people are spending more money in the recorded music industry, then that's great. obviously for me, sort of personal business level. It's great for all my friends who work in the industry because that money's coming in and supporting our industry. It's brilliant because record shops almost disappeared. And now you see great little record shops opening up all over the place. And people are able to make a living from selling records, which is wonderful. Some of my happiest memories are going into a record shop and just losing myself for an hour, just flicking through the racks and pulling out stuff. And you'd buy a load of stuff you had no idea. if you were going to like it or not, but you discover a whole bunch of stuff that way, which, you know, when you're browsing on the internet, you don't, it's a different thing, you know, so that's really, really healthy. It means that, you know, factories can hopefully carry on trying to press good records. You know, one of the problems that... we have with vinyl production, the manufacture of vinyl, is the smaller the margins in it, effectively the worse the product sounds. There's a direct correlation. I remember reading, I can't remember who it was, but it was a guy who worked in one of the big... pressing plants in the States. And he was saying that, you know, if you were pressing a Michael Jackson record in the 80s, and I'm paraphrasing, you know, from memory, so this isn't going to be exact, but, you know, they'd throw away the first thousand copies, you know, to get to the run of test pressings. thousand copies that came off the press the presses weren't operating at the correct temperatures correct pressures so those copies didn't sound good enough it's only when you've done a thousand that everything was kind of warmed up nicely enough to then say okay right now we can actually listen to some of these records Obviously, these days, maybe the pressing plants can afford to, you know, do like maybe throw away the first 20 and then they'll run the teepees. I mean, you don't even have thousand record pressings. Well, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the vast majority of runs will be under a thousand copies for, you know, all told. So the... That's what I'm saying. It's, you know, as the kind of margins and the numbers have got smaller, it's become more and more difficult to make good sounding vinyl. And so conversely, the flip on that is obviously the more records are being made in general, the more profit is there for the factories and that kind of thing. They can hopefully work it so that, you know, records start to sound better and better. And it's the same with mastering studios and everyone else. We can all invest a little bit more and we can kind of push this thing on, hopefully. And hopefully it can be a good, healthy period of sustained growth and we're not looking at just like a sort of little bubble. But I think it's been really healthy for music in general. There's not that many people that can actually make a living simply from selling recorded music. I'm not naive enough to... think anything different but you know the fact that it can kind of help and if people selling vinyl you know there's the opportunity for it to help a little bit more than if they're just you know giving their tracks away for free on SoundCloud or whatever, then that can only be a good thing. It can only encourage more people to do this. And the more people making music, the more crazy, brilliant audio recordings are going to come out. Which will only make your job more interesting. Which will make my job more interesting. thing more fun and you know hopefully touchwood i'll still be here in 20 years time doing this you know that's certainly that's certainly my aim i've got i've got no desires to do anything else with my life um so yeah fingers crossed long may it continue ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Thank you. you
