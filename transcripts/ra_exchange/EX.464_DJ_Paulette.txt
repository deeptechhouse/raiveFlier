Hello and welcome. to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with DJ Paulette. While studying in university and working as a TV presenter in Manchester, Paulette landed her residency at the legendary Hacienda gay party, Flesh, where she learned to DJ on the job, as she says. After regularly DJing around other northern cities like Leeds, Sheffield and Nottingham in the early 90s, she was eventually called down to heaven in London and ultimately ended up with the Ministry of Sound. working both in London, Ibiza, and around the world as a resident in their international touring crew. In conversation with Martha Pazienti-Caden, we get a first-hand look at Paulette's time behind the decks at Flesh, the story behind a nine-hour jet-lag DJ set in Montreal, and her advice for young women aspiring to build a career on radio and in the booth. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with DJ Paulette is up next. You're listening to Resident Advisors Exchange. My name is Martha. I host The Hour podcast, which is our other podcast. And for today's exchange, I'm spending some time with DJ Paulette, who's been an integral part of Manchester's dance music scene. Welcome to Resident Advisor, Paulette. Thanks for joining us. Yeah, absolute pleasure. Happy that you're here and you're down from Manchester today. Certainly. Yeah. Virgin trains. They were late today. Ten minutes late. They sent that little note out saying, how did you judge our performance? And I'm going to go in with the complaint. Yeah. You tell them how it is. Yeah. Let's begin in Manchester. So what's your earliest music memory connected to the city? It's quite funny, actually. Well, I've got two. really big blazing memories. My mum used to own a nightclub, a co-owner nightclub in Manchester in the 60s. late 60s, early 70s called the Ebony Club and I remember I have a vague, well vague recollection as a child of hiding underneath the tables and watching people's legs dancing that's just the first sort of vague music, people dancing, connection, memory. And then I remember being maybe three, I can't know, I must have been less than three because we left Manchester when we were three for a few years. Me and my twin did... A starring role at the Jamaican West Indian Centre, my mum had put together this massive concert thing at the community centre. My mum was a singer, my mum's a jazz cabaret singer and she was very involved in the community and so all our family were kind of roped. in for this concert and we all had a song to sing and me and my twin sang this song I've got twin sister identical And we sang this song, Daisy, Daisy, which everyone loved, you know, two little cute as a button little kids with afros and dressed identically singing a song with a dance routine. I mean, what's not to love? So we got a massive round of applause singing this song. So we went off. And then my sister Elizabeth went on to sing her song, which was a penny kiss, a penny hug. But me and Paula just loved being on stage so much. We just blazed into her thing and started doing our song again, which was just like, no, it's not your turn anymore. And I think. That is the moment when I learned to love being on stage and performing and also learned the very bad habit, and I have a really bad habit, of upstaging the bride. Never upstage the bride. It's a bad idea. Fast forward to, and this is why I say this memory, my 40th birthday in Paris and I had Steve Angelo and Sebastian Ingrosso played at my birthday party. Never upstage with a bride. I got really drunk. And I used to dance in Paris when I was DJing. I'd kind of dance at the same time as I was putting records on. So the first part of the set, I was topping and tailing the party. So for the first part of the set, that was fine. It was perfectly accepted. Raised the atmosphere, got everybody going. But then I got really drunk. And when Steve and Seb were on, I was on the stage, wouldn't get off, up above the rafters, wouldn't get off. And they complained about it and I never worked with them again. that was just oh that was that so yeah there's a little memory that's a good one so after you were three years old on the stage what were you listening to throughout growing up I am the youngest of eight I've got six sisters and um yeah I've got six sisters and one brother And my mum's a jazz singer and she sings cabaret as well. And my dad always loved music. So there was always music, music, music in the house all the time. And I just picked up music from everybody else. So my mum would be playing everything from Ella Fitzgerald, Hayley Jackson. Lena Horne, I'm thinking of the album covers, Lisa Minnelli, Barbra Streisand, George Benson, you know, everything from show tunes, Hair, Jesus Christ Superstar, West Side Story, Funny Girl, Funny Lady. She loved Barbra Streisand. My dad loved Victor Moan. And then my sister Rhonda was really into Northern Soul. So she had just this phenomenal Northern Soul record collection. I remember my brother had the original Sticky Fingers Rolling Stones album and I used to love playing with the cover because it had the jeans. It had like a proper zip in the jeans. It's a black and white cover. And I used to play with that. I remember playing with it. And I cannot believe my brother sold that album. It's worth a fortune now. And he also had the original Andy Warhol Velvet Underground album with the banana on it, which I just thought was a magnificent cover. So I have this. recollection of not just being aware of the music Miss Sister Jenny loved the Beatles so she had all of the Beatles album and Genesis and Jethro Tull and Roxy Music and Sparks. And so I'm getting it not just soul, disco, funk, jazz. You know, my mum was also into classical music, but also, you know, lots of different types of music as well. David Bowie, Roxy Music, Iggy Pop, T-Rex. I've still got my sister's, Alicia's album. T-Rex. My people were there. They had stars in their hair. It's a double gatefold sleeve and it's just got this mental psychedelic 70s cover on it with Mark Boland kind of morphing into some kind of peacock or anyway, crazy album cover. I still have it. So there was all sorts of music going through the house. All of my sisters, my brother, they were all into different music. Some of the same, but, you know, some crossovers. But we all had our specialist subject, you know, our specialist field. And I, being the youngest of eight, got to hear it all. Because I was just one of these kids that pestered and pestered and pestered and said, can I come in the room while you're playing your music? And I was told if I sat on the heater and I was quiet and I was good, I could. So that's it. And do you think being around all your siblings and their music taste has impacted yourself as a selector and as a DJ? Absolutely, yeah. And it still does today because kind of one of the reasons why I came back from Ibiza was because and changed what I was doing in 2013 when I left Paris was because... I wasn't feeling the music that I was playing at the time and I wanted to play the kind of music that connected me back with my family, which also, and in a very selfish way, I wanted my family to come to my parties. I wanted to have that kind of house party vibe again where I felt like. if I was doing something that they could come and I knew for as long as I was just going to play straight down the line like techno or house or, you know, there would be some that would come, but they wouldn't, you know, the older we've got, you know, they're less into raving. But if I play. a set of disco, funk and soul and that kind of music, rare groove, they'll come. And, you know, they might not stay all night, but those parties tend to be earlier. So they'll come and they'll still get an early night. So in a very selfish way, yes, it did influence me and still does. I wanted to ask when you were growing up, alongside all the music and the albums, was radio a big thing? part oh absolutely oh my god yeah it really was because you know I've I don't make any secret about my age I was born in 66 so you know when I was five six seven years old the radio in fact younger than that because my mum used to leave this sounds really bad When my mum had to leave the house and leave me and my twin with my sisters, she'd sit us either on a window ledge or on a, you know, wherever, on a chair or tell us to be good on a sofa or whatever. And she'd sit me and my twin together and put the radio on. And sometimes if we were crying, she'd put the radio on and say, you can cry to this, knowing that we'd start to listen to the music and we'd stop crying. And it used to stop me crying. The radio always used to stop me crying. And I have a recollection of us both going. And crying and then this song would start and we'd go, and start living. listening to the music and then we'd just be really into the music and be really good kids till my mum came home because we were listening to the radio so the radio has always had a very special kind of place in my heart because it it's that thing that gave me a sense of security and a sense of everything's going to be all right and a sense of um you know, a sense of the music that I liked because I was responding to things that I heard. So all the way along, I think I started listening to Radio 1. I think that was the national station. And then when we moved to Manchester, a few years... late into we moved there probably mid 70s and mid to late 70s or early 80s Piccadilly Radio was started in Manchester 261 and we switched to that the local radio station And on the local radio station were Greg Wilson and Mike Shaft. And Greg Wilson was like my family's absolute go-to for music, soul, disco, funk, you name it. And they went to all of his parties, whether it was at Berlin or Rafters or wherever else. Greg Wilson, Colin Curtis, Mike Shaft. and Hugh and Clark were the DJs that were playing on the radio and also in clubs. So there was that link then straight away also from radio DJs being the ones that entertained us at night as well. So that's... how I kind of got interested in doing radio. And then when I was 18, I wanted to become a broadcaster. I don't know why. I think probably because I was also listening to people like Annie Nightingale and John Peel and they'd impressed me because they had just these weird out there random selections that were... You know, they'd play David Bowie and they'd play Susie Sue, Susie and the Banshees, and they'd play the Sex Pistols. And then John Peel had to have like really weird named bands, which I'd never bought a record by any of those people. But he just played it anyway. And it just gave me this idea of you can educate people with a radio show as well. And then I wanted to become a broadcaster and I started working for Piccadilly Radio as a junior reporter on a show. I did interviews. gig reviews, live, Vox Pops, everything. Back in the day as well, we were recording it on like a Marantz and then going back into the studio and actually editing it with a scalp and chalk. So that's how I learned. um my radio skills I'm like I've got a history of radio from then I've always wanted to do radio shows and how about learning to DJ how did this come about I don't think I've I still don't think I know what I'm doing because you're You always learn new tricks and the technology changes. And it's changing so fast now anyway that it's actually stabilized a bit now. But I've seen DJing change from, you know, we didn't. even start with techniques you know they they weren't the original decks that were in the clubs weren't necessarily belt driven you were just putting records on you know one after the other and you had a mixer that enabled you to move fade from one side to the other and then I've watched it develop in the time that I've been DJing from 1991 to 2018 to Technics becoming the industry standard. Now, when I started DJing at Flesh at the Hacienda, we didn't have Technics downstairs. Are you kidding? me it was I can't even remember the make that like it looked like some kind of mixer that you would use for live performances or or even festivals in a field you know it was like sound engineering equipment not club mixing so I've seen it change from really like ghetto setups to you know top of the range now um you know my rider is pioneer nexus 2000 cdjs i won't use anything else i i'm a usb head Although, you know, I have used and can use Traktor, Serato. You know, I use Traktor to do my mixes at home and I use Pioneer when I'm DJing out in clubs. So I've watched the whole thing change. So do you recall getting your hands on decks for the first time? Yeah. And were you nervous? It was terrible. It was awful. I didn't have equipment at home. I didn't have the equipment at home. I didn't set out to be a DJ. I really did not set out to be a DJ. When I became a DJ, I was studying at Manchester Metropolitan University. doing a degree in English but at the same time I was dancing in clubs I was modelling I was a known sort of head People know you for your area and it's like, oh, there's Paulette, whatever. So in one way, I was expected to become a teacher. And in another way, I was presenting a TV program. So I was more a TV presenter and I was presenting a radio program. So I was more on the presentation side than the actual. DJ side and I fell into it just because I had a lot of records and a friend of mine who knew somebody else who was doing a party at the number one club and she'd run out of money and She didn't have any money to pay a proper DJ So he told her that I had a lot of records and which I did and she asked me if I would like to do it and I said well I haven't got lots of house music but I've got some house and I've got like bits of everything I've got disco funk soul wear groove and she said yeah yeah yeah that's great I think she was just absolutely desperate to be honest because she did she promoted the party and she didn't have a DJ which is just absolutely bonkers so she's like yeah yeah yeah yeah that's great that's great just do it and I said I've never played in a club before she went oh right I'll take you round to this guy's house you'll learn it'll be fine And we went round to this guy's house, a friend of hers who had decks, and he wouldn't let me touch them. And I was like, well, I need to learn how to play. And he's like, no, no, don't touch my deck. And he was really possessive about his equipment, which now after years and years DJing, I'm like, okay, I kind of get that. Like, these are my precious. like Gollum with the ring, you know, it's like, don't touch it, my precious. But I don't know whether it's a male, female thing or whatever it was, he did not want me to touch the decks. And I'm like, well, you're going to have to let me have a go because I need to learn how to play. And he went, okay, well. Just press that button. So I pressed the button and I made it start and it was playing. And he said, right, so on the other deck, you've got to press that button and make that record play. And then he'd bring in the fader. He didn't tell me about beat matching. He didn't tell me about sequencing. He didn't tell me anything. So I set the second deck off, brought the mix across and he went, great, that's it. That's all you need to know. Right Are you kidding me? And that was my introduction to DJing. So when I started DJing, when I did the night of the number one, I was almost hysterical. I knew because the system also was different. It wasn't the decks. It wasn't techniques. So they weren't the decks that I'd practiced on. And it wasn't a mixer that I'd practiced on. And I didn't recognize the buttons. I didn't know how to monitor it. I didn't have the foggiest idea how to make it work. But I had. the records so all the way through the party the guy that was doing the sound at the number one he also went to do the sound at Paradise Factory later on was called Ian Bushell and he was at the side of me all the way through because he was working the lights and I was just all night I was like what do I do What do I do? And he'd go, press that, push that across. And he just told me how to do it. But I learned on the job. And how we managed to then be offered the second room at the Flesh Party is just a complete stroke of luck. Like they liked, I think people talked about the music at that party. People really enjoyed it. And it was something different. I wasn't playing like. mainstream the sort of music that you would hear at a mainstream gay party um i was playing house disco funk soul you you weren't really hearing that on the gay scene in manchester So they offered, they said we could host the second room and that's how we got in. And I went, I think I played there two years before I'd even bought my own equipment. So for two years, even though I was DJing regularly. monthly for Flesh and then weekly for other people around Manchester because my booking started to pick up. I still didn't have my own equipment at home. So what I used to do was I had a record. player um you know my mum had a record player and I just used to put them side by side and try and get the records to run at the right speed and then bring one in and bring one out and I think that's kind of how I got to know what to do which is probably why I'm so rubbish still it's all roots Was there a moment after that where you felt like you kind of looked around at a party that was going well and thought, oh, maybe I've got the hang of this? I did when I was at Flesh because that's when I kind of relaxed because it really, in the end, it comes down to what you play. And you can be as technically gifted as you are. as you like but if the music's awful no one's going to stick around you know you can put put as many loops as you want in it and you can cut and scratch and you can do whatever you like with music but if your music isn't on point no one is going to stick around and the good thing for me is I'm a dancer I play music that makes me dance, that makes me feel good, and I hope that makes everybody else feel good. I am... I like to party and I do go in deep with music in a certain way, but I'm vocally led and I'm lyrics led. I like songs. So for a long time, I couldn't get arrested because a lot of clubs aren't song related. If you play a song in there, it's like, ooh, words. But I am vocal and song driven. And I think what happened was I was playing music that was making people feel good and the room was always packed. So from the beginning of starting to play in that second room at Flesh, I had a captive audience. People didn't leave. You know, people came to that party for my room. So that. was you know that was a moment for me because no matter whether I had the equipment at home, I knew I was doing a good job because there was sweat dripping off the wall. People came back every month. I got to know faces and regulars and names. Some of them, some of the people I'm still friends with now, 20 odd years later. So yeah, Flesh was really a turning point for me in terms of musical choice and also my my own DJ personality, how I wanted to present the music. And tell me a bit more about Manchester around that time. Well, you know, it's funny when I talk about Flesh Now and I talk about the gay scene and I talk about Manchester, people kind of think about it with a 2019 head on them. And I have to ask them to remember that in 1992 in Manchester, we've just come off the back of Clause 28 being passed. It wasn't cool to be gay in Manchester. You were under threat in many ways. If you were seen to be hanging around the gay quarter, you know, Canal Street and all of that wasn't like it is now. It wasn't accepted. You ran the risk of getting your head kicked in. You know, so what they did. in creating the Flesh Party was make a safe space for people to go and enjoy the music and enjoy their culture and enjoy being who they are without fear of... retribution or violence. So politically, it was a very powerful statement to make. It wasn't just a club night. And it wasn't just a branding exercise to make money out of a rainbow flag. It was as political as it could be. You know, even the police force at that time in Manchester were anti-gay, anti-LGBT. kind of sets the scene for the clubbing that I came through. And what ways were the organisers of Flesh Ape... to create this safe space like how did they go about it? Well they made it very clear in the advertising straight away that it was for what was it lesbians gays and their friends and they would ask people on the door are you gay that's straight away And if they said no, it's who are you with? And if they didn't know who they were with, you weren't getting in. They did not get in. And it was positive discrimination, but for a reason, because... They had to make that space that safe. We couldn't run the risk of having people that were even remotely questionable in there because we wanted everyone to have a nice time and enjoy it. as they wanted to enjoy it. If you want to run around with gaffer tape crosses on your boobs and wear nothing else, you could. It was very hedonistic. And we were allowed to do that because the doors were closed to people who had closed minds. So after you'd been DJing around Manchester for a while, you started to get opportunities to go and travel and play internationally. How did that first experience of playing outside of the city go? Outside of the city, I think the first... I think I played in Leeds first and it might have been, was it the Music Factory or it could have been the Vague Party that I played in Leeds first. great you know I was just like I actually couldn't understand what was happening but but people wanted me to go and play in another club and do the same thing that I was doing in Manchester so it's like oh okay then this is good I hadn't considered it as a job and it didn't exist as a job really in those days either. You know, it's not like it is now where you were expected to have a certain progression and certainly, you know, not for women. Yeah, it was great. I started off in Leeds and then I did Venus in Nottingham and then I did Sheffield and then I started doing Leeds, Sheffield and Nottingham on a regular triangle. Then where did I go after Leeds, Sheffield and Nottingham? I think then I started to go further south. I started off in London with Heaven and wherever else they used to put me. And by 90, well, Heaven, the Zap in Brighton, and then I started playing at the Ministry of Sound. And then from there you started to go to Ibiza. Yeah, yeah. Well, it was the ministry that took me out to Ibiza and I played for the ministry for years. You know, I did both London Club Nights and also I did Ibiza for them, playing at Space and Pasha and Café Del Mar and wherever else. And then I... was one of their international tours residents for years and I toured Asia Argentina, South America, all of Europe, all over the place, really. Let's talk more about residencies because I feel like they're kind of coming back right now. It's interesting. In one way, residencies are amazing because you get to know, you really get to know your crowd. But in a way that can be a bit the undoing of you because then, and certainly I know this applies when you're a resident in Ibiza because you are overlooked as a DJ. You're just the resident and the guests come in and they're always the guests. always are bigger than the resident the guests always and you don't get to grow into from being a resident you don't get to grow into guest status so you you have to be very careful about how long you are a resident for Or how long you are a resident in one place for. So you have to kind of move around and change it or start your own party or do something because you can kind of box yourself off with being a resident for too long. How did you navigate that? You have to move. I moved. And also I play lots of different sets. So I think I've never really got stuck in a resident rut until I got to Paris. And there I did nine years of playing at the... top of my game but I was a resident at three different clubs and then you're not allowed when you play for those clubs for a certain amount of time you're not allowed to play for any others in the city and then it started to work against me but everywhere else when I was in London I played for lots of different people. So I'd play for Giles and I'd play for the Ministry of Sound. So I was playing house and I was playing rare groove and little bits of tougher music. So when I was sent out to play in Montreal, I would play much harder and much darker. So I was doing lots of different things in London. So the residencies didn't block me off too much there. And when you do have a residency and you're playing weekly or monthly, what were your methods for... growing your audience or growing your community around you? Well it's the music it's always the music and there are certain records I know even now since I've been back in Manchester and I've only been back for three years and only really playing properly regularly for two of that that people know who's playing by the music they hear. And I have a certain way of playing and I have a certain musical choice that people can recognise, even though they're probably records that other people will play as well. I'm not saying that I'm... you know I'm not inventing the wheel I'm playing records that exist you know I'm not a producer of music that is essentially mine so I am playing other people's music but I have a way of putting that set together and I have a way of arriving in a room and taking over a room that people know instinctively that it's me that's on the decks. And I've heard people say that really regularly. It's, oh, we knew it was you because I have a way of flipping a room. I just know that's how I like to take over that. Have you got any... particular memories from any residencies across your career of um i would like to hear about the kind of characters that you met during those residencies like people that were ravers that became friends oh loads loads i mean flesh is the the ultimate one because those people all of those people that were front of my deck so now you know a lot of them are really heavy hitters in their respective trades and things so um you know I had like a very young Stuart Holton who is dancing in front of my decks all the time he's Vivian West Westwood's second, you know, he is the director of Vivienne Westwood International now and he's, you know, very serious player. You know, he brought the fashion edge to my room. Similarly, Paul Marascha, the guy that's the head of Nobu now, I remember him when he was sweating. Sweating in his boxer shorts, dancing on the bar, you know. And various models, you know. I always had like Mick Hucknall down in my room and various pop stars and DJs down in my room. And I used to play with Luke Howard in that room and Princess Julia. And Luke Howard is now, you know, one quarter of Horse Meat Disco. And that's, you know, we DJ together for years at Flesh. And Guy Williams, obviously, you know, he is now in his second season with his Flash Party. at pikes and um you know he used to come and dance in front of my decks and asked me for dsk what would you do i don't remember so funny Was there anything that you observed or picked up in terms of skills for your sets from doing those residencies? Like, how would you say they shaped you as a DJ? Flesh is just don't bore people. Absolutely don't bore people. Because my friend Robert Shaw and Paul Marascha and the Sheffield lot, they used to have this thing where... If they didn't like a record I'd played, they'd just give me the timeout sign, you know, the American T. So if I ever saw that, it was like, oh, yeah, change the record fast. And I just learned to be in the vibe and keep the vibe like steady, steady, steady all the time. And it's a really. It's a very levelling thing if someone actually does that to you. It's very rude, actually. But, you know, I just had, it was like a war zone. It's like the front line. Like people were very, they were very supportive, but also very unforgiving. So if I made a mistake, I knew about it. So it was a very hard, hard, harsh and good training ground. And nice to have people so engaged. Totally, totally. And like I say, they're still friends. You know, we still talk and everything. So what do you like about holding a residency? Oh, I love residencies because you do get to know, you get to know the people at the club, you get to know the people on both sides, so staff and punters. You get to know the way everything works and every building, every place, every club, every bar. has its own feeling, has its own vibe. So you really get to understand what makes that space tick. You know, certain times and the waves of people and how the people move around the space and whether they want to dance or whether they want to listen or... you know, where they want to dance on the bar or where they're going to get really, you know, some places people go and just have a couple of drinks and they're fine. Other places people go and they get absolutely wasted and you have to know, right, okay, so I'm in a wasted space. So this is what they want in this space. And the music changes for... every space and I think the residencies give you that insider information that as a guest when you go in you have no clue what people want you just have to go with your gut feeling and if they like it they like it and if they don't tough do you have stories to share with us from Hacienda times which ones I think there was a lot going on at the Hasse Endertimes. On a personal level, I was presenting a TV programme and studying for my degree at the same time as DJing once a month there. And I was also very... I wasn't really party, party girl because I just had so much going on, so I wasn't... You know, I wasn't a googly eyed salad spinning. How many whatever you've got on the carousel is mine there. No, I wasn't taking anything and I wasn't really drinking. For me, it was watching other people go and thinking, wow, this is what I'm doing to people when they're in that space. So I just didn't really get to have that experience of the high. the assisted high I was always just high on the music so I suppose my stories for the Hacienda Durham are more music related than that and were you alone in not partaking in yeah totally everybody else was three sheets to the wind and everybody thought that I was just assumed assumed yeah my twin was my twin was absolutely bang on it but I wasn't and how come you and your twin never decided to be a musical duo because she cannot DJ to save her life have you tried to encourage her absolutely no what Now, here's the thing. Yeah, here's the thing. This is what and this is why I don't take drugs anymore. Don't take drugs. It's bad. I finished my degree and I'd taken three months off from DJing and I'd moved across to home. We had a party. called The World at Home as well as Flesh at the Hacienda. And I was a resident of both of those parties. And it was my first night back after taking three months off and I'd invited all my friends to come and party at my house before we went. And we'd had vodka jellies, we'd smoked a bit, we'd had drunk so much alcohol. And somebody gave my twin a pill. So she was high at nine o'clock. She's like, I want to go to the party. I'm like, it's not open yet. No, we need to go. We need to go. So we went to the party at nine o'clock and we were in the car park listening to Pete Tong before we got into the club. It was just one of these nuts thing. We got into the... party everything's fine everyone's kind of enjoying it and I think it must have been about 10 o'clock or 10 o'clock half 10 ish someone gave me a pill and said here everybody else has had theirs you take it can I talk about this worried so everybody else has had theirs you take it so i looked down i didn't have any pockets and i looked to my right and there was a security guard to my right and i thought i can't just put it down on the decks because he'll see it I can't put it inside my waistband because it's going to melt. So I just took it. Now, I have got absolutely no resistance to drugs. So I took it and then I looked over to my friends and they were all holding on to the pillow like this. And I thought, oh, no, oh, no, because all of my friends, they have got like. you know they can do whatever they want all night I was always the one that was getting carried out for just being you know whatever having having a nibble and getting carried out I was I am a really rubbish drug taker I'm just really awful at it I can't do it just doesn't agree with me and I'd taken a full one and I looked at them and I thought oh well This isn't going to go well, is it? So it got to about midnight and I played the track Donna Giles and I'm telling you I'm not going. And it was my absolute favourite track of that time anyway. It's a Stonebridge mix. It's a brilliant remix. And it always, always lifted the room and always lifted me up. And it really did. I went so high that I could not come down. Like, it was just like, oh, God, I'm like not even halfway through my set. My room was full from front to back because it always used to be. And plus it was my first night back. So the room was really full. And I had to go and dance to this record. I just want to go and dance to this. This is my record. And I think this is also the start of me really going. around the decks and dancing and then coming back and putting another record on and going around the decks and dancing and coming back. Anyway, I had a little dance and it wore off a bit and I thought, oh, that's all right. I feel so much better. And then I'm mixing, turned around to look at my record box and all the middles had gone black. So I couldn't, it was like there was something wrong with my vision. And I thought, oh no, what do I say? How do I tell what record it is? And fortunately, I arranged my record. and I was playing vinyl at the time, so I arranged my record box in alphabetical order. That's how I find my stuff. So I'm kind of rifling it through, picking one up, putting it on and thinking, oh yeah, right, that's it. So I'd put that record on. I wouldn't know where it had come from in the box because all the middles were black. And then I put it on the... The turntable went to monitor it in my headphones and I could hear it. But then when I was bringing the fader across, I went deaf. I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This could not be happening. This cannot be happening. So I kind of struggled with it for about 10 minutes. And I knew the mixing was kind of going out of the window when the selection was going out the window, but people were staying. So it's like, oh, right, OK, just keep it. And I had like three hours more to go. I was like, oh God, this is an absolute disaster. And every time I brought a record across, I was having to sit down and get my head together and stand up and put another record on. There was a lot of huffing and puffing going on. At the time, it was just like, oh, God, this is terrible. And then I put on No, No, No. You know, no, no, no, you don't love me. And that was, it broke me. It absolutely broke me. I was just like, I said to my twin. you've got to go on and DJ because I can't do this anymore. I need to go. And the thing is, if I ever got high on anything, even the tiniest bit of a pill, I had to go into an enclosed space. I get really like crowd agoraphobic. So I need to go into a tiny little space and then I'm... fine you know safe space lock lock the door toilets you're fine so I said to Paula you DJ you DJ with Johnny everyone will think you're me they will carry it off um you DJ I'm going to the toilet to get my head together because I am off my tits hey so I left with Johnny stupidly because they were all absolutely wasted anyway and what I could hear from the toilets is her playing no no no over and over and you're supposed to put another one on you don't just play the same record all night so I was just like in the toilet like hyperventilating thinking oh my god I need to save this room and I couldn't get out I just I was just like and then the next thing was like my head was on the toilet roll dispenser and I was talking to myself like I really like it in this space this is really my twins knocking on the door he cuckooed enough put another one on to play. So no, me and my twin are never going to DJ again because she loves her music, but she could not. She doesn't have it in her head how to structure a set and play anything for longer than, you know, she could maybe put two or three together, but she finds it quite stressful. Well, obviously, she finds it quite stressful. to stand up in front of a load of people for longer than 15 minutes and put a set together. And I don't know where I learned how to do that. It was just instinctive for me. to just keep playing and just keep selecting. And I can do that for hours. Hours. I was going to ask, what's the longest set you've played? I remember doing nine hours straight at Stereo in Montreal and I'd got straight off the plane. It was one of the black and blue festival parties. And playing at Stereo is like, it's one of those hallowed ground clubs for, at the time anyway, I don't know whether it is so much now, but certainly then it was one of those clubs that, you know, David Morales had. his residency there and Angel Marais played there. And so it was like to get offered it, it was just mega. And unfortunately my flight didn't get in till, I think my flight got in at about 9.30 at night and the party started at 10. And I remember, like, I dropped my stuff in at the hotel and I just took my vinyl and the car was waiting downstairs. I didn't even really have time to change. And I was so jet lagged, I don't really remember the set. I get really, really bad jet lag. And I remember playing and getting about halfway through my set and thinking, where are... even know where I was and then then about six hours in I was like have I played this And everyone was still dancing. The club was going absolutely mental. But when you play long sets, the one question you have to avoid asking yourself because it will blow a hole in your set is, have I already played this? You can check on USB. You can check on the history. mystery but and you can check even when you're playing vinyl because you know you've stuck your vinyl and you'll put it so that whatever you've played you've moved to one side but just the by dint of asking yourself that question have I already played this puts doubt in your head and doubt is the worst thing you can have when you're playing a long set because it will it just messes everything up you have to be so sure of your journey no I like to start slow build it up and get to a peak and then come down again I like to do peaks and troughs, that kind of journey. I don't play linear. I think that's quite boring. I think you need to have moments where people are just literally scraping the ceiling and then they're down and they take a breather and then they're dancing and that kind of journey. But yeah, nine hours for me is the longest set. And it was amazing. It was a brilliant party, but I cannot remember a single record I played. And how do these long sets and your club sets in general differ from when you're programming a set for the radio? Radio is really different because with a radio set, it's generally shorter. I mean, well, it's definitely shorter because I always have a guest mix, which is an hour. And then I play for an hour live. So in an hour, I'm just showcasing new music. So I'll pick 12 to 18 really firing tracks. and just belt them out. And also with the radio set, I like to play tech. So it means that the music for the guest DJs can really shine in their own way. I don't like to play. too similar to the guest DJs that I've got because then you just get two hours of really boring all the same tempo music so I like to switch it up and I like to crank it for an hour which is much much easier You know, it's much, much easier playing a short set than it is when you're playing a long set because you really have to think about the journey that you want to take people on when you're playing longer. I don't really like playing 50 minute sets. I think that's a waste of time because literally you're just playing all the hits, you know, even if you whether you're playing disco or tech or techno. You're just playing 10 straight bangers, which is, you know, if you're at a festival and you just hear 12 DJs playing 10 straight bangers, it's just relentless and it's boring and it's thoughtless. I prefer it when DJs can play two to three hours. because then they really do get the chance to express a little bit of themselves and how we think about the musical world in that time scale. So I think the best sort of set DJs can play is two to three hours. And that's how, I think that's the difference of this set. On radio, an hour, it's just straight. this is what I think is going to be, these are the producers that I think are going to shine in the next, in the coming months. And in my club set, two hours, three hours, I like to be on a little journey, remember this, a little bit of nostalgia, a little bit of now, a little bit of now, a little bit of then, a little bit of future, and that's how I play. Whether it's disco, house, or tech, I like to mix it up between past, present, and future. And for radio, what do you like about it as a medium for communicating kind of what you're about to your audience? I like it because it gets... into everyone's home it's like it's got the key to everywhere anyone who clicks on the link whether they're in India or Russia or Paris or London or Manchester or Rochdale or you know everyone can be listening all at the same time you know specifically particularly if it's online FM is a bit different it's national and you know when you're on an FM thing then it's more you're talking to your country specifically on an FM wavelength but when you're online you're reaching everyone. And if you have a message or if you want to push an artist or if you want to educate people, I think it's a really good medium to do that. I think with everything that's come up with streaming, Spotify, YouTube, Deezer, that kind of thing. I know A&Rs and record labels are saying that radio maybe isn't that important anymore because anyone who has a subscription to a streaming service, everyone is their own radio station. But I don't think that's true because I think... you still need to point people in the direction of good music. A lot of people can discover it for themselves, but Spotify plays and their 50 choices aren't always the most interesting 50 choices. Probably 30 of those are paying to be in that chart. And what radio does is it liberates somebody to say, I can play something that isn't in that 50 that someone in Russia or, you know, or Brazil might like and hear and be inspired by and be inspired in. such a way that they want to make a track like that and then they might become the next star that makes the next record and that's how music does tend to touch people I think it's on a relay or or or it's kinetic and I think radio enables people to pass music on in that way Are there any really special radio sets that you've had? Well, My Essential Mix, first of all. And I still stand by that set. And I think a lot of people didn't really understand it. And to explain, I suppose I didn't really get the chance to explain what my thinking was behind the essential mix or my essential mix. And what I wanted to do was, first of all, tell a story of who I am and where I'd come from and the music that had inspired me. Well, it was on vinyl. It was 1998, so there was no other way of playing it. But I didn't go into an all-plush, all-singing, all-dancing studio to make my essential mix. I made it at home. And I did it in one take because I wanted to make the kind of set that people would hear if they heard me in a club. I didn't want to fake it. I just wanted to play the way I play. You know, I was criticised for a long time after that because people were like, oh, it sounds a bit rough and you should have done it this way. But I'm like, I don't play like that. And it was a bit balls on the line-ish for me because I've always, and still, I like to be authentic about what I do. And I just wanted to play the way I... play and play the music I play and present the artists that I think. were superb at the time and also what that mix had in it was I was working as a publicist for Mercury Records at the time so I was doing the press for I did all the press for Represent Ronnie Sison Represent I did all the press for New York and sold Terry Callie. Everything on Talking Loud for four years, I did all the press for. So I made a point of opening the show or the mix with three remixes of New York and sold Terry Callie and represent because that's where I was at that time. point in time and I think that was a bit misunderstood also they were dub play so they hadn't even come out yet nobody even knew what it was nobody even knew what that music was then we were just about to start promoting it so yeah that's me just explaining my essential mix and I still you know I go back and listen to it and there are you know there are mistakes in it But I don't care because even the mistakes, I can see where I was when I when I made it. And it was a very personal mix. And I still like it. So I don't care. It's nice to document kind of where you were at at that point in your life. It really does. It really does. It tells its own story. And, you know, it also says what tracks I was playing when I was playing at the Zap on a Saturday night, because a lot of those tracks, you know, some of those tracks were on there. Roger Sanchez, Ultra Nete, all those people that were. coming through in vocal house music. And there were vocals on there. There was Rome Anthony on there. There was, you know, there's classics and there was current and there was disco and there was house and there was... it's everything to do with why I love music I was wondering if your the compilations that you've curated are they in a similar way like a snapshot of what yeah they are they are some of them more than others because the way compilations work is and it's quite funny you tell the record label right I want 40 of these tracks or you'll send them a list of 40 or 60 tracks and then they will come back and say, right, you can have 15 of them and you have to use 15 of ours. And then it's like, oh, right, okay, well, I hadn't really planned on that. putting that or that or that on there but you have to because it's coming through that record label so it has to promote their business as well as everybody else's so I understand that so you have to kind of compromise and work with them I mean I suppose if you're Annie Mack or Pete Tong and you're putting out a compilation of what's coming up you know maybe for Ibiza you'll have your pick of things and also that that is how it works is if they have an exclusive on something then there there are tracks that you can't have whether you like it or not for your your compilation you can't put that on so your choice kind of gets whittled down and then you work with the absolute these are my tracks these are the record label tracks and I'll put them all together and make something really beautiful with it. And I did three compilations for fashion TV in France. And one... for Mix Club and I did one for Tool Room for Radio FG as well when I was in France so I did five compilations when I was in France I did one for Nervous Records in 2000 And I did one for Privilege in 2013. And I did their Deep House. It was a triple CD set. So Semvox did one. Martin Garrix did the EDM side of it. And I did the Deep House side with like Duke Dumont and Justin Martin and people like that. So that was who I wanted to present. for their CD yeah compilations are a bit of a weird a weird thing to do I love doing them but your curation has compromised running through it like a stick of rock but you don't have to do that in your DJ sets no well people would like you to you know the one thing that I am really fed up of people doing is showing me their phone with a request on it or a line of requests or their Spotify playlist or, and I even see it on Derek Carter's, I've seen it on Derek Carter's Twitter stream, you know, don't show me your phone and really, you know, showing a DJ a phone. When they've got the head down and they're concentrating, it's like, or even asking for a request, it's like driving down the motorway doing 120 in a Tesla and then someone blindsiding you with a juggernaut. That interruption of concentration is extreme. And if people want to really know why DJs growl at them when that happens, that's why. Because you're interrupting. It's almost like you're thinking... in binary ones and zeros like it's a mega maths thing going on in your head like you're thinking three and four records ahead you're not just thinking about the one that's playing then you're thinking three and four records ahead and if that then this And if not that, because it might not work, then you've got to have three different options. So you've got so much music running around your head. And then some person comes in asking, you know, I've had people ask me if I will play a track off their Facebook. I'm like, what now? While I'm in the middle and the room is absolutely jumping, you want me to do this? So no, no, no. Is that more of a thing that's happened like recently with the development of technology and stuff? Oh God, I really wish that clubs and bars and everywhere would get people to check their phones in. I really wish. I mean, I know. I know that it's really nice to have it documented and to take photos and everything. I'm not against that at all. But this showing someone, because everyone has access to the same music now. So whereas before DJs had the exclusive on music, we've not. quite got that anymore you know as soon as a DJ whether it's Richie Horton or Luciano or or or I don't know Marco Carolla or Honey Dijon or as soon as they play a record Annie Mac P-Tong as soon as it goes online everyone's got it everyone's got access to it whether they want to rip it from YouTube or whether So everyone's got that track and everyone's got their favourite track that they can ask a DJ for. But showing a DJ that while they're playing and trying to construct their own world for... everybody else to listen to. One is really rude. Why do you think you can do that? That's entitlement. It's like, I have this track on my Spotify and I want you to play it. No, that just gets that. I've just got that gif of the dog with the really wriggly mouth, you know, like fed up dog face. It's like, you're not making me happy there at all. Do you think ravers today who have always kind of had phones and who have never had the, just because I've never had the experience of going to a club without my phone and I'm thinking, am I like missing out? Yeah, because how I think this is what's made music and what's made the environment and the atmosphere and the ambience of clubs change is because when I started DJing and when I started clubbing, going back further than that. Either you were there or you weren't. So that's how DJs got big because people talked about the party and then the next time they came back, more people went. And the next time they came back, more people went. Whereas now a DJ plays, someone records it on the phone, puts it on YouTube, everybody can hear it. And it's not that special anymore. And also those same DJs are traveling flat out all the time, all the time, all the time. So you don't get. that exclusivity of a club night or a party or a DJ set that you used to have. You know, it's all available online, whether it's from somebody who's been at the party that's recorded it on their phone or they've live streamed it. It just takes away. all of this and I know it's brilliant and it's technology and this is how it's how it's developed and evolved I understand that I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that But it has had a knock-on effect of changing the way that people get something out of, that they feel the benefit of actually being in a communal space and listening to music with a lot of other people. And that's my 10 pence worth. How do you feel about today's music climate, specifically for electronic music and dance music? Is there stuff that you're nervous about for this community or stuff that you're excited for? No, because I think there'll always be new things. There'll always be people pushing boundaries. There will always be someone that wants to do something different or do it in a different way or go back to analogue like Niels Fram. you know mix one thing with another you know but there will always be someone who's doing something new you know even in pop music Billie Eilish you know 10 years ago it it was oh what's the name the one that sang down on the west coast oh Lana Del Rey yeah that's the one So it was Lana Del Rey 10 years ago. Is it 10 years ago? It's even less than that. Maybe eight years ago. And now it's Billie Eilish. And you look at the way she's doing it and she's like... pop star with an edge you know she's not being nice about it you know she is totally in it with the cartoon angle the justice you know suicide squad look and all of that but writing great music so you know even pop electronic there will always be you know they'll always be something new and interesting that comes through and there'll be all the commercial stuff as well because that's got to keep you know it's got to keep cash cash tills ringing but there will always be I think there will always be people doing new and interesting things so you trust the innovation I do Totally. You know, it was James Blake and then it's Niels Fram, you know, and after Niels Fram, there'll be somebody else. But, you know, for me, I can see that. as a progression, you know, and it's amazing. You know, Donald Glover, you know, you look at the way his music's gone or you look at the way that it would have been the way hip hop has moved on and the way more women are coming through in there. And, you know, certainly, yes, there are more women, you know, even though there are not enough, it's not equal, but there are more. coming through and that's great and certainly in terms of electronic music and DJing there are more women are you happy with the pace that more women are coming through I think it's great now that more women are coming through and being able to take control of their careers when I started it wasn't a career it wasn't a brand and it wasn't a job it was a bit of a laugh bit of a hobby and if you made some money from it great but It wasn't seen as steady or it wasn't seen as a career path. Is that for everyone or specifically for women at that time? I think for everyone, really, really. And then I think probably around 98, 2000s, then it became superstar DJs and they were all men. Fatboy Slim, Carl Cox, Eric Murillo. It became very much a career for men, but not really for women. And it's only much, much later on when you see like Kim Ann and Nicole Mudeber and even now Honey Dijon, where it has become a Black Madonna. It has become very much a good career path for women and their brands are strong. So that in itself is a very positive change. And I think it's amazing. Yeah, it's interesting how it's it has taken a really long time. Yeah. I don't know if I'm personally satisfied with the pace right now because I just feel like. my heroes, people like Annie Nightingale have been fighting this fight for so very long. Absolutely, and the thing is they're getting overlooked because unfortunately, and I know it does touch my life in a way. is that if you've been doing it for too long, you're kind of being put out to pasture a bit or not put out to pasture, but you're not looked at in this. same way it is very much a young people's game certainly in terms of bookings and and even in radio you have to be quite young for it and if you're not young for it you have to really fight for it so the fight is the battle is a bit bloody but I think they should make it a bit more even old to young And when there was the kind of superstar DJs coming out and they were all men, how did you like visualize a career for yourself when you had literally no blueprint? Well, there wasn't, I don't know, you know, I don't. That's a good question. I don't, it's funny, you know, I hadn't actually thought about why I stalled, but you've just explained it. There wasn't any blueprint. I didn't have any mentor. There isn't anyone. And really, until Annie Mack came along, there wasn't anyone to match. You know, in radio terms, until Annie Mack came along, there wasn't anyone to match Pete Tong. And in superstar DJ terms, there still is not anyone on the level of Carl Cox. There still is not anyone on the level of David Guetta. There still isn't anyone on the level of Solomon. There isn't, you know, there just isn't. And that's the block. There is there isn't a blueprint that there isn't a mentor. There isn't anyone who's got there. And the closest we'll get now is Black Madonna and is Honey Dijon. You know, she's coming through now, but they can't command an 80,000. you know, they're not going to fill an 80,000 stadium three nights on the trot like Swedish House Mafia. You know, they're not going to get that kind of gig. They're not going to get, you know, maybe Black Madonna. But yeah, there isn't that equivalent. And I still hold there isn't a female equivalent to any of those DJs. And I bet they're not earning the same money either. Is there anything you think we can do to kind of hurry this along? Give them a job. Give them a job. it's not rocket science. You know, they just make the lineups more even. And I know they, people will say, oh, well, you know, they can't command the same crowds. It's like, well, they never will until you give them the chance. There's a film called The Natural with Robert Redford in and he makes this big baseball square and everyone's saying that he's crazy. And he says, if you build it, they will come. People will warm to an idea. It takes time. For sure it takes time, but they will warm to an idea if you put it on the plate. It's like if you only give people beans all the time and tell them that there's only beans to eat, they'll only eat beans. But if you put beans and an egg on the plate, they'll be like, oh, my God, what's that? The first time you do it and the second time you serve it, they'll eat it. So it's not rocket science. It really isn't rocket science. You just have to offer it. Give the women the job. Make it an even split. Make sure that you've got the same amount of new DJs, mid-range DJs, older DJs. You know, mix it up a bit. you know they've really got to mix it up a bit and not have it it's the same art see i'm ranting now and i'm getting a bit frothing at the mouth because it just really irritates me because it's not rocket science you just offer it and i don't know what the is whether it's on percentages or agents or there's something going on somewhere but there's class ceiling money earnings I don't know I don't know what it is but they just need to offer it we'll get to the bottom of it in the meantime what would your advice be for all the budding DJs and radio hosts. Oh, you've got to, you've just got to do it, really do it. And I, I wish, I really wish because I'd had someone to. hand-hold me a little bit through my career. I've never had any help. I've pretty much done much of what I've done, I've done off my own back, and that's also why. it's been a bit of a slog at times and it's taken a lot longer. So I would first say do it yourself. You have to. If you love it, get out there, put yourself out there. Don't be a... afraid of failure that comes with it i have failed more times than i care to mention i've made some massive mistakes but i've had some massive successes as well and you've got to go through the fire you really have make contact with the record labels other djs find your tribe um find the people who are like you, find the people who are not like you because collaborations can come from anywhere. And once you get it going, you get it rolling, you've got to publicise yourself and really get to know the technology, not just in terms of... how you're playing it or how you're producing it, but your social media is really key. And I hate it. I really hate it for me because I suffer from anxiety. So if I didn't, if I never had... To use Facebook again, I would be a very happy woman, but I have to use it for work. I have to put myself out there. And it's a bit of a, you know, what do you call it? A necessary evil. But also don't take it too seriously. Don't take it to heart. you can switch your phone off, you can switch your computer off and you can move away from it. So as much as you can have friends and find your tribe in that circle, also be sure about having a support network outside as well. And just enjoy it, have fun with it. When I started, it was fun. It was a laugh. And now it's a business. It's not... What I wish is that the fun came back into it and it was less about entrepreneurs and business. It was more about us all having a really great... time in one room at the same time and coming away from it and going oh do you know what I've got 10 new numbers in my phone and I really like these people and oh do you remember when they played that track oh what was that I don't know it's the one that went rather than oh it's on my shazam and it was you know Forget about that. Just have fun with it. Just have fun creating something that is you, that represents part of you. And that's what I'd say. There we go. Number one tip from DJ Paulette. remember where your record box is don't forget don't forget your records and don't forget your headphones that's key yeah uh what's coming up for you next so there's still things in music that you want to try yeah yeah because I'm still I'm still trying trying trying trying to get this track down but my I'm not a producer per se but I'm more a writer I like lyrics and I like songs and I write melodies and that kind of thing. So I'm working at the moment with a producer called Mbaya in Manchester. And we've got three tracks together which are nearly finished, if we can get some time to finish it, because he's really busy. And I'd like to get those finished and into the years and in boxes of the people that matter and see if I can get another EP signed. I mean, it's me singing as well. So it's a bit life on the line with that one. If people go, oh, my God, she's got a terrible voice. No, she sounds awful. I'll be crushed and hiding under the desk. But you've just kind of got to feel the fear and do it anyway. I know I always used to, I used to sing before I became a singer. a DJ and I damaged my voice mid 90s so going back into singing is not just therapy but exercising a muscle that I haven't exercised for a long time so that'll be interesting if I kind of get that working I'll be very happy happy because I'll feel a bit more complete about the way I'm doing it.
