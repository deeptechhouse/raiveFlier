Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Over the past few months, you may have heard the terms juke and footwork entered into the wider musical lexicon, courtesy of tracks and compilations from the likes of Addison Groove and Mike Paradinas' Planet Mew. But the genre has been around for a number of years in the Chicago area. It's been a unique and local phenomenon, with stars that are only now coming to the world's attention. Chief among them is DJ Spin, whose history is detailed in this lengthy conversation, alongside Sleazetone label boss Chrissy Murderbot, who releases Footwork, UK Bass, Electro, and just about anything else on his imprint. On the ground in Chicago, Chrissy provides a unique perspective as one of the earliest people to connect the dots between these genres, laying the groundwork for the explosion of interest in juke and footwork. You were born in Chicago? Yeah, in Chicago. My family, like, from the south side, so pretty much. My mom was like the only person that moved to the suburbs and like exiled me from like being a cool Chicago kid. But it was cool. You know, it wasn't too bad, but it got worse once I got older. How so? Just, you know, with the typical growing up adolescent type stuff going on and everybody growing up without like dads or big brothers or uncles that really could like put you in the right direction. You know what I mean? It gets hard out there. And like that's the same thing that's going on now with the kids. It's like it's back to that same. like blank space and when when the kids need somebody to really you know be there for them you know it's it's not too bad as far as you know living i mean there's plenty of stuff to do plenty of stuff to get into but you know if you ain't got money you you nine times out of ten gonna get some trouble but i mean all in all i can't I can't sit up here and say like I had the worst life or something growing up. It wasn't terrible for me. I had a real good life growing up. It just got bad when I got older. For someone who doesn't know the sort of geography of Chicago, you grew up on the south side. What's sort of the difference, I guess, generally between that and the west side? Pretty much the south side is like the... biggest side of the city from South Roosevelt all the way to 127 and that's like 100 blocks 112 blocks which is 14 miles. Okay. And then you got, I mean, it's really not an east side of Chicago. So that's considered south side too. And then you go from the lake all the way to, hmm. Wait, what did you say the west side starts? Because I'm calling it Kedzie. Yeah, about Kedzie. Until the first. you get, the further west you have to be to be calling it west side. Once you're in the hundreds, there's no west side. Pretty much. There's a contentious geographical division sometimes. How should I put this? And this is gonna sound terrible. I'm gonna catch fire for this. If we're going to talk brass tacks, the South Side is mostly African American. When you start to see more white people and Hispanic people than you see African Americans, you're on the West Side. I mean, and there's exceptions to this rule because you've got pockets of, you know, like, you've got Bronzeville and Bridgeport and stuff, you know, and there's, and Pilsen, there's Definitely non-African American neighborhoods in the South Side. But if it's a neighborhood that's in question, like Brighton Park, is that the South Side or is that the West Side? Is it a pretty racially divided city? It is the most segregated city in the history of cities, period. Yeah, everything's separated by certain boundaries, either train tracks, viaducts, bridges. Urban planners had to invent the word hypersegregation to describe Chicago in their studies. It is more segregated than any other city in the developed world, certainly. It's fucked up. So, like a party that you would be playing at, would there be white people there? off if it's on the north side it depends on the party i know that's on the party yeah or downtown i mean depending on what part of downtown it may be a mixed crowd but for the most part it's either all black or we can count on one hand the number of white people who've been to the Shit y'all doing in the hundreds, man. I mean, it's pretty much me, Nima, and Dave. And Nima ain't even white. He's Persian, but it's just that people yell at me. Black motherfuckers and the Hunters can't tell the difference, so y'all call them out of the Sandler. They do all look the same. It's true. It's true. White people all, they're identical, man. They all either look like... Yeah, or George Clooney, or the Lucky Charms leprechaun, or... I mean, there's pretty much only three types. You're George Clooney. Be proud. Thank you. I appreciate that. Probably the nicest thing you've ever said to me. Well, I mean, if I had to pick, you know, you're not an Adam Sandler and you're not a leprechaun. I don't want to go back on what I just said. I'd look foolish on the interwebs. I'm not going to ask you to. When are you going to start recording? Yeah, of course. When did you end up moving to Chicago? Because you were growing up in Missouri. Yes. And Kansas. You were born in Kansas. Yeah, I grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. And, gosh, moved to Chicago about three or four years ago. Okay, so yeah. What was the reason for that? How to do music. You knew there was a good scene there or you thought there was a good scene there? I... Or you knew there was a better scene in the Kansas City, Missouri? Well, um, yeah. I mean, I knew about the stuff that was going on. I thought the chances of, you know, I basically, I mean, I was a big house music person. Also kind of following the stuff that was going on as far as juke and footwork and all that, as much as it was possible to follow that in the... you know, not being from Chicago and being in the kind of pre-YouTube era, you know. How were you finding out about footwork in the pre-YouTube era? Records, record shops, stuff that... There was the stuff that was coming out on Database and Juke Tracks. There was the old Dance Mania stuff, which was really, really big in St. Louis, Kansas City, Omaha, that whole kind of area. So yeah, pretty much, I mean, when I moved out there... I was kind of like, I'm going to work on this. And, you know, I'd kind of been working on this kind of stuff in Kansas City, but hadn't really been making any progress because it's Kansas City. And I moved to Chicago. As a white kid who is not from Chicago, I realized that there were a lot of obstacles in my way from being, from moving myself into that scene and being successful. But I figured if anyone was going to do it, it was going to be me, you know? And so, just moved. Just someone who showed up one day and started. Pretty much. Passionate about it. Do you remember the first time you met him? Man, I'm mad. I'm mad. Chrissy, man. That's what's through Nima. Yeah, through Nima. I talked to Rashad before in like 2005 because he was finna do a remix for a record I was putting out, but then his MPC broke. I would have made air quotes around broke, but nobody would have been able to hear it. But, you know. So I talked to him, but then when I met both of y'all, he didn't put together that was me. He had no recollection of that until about... It was maybe a year and a half ago? Yeah, that we actually met in person, yeah. Was it... When you got there, did you know so much about, you know... Because for a lot of people... You can flip over, please. was first discovered in a way through youtube watching youtube videos did you know about the dancing that's why yeah the parties yeah i mean most of the real kind of footwork oriented parties now happen in the south side and as someone who lives on the north side most of the stuff that I'm playing at and involved with is Northside and Westside parties, which are a little more kind of, they're a little more ethnically mixed and they're a little more focused on like just juking as opposed to footwork. So, you know, more like everybody kind of dancing, you know, like, and so. I don't see a lot. I mean, I don't see as much footwork as he does in the course of our DJ gigs. What's the difference? - Just tweaking. - Or juking at footwork? - Yeah. - Juking, I mean anybody can just juke, just get behind a girl and dance pretty much. That's just juking, just dancing to the beat. - Just freak dancing, that's what my mother would call it. - Yeah, and then of course footwork is more complicated, it's competitive and it's about style and finesse and cunning. It's what's worth YouTubeing. Nobody has... There's no videos of people juking on YouTube because... Yeah, why put a video up and something you can do yourself? I mean, that's like a common dance between... I mean... Anybody that just dances, interacting with a female, the dance of the party, you know, party style. And then you see, I mean, you see other specific dances on these West Side and North Side parties, you know. There's still like the Percolator and the SpongeBob and the 40s and stuff like that, you know, that you see. But then the actual like footwork parties mostly go down on the South Side. When did footworking first start coming into... It's been a million. Forever ago, man. I mean... I come from a dancing background, so... I really want to say, you know, like, me, Rashad, a couple other, you know what I'm saying, guys, dance groups... actually made it into something that was more so something that we did when we came to the parties which other kids followed along after you know and pretty much all this stuff usually just happened in skating rinks it all started pretty much at the skating rinks because you know we weren't old enough to go to no club or nothing like that so everything pretty much started really at like house parties basement parties and skating rinks like that was like the forte of all of the dancing pretty much like You'll go to a skating rink and pretty much every skating rink had like a disco. And you know, it'd be skating on one side and you know, they'd be in the footwork and listening to Ghetto House and the disco. And pretty much, like the first guy that I know that really put footwork on the map was a guy named Anthony Brown. and he from the south side and you know he was the one that really modernized the the different styles that's still going on right now and that was back in man like 94. what was he doing that was different than people. Alright, like people just had like they simple moves, you know, just simple. It just went from simple moves to man, he brought out the complicated stuff like for real and have everybody like, oh and like, you know, it's either if you could get with Adam Brown and he could teach you or you just steal his moves. Most people stole his moves. Did you get top five or did you steal his moves? Well, actually, I got a chance to get top bound. That was later on, I want to say, 98, 99. But it was going on before then. Like, I mean. When I first, I want to say when I was like 13, 14, that was like 94, 95, you know, like only certain people came to our side of town, which is Markham. And Markham got a big skating rink out there. And like, that was like the number one spot where like you would get kids from the city that have buses that come out the school. trips or whatever. They'd come out to our side of town and we'd learn something from them or, you know, we'd pick up more and more from the city kids. And from there, it really turned into a suburban thing after years and years of us mastering, like, the footwork from the guys from the city. And eventually, you know, them guys were older, so they stopped and we carried it on, you know, in the late 90s. to the early 2000s. So it was a suburban thing after a while. Yeah, after a while. I mean, city kids probably would never admit to that. But I was there and I seen it. And even now, to this day, I run into somebody in there and say, man, I know somebody with the coldest footwork. And I'm like... Like, come on. Like, if I don't know them and I ain't seen them, I can't say they the best. I seen the best. And I mean, they my guys. And I mean, it ain't no favoritism, but they footwork the best. Pretty much the guy that footwork the best right now. and all the legends could agree to it, is my guy Q. He like, he the protege, he the guy I picked up when he was like 12, just a little guy. And I worked with him first, and then, man, he just got out here, started learning from other people, and he just, man, he like 25, nah, 26, and like, he a monster. Is he just dancing? Yeah, he just dance. You said you were dancing to Ghetto House sort of in the beginning. This is pretty fast house music that comes out of Chicago. But when did, I guess, the music sort of, you know, you started making something that's a little bit different? Well, all that changed, I want to say, probably about 98 into 99. Like, when Dance Mania Records was coming down to a decline, you know, actually me and Rashad were supposed to have some records come out, and, like, Dance Mania got, like, in trouble for tax evasion. So... By 2000, it was like no more Dance Mania records. I mean, we still wanted to keep the same sort of style of music, but it was already pitched up. We already pitched it up. We turned it to 160.99 for sure. It was 160 for us. What was it before that? Man, we used to make tracks that like... 138, 145, like an odd number. But to be real, I remember, you know, back in the days, that was the days of tweaked decks. And even the tracks at 138. Right, we'd speed them up. Everybody would play them at 160. All those Dance Mania records. Yeah, we'd speed them up. When you open up a Technics SL-1200, there's a little... knob, well, I mean, kind of a lever next to the quartz crystal that adjusts how much pitch control the turntable has. And so, back in the day, at every party, you'd have the DJ bust open this record player to shift that little lever to where instead of getting... To where you could go 8% faster you could go like 25% faster so that you can pinch a record up from 135 to 160 and if it was I mean if it wasn't if it was too slow to do that you played on 45 and I could credit the west side of Chicago. That's true. They started the fast Like, it was real fast. It was faster than 160. Yeah. Like, they used to 45 it, and it'd go super fast. I can't even tell you the last time I heard the percolator on 33, man. You know, when I hear it on 33, that don't even sound right. It sounds too slow, man. Or there's a whole gang of tracks like that that you only hear on Club Soda by Thomas Bangalter. I've never... I think I've heard that on 33 at a club once. But especially on Westside. Westside. You hear that on 45. I used to always play there. So fast and the way we kind of adapted our dances to that because we had come from our South and go out West and dance against those guys and we like man y'all music too fast, you know, but then we got kind of adjusted to it. We won't make no excuses. We gonna dance against y'all. Yeah, I can imagine you would be like we better adjust rather than being like, oh, it's too fast. We can't handle it. We're not going to, we're not going to foul you anymore, guys. Yeah. So, I mean, like, was it the dancers, though, that, like, sort of, Yeah, the dancers, the dancers pushed, we pushed it, like, to the limit, like, man. Joe Fitzgerald. Yeah, before I was DJing, like, for real. I was really dancing and it was like we'd go to the DJ like man speed it up speed it up speed it up And then be like what speed it up man. We need some more energy with it you know it was just it was getting to that point where it was just getting too slow cuz Man the dancing was getting more complicated and it was like we needed a little bit more faster We could put more energy into our moves. You know that That's initially how it got faster, though, really through the dances. So you had a lot of DJs saying, like, really? Yeah, they, you know, it's like Southside DJs, Westside DJs, they all play their stuff fast. But on the Southside, we, man, pitch that up, man. Come on, pitch it up. And they look at us like, huh? Man, come on. And they see how they dance to it, and, you know, they couldn't So when you first started DJing yourself, it was to sort of to what your crew of dancers was doing? Yeah, pretty much. To basically give them the room to do, to compete against other crews? Yeah, I mean, because we would make them slow and then speed it up. You know, like we would purposely like say a sample slow, like. bang that shit and then speed up, bang that shit, bang that shit, you know what I mean? So it was a thing of how it sounded and at the same time to go along with how fast the dancers was going. So I mean, 160, that was a standard for us in '99 for a fact. And from now it was like, 'cause I believe Clint did the first record that was like 160. You know, with all the tracks was 160. But like I said, we never got a chance to do that. So, you know. When did you start DJing? Oh man, I started DJing like 97 officially. Like I got my first parties like 97. I was 16. So like from there, we had a spot called Cavalini's, which was in the south suburbs. Basically, I was in a dance group called House of Maddox and they were based from the low end of Chicago, 51st and Prairie. That was the headquarters pretty much where we practiced. They had parties down there, but it was just too much stuff going on, so we ended up linking up with the other groups from the suburbs, which was House of Rest 2. and House of Maddox used to throw these parties at the spot called "Captain Lee's" wasn't nothing but a banquet hall and like man it'll be packed out and like I can remember uh it used to be me, Rashad, Boo and Clint Yeah, Chip used to be there and Thaz used to be there. But for the most part, They let us run the show, me, Rashad, Clint, and this guy named DJ Mouth. He was like an older guy. He really didn't spend too much of the footwork, footwork stuff, but that's where we came in at. He was more of a hip-hop DJ and stuff like that. So at those parties, it went from being mostly hip-hop, because they'd yell at us like, man, stop playing all that footwork stuff all night. We like, "Man, that's what people come to hear." It's run by the dance group, so it's like, "Okay, we gonna see how it go." And it ended up turning into, like, okay, well, it turned around, the whole 180, from being mostly hip-hop to mostly ghetto house all night. Yeah, it was, man, it was fun, man. These kids, they don't know what they're missing. Like, and from Cavalini's, it went from Cavalini's. I mean, the skating rinks were still going on. But after Cavalini's, it was this spot called the Dalton Expo. And that'd be like 4,000 kids. Like, whenever it was the Dalton Expo, it was like a concert. Like, literally, like, a sea of kids. And like... Man, it was bananas. When was this? Dalton Expo was late 97, 98, 99. Dalton Expo Center, just so like, for people not in Chicago, everybody in Chicago knows the Dalton Expo because you can't listen. any of the urban stations without every five minutes it's like Sunday at the Dalton Expo. Will Lewis versus Jamie Principal. You don't like house music and you're a bad person the Dalton Expo Expo Expo like every it's always those ads like on the radio for it So it's like they do a lot of shows there a lot of big stuff but I'm Expo like because at first the Dalton Expo was like Ran back some some gas that was like a little older than me and like they they didn't know I even DJ They just thought I was a dancer And like the one guy, his mom like had ownership to it and they would just throw parties there. But by the time we got involved in it, it was ran by the House of Maddox, House of Rest and DJ Malcolm or whatever. And we used to, you know, make it like how Cavallini's was. We just carried Cavallini's to the next level. Did it change though once it got so big? Yeah, it just got crazy. Like, I mean, just, I mean, shootings and, you know, stuff like that. People getting beat up and chased. Because you got, Dalton Expo is in Dalton, Illinois, which is a south suburb. And you got kids from the city coming to Dalton. People from Dalton. People from the other surrounding suburbs. And it's just a big mix of different high schools. It's pretty much about what school you're in. you went to. - Sure. - Really, and that's what divided what part of town you was from. It was cool at first, everything used to be fine, then it got to be something usual to everybody, it was just something, I know I could go to the So, you know, I'm gonna catch this guy at the expo. I'm gonna catch this girl at the expo and you know stuff got you know too violent or whatever so they end up shutting down the parties. It was just too much rhetoric for the police in the city of Dalton to deal with. It was, I mean, it was juke and footwork sort of. Are the police aware of it? And are they shutting things down? I mean, the bass is kind of like the same thing with rig music. Well, now, yeah. I mean, you definitely got to have your paperwork together to really do something big, you know. I mean, on a smaller scale, they're not going to really mess with you. But once it gets big, that means... They might come for a bribe. They might want to bribe if you're on the spot. Cops in Chicago are crazy - For his health. And Chicago politics is run like it's Bolivia or something. - Yeah, Chicago is all about politics though. So if you don't got your paperwork right in 2010, then it ain't gonna go down nothing like how it was in '98, '99. 2000, you know, because so much changed as far as just violence and the structure of how parties got thrown. You know, they'd call it a raid if there's so many kids, you know, or whatever, so many persons in a building and, like, you don't got the permit for this many people to be out or something like that. So, I mean, like, it's crazy. I can give you a clear example of this. This spot we used to throw parties at. I mean, when we used to do footwork stuff, it wouldn't be that big, but the spot was big, you know what I mean? Like, we wanted a bigger spot for the kids to footwork. So we got a bigger spot for it. But at the same time, the guy who has the building doesn't have the proper license, so we tried to do just like a regular party instead of a footwork event. We tried to do a regular party, and it was until somebody got killed outside the party. You know, after it got so big, it was just so many people in there. These guys get into it, whatever, go outside, kill this guy. We in inside of the building, we like had no clue what's going on. People just come back in like, oh, somebody outside dead. Like, we like, for real? Well, I'm not going outside. So an hour later, the police come kicking in the door with M16s and everything. And this is for real. Like, they come asking straight for the DJ. Now, I wasn't going to say anything, but I'm like, this all my equipment. I got 4,000 miles worth of equipment It's mine. They pull me to the corner and say, hey. What they say outside is you the DJ, you know who shot such and such. And I'm like, well, I'm going to keep it real with you, man. I'm a grown man. I'm not even from this part of town. I don't know who is who or what is what. But yeah, this is my equipment. This is not my party, but this is my equipment. For the record, if somebody gets shot outside, DJs don't keep track of that. We don't have a doctor. Diaries, we have a lot of books. I'm not going to go outside and say, oh, somebody got shot on the league. Serato doesn't keep track of that. information, oddly enough. Maybe in the new version. But for now, we're stuck not knowing who murdered the guy. I mean, I understand where the police come from. Like, there's so many murders going on right now. And like, at that point, when that happened, it was like a hundred, I mean, it's a countdown. It's a count, they got a countdown of how many murders happened. Is it particularly worse in the past couple of years in Chicago than it has been? Yeah, it's way worse than when I was young. It's been worse in the last three years than it has been since the crack epidemic of the 80s, pretty much. It's been declining since the 90s. I mean, everywhere, really. The murder rate everywhere in America has been declining since the 90s. And we just had a spike in Chicago for the last two or three years. And the police reaction to all this was take my equipment. They took all my equipment. And I still didn't get my equipment back. And I had to go overseas in two weeks after this. And I'm like, well, I can't go to court. And I didn't get it. court case I never got arrested it was just a citation for the licensing so when I went to court it's like how do I get my equipment back Sorry sir, we don't know anything about your equipment. And now they put a first-degree murder on my equipment, like my equipment jumped out and killed somebody. And that's the difference between, like if something happened back in the day, they wouldn't do that. You know, they wouldn't just take your equipment and stuff like that. They would find a person, they would find somebody or something that would make somebody responsible for it. now they find theyself in a situation to where they can't actually pin a murder on somebody. There's just so many murders going on they gotta make an example out of somebody. I was one of the people that got made an example out of. So now we gotta keep it to a minimum or get the proper paperwork to do the proper thing for an event. And most of these murders have been in the South Side and most of these murders have involved like high school age kids. And so it's... If you're on the north side or the west side, or if you're doing something at a 21 and up venue, the cops are a lot, I mean, they're still douchebags, but they're a lot less hard on you because they don't have that same weight coming down on them. You know, I'm assuming this is all because they've got something coming down on their head from above, you know, in the department. But yeah, so it's. It's a lot worse if you're trying to do something that's all ages or if you're trying to do something on the south side. The unfortunate irony of that is that doing a 21 and up party on the north side isn't keeping any kids off the street. Whereas doing these footwork events, I mean, yeah, sometimes there's drama that pops off at these events. But for the most part, there is. the element of this is giving people motivation to do something other than criminal activity. You know? And, you know, I mean, I'm not from Chicago, but you know, in the kind of neighborhood I grew up in and the kind of neighborhood I know you grew up in, sometimes there aren't a lot of options other than crime. And we didn't even have it that bad compared to fucking people we know who grew up in Actually bad neighborhood. You know, we just, I mean, you know. For real, like, I say, like the skating rinks and stuff like that, since they already licensed established places. I mean, they have a big party. Somebody gets shot outside of there, they're not going to shut the skating rink down. For real? You know, or take the skating rink's equipment and hold it. You know, it's all political. It's all about who pockets really getting lined up with that extra cash. And that's the real. Work, work, work, work, work, work. Let me see your foot. Work. Let me see your foot. Work. Let me see your foot. Work. Let me see your foot. Work. Let me see your footwork. Well, I mean there's been times there's been times where I've actually been at parties that were illegal, didn't have any permits, whatever. And the cops come by, and the police of Chicago will say, boy, this party, yeah, it doesn't seem like you guys have any permits for this. And instead of shutting the party down, what they'll say is, yeah, you know, that's really dangerous, and, you know, the fire marshal. We should probably call the fire marshal out here. He should just shut this whole thing down. But I mean, I guess if you hired a couple of police officers to sit outside and keep watch, then we could just make it safe, you know? I mean, we wouldn't even need more than about $300. And we'll just sit here and keep it safe for you. So do you play often at parties yourself in Chicago? It depends. I'm not in the wild hundreds hardly ever, man. I'm not playing deep south. But as far as... of the what? Pilsen, Humboldt Park, Bronzeville. Do you find that there's any appetite for footwork in those types of places? Absolutely. Nobody footworks to it. The entire city, you know, this music is a big deal throughout the whole city. And everyone's aware of it. It's the music of the city, really. It's like a theme song. I mean, if you go up to Chicago. House music. Or not even in Chicago. You know what I'm saying? out of Chicago. I mean, it's one of them things that if you like it, you love it. You know what I mean? Once you get into it, it's like a gang. It's hard to get out because it's like, damn, I love this fucking music. You know what I mean? It's all about the music. And then once you get the right place and the right time to do something, anything can happen. You know what I mean? It's so sad. It's segregated as hell in Chicago. And I mean, it ain't impossible to do something on a bigger scale. But it's really up to us. Us, me, Chrissy, Rashad, Clint, Boo, anybody that been doing this for a while to really put... our own money up behind it and really believe in it and really do something. Other than that, it's not going to be done. Nobody's going to come at us and say, well, here's the funds to do, you know, Juke Fest or something. They're like, nah, they don't care. The city really doesn't care about our music. The radio stations don't care about our music. They'll play our music. They don't care about us. They don't care. You know, it's just like, okay, okay, this is made in the city, but, you know, it's not professional. Nobody's with a real record label or, you know It's all a bunch of bullshit when it comes down to it. You know what I mean? It's like no pride from the actual city or the government. You know, there's nothing from the government. Nothing comes from the state or the city that helps make this a better thing at all. Is that why you started producing music yourself in a way? After you were dancing and DJing? I mean, I was dancing and making music. Really? It was all at the same time, really. I just, you know, I mean, it wasn't on MySpace or YouTube back in the day. So it was more so like we had to keep our music underground. You know we played at the party some off our pitch decks you know mix it with the records that were out and I mean it was something that after the records got stopped pressed you know it was no more Dance Mania it's like okay it's only so long you play these same old records so we had to reformulate and man restructure the whole sound like for real in the literal sense because the guys before us Like, none of the guys before us, you know, really helped us. You know, it was more so like they were on whatever they were on. You know, they were DJing wherever they were DJing or not DJing. And we were left with the city. We were left with this, boom, here y'all go. And it's like, cool, okay, ain't nobody in our way. So how do we do this? And I can get credit when credit is due. There's a guy named DJ Thass. He started a record label called Plant House Music. He was one of the first people that actually capitalized on the word juke by putting juke on every product he put out. Like, get ready to get your juke on every CD, every tape. Rant, like we had probably through Thads and Clown House Music, it was probably about a good 15 CDs and tapes that came out. And I mean, he used to mess with everybody though, besides the people that weren't actually with his crew. You know, he'd get other DJs like RP Boo on the CD or do a CD with Clint, you know, me and Rashad. any of the new guys that were coming up, you know. He knew how to brand it. He was like the only person that really knew how to brand it. And he branded it. And once it got branded, that's when you had like a juke movement, you know. I mean, I get credit when credit is due. And that's one of the dudes that really like put that stamp on it and made people, I mean, he actually put our CDs in Best Buy, you know, real retail stores, so. You know, I mean, he was one of the people that actually had the means to do it back in 2000, 2001, 2002. So by the time we get old enough to understand, like, well, we can do this ourselves, you know, that's when it. changed once again, you know, to another level to when we got opportunities to mix it up with Godfather when he put out the Juke Tracks label and like used us really as like the forefront men to push the sound out. Like, well, I got the best guys that do the Juke Proof Chicago on my label. I mean, there was nobody in Chicago doing that. Nobody. Like nobody from Chicago was really messing with the music, you know, it was kind of a thing that the All the DJs and producers frowned upon like, "Man, that's just that juke bullshit. This is bullshit. It ain't gonna never get nowhere." And that was the attitude that they gave us like, "What? I mean, we just need some help doing something." Nobody, I mean, nobody helped, you know. Daz was one of the only people that I can't say helped. But he had the means to get things done, you know. And from the money from CDs, he got a chance to throw parties. And that's how we got a chance to get our names out here and get our CDs out here and, you know, stuff like that. When did you meet Rashad? Oh, man, me and Rashad met. Oh, shit. I mean, officially we met in high school. At home room, because me and him got up. Not the same last name, but both our last names with an H. I don't think they got homeroom now in schools, but back in my day. Homeroom. Yeah, we had homeroom to where if you had a certain, you know, last name, you know, and your name fell in that category, you would be put in that room with, you know, with a group of people with the same, you know. initials, last names or whatever. So we met in homeroom and like we were fortunate enough to have a homeroom that actually had a radio in it. Like, it was just like a, what I want to call it, like just an arts and crafts room. You know, they make balloons and baskets and stuff in there, and it had a radio in there. And I seen him. Like, he was the DJ at the skating rink, and he was one of the guys. He was so cocky. He'd come down from the DJ booth while he was mixing and dancing. You know, like, he was good. He was always a good dancer. So he'd come He had burned everybody that's on the dance floor. He had tear their ass off and then go right back to DJing. And I just see this guy at different parties. It was a couple different little parties that was going on in the skating rink. We had a spot called Jubilation, too, which was actually a big laser tag room. But it was more so just like parties. It wasn't based around footwork. But it would be that time when they would put the music on and everybody would get out there and do their thing. But, yeah, I officially met him in home. That was in 95 at Thornwood. We ended up getting around to the radio one day because the teachers used to let us use the radio on Fridays or whatever. And I put in the tape of mine or whatever. He was like, oh, you DJ? I'm like, yeah, I DJ. I mean, I was like kind of fake DJing, but I was really DJing, but I actually had no records. I would mix like two tapes together. I had like a recorder with a pitch on it. I had that auxiliary to like another radio. Another tape, mixing that with a tape, you know, before the blend come on, I mix it, take it off, you It was crazy, but he like, "Man, where you get these tracks from?" And I actually just bought a tape from them at the skating rink the week before, so it was like tracks that wasn't even released, so he kinda caught me. I'm like, "Yeah, I don't got the records, man, but I'm into this." You know what I'm saying? I dance and this, that, and the third, so he really put me on to the whole. Like the realness, like the reality of like, man, you can really make tracks if you want to. Hey man, just come over by the house or something. I got a drum machine, I got a little sampler. I'm like, what? You know, what is this? I didn't know. I thought a drum machine was like the drum set, like electric drum set. Yeah, that's what I thought a drum machine was. And then I actually seen this dude like have a drum machine. I'm like a 660. He had like a Gemini mixer with like an 8 second sample on it. He let me have it. Like the first day I went over his house, he was like, "Man, you can have this mixer." I'm like, "What?" I just went back to the house and I was just saying stuff, sampling everything, just making 8 second samples. I mean, I didn't know how to really make beats like that, but I had the idea. You know, I mean, I come from the play music and stuff like that but not on a drum machine so when you show me how to use it you let me hold it for a couple weeks or something Yeah, I used to play the clarinet, buddy. Yeah, without a doubt, man. I was cold, but I was too embarrassed to do it in high school. But he finally let me see the drum machine, and I got hooked. I couldn't turn away from it. It was like, wow, this guy's done. I mean, it seemed real long when we were younger. Things just seemed like it took a long time. But I mean, it wasn't just like a matter of a couple months. I mastered the drum machine and we was ready to move on to the next level. And he introduced me to his partners, which was Gantt Man, Jenna Rush and DJ Nathans. And they all used to DJ down at the local college station, WKKC 89.3. Before that was over with, I got a chance to actually get on the radio with him and we used to showcase our stuff. It seemed like it was a long time, but it was relatively fast when I caught on. It really had some tracks and some stuff I could play to people. And man, from then on, we was partners ever since. He got me with the House of Maddox and we both tried out at the same time. And got in house and I out to be yeah, you had to try to be in the dance group back in the day Yeah, you just couldn't claim you said actually be in the trials and everybody just sit there and look at you and look at you crazy and see how silly you look or you know, it was mostly the test you'll see if you have potential and then I got fortunate to get picked up with the team and you know Around that time, that's when the leader of House of Matic, Ronnie Sloan, he started going to parties. And, man, he put us out there. He gave us our shot to DJ, you know, on a bigger scale. And we DJing with guys like Deion and Sluggo. And, like, those were the guys we liked. "Man, we listening to your tape now. We still listening to your tapes, but we make tracks too." They look at us like, "Yeah, y'all got some high stuff." Even if they'd tell us that. I remember the first track that I made though that caught Sluggo's attention. That was a track called "Bout It, 'Bout It." That actually did get put out with Dance Maiden. But I didn't get credited for it. Thad's put it out because he was already with them, had a record out and put it on his second album. And that like it was crazy because this was Cavalini's going on and Boo like Boo just was holding down on the tracks at that time. And man, I came in, I had this tape in my hand. I'm just so happy. I got this track, Boo. I got this track, man. Let me play this track. He like, all right, you know, let me finish up. I ain't came out. I stopped the turntable. So everybody was just looking at me. Hit play on the tape. Bad bad dudes everybody they was looking at first cuz come on like a rap song, you know, I just did it about it I just sound it like a rap song the beginning and it's got the regular platform They looking like the fuck is this shit and the beat came in everybody turn out I remember Sluggo came to me and was like, "Man, Shorty, man, you putting that out? I mean, you put that out yet?" I'm like, "Nah, man." He's like, "Man, you need to hurry up and put that out." And that was the first time I remember somebody that's a veteran opening me, giving me my piece. I mean, Boo was a veteran, but he was still a new guy to making tracks. He was older than us, but he was still a new guy making tracks at that time. So it was a big thing. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, So Dion and Slogo were the two of the guys you were really looking up to? Well, uh, not really. As far as trying to avoid them. They were actually at the places DJing. As far as Southside dudes. And there was a bunch of Westside cats. There was Gerald, there was Wax Mask, there was Traxman, there was Funk. I mean, Funk, where was he? D-man. D-man. I mean like all these mixtapes we used to have all these mixtapes when we were younger like that's all the stuff we used to dance to but like the real shit that influenced us was like the Dion Mills shit the DJ PJ shit DJ Greedy like they they made like the grittiest like grimy tracks like under the ghetto house act I mean of course like percolator was like the number one motivated track to like wanting to make house music but like once they started getting like ghetto it was like man we really clung on to like the pj style uh that was like DJ PJ, DJ Lemo, Cosmo D, DJ Monty. That was like the whole low-end crew. I mean, it was different crews. Back in the day, we thought everybody used to mess with each other. But, you know, later on down the line, we knew that it was a separation. It was the reason why it was DJ PJ, Monty, Cosmo. By they self DJ Deon and Milton DJ sluggo like he was like by itself But with the low end because he was considered low in and it was it was cool, man. You know, I mean Man, it was it was them times man. Like when You didn't know you was into the scene at the right time. I thought we were late, you know, coming from the suburbs and stuff. But we were like right on time with knowing all the tracks and everything. And we was just like track fans. We just go get every mixtape that was out, every color tape, and just listen all day and dance. How has the sound changed over the past 10 years or so? I mean, has it gotten... regularized, I guess, in a way. Like, you say you produce stuff at 160. I mean, was it always sort of you started at 160 and you've been doing it ever since? Or has it... Has it changed over time? Just a couple years from '96 to '99 pretty much because we were still trying to blend our tracks with the Dance Mania style tracks and then once the records started declining, they were just putting out anything on Dance Mania and that's when we knew it was about to be over. So that's when we really changed it up. And the 160 started like '99, you know, officially. But there's been a lot of different kind of sounds and styles since then. You know, and I mean, I know that you and Rashad and a lot of cats be making all their stuff in 160. But I know Gap make most of his stuff at 150. And RP Boo always be making tracks at 155. There's a lot of different things going on. But see, I'm going to put it to you like this, though. Boo. Who can't have stopped making tracks in like '99? Like he just chilled out for a minute. Gant wasn't even around, bro. I'm gonna keep it 100. Gant wasn't around. Gant was overseas in Ibiza in Spain, you know. - He was in Ibiza? - He was in Ibiza, yeah. He was out in Spain. He was touring with Paul Johnson. Like '99 to like '02. So like Gant-- wasn't even on the scene when it was dead. I'm saying when it was dead, we had like, it was, we didn't want it like that. We wanted more input from more people, but it was, it was dead. When none of the, all 100 how many DJs that was on Dance Mania, they all stopped. It was, it was over. It stopped. They wasn't putting out nothing. Like after Dance Mania Records. It was nothing else. You were the only one who was putting up records for that scene to dance to. Yeah, well not records but recordings. Yeah. But what I'm saying is, you know, all I'm saying is that there's more variety to what's going on in Chicago and the suburbs and being branded as juke or being played at juke parties. When you just talk about the stuff that your crew is doing, I'd say that's a lot of it. And that's a very important part as far as... is what sets the trends for a lot of these other people. But it's not everything that's happening. You know, there's other people doing stuff at different tempos or doing their own. You know, you got all them internet, all them YouTube kids making stuff at 160. I ain't talking about that stuff. I ain't talking about YouTube. I'm talking about 2000. I'm talking about 2000. When it was dead, when we took it over, when ain't nobody give a fuck about, when ain't nobody care about this shit, bro, when it was dead. That's what I'm talking about. We was the only people that had mixes on the radio when the radio wanted to bring the house shit back. You know what I'm saying? We was the only ones to be 100% honest like. We was the only people doing it. What I'm saying is now, now that it's kind of built up a little more, you have a lot more variety of things going on than you had back then when it was just a few people holding it down. And you've got a lot more stuff. You know, Gant's back here. He's doing all his stuff, which is similar. You know, he got his own style. And then Sluggo's doing stuff again. And he got his own style, even if same style from 15 years ago and you know you got a whole bunch of different people doing a lot of different kind of stuff and there's a lot more diversity in it now than there was eight years ago because you have a lot more people doing it a lot more things kind of fall under that umbrella now than than there was 10 years ago and some of it's whack and some of it you know some of it's really good there's a lot of in between but i mean there's a lot of different stuff going on now, man. All I can say... Were you surprised at how popular it got? And, you know, now that more people are coming in and trying to put their own spin on it. Yeah, of course. And, like, that's really... I'll do to the internet pretty much YouTube yeah pretty much do to the internet because if it was never no YouTube or myspace or any of that like it'd be a totally different game right now like for real it'll still be primitive 2019-99 type shit going on you know but with us being out here and getting with different people that listen to the music and really put a certain standard how they wanted the music to sound you know like Godfather didn't take every track that we you know gave him he was like he used to be like man I need some more hat hats in it I need to make it more DJ friendly and stuff like that so we learned you know I couldn't say it was a bad thing to do but he He taught us how to really make our music more worldly friendly, you know, world friendly instead of just making it for Chicago friendly. You know what I mean? And at the same time, now it's getting accepted, like in the raw form now. It's getting accepted to where, I ain't even gonna say this. But anybody that make a similar sound will get noticed. You know when it was a time when we were criticized for making a certain style track like that You know like the kids not like they really caught on to our older style of tracks the stuff we was doing back when a Lot of people was like fuck that juke shit this shit crazy like they just sampling hip-hop making it sound crazy They just doing whatever they want They just doing crazy, they just doing half time claps and shit. What is this? This shit ain't dance music. I mean, when I first took my CDs out to the West Side, I'm saying this is my own city and I'm giving them a CD. And I mean, I got Shikes man with me, he's from the West Side. So he take us to the stores and be like, man, it's that South Side shit. You know, it's that new juice shit. And they'll be like This is rap. This is not no house music. What the fuck is this shit? And two weeks later, them same record stores was calling us back, wanting to order 50 CDs. You know what I mean? That was the progression right there. And I want to say tracks ain't changed. Tracks ain't changed since then. I don't know, man. Some people's tracks ain't changed, but this... I mean you make a different stuff now than you was six years ago. Yeah, I ain't talking about me though. But no, there's plenty of other people making different stuff than that. There's plenty of other people who ain't on that tip. It's just certain artists who are, how should I put this, blowing up in England. because of the internet in a way that they never blew up at home in Chicago. True. Those artists are still stuck on some 2004 shit. Fairness, a lot of those tracks they done made in 2005, 2006. and are just now coming out. So they're a year or two late and then now it's four years later and the tracks are coming out. But it ain't like they're six years late. It's just that they've been in the vault forever. I was just talking about the general... I could get to talk about us because we changed the whole format of it. Man, like... man cause at that point I'll tell you how his stuff has changed it's become and this is for Rashad too cause I love you Spin but if you say how your stuff has changed it's gonna take 20 minutes um Spin's stuff and Rashad's stuff has um Your songwriting has developed. You, you, you... Six years ago, the stuff you was putting out, they was hot, but they were tracks. Yeah. And now you make... songs, you know what I'm saying? And the songwriting of it has really developed a lot from being, oh, here's a track that's based on a sample, to actual, you know, whether it's got a sample in it really prominently or not, something that's got more kind of melodic content and something that has more of a... kind of traditional song structure that works as a thing that you listen to on its own, even if it's not a DJ set. And there's more kind of instrumental tracks, things that, you know, don't need to be anchored by a sample to still be an interesting, like, listenable song, you know? And I'm not, you know, I'm not dogging your old stuff, but, you know... both you and Rashad in the last five, six years have made really big progress as far as writing songs. work outside the context of a party, you know, which is really what any dance music has to do to be able to really blow up is to be kind of each track outside of a DJ mix has to be enough of a song to be. Something that somebody who can't dance will listen to at home, you know? Do you think that's why a label like Planet Muse finally released some stuff? I like that there's songs songs as opposed to tracks well I think they're releasing a lot of tracks you know I think they're releasing a lot of more tracky material um and and so so yeah I wouldn't say that's a I mean I know that Mike caught on to this stuff because of the internet and YouTube and and he likes what he liked and he's got a very British taste and sensibility, you know. Because he comes from a different background. Exactly. So he likes what he likes. And I know that some of his decisions, I'm like, exactly. Thank you, Mike. And then some of his decisions, I'm like, I question him. I question him, you know. And, you know, both. I kind of work with Mike and talk to him. Both me and Nima and Dave Quam have had a lot of discussions and talked to him about stuff like this. I know that Dave has worked on liner notes for a compilation. Both me and Spin are kind of... Talking with him about releases and stuff and he has that Rashad 12 inch that came out so it's not like I mean I question some of his You know some of his taste is different than my taste and and you know different than Spence taste too, but I mean he is Isn't that just a difference in taste? Exactly. Well, I think part of it is cultural, too. He's an outsider and doesn't quite view the scene the way that somebody on the ground level does. But then again... You're looking at it from only YouTube. Yeah. It's like, that's all you can... Exactly. And the thing is... But if he's marketing it to a bunch of... You know I don't mean to cut you off but see like the thing is we got season like I tell you I take lip I got ridicule we get ridiculed man. People told us like you should do this. You should do that I'm not gonna accept this shit sounding like shit. You know what I'm saying? A lot of that shit he like this shit. I'm gonna be To you I can say this because I fought for this shit, bro. Real talk. And motherfuckers told me my shit was shit. Understand what I'm saying? Just in terms of production quality. Yeah, it's quality, structure, and everything. one thing when it's a good track it's a good track regardless but i'm saying like man it's no hits it's just different sound of shit it just sounds different to him you know what i mean and that's the perception i believe he take it from and like as far as youtube go man if we put tracks on youtube for free like if we did that back when everybody was putting tracks on youtube I definitely have a million fucking plays. I never gave YouTube a track. Anything that's on me from YouTube is from somebody else that ripped it off my CD or got the track and put it on there. I never was one of them. No, I'm not down in the youngsters. They young, you know, the youngsters, they got this all in them. So it's like. I'ma put my shit on YouTube. You know, it didn't get a chance to get any type of listening, screaming or nothing. It's just straight on YouTube and anybody can click on it and listen to it and that is what it is. But you ain't get nothing from YouTube. The thing was exposure and that's what they did. They got themselves out there and that's all respectable. But at the end of the day, did that make that the right sound to put out? Because it got fucking 20,000 hits on YouTube. I mean, it's an interesting kind of thing to think about, in a way. Like, you know, you put something on YouTube in Chicago. and you maybe take a video of people juking and it may not even be being played at the same time like at that party but you know you see people going crazy to it and it's like wow this track's amazing. A lot of the videos on YouTube if it's from a certain guy that films a lot of videos He edits out the real music and puts in whatever other music he wants to put in there. And that wasn't the tracks the kids was going crazy for. And I'm just going to be honest with you. I got to stand up for Mike, though, you know, because. I'm not dogging Mike. I'm not dogging Mike at all. Like we say, it's different taste, but it's coming from a different point of view. He hearing it as something that's different and experimental. That's true. He definitely comes from a background of kind of experimental. And that's the shit I wish we had in 2000, you know, when people thought we was making crazy shit. It was the same. Shit! Shit! who I because all he came in the dubstep and started buying up all this dubstep and putting it out and now he's coming in the juke and starting to buy up all this juke and put it out and he's he's you know I've heard people People in England call him. Oh, he's jumping on the bandwagon In England and so when people say, you know, I've heard people say oh he's He's coming into this late and jumping on the bandwagon And then I've even heard Chicago people say, this has been going on for, you know, we've been footworking since the early 90s and this music, even in its current form, has been going on for over a decade and he's just jumping onto it now. To which my response is, he's still before... any other non-Chicago person in this whole game. So, you know, like, So what other name did I say? Godfather. That was it. He was the only person putting out juke music. That's it. And really, I mean, Detroit, as much as they don't hate me for saying this, Detroit's just a suburb of Chicago anyway, man. It's like the other Gary. Man, so I got mad love. I love Detroit. I love it. Detroit Jit and the Detroit Ghetto Tech is nothing like Chicago. It's similar, but it's different. comes from the same background it comes from ghetto house in the same way that juke does right and there's similarities but yeah to get them confused you can't you can't be in detroit or chicago and have and be into the music and get those they just said you hear a detroit track it's just like techno man you hear a detroit track and it's instantly you know first five seconds Oh, this is the Detroit track. Yeah. And that's the thing that made us change our style, though. Fucking with Godfather. Like, we had to have that sound. That could sound similar to what they had going on in some lake of me Troy right and invite I mean we never had to play no Detroit tracks in Chicago I'm be honest with you like that's not the thing like we never had to fight get a Detroit Ghetto take record and have to play it in Chicago like it was a hit and I'm not trying to say they had to play Oz either Oh God that Godzilla track is huge Detroit man there's some there's a bunch of Chicago records that you can't be a DJ in Detroit not on man true there's a bunch of them I mean that's the biggest one they go for dance mania and that was after the dance mania era and like that was crazy like I had one track that one track like change shit which track I said Yeah, that was that merger like the merger track But it was like what nothing else to go with that when that was out But to mix it with some old Detroit shit, and that's why they got the Godzilla remix. It's not on vinyl I mean there was the tracks, but they weren't on vinyl. And then once the Godzilla remix came out it was like that and they didn't play the regular Godzilla no more. Yeah, the real for real is that I mean we never expect that shit to leave Chicago. I mean, it for Chicago other than the shit that we made to go outside of Chicago. You know what I mean? We made certain tracks to go outside of Chicago. But then it's just the shit. Like, it's not right. You know what I mean? It's just like, it's crazy as fuck. But at the same time, I mean, if you can relate to it and you can get the groove, you can catch the groove to it, it's a beautiful thing. But it wasn't made to... for British kids or it wasn't made. It wasn't. But if they like it, we love it. It's a different sound from the average techno house or whatever house they've been listening to for however many years. And I can vouch for that. As pretty much the only person in this scene, I'm not as entrenched in the South Side stuff. as obviously Spin or Rashad or Gann or any of the dudes are. But as, I mean, I am pretty much the only person who's tied into y'all and knows on a first-hand level what that scene's about and is also tied in with all these English people and has been playing there for, you know... past four or five years and knows what all that stuff's about and and that's kind of why i want to talk to you as well because i think you have an interesting perspective on all of this Yeah, and I can tell you, you know, like, as much as the English were just completely not in the know about Chicago until very recently, it's the same thing as Chicago, you know? None of these cats had any idea what was going on in England really because they were so tied up in Chicago stuff. And so you have this whole world of like grime and dubstep and UK funky and all this kind of gray zone weird stuff going on in England that has a lot of... overlap with the Jew, but it's completely coincidental. Yeah, it's not coincidental. I ain't here to dubstep until I went to the west coast of Seattle and I thought I'm casting Seattle made I thought they made the you know because at the place I was at it was a fucking skate park like fucking huge as fuck and it just sounded like some skater music like some of that type of shit or some raver shit but come to find out it's from the fucking UK yeah do you find that your DJ sets now are opening up to dubstep or Addison groove I mean, I'll put it to you like this. I mean, right now, I mean, it's just our time. We just got our time to showcase our music right now. So that's what you're doing? Yeah, I'm pretty much going to showcase. But I'm a DJ. I play whatever I like. You know, I mean, in Chicago, I play all types of styles of music. You know, but as far as if I'm out here, come up with a new joke. Yeah, I'm going to get some juke. I'm going to juke that ass up. But at the same time, so I get back to the house. I'm about to season my ears with some more dubstep. I got put on to the real dubstep. I know where it come from. I'm knowing more and more about the things instead of like I said, I went to Seattle and I thought they made dub And I got the opportunity to spread this music to my people. Like, man, y'all should check this out. This is some good music other than the same shit we listen to all the fucking time. You know what I'm saying? If you ain't trying to listen to Gucci Mane and all that other bullshit, listen to this different type of dance music that they present from the other side of the world. Check this shit out. I know you'll like it because I like it. I love good music. If they don't like it, whatever the fuck ever, but I'm going to learn from it. That's as simple as that. As far as anybody saying anybody stole something from anywhere, I can't call that. I don't know how much of a juke the English people have ever heard. I don't know. I know for a fact nobody from Chicago has heard of us. I mean, as far as the jukebox producers, we've never heard of us except for me. Except for me and Rashad. We went to Seattle and that was about, you know, six months, eight months ago. Nah, I went to Seattle and that was shit, oh nah. That was last year. Okay, word. Yeah, me and him went up there last year. So we just got up on that shit last year. Yeah. I couldn't pinpoint it. It was 2008 at a Roughneck discotheque gig in Bristol. And that was, I believe, the first time that Headhunter kind of felt confident enough to play Juke for like 15 minutes in one of his sets without feeling like he was gonna get, you know, like... He talked in a recent RA feature about this. Yeah! It was kind of interesting. And I think the... crowd response was like, well, I'm not going to try that again for a little while. I played with that same show. And yeah, it was me and him with the headliners. of that and who else was there? Blazy was there and some dubstep DJs and I can't remember who else. Then all the local roughneck discotheque guys like Dubboy and Aki2 and Justin and Ollie and all them cats. And so, hi guys. And so... They uh... I played a whole set of pretty much Juke and Ghetto House at that party. And then in the other room there was a guy playing real wobbly dubstep. And I definitely noticed that the rooms just divided. Like, it was a packed enough party that both rooms were packed. I noticed that my room, within about five minutes, I had scared off all the dudes. because they're like, what the fuck is this shit? I haven't heard this. I'm not comfortable with this. I'm out of here for the wobbly dubstep. And likewise, wobbly dubstep man with his fucking macho ass dubstep music within five minutes and scaring off all the girls. So I just had a room full of women and then like... some of their, you know, like, boyfriends that they were forced to be in there, and then, like, the ten men that were wise enough to understand this as an opportunity. And, um, and then the other room was, like, straight up just, like, kind of... English dudes, you know, like, want to have their, like, dubstep boy time, you know, in the man cave. How did Headhunters, I mean, obviously you were playing an entire set of them. Yeah, and mine went okay, and then he played, and I think, you know, people wanted him to be Headhunter, and it was before. with the Foot Crab record, so they didn't... He said that he felt like it was kind of, yeah, the reaction wasn't what he'd hoped for. But at the same time, he seemed like, oh, I just wanted to really get this music off my chest because I'm really into it. And for the longest time he was, you know, he'd be sending me tracks and I'd, uh, I mean this was before we really emailed back and forth, but I'd email him the NEMA, I'd email him the Rashad, and every time I talked to Tony, he'd IM me and he'd be like, "Hey, are they playing my tracks in Chicago?" This was before Foot Crab even came out, it was just like, um, he was shopping it to labels and, uh, and and you know trying to get temper to put it out because he has a contract with them and and so he Would be like how they plan foot crap and I'd be like well It's a little slow. You know it's a little slow and And so he was really he was really instrumental kind of pushing this juke thing in in England and he really kind of opened it up and I saw that how much you know from playing there back then I saw how much people slowly kind of opened up to it yeah the the foot crab thing came out and suddenly everybody was aware of what was going on in Chicago and was curious about it, you know? And it's really completely changed things. But then again, I have to say that that awareness and that openness to it... um is still very much a kind of uh it's a lot of like uh white middle class university students trying to kind of find out something exotic and like electronic music nerds all these like hood ass and brixton and all the people making grime all the people making like the really like you know, more like ghetto tracks, all these UK funky cats who are like, not on the more kind of like hipster UK funky scene, but the deep, you know, like, you know, I'm pretty sure they ain't got a damn clue what we're doing. They probably don't know anything about this juke stuff. Just like... None of the jukeheads in Chicago know about terror danger or whatever, you know, and so it's it's I'd like to see kind of the more it's not a loose the way I know, you know, I mean, you know you when you when you are Kind of you know coming from a from from a from a background. That's kind of like that It's very easy when you're living in a bad neighborhood, working in your kind of own urban music scene, and you've got a million other things on your plate. It's easy to never have the time to be like, oh, I'm going to Google what going on with urban music in Chicago? You know, like, who has the time to do that? And so it would be nice to see kind of more collaboration between these, like, kind of street-level... urban music side of the British scene with what's going on in Chicago. And I've been trying to kind of reach across things to foster that. Yeah, make connections between people. Make that happen a little more. So we'll see. The last thing I wanted to ask you about, you mentioned that... In your room, all the girls came. Yes. Are there a ton of girls at these parties, or is it pretty? even or is there a ton of guys at this party? Oh, that's, well, that's a different party. You're talking about the, you're talking about the, yeah, but like, but I'm talking about the juke parties in Chicago. The footwork thing has got a lot of dudes because that's a showcase for a dancing style that's traditionally more male. But are there ever any females in any of these? Are there female workers? Yeah, it's female foot workers. But it's like very few because a lot of them are scared to come out. They don't want to be embarrassed. So they really need to practice first. Because, okay, I'll tell you. The Chicago dance group structure used to go down like this. If you had a dance group in Chicago, A, you had dancers that just danced to hip-hop and R&B. And that was like... That's what they did. You had to know how to do that for sure. Alright, and number two, at the end of every dance performance, it will be a footwork performance. That was usually, always was scripted. So you had your certain group of people that were good enough to footwork at the end of the show to showcase their footwork at the end of the show. So now footwork got so complicated to where it scared the dance groups away from footwork. So dance groups pretty much do the America's Got, America's Next Dance Crew type stuff. Choreographed dancing and they don't even really mess with the footwork. They leave that up to the footwork crews. It turned from dance groups to footwork crews now. So that's what brings in that line between when it used to just be a dance group thing. Like House of Mag, we used to do regular dance. We used to do hip-hop dance and everything. And at the end, of course, everybody get their chance to footwork, you know, do their solo thing. But over time, It changed because it got so complicated. So, at one point in time, it was a lot of girls at the party. Just because it was just parties. And it would be that 30 or 40 minutes for the footwork and the juking or whatever. And right after that, it would go back to a regular party. Now, it's like, if you... put on some footwork music at a regular party, now it's gonna start a fight between the people that have nothing to do. You know, they don't know how to dance, they just standing around, I don't wanna see these dudes footworking or I don't wanna see these, you know, it's crazy to me, it really don't make sense. Like, it used to be cool, but now I kinda understand because it's getting bigger. It's getting more to the point where the dudes that come to the party Like strictly footwork And that's what they come for They come to show off Yeah Pretty much This is I gotta say though If you're on the west side Or the north side Or the near south side It's different You still have that of guys and girls dancing together and fairly even ratios. It's not a little more female than male. And they'll dance to footwork music. Right, but it's not going to be all. man I mean and it might I mean it might not be footwork music all night they'll play some juke they'll play some cumbia some merengue some kind of house classics but it'll be predominantly juke music juke and footwork and so it's a lot more the whole kind of footwork battle culture has a developed on the west side and the near south side like Pilsen and Bronzeville and stuff and the north side like it has in the deep south side and so At the parties I play at, there's still tons of girlies there. Alright, I mean... That's just the difference that I've seen. It's a side of town. It's still a lot of parties that I DJ at. Like in Aurora, in the suburbs in Aurora. Yeah, if you play in the south suburbs or if you play in the south side. They go crazy for that juke shit. You know what I mean? That's true. They go crazy for that shit. But it's knowing the limit of how long you could play, you know, before some bullshit. Yeah, I'm just speaking from the party I DJ. I know what kind of party you DJ, so I could, you know, fucking Puerto Ricans and Mexicans, man, they love that juke shit. They love the fucking juke shit. It's like fucking the shit that they used to. And the girlies come out for that. And it's like that Chris Rock thing about the nasty little... Girls love dirty, degrading, misogynistic, objectifying, just ridiculously filthy music for some reason. And I'm not... You know, obviously not all girls like that, you know? But damn, if it's not the overwhelming majority, man, at least in Chicago and everywhere else I have played ever, you know? Like, it doesn't seem to change, you know, where I am. That's why that response was like it was in England, because there's something a little more, you know... How should I put this? I don't want to just chalk it up. You know, dirty music. At the end of the day is usually catchy music too, you know? And there's a playfulness about it that is a little easier to take. I feel like really wobbly macho dubstep is a little more kind of... Ultra serious. Yeah, and the ultra serious aggression of an instrumental music... I feel it's more threatening to women than somebody jokingly being like, hoes, take off your clothes, hoes, get naked. You know, like that, that's tongue in cheek. You know, you can't take that as like serious aggression. You know? Seriously, I was, please. Yes, seriously. Please, if you would. Hoes. Hoes. Come on, take off your clothes. you
