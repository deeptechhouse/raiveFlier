Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Monica Kruiser. She's been active in dance music since the late 80s and now ranks among Europe's best known DJs. But while she's regularly found playing festival stages in cavernous warehouses, her first forays into dance music were very much DIY. Here she tells Matt Unicum about scouting abandoned spaces in Munich for throwing her own illegal parties, blowing her allowance on records at the tender age of 13, and the founding of No Historical Backspin, an organisation promoting diversity and tolerance through dance music. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Monica Kruiser is up next. What do you have coming up on your label? Yeah, right now it's just a compilation out with several artists mainly like artists from the family artists for my label which release We are frequently once a year and some new artists. I always am looking for newcomers as well. That was my main aim, why I started to make a label, to support artists, to give them a platform, so they can release their stuff. So this compilation is out now, and then I made tracks with Pig & Dan together, and Scobar, he's a newcomer. Great EP last year on my label, plus a remix which went quite high on B-Point. Yeah, some stuff from Metody, Hristov, if I spell the name right. So how are you finding the tracks? They're sending them to you? Yeah, they're sending... Well, sometimes it happens to me that I listen to a track in a club when somebody is playing it. That happens to me now twice. For example, with Alexander Aurel, he was playing before me and I was like, oh, what is this for a tune? And he was like, oh, it's mine. I said, is it signed? He was like, no. I said, now it's signed. It's a contract. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or last time in Belgrade was a DJ who was playing before me and he was sending me stuff and I was like, anyway, interested how he's playing when he's playing before me. And then I was listening to his tracks and I really liked his tracks. And then when I was... playing with him I was playing one of his track and he was he almost he had tears in his eyes he was like super touched and I said I really want to sign this track and send me more stuff and so that's how it can work and then yeah if they send me demos I'll try to listen to them but I have to admit I so many demos a day it's it's really sad because I want to listen to them all but sometimes I I just can't you know it's I need to hire somebody and even with one person I It would not be possible to listen to them all. Do people send you totally random music as well? Like hip-hop? No, no, no. It's always usually techno. Yeah, but sometimes you think like, hey, this style doesn't fit to my label. Why do you think it works? But my label is quite open-minded. It's not only like one style. It's like me. I have a big variety of music, but sometimes it's like too hard or too commercial. It's like, hmm. Okay. Thank you, but no. Do you ever ask for changes in the tracks? Yeah. Like what kind of things? You know, I feel as well kind of bad when I say, hey, can you just like get rid of the snare drum roll or change maybe this and this? Because I know by myself as an artist, it's your style or it's your expression, how you feel. And who am I, me, Monika Kruse, who can say, okay, this has to be done. so it's better it's just a suggestion if we would say it's us this would say no that's my style i would totally say okay yeah okay i agree but of course i feel a little bit bad to say could you change and or if somebody's sending me a remix and i ordered a remix i said i don't really feel it Because making music is such a very emotional thing and very personal thing. So I know it hurts if somebody doesn't like your music or get criticism. So when did you actually start the label? 16, no, 17 years ago. So you used to press lots of vinyl then? Yeah, I still press vinyl. Ah, I didn't realize. Yes, yeah, but it's important for me because I'm a vinyl lover. Yeah, I think I should never stop pressing vinyl. Was there a period where you didn't press vinyl? No, no, no. Like in the bad vinyl days? No, no, no. Wow, nice. Because lots of people had it. Oh, I lost a lot of money. I was, yeah, I was even like, I got a letter from a financier, from the money lawyer. The tax department. The tax department. you're losing continuously over so many years money. Yeah, it's like, what kind of business are you running? Yeah, like, what kind of business? We don't see that as a business anymore. That's a hobby. And I was like, oh, fuck. I have to do it. I have to change something now. Where in Berlin do you live? Next to the park. So it's really nice to go out. Watching all these families in the summer doing the barbecue. So how long have you lived there for? Since four years. So not so long? No. I lived in this area now almost 10 years. Before I lived in Moabit, 10 years. So quite a long time. Moabit's pretty cool. I've been there recently. No, no. But back in the days it was only cool because the rent was really low. I mean, we had no money. DJ fees were down. We had a 100 square meter flat for 250 euros. Warm. Could you imagine that? It was pretty amazing. Things have changed. Yeah, but at this time there was no coffee, there was no restaurant, which was good. People on the street were really... As a girl, you did not feel comfortable going there in the night, to be honest. It's a funny thing though, like with rising rents. It's like what do you choose? Would you prefer to pay more when the rent gets more expensive? You're paying for the convenience of having all these nice things around maybe. Yeah, definitely. I mean you want to feel comfortable and If you're young and you don't have so much money, you don't really have a choice Well, if it's if you earn a little bit money and then you're like, okay, do I really need this new shoes or Let's spend it on a nicer, you know, surrounding. So do your neighbors know that you're a DJ? Yeah. After a while, they recognize it because of the music. Yeah, but my neighbor now, he's super nice. He's always texting me when I'm too loud. So you have a good understanding. Yeah, it's important. Neighbors, yeah, if you need help, neighbors are the first one you ask when you need help. I always, for me, it's generally in my life, it's very important to have good relations around me. It makes life easier and more peaceful. Has this always been important or you had to, something happened one day and you realized, I should have nicer people around? I think I'm a person in general that needs harmony. Every negative thing just brings you down with your emotions, with your creativity, because you're blocked in your brain and you keep negative aspects and problems too much space. And that brings you down. And so it's nicer to have a good surrounding and good relationships with everybody. And if there's a problem. try to solve it in a good way and not in an aggressive way because that... It's not about like that you won because it's more about like, hey, how can we, you and I have a problem. How can we solve it together? That's my. Yeah. Positive action. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because it's so easy to dwell. It's so easy to become obsessed with negative thoughts. Totally. And then sooner or later all you're thinking is like, oh, this guy is so annoying. This girl. Yeah. Totally. And then my creativity goes down. You know, if my brain works only about this topic, then how can I be creative? Or if I have problems or when my heart is broken or, you know, this relationship or when somebody in the family is sick, it's really hard to focus on. creativity yeah for me so did you have to train yourself to be able to do this to block out negative things yes yes because um when i'm on on the tour Sometimes it's very stressy, you know, you don't get so much sleep. It's not so easy to calm down. People try to talk to you, which is nice and understandable. And then you have to deliver, deliver. And there's a lot of pressure when you DJ. So it's important for me to take myself a step back, like with meditation, with yoga, with a nice walk outside, with nature. I need nature. That makes me happy. And of course, meeting people, have a good deep talk. So that's why, for example, I take a time out as well every year. Two months is good for me. You're on holiday now, right? Yeah, yeah. Nice. Well, it's not really holiday. Still working. Still working for music. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And going through my old records, for example, or I just learned Reiki. You know, I want to do something besides that. I play a lot of piano during the day, which I have the time normally so much. Yeah, doing all this stuff, I don't have, when I'm touring, I don't have the silence or slower mood to do it. So now I can do it. But still, like, new ideas which comes in, like, hey, a new logo, merchandise, blah, blah, blah. I can now focus on and that's good. So I'm still working. And I was in a studio with Pick and Dan. So that's another thing. So when did you start having these breaks? When did you realize, hey, I should have a two-month break every year? Once I did a three-month break that was already like 15 years ago. And then, okay, three months is a little bit too long. 13 years I do this Panchakarma treatment, which is an old Indian detox treatment, like you're cleaning your body, your soul. You clean yourself and you clean your brain, you clean your body. I do it every year now since 13 years and it helps. It makes me really alive and gives me the power for the rest of the year. And actually a lot of other DJs are doing it too. Like Sven Fade is doing it every year. I think Dubfy did it quite a few times, Richie Horton. my grand boy I met the last time and I even met you know all the Cosmopop guys once in Sri Lanka with Magda I was going there on a very little house and I think for it was only 10 rooms you know and who was sitting there Robin from Cosmopop and was like no way and he was yeah and you know what Magda is one village further on with, you know, Stefan. And I was like, okay. It's a little secret we all do to get more power for all these travels. So how long were you DJing full time for before you realized this was a good thing to do? Now I'm DJing 26, 27 years. I started in 91. 26 years, wow. Yeah, so 13 years ago. Half of my DJ career, yeah. So you were living this party life for a while? Just DJing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Drinking on the weekends, this, you know, DJ life. Yes, yes. But when you're young, you have so much more power. But after a while, if you do a lot of gigs, you feel like, okay, I need to give my body something back. And you grow up, you know, you get older. When you're young, you don't think about, hey, how much did I drink tonight, really? When you're getting older, you're like, hmm, maybe I should take care more about me. And is there something else? And how can I balance myself? We teach, we speak about these things like, hey, what's your things? And then you see colleagues who break down, you know, who cannot play anymore, who have problems. And you ask yourself, OK, it's not such an easy job. You should take care. So what are the hardest things about it? The travel, of course, would be pretty tough. The travel and the jet lag and staying up all night. I like traveling. I love it. It's not the travel itself. It's just like being on the airplane with the dry air, going to countries where the time change and then you have to play even later. And my buddy, if I force my buddy, hey, sleep now so you can play later. My buddy says, yeah, but it's not time to sleep. It must be so weird. You get off the plane after some, I don't know, eight hour plane journey or longer. Yeah. You go to a dinner and then like you're already in some weird like days. It's kind of very, very trippy. It's very trippy. Yeah. Somehow after a while it happens to me even. If I did not sleep for one day, the body changed. It's like, no, now I don't want to sleep anymore. Now you cracked it. Yeah, the body says, I'm okay again, you know, let's go on. So can you be really relaxed? Like, just say you're really tired. How do you stay happy? I don't know. Are you just really glad to be able to DJ soon? Yeah. What are you thinking when you're at the dinner? You haven't slept for a day. Okay, when I'm at the dinner, I'm like, oh. Bring me the food. I need to go to sleep. But when I enter the club, sometimes I'm really scared because I'm so tired. But then when I see the energy and the crowd and the happy faces and I'm like, hey, then this comes to my mind. I'm so thankful to experience this, that they booked me here to Argentina or Australia or whatever. This is so amazing. And then I hear the music and this music gives me so much power and the good energy of the. people and then you exchange the energy sometimes even I mean I thought how can I you know play now these three hours four hours and after this I'm like asking the promoters hey can I play more can I play longer it's like wow it can turn around and yeah because I love my job I love what I do I love spinning the music I'm thankful and if it's a great night it's hard to stop you know but after this I'm like after I played the last record I'm like okay okay yeah well yeah yeah I think I'm tired So when did you start looking at DJing as though it was a career? Like when did you, was there a point that you realized, hey, it's not just fun anymore? Well, of course it's still fun, but that it was a career, like that it was a job like anything else. Back in the days, I started in the 90s, like 91. When I DJed, I was happy. to get 50 German marks that was 25 euros but I bought records for every week a week for over 200 euros so I had to work besides that to to pay my rent and to pay the records and so it was never in my mind I can live out of it you know a DJ was a music maker for the night and I started to do my own illegal parties. There was not even a techno club when I started. And I was even, I was starting actually with Funk and Soul and some Deep House in the years. But after a while, suddenly there was the first techno club. Suddenly I was, I had the first bookings outside of Munich. I was moving when I was a child from Berlin to Munich. Yeah, and then I was like, hey, okay, I get some money more. Nice. But it took me seven years to pay my first rent. And that was only the rent of a very cheap flat. So still it was like, I never saw it as an option for my whole life. I thought, okay, now I'm going to do it. I was studying besides that as well. I quit my studies and I thought, okay, I'll give it a try for the next couple of years. It's fun now. And when I'm 35, I stop and get a real job. Did you know what job you wanted to do? Did you think what you would do afterwards? No, actually, I was never the girl who was planning anything. through my whole life you know I never had this plan to reach I have to do this and I have to bring out this record on this label to make me famous or work together with this guy that was never me I always did it with my stomach and with my love for music and not thinking Yeah, and then I became 35 and I was like, there was no option to stop it. I was like, hey, this is me. This is what I wanted to do my whole life. I put my first money, which I got from my parents in the age of 13, into records. I did not buy any shoes or any makeup. No, straight. I went to the record store and bought my first record. So that's my passion. I spoke with my first boyfriend, which I had with the age of 13. And he said, yeah, you were so always this crazy girl who was so much into music. I did not really understand it. But now I see what you made out of it. And that's really great. And yes, it's my passion. Music is my life. So there's no option to stop it. Do you have many non-music friends from outside DJ world? Yes, a lot. Actually most. Really? Are they from old school days from when you were younger or you're still meeting people now that you're meeting people outside DJ life? I still meet people outside DJ life. I even meet people inside DJ life which are like maybe just coming to see this party but actually they do something else. A driver for example, a driver who drives me to the club or something. When I go to yoga, I meet other people. Through my relatives here in Berlin, I meet other people. So, yeah, I'm open. I'm open-minded. And it's good to have other people because I don't want to talk only about this new track and the last party. I want to share experience about things and different lifestyles or different opinions. Once it becomes such a central thing in your life, you start looking for other things maybe because you know it's always going to be there. Yes, definitely. And I have these talks enough, you know, when you sit down with a promoter. in the evening before the club it's only this topic so what's the what are the main like what kind of the questions what do you chat about at dinner how does it work when you're a dj i don't think i've ever yeah i mean mostly like who played before last week we had ricardo villalobos and you know these things or gossip But sometimes you go into a totally different direction. played in Stockholm. We suddenly started to talk about diving. It always depends on the person. Sometimes it clicks and you can, you just go to different directions or even politics, you know. You're pretty socially active when it comes to social issues. Yes. I guess at the moment with the internet, it seems like that stuff. is coming up again. But actually, it's been around for such a long time. Like linking techno and house here in Germany with social things. Like no historical backs Finn. Yeah. It just seems now like, it seems like there might be a new wave. linking dance music with political issues. When we had this topic about racism back in 2000, when I started No Historic Backspin, this issue was really widespread in Berlin. So there were a few groups who started an organization against racism. They stopped after half a year and I was still continuing. Some people were always like political statements like Seth or Seth Toxler, Gooty. So I guess it's always been there. It always depends on the person, I think, more. Because some people, they never post anything political. Do you find that lots of DJs do think those things, they just don't post it? Yes. Like if you chat to a random DJ, there's a good chance they'll think the same way as you. Yeah, yeah. But they're just not. Yeah, they don't post it. They want to leave it outside. Why do you think it's, why is it important to you? I have an opinion. I'm a human being. I'm not only a music box. I think it's... important to stand up for things, you know, and not only like living this hedonistic lifestyle and just like, hey. It's important to think about these topics or to make a sign, you know, like this is not okay or think about it or get involved. I mean, it touched me as a person. And when I'm touched as a person from something, like, for example, this march, this women march, I have to write it down that I'm really touched that so many women went on the street to fight for the rights. But also it's kind of sad that we still have to go on the street to demonstrate and to say, hey, these are our rights. Please respect us. And why should I not post this? I'm a woman. It affects me. I have this trouble all my life. And if something is affecting me as a human being, it affects my music. So for me, it's not a separate thing. Music is me and what is happening in the world is affecting me as well. So why should I only show one side of me? and always be the happy, happy money. Yeah, world is so easy, blah, blah, blah. No, that's not me. Do you ever get any resistance? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Or in the early days, were people like, hey, you should leave the racism out of it? Yeah, of course. This is techno. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Really? Yeah, yeah. So what kind of things would people say? This is post of the march, for example, that some people were writing Yeah, why don't you not write about the refugees in Germany and the crisis and what happened in Cologne with the rapists? This water baptism. It's called water baptism. Yeah. Or when I wrote something like, hey, I'm really shocked. about what happened in Paris. Again, people, why don't you write about what happened in another country with war? You know, it's like, again, what about autism? And especially if I write, I care for refugees, then, oh, yeah, I get a little shitstorm. Really? Yeah. Wow. But I know that. I know that. I'm aware of that. But it's me and why should I hide my opinion? Because of people who think different and want just to be negative. And what about before the internet was big, when you would put on these parties? Yeah. Were people only supportive or were there also people questioning? Why link? I don't know. Some people were questioning like, yeah, you're talking about tolerance, but so you should tolerate the racist. And we had even some Nazis on our parties, on the first few parties at the Tresor in Berlin, for example. Yeah, they came and they want to start a discussion like, oh, Holocaust never happened. good because I don't want to exclude them it's important to talk and back in these days with the young people we still could talk right now so I'm really sad what happens on Facebook there is not a talk it's just like you are wrong you are wrong I don't accept your opinion I don't accept your opinion it's just like It's a war. It's a war right now on Facebook. It's, yeah, it's disgusting. It's really sad. Yeah, it's pretty bad with the internet. Like how everyone's just so aggressive. Yeah, yeah. It's sad because, you know, I always have this opinion like, okay, this is my opinion. I see the world like this. This is my reality. You have a different reality. So show me and explain me why. Is your reality like this? And then I can open up and say, and I can learn, you know. With some things, I change a little bit my opinion, you know. It's about respecting and seeing. The world, we're trying to see the world through their eyes. But if their eyes are full of hate, well, then it doesn't work, of course. How many parties did you do when you first started No Historical Backspin? How regular were they? Back in this first year, I was, I was, we did a tour even through whole Germany. Seven parties, eight parties. Yeah. That's pretty cool. Most of them in East Germany. Not even all in clubs, even in some empty military bases. And yeah. So it must have been a pretty big thing for a while to go on tour. You should do it again. That'd be cool. Yeah, but it's so much work, you know. And right now, a lot of clubs, they don't want to. get involved anymore in this political thing. Because they'll also get attacked. Yeah, of course. Yeah, they lose people. They lose the crowd, customers. Man, that's so weird. Yeah, I mean, it's the same. It's a tough situation for them. Yeah, it's the same. I just saw Oliver Kolecki posted something. It was not really political. He just, like, shared a link. And then somebody wrote like, okay, you posted something political. Now I delete all your music and will steal the music illegal from platforms. Yeah, I've also seen these comments. Hey, come on. I mean, okay, you become a criminal because somebody's posting a link, political link. It's ridiculous. It's sad. Yeah. So if it's February now, you're on your break. Yeah. That means summer's going to be pretty busy. Yes. Right? Yeah. You're playing a lot of festivals. Yeah. Time Warp for this. Yeah. I was kind of thinking, obviously you haven't always. played such huge stages one thing that's always been interesting for me yeah is you obviously started out djing in clubs or you know smaller parties what do you need to do differently at a festival compared to a club yeah i mean when i play in a club of course i play longer sets and you can what i love to play is sending the people on a trip like mostly starting slowly or deeper and, you know, and then building it up, having some peak time tracks, going maybe down, make a break and building it up again. And when you have only like one and a half hours time, how can you really make a build up? and I have to, mostly every DJ is like trying to play their peak time tracks. So you have to follow the level of energy too. You know, it's hard if you really make a super break. Yeah, if the person playing before you is also playing really banging loops, you also have to. to yeah if you come up and play softer people will leave yeah then you'd be like get really uh The crowd doesn't really like it. So I always try to check who's playing before me and what time I play, of course. Because even sometimes when a DJ is playing super hard and it's in the afternoon, I don't see the point in the afternoon and outside. Maybe I don't see the point why I should play like super hard techno. Sometimes I really make that break, but normally I play more powerful. When you talk about a track being powerful for a festival, it's not just tempo, obviously. No. What are the sounds that, what makes a track suitable for a festival? Is it like a really loud sub bass or, I don't know, the kick drum is really... I don't know. It's just like when I hear records, I know, okay, this is like, yeah, this is a peak time track. It's when a break, the special kind of break, the bass drum is really like kicking. Melody is keeping in your mind or the rhythm is keep on going. You know, they are. tracks who are like really slow where the rhythm is laid back and that's different you know but you know other people play this as well if it's their style why not one question i wanted to ask is just say you have you have a friend that plays in clubs once or twice a month and all of a sudden they have to play at time warp at midnight okay what like advice do you give someone who knows how to DJ in beat match, who knows how to like make a set flow? Yeah. But obviously it's such a different situation. So what skill do you have to have to be able to play at Time Warp that maybe, yeah, what would you tell someone? Well, it depends where you play because Time Warp, you have the super big stages, the two main stages and where I played sometimes, but I played also in this little room where, for example, Laurent Gagné is playing his long assets. So this little room is like a club. Okay. So you can play more deep there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And when I played this main room, I was playing at 11. And for me, was 11 still like a warm-up thing? So still I'm thinking about, okay, people just arrive. They want to get into it. I can build it up because it partly goes on until the next day. It's like, hey, we have enough time to hear all the bangers. And I think about not about only me as a DJ. I think about the whole concept of this night. to introduce the people to the night and get them into the whole party feeling and not like bam, bam, bam, now it's peak time. It's just like, hey, okay, we come together, we share. And then later on, you can hear all this bam, bam, bam techno. Think about where you play, when you play, and who's playing before you and after you. So it's not so different from a club because you would still think about those things at a normal club night. Yeah. I mean, that's me. Some people do it different. 140 BPM, bag and kick drums, no melody. Yeah. Once I heard DJ Rush playing at Time Warp, was it? Yeah, at eight. But he was doing his DJ Rasta. Well, okay, I see it differently. But for me, techno or electronic music in general was always a big variety. You know, for me, it was not only one kind of sound. You know, when I started playing. electronic music I started with deep house so I'm still like I love to play tech house deep house with melody and then going harder I have this I can choose from my favorite tracks some people only have one style so they cannot really change But I'm happy that I like this and I like this and I try to combine it. That's for me interesting to do it. Yeah, and it's also more difficult to combine different types. Yeah, yeah. It's easy just to play one style over and over. But by myself, I get bored if I would play only one kind of style. You can play the tracks in any order. Yeah, there's no peak, there's no low, there's no... It's, yeah, I need this goosebump effect. Like, oh, what's this? Yeah. Did you gradually work your way up? I don't know what the best name for these parties are, but these massive festivals, I'm talking like, you know, Time Warp, Love Parade kind of numbers. Was it a gradual ride for you to get... to playing these huge events or did you was it was there a sudden change where you went from playing to clubs to all of a sudden hey monica we have this open air there's 5 000 people i mean back in the days uh in the 90s there were not so many festivals i mean we had mayday and we had time warp And yeah, after a while, Time Warp was asking me, I think, 1998. And did it seem like a big step up for you? So all of a sudden play Time Warp in terms of how big the stage was and how many people were there? Yeah, for sure. Stage-wise, yes. Yeah, you can tell, yeah. And do you remember how it went? I think it was a big warp. They had a lot of tents. It was in the summer. And there was a thunderstorm coming. So they lost a few tents. And very crazy for us to play there. It was great, but they had a lot of trouble. And we were concerned about how it's going on with the thunderstorm. That's what I remember. And I remember because we were playing before there was a little love parade in Munich called Union Move. And they were inviting us, Sven, Richard Barthes, DJ Hell, Tom Novy and me. We had to play on the same day in Munich for this parade. And then in the afternoon for a time warp, we were sitting in a little private jet. And the private jet was super bumpy. There was this storm. And then suddenly Sven was asking, does anybody believe in God? And I was like, yeah, me. And the guys, at first they were like, no, no, no. And then they were like, yeah, sometimes we pray, you know, when we're scared. That was so funny. Yeah. So that is what I remember. That was a strange day with all the storm and being scared. Stefan lost his tent and lost a lot of money. So the tents were getting destroyed by the rain. And the festival went on like the music didn't stop. Yeah, I think the tents were destroyed before the festival went on. It was no danger. We were just sorry for Stefan that it went so bad. But he's doing okay now. Oh, yeah. Chime Wolf, is it bigger than ever? No, it always has the same stage. But I'm so happy. I mean, he has such a great lineup and he's supporting the underground since the 90s. And I have big respect for all their work and never did a sellout and what they tried. The sound, they always put more into the sound and more into decoration, the lights. It's like everybody, every DJ wants to play there. And when can you say that, you know, and everybody is staying on and dancing. And it's like a... big meeting for all of us. It's like, yeah, and having fun together. So normally on other festivals, people leave, the colleagues leave. They don't listen to your set. They don't dance. They do. It's, yeah, but time warp is different. And I guess it gives you such a nice feeling when you're playing. Yeah. Your friends are also hanging around. Yeah, super nice. Yeah. Is there any other event you've played so much? Belgian Fuse in the 90s. Yeah. Was it common for someone to be a resident outside their home country? No, no, no. And they stopped after a while. Oh, really? To do that, unfortunately. But normally, no, it was not common. And when did you travel to the US for the first time? It was in the 90s as well. I played Limelight. I remember that. And then another festival I was booked. And yeah, and I played Chicago together with Luke Slater and Dieter Pierre. I was a huge fan of Dieter Pierre and I was very nervous to play with him. How was it? Yeah, it was in a sports hall, you know, and the sound was really shitty. The people were wearing these white gloves. And then long sweaters with long sleeves and sabotage, you know, sabotage, the old fashioned. I don't know it. Everybody was like, there were not people not wearing black. It was this rave fashion. Yeah, rave fashion. Totally, totally. funny heads. Yeah, it was fun, of course. And I was wondering, like, when European DJs went over to the US, was their DJ style really different? Or there wasn't such a big difference in their DJ style? Oh, back in the days, you know, after me, after a while, I mean, I started with Deep House, but after a while, I was not playing smooth at all. Really? Yeah, I was getting really hard. And so, yeah, there was no difference. I mean, Luke Slater was always playing hard and I was playing on the techno floor and DJ Pierre was on the house floor. Yeah, so they made already this difference in floors, like techno and house. Like in Germany, I mean, and the other clubs like Ultraschall, we always had a techno floor and a chill-out floor or maybe a house floor. Back in the days, we had chill-out floors. It was so nice. Yeah, it doesn't happen anymore, does it? Yeah, I don't know. I don't understand it really because there is so much good music, so much good ambient music. And they really had great DJs back in the days, like Mixmaster Morris. And I remember once at the Ultrashot Club in Munich, they even had a festival with only ambient music. And people came with their bongs in Munich. Can you imagine that? And yeah, taking mushrooms and chatting and lying down and just listening to the music and cuddling and maybe a little petting. So yeah, it was people really wanted to experience the music. And I miss that. I miss it a little bit that. Because there's so much more in electronic music besides the danceable. It's just like all these sounds, all these open-minded frequencies. Yeah, they should put it back. Yeah, I wonder why it went away. Yeah, me too. Maybe because they couldn't sell so much drinks then. That's exactly what I was going to say. Yeah. What were the clubs in Munich? Ultraschall? Harry Klein is still there? Yeah. Harry Klein is shot. Yeah. No, no, no, it's still there. Is there any other club that's been there so long? I mean, Ultraschall closed beginning of 2000-something. Yeah. And Ultraschall was always different, especially the first one. They invited, you know, first bookings were like Jeff Mills and then Underground Resistance and people like this or Early Creed and all these people from Vienna, from the cheap label, Patrick Pulzinger, Electric Indigo. So it was always this more experimental music. And then as the other clubs, they had big, big raves next to Ultraschall where you could hear like Sven Fede or Carl Cox. But it was a totally different sound than Ultraschall. That was very interesting. So it was this little, little weird club. And would you go to both? Yeah, I was more the Ultraschall girl. Yeah. So how was it in Munich in the early days? It was crazy. Yeah, you wouldn't believe it. Music back in the days, even before Ultraschall started the club, we had a big underground scene. I was starting to do the first parties, the post parties in the club. But then... I was trying to get to do parties outside of clubs, like in a military base or bunkers, in empty houses on lakes or even in trams who was moving. That was really funny. For example, in a tram. We had to put a power aggregator, a power machine inside because the engine of the drum did not connect with the power you needed for turntables. And there was a DJ with turntables in the drum. We had a bar. And it would drive around? And yeah, it was driving around and you could rent it. I was seeing it once with the blast music, with the Bavarian. And I was like, hey, we do it with techno. So the house drum was born. And yeah, we had even had a smoke machine inside. So who would drive? The normal drivers? So it's kind of like a boat party where there's some like old guy. Yeah. What the hell are all these kids doing? Totally. Just trying to ignore them. Yeah. And once we were even stopped by the police because they thought the tram was burning because of the smoke machine. And we were like, no, no, it's a smoke machine. And we had to do this little breaks when we were driving because people had to go to the toilet, of course. And then they were dancing on the street, so no car could even move. And we had this little street party for maybe half an hour. And sometimes even people left their cars to dance with us. little love parade but just like for 30 minutes and then we were moving on with the drum and it was amazing amazing times and when I did it in illegal places actually always the police came but at this time they didn't know about techno they did not have this negative thinking about this kind of music And they always gave me a warning once. They said, oh, lower down the bass, otherwise the house will fall down. So, yeah, it was a great, great night. And even people played for free. Like I invited Chris Liebing one day. Move D wanted to come to play for me. Yeah, it was amazing. And we only had flyers, you know, we had flyers and people were telling each other face to face. There was no Facebook, there was no other social media, you could spread the things. But at the end, on my last party, we had over 1000 people coming, you know, it was amazing. Yeah. Would you get into trouble putting on these parties? No, but as I said, every time the police came and I was talking to them, I had always either me or somebody else from people who helped me who had a birthday. So we said, oh, it's a birthday party. I've also heard this excuse. When the police come in, you turn the music down, like 300 people are like, yeah, it's a birthday. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we did not ask for entry fee or, you know, it was like, or the beer was like 12 euros and... We just said once to move the party and then we just build it up another place. We always had a second option. So if we got shut down, we just move. So how long would the parties go for? Oh, until the morning, until eight, nine-ish. And what after hours? happening also? I don't know because you know I was the one who was building up the party that means we have to clean the house or the place or whatever we had to bring all the beer all the drinks build up some kind of a bar, build up the turntables, build up the aggregator, the power thing. Generator. Generator, thank you. And putting some gas into the power generator. And then after the party, because it was not a house you could close or a place you could close when it wasn't a lake, we had to, I had to bring it back. So, of course, no alcohol. And at nine o'clock, hey, and you have to bring it back until 12 before it close. We had to stop it on one time. So for me, of course, no after hour, just like getting and getting the, you know, empty bottles together, cleaning up. Yeah, I was the first one there and I was the last one there. And then I was tired. So you must have been really obsessed with putting on these parties. Yeah, totally. So what did you like about it so much? I mean, actually, I was like, when I was every day when I was in Munich like going around I was looking at spots it was like a passion like oh I can do it there and then I was thinking okay if I do it at this place how far away are the neighbors and is it good reachable with public transport you know because People did not, all the people had cars or were young or whatever. And is it dangerous to do it? You know, some people are tripping. You don't want that to fall down somewhere. You know, all these thoughts. But it was so much fun. It was like I was getting so excited. It was like, hey, we create something and we can play our music and we come together and it's a new movement. And we felt so free and very naive as well, you know. we can do it we just like never thought about any negative things just like positive things and there were no rules of how you should dress how you behave just behave nice and get together and from I made a lot of I met a lot of people on these early days and still Like Peter Fleming was doing now, Harry Klein, you know, we met back in these days. A lot of people who were there from the beginning on in this scene, they still do clubs, they still are involved because it was their passion as well. I was reading that when you moved to Berlin, you didn't want to DJ so much. True. Yeah, because back in the days it was, well, I didn't want to DJ in Berlin that much because back in the days in Munich it was like. Oh, when you play in Ultrashar, then you cannot play with us. And there was so much jealousy going on, DJ-wise. Was there also lots of money involved then? No, no, no, no. It was purely just jealousy. Jealousy. It's not like money was on the line. No, no, no, no. Jealousy. And, yeah, competition. So I was like, Berlin is my home base and I don't want to have any competition. I just want to meet my DJ colleagues and be more quiet. And then people were like, oh, why don't you play? Are you too arrogant? Yeah, you're too good to DJ. So then I started to play Tresor and SO3636, which was a gay and lesbian hangout. And it was Monday, not Monday. It was great, yeah. And it was a big part, like, there were lots of people there on Mondays? It was like the pre-Oskwood and pre-Burkheim thing, yeah. Yeah, what do you think about Berlin? It seems like maybe since Berlin has gotten so huge, all the attention is on here. Yeah, that's true. And it seems like there used to be more clubs outside Berlin that were really successful. Did there used to be more? Oh, yeah. World-class clubs. Yeah, well, it's not because of... Berlin I think it's more the question of time because when when techno was coming up it was like yeah it was something new and it was a generation who are who was techno now the this generation is I mean it's they are the children of us now want to listen to the music their parents hear I think so now they're going to EDM or maybe hip hop I don't know techno clubs died a lot of techno clubs died of because of this because they did not have any followers anymore but not because of Berlin so how do you see when you look out at the crowd when you're DJing are you seeing a lot of really young kids like 18 year olds yeah so you still see there's lots of interest yeah Yeah, I wonder what's going to happen with house and techno. What do you predict? Oh, it will always be there. Yeah. That's the thing. Nothing is taking it off. It's only getting bigger, isn't it? Yes, it's waves. You know, sometimes it's like going down and then EDM, for example, came up and now I hear EDM is going down. Or the trance DJs suddenly play techno. It's always like waves of what kind of style now is in or hip or do people want to hear. But how can a music die which was influencing so many people and is still influencing other music, like hip-hop? You find so much electronic. influences in hip-hop or other or Schlager this German music for example or yeah electronic music was the biggest influence of the last 20 years towards other music and and it's funnier if you listen to the productions now I mean you see breakbeat is coming back and some techno tracks or some drum and bass and then when we had this minimal we had minimal before in the 90s and then suddenly middle of 2000 so it's always coming back with another kind of a new twist yeah thank you the new twist yes Thank you.
