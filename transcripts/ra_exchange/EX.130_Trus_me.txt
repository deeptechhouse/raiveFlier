Do not adjust the sound on your stereo. There is nothing wrong with your set for the next 34 minutes. I will control what you hear and feel. You're about to be taken on a musical safari through the most ferocious jungle known to man. The jungle where the hunter is often captured by the game. This is a city, and you are there. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artist labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. Spend any length of time with David Wollstonecraft and it's clear that he's deeply indebted to his hometown of Manchester. It was there that the DJ and producer, who goes... by the name of Trust Me formed his musical identity through exposure to the city's far-reaching music scene. The city's melting pot of funk, soul and disco informed much of his debut album, Working Night, a record that sounded like the work of a veteran when it was released back in 2007. After issues with Chicago's Still Music, who released the very first batch of Trust Me 12 Inches, Wollstonecraft set up prime numbers to retain full control of his and his roster's music. The label has since become one of the UK's go-to outposts for high-quality house music, although much like Wollstonecraft himself, techno has been of increasing concern for Prime numbers in recent times. As he gears up to release his third full-length, Treat Me Right, we spoke about the difficulties associated with changing your sound, the controversy surrounding his new album's artwork, and the fascinating story behind his debut single, which apparently took him just 20 minutes to write. Outro Music People of the world. People of the world. People of the world. I just kind of wanted to start by asking about last night because we're here in Berlin you had your album launch party how was it? Yeah it was really good fun I mean it can always be difficult straight after Christmas New Year's Eve you know but Johnny who runs the place. He wanted to promote it a couple of days before and we had a really good turnout. You can always tell when the crowd has particularly come for yourself or Lawrence as well, who was playing last night. There's a few weary legs dancing on that dance floor. A lot of two-stepping going on. It took a few hours before people really kind of got into it. But yeah, it's a great sound in that club. I like the vibe of it. It's very kind of, it's a little bit more open-minded, it feels. You know, there's no precedent. You know, you have to kind of... you know, bang it out or you need to keep it deep or, you know, you feel like you can play any which way and they're willing to listen, you know. Have you been playing at Horset for a while? No, I've actually visited the club before, but that's the first time I've played it, actually. I'd only really heard about it through the hard wax parties that used to be there. That was the first time that I went. Yeah, you know, it is. Berlin's always quite a unique thing to me. Every time I come, I seem to check out a new venue I've never heard of, never, you know. No one's ever talked to me about it. And then you kind of walk in there and it has this history, you know, about the place. And you feel kind of a little bit silly that you don't know about the venue. But I mean, that's the cool factor of Berlin, really. There's all these little in-depth things going on. So how long has the album been in the pipeline for then? How long have you been working on it? Well, you know... I took a little bit of a break for three years, basically. Someone posted on my Facebook saying, like, how do you take a break for three years? But, yeah, I mean, you know, I'm 32 now. I just had my birthday on New Year's Day. And I think turning 30 and all this kind of thing, I needed to take a break and assess what I was doing, you know, not particularly with music, but just life in general. And you know, you kind of have to wake up in the morning and have the drive and the passion to want to make the music and I just didn't have it you know until recently really like the last three or four months and I kind of locked myself in a studio and the first two albums were always kind of a collaboration working with other people different musicians different engineers you know and this one was just exclusively me trapped in a room with a load of studio gear and you know, you can do things a lot quicker that way. Definitely. So, but it's, it's a learning curve as well to only work on your own, um, and be happy with the end result, you know, cause you've only got you to kind of judge the music. I found myself quite a lot hitting up various peers, not necessarily famous DJs, but people in Manchester that I respect, just to kind of get that acknowledgement of what you've done is on par with what you've done before. So yeah, sometimes it's not took three years to make, let's put it that way. Were you attempting to make music during that period? time yeah i mean i've been dabbling with different things i mean when you play different clubs and you're traveling around the world and all that kind of thing you experience different sounds and your taste definitely grows and expands and you start to see things in a different light, different sounds and vibes that you wouldn't necessarily even entertained before, definitely when I first started, and that slowly creeped into your production as well, and sometimes, you know, like Theo Parry said something quite profound once. when he said, you know, sometimes where you are as a DJ is not necessarily where you are as a producer. So sometimes the records you produce, you might not even actually be playing. They may even be further ahead than where you are as a DJ or they might be behind where you are as a DJ. So I feel like with this third album, I'm kind of reaching where what I normally play is my kind of record in a club, you know. where the records before were kind of more across the board. You could quite happily play it in your bathroom, in your bedroom, in a car, but you'd hear people playing it in the club as well, where this one sits at home more in a club environment. But I still feel it lends a sound to these other... kind of instance where people want to listen to it at home or an ipod as well so it's it's a hard kind of uh skill really to make an album that ticks all those boxes because you know an album is something that you listen to from start to end you know it's not just 12 banging tracks you know it's a it's a cohesive piece of an hour of music And that's what I try to do. So what have you been getting into the past couple of years? What's been influencing you? I'm not going to lie. Places like Panorama Bar has obviously been a big influence. Trou in Amsterdam. These great kind of sound systems and kind of church, as they call it here, where you kind of get locked into days of music. it's not even hours now it's days of music and uh that definitely takes a toll on your taste buds and how you how you think about making uh music you know it's always hard to say like is there any particular producer or label that you feel in a moment it's so varied these days it's like there's a million labels out there so you know um it's track by track these days i always find that question quite hard to answer so with this in mind how would you describe the sound of the new album well again you know it's eight tracks but it's eight different vibes i would say that's from my palette of of electronic music you know there's this earlier kind of dregsia influences definitely in there there's a lot of kind of dbx daniel bell kind of vibe baby ford which you know i have a big passion for like you know the early minimal kind of house sound there's definitely that big room sound as well in there and there's definitely heaps of detroit still influenced inside me you know and uh And there's even variants into kind of like a techno sound, like an early Tyree Cooper kind of vibe as well. So I think there's something for everyone there, but hopefully all the dots are joined together. It's not too far away from everybody, but everybody seems to have a particular track that they're keen on. There's no one standout track. Everyone has a different angle on the album. which is great, I guess. I mean, when did techno start becoming a more serious concern for you, would you say? When did you start properly honing in on the sound? I get asked this a few times, but earlier on in the label, we did release some stuff from Actress and... I've always tried to push different sounds on the label. I've always been into my techno, but maybe, I mean, when people have seen me play, they know that I go right across the genres and I very, you know, quite often get into techno as well. So it's always been there, but you always kind of get seen as what you produce. Like what we were talking about before, people thought, you know, I'm a disco, jazz, house, soul, hip-hop guy, you know, and like, how dare he kind of like dabble in techno and house, what does he know about that? from Manchester, you know, it's like I've been drummed all this kind of music into my head from an early day with eyes down and electric chair, you know, and drama back in the day. I mean, is that frustrating for you as an artist that people seem to be so close-minded? You know, I always bang on about this Manchester thing, but it really is a wide palette. You know, I even see it more so than London. It's very difficult to see other people's frame of minds when you travel, like how blinkered they actually are. Like one person's into deep house and then maybe some guys into tech house and they don't even cross over. And I find that, you know, this is just house music. And I'm like, you know, I might want to play techno in the set as well, even disco sometimes, you know. and that that seems to be completely closed-minded to what they want to do so yeah it is frustrating as an artist and I mean you can hear that in this third album as well it's like I'm trying to close the door a little bit to people understanding what I will actually play when they book me you know because there is a confusement level there there really is like you will get half the crowd coming to you going they didn't expect that but they enjoyed it And then the other crowd might be really disappointed because they wanted to hear something completely different, maybe what I produce early on. So they're expecting more of the like soul, funk, disco influenced sound. Yeah, definitely. Because like I say, I've made such a variation of music. There'll be one track or a couple of tracks that they are really into that they know me for and just don't know that I'm into these other genres and that this is what I do. how you keep everybody happy like that i don't know so yeah i mean you know thinking about it now maybe this third album was kind of like you know i'm gonna try to concentrate on this area of sound um if anything not to confuse people of what i'm concentrating on now and what i'm doing would you say that is kind of your most diverse album today yeah definitely um i mean Thinking now, the remixes that I've just recently had done from the likes of Ben Clark and Marcel and Norman Nodge and Vekula and people like this, I guess that was seen as a bit of a bridge to what I've been doing now and where I'm at. So people were too shocked when this third album came out and people kept saying, right, okay, we've heard the remixes now, let's hear the new stuff. That was the general... consensus from the media and so you're almost looking to make a statement of sorts yeah i guess it's like a you know this is this is maybe an indication of what's forthcoming well i came so hard with straight up techno basically with that that what came out with the album i guess is more housey um that it wasn't as shocking i suppose yeah So in that sense, it worked. There's something I wanted to ask you about surrounding the new album, because when it was released or the news was put out there, there was a bit of controversy. surrounding the artwork. Yeah. So firstly, I wondered if you could explain the artwork to someone who hasn't seen it. Well, I mean, you know, for many parts of you, if people have been following my music from the beginning, the artwork is no different than the first album cover, you know. I've always gone with this kind of burlesque. show dancer kind of vibe to the imagery. But the second album is, sorry, the third album is predominantly like a message about relationships and long distance relationships is kind of what I've been going through for the last three years and probably why I've not been making music. And a lot of DJs will know exactly what I'm talking about. um with that and it was kind of a message about you know uh treating them right or treating me right um and the picture kind of is a representation of that you know there's a little bit of s&m feel to the to the vibe of the image and it seems to provoke some people um but it's It's kind of, you know, I didn't do the cover to try and provoke people. It's just kind of that is my style. That is my vibe of what I like to do. You know, who doesn't like to look at a beautiful woman? And why not put it on a cover? You know, but yeah, I mean, people have been doing this for years. I mean, we're just in a zone and an area right now where everything has to be hip. cool you know on the cover and everything's so minimal and gray and all this kind of stuff that when you come with something like this it's so off the cuff of what other people are doing and it's provoked a reaction but then there's the other side to it like you know my core fans of you know people who follow me on facebook or soundcloud they all love the cover you know i've not heard a negative word about it But in many senses, the word of the resident advisor one, you know, it was like one or two guys who really wanted to kick something off. And it all seemed to kind of stem from the Sega album as well. You know, someone said something about side boob trend, which kind of made me laugh. You know, but then there's a lot of people coming on to the arrow page defending it, you know Really liking it and say, you know, I'm into it. I want the cover, you know I mean, could you kind of see where they were coming from though that the guys who were kind of kicking off about it? Yeah, but I don't know if I mean a lot of them I don't know if they were actually aiming that at my cover or kind of the trend of what was made possibly happening But you know me about it you know it's i had this in my mind for a long time you know this is something i i set up in a studio and we did it properly you know so you know i mean each their own into if everybody uh you know i don't know how to describe it it's like there's there's a lot of terrible covers out there and there's a lot of great covers with terrible music on it i mean At the end of the day, it's about the music, really. If a cover is going to put you off in that sense about buying the music, I don't know. I mean, someone posted an event that I'm doing in Belgium the other day and posted the cover with previews to the album. And some idiot said it offended him and the Facebook event page got banned. And I mean, come on, it's not porn. You know, it's just a naked, beautiful woman on a cover. I mean, I don't see how that could offend anybody. More recently, you've had the side project going or there was talk of adopting the David James name for some of your productions. Is that something you're going to continue with? And you've also been DJing under the name a bit as well. Yeah. Well, I've started this night called One Red Light that predominantly started as a techno night and it's quickly evolved into... more of an open book again from house to techno. Some people are into this idea of me completely doing something different as David James and just, you know, floor to the floor techno. I mean, I'm doing an album launch at Fabric and doing Room 2, so they've known me now from doing this techno thing. I mean, it's just this, again, what we're talking about, the blinkered eye thing, you know, I wanted to separate so people understand that, oh, right, so when I play as David James, he's going to come with a techno. And when he plays as Trust Me, it's going to be a little bit more versatile. What he actually plays is more of a houseier kind of vibe. But also including some techno. Yeah, including some techno. So that's where it kind of gets confusing. Whether I'll carry on with the David James thing or produce under that, I don't know. I've been toying with the idea of just abbreviating TM, you know, as trademark, aka trust me, you know what I mean? So it's kind of, I guess like the Carl Craig thing, C2, you know, everybody knows it's the same person, but they understand that it's a certain sound. when he does it under that name, you know, so... I mean, had you been writing music with that sort of alias in mind? Yeah, I mean, there's several labels that are wanting 12s right now because they've heard, you know, there's somebody off the new album and wanting to hear something on that kind of techno tip. And I've been making tracks that are coming out, you know, labels like Syncropho and stuff like this are asking for those kind of 12s. So I've not committed to anything yet. So what the name will be right now, I'm unsure, to be honest. I mean, where do you place yourself in the wide world of techno? What would you say, you know, how would you say your approach differs to your contemporaries? I guess I approach it from a much more housier concept. I don't see myself banging it out in the Berghain or anything, but I do love techno and I love the more loopy, deeper aspect to it, the hypnotic aspect of it. The militant sound, I can play that in between a set, but I can't do that all night. My brain will just... fry you know it'd get bored so where i fit into that spectrum i don't know i mean time will tell but from a techno point of view i'm more interested in it in a production sense at the minute and you know i'm just really enjoying making techno um you know if i'm waking up in the morning and that's what i'm thinking of doing you know it's clearly a passion at the minute and I'll see where that will go. I mean, the sound will evolve. I don't really know where it is at at the moment, but the trust me is kind of, you know, I know what that is. I know what I'm trying to do with that, but I guess most of the enjoyment of this new techno thing is like I don't know where it's going to lead at the moment, so it's quite exciting to do. Yeah, I mean, certainly for me, some of the more techno leaning tracks on the album, they still seem to retain some of the swing and like the warmth of your earliest stuff. Yeah, I mean, I've always like, you know, I've been toying with this word when I've been talking to media, like analogical, because, you know, predominantly the sound started analog. And then I brought it into the computer and then I kind of digitized it in a way to try and make it, you know, updated and modern. So they will always have that kind of old school. element to it but it'll have this kind of new techno sound as well but yeah i mean just with that sound as well it'll progress into something that uh is my sound so to speak but you know i find that i find that pleasing when people say i can hear you know whatever the trust me sound is in there you know it's not like i've completely ran away from it where people are kind of like is this you you know that's the uh that's the bad point So it almost sounds like there you're going in a direction that most people are going the opposite way. So you were going from a more analog side of things into digital. What was behind that decision? I guess the way I came in was kind of, you know, I remember Movedee saying to me once, like the first album is so complex and mature that it's something I would have expected you to do when you were like 35 going on to 40, you know, like. and now you've you've come into it the wrong way around it's like you've gone complex and now you're trying to simplify it into tracks you know um but you know that's that's where my head was at and um Again, going back to what we're saying, playing in clubs, you start to realize the simpler it is, the more effective it is on a dance floor. And, you know, I wanted to start doing the thing myself, you know, and not really working with anybody else because it just takes too long, you know. So I just wanted to be completely in control from the production to the mixing. So, you know, being a bit of a control freak, I guess, is why I went that way. Yeah, I see Just to touch on something, we mentioned the One Red Light parties. What was the kind of initial concept, if you like, behind those? Well, it all started two years ago at Sona. I did the last party on a Sunday and it was just an idea that came to me and we got a red light bulb and we hung it from this high ceiling in this secret bunker. and that people were using it was a pilot started at 1am on the Sunday so technically the Monday morning and you know being a DJ obviously you know other DJs and DJs want to play and I ended up putting like a crazy kind of line up together that just didn't really make sense you know like me shonky dvs1 francois x you know and the list just kept going on space dimension controller then mandy turned up Armin van Helden turned up, you know, and everybody just wanted to come and play a few records. And it was a more back-to-back kind of thing, you know, not one-on-one off, but on the feeling. The roof just went off. It was crazy in there. Nobody was wearing clothes by the end of it. I think the drains, you know, blew up as well. And we all got wet from these drains and sewage and people just kept dancing. So you're like, we have to do this again. Yeah, yeah, we have to do this again. And then it just, it kind of just, you know, was made out of that really. And before we knew it, you know, people were asking us to do these One Red Light parties in America. And we did it in New York and San Fran and Minneapolis. And then we started doing them in London and Manchester. And now it's developed into the first Monday of every month at Plastic People. And it's kept the same concept where I kind of pick, you know, I have myself play and then I have two different DJs play. So, for example, a couple of weekends ago, we had Michelle Cleese and Space Dimension Controller, like together. It's not really a lineup you would think to do with myself as well. But it worked, you know, because everybody kind of adapts to the other DJs to kind of fit a mold, you know, together. and you bring complete you know like michelle brought all the italians and space dimension brought all the young hipster kids you know and i brought my usual crowd and they all kind of mixed together and it created a party and that's what i'm trying to do is just you just do something different you know and the fact that it's a monday as well is people don't feel like they have to peak you know they can play records they really love play a little bit deeper you know and and relax, and not worry too much about where the night goes. It's just about listening to good music. Everybody wants to play at Plastic People. Did you make a conscious decision to do it on a Monday? Yeah. That was the whole idea because, I mean, London is so competitive now. It's just pointless trying to do a weekend. And the Monday literally lies on people coming. Like, you know, there is no money in it. The DJs turn up because they want to play. They want to play in the plastic people system and they want to play records they don't normally get to play. And so the Monday works well, you know, if they play London at the weekend, then they stick around. Or if they've played somewhere in Europe, say an American DJ, they fly over for the night, you know, and I look after them and we all hang out, you know, just have good times basically and play good records. Because in the day, every DJ wants to play and they want to play somewhere good and they want to play to a crowd that understand and appreciate it, you know. And the fact that Plastic's so small, it's like the core crowd is very knowledgeable. It's just an enjoyable experience to play as a DJ. So yeah, Monday was definitely like, you know, the goal plan of doing it. Have they managed to smooth over the sound issues that they were having there? Yeah. Understanding that at one point they were having some problems with the limit. or something the first setup that they did they've changed that system now and they've got a new system in and that for me it sounds better than the original plastic people um i mean you gotta not think about it like the original one otherwise you know you'll never you know gain that kind of vibe It's a new club in itself now, but it's still all about the sound. Adi's ridiculous with his techniques of how he does it. I mean, you stand in there, you feel like you're in a studio. You can talk at a normal level. There's no reverb. You feel the bass, but it's not too loud where you kind of get jaded with the sound. And you still hear things in records you didn't even know was there. Even in your own productions, you forget. little synth lines you did or whatever because it's just so clear you know i mean i mean it's the only it's the only place i know in the world where the dj playing keeps coming out of the dj booth because he wants to hear the record you know that he's playing because you know he wants to hear what it sounds like on that system and what is it like as a dj to play in that sort of uh acoustically treated type space is it much different from yeah i mean you find yourself not even using the monitor i mean the monitor is only comes on like as you as you're in the mix and then it's off the rest of the time because the place is just so clear you know you want to hear that sound um it just helps you just connect better with the audience you know you feel like you're almost at home you know playing music to your friends It creates that kind of like house party kind of feel. You know, it's just, if you're a DJ, it's what you want to do. It's fun to play on. I just wanted to talk a little bit about what's got you here, basically, some of your beginnings and such. You're from Manchester, as we mentioned. How important do you think it was on your music education growing up in that city? Yeah, well, Manchester and Leeds is probably part and parcel of what I'm doing. You can ask Ben from Ben UFO. because he comes from the same kind of field of what I did. We both went to uni there and there's more. clubs per quarter in leeds than there is anywhere in the uk and it's all different genres and you know even though i'm from manchester that's kind of where i fell into the music and before you know it you want to be a dj you're collecting records and all this kind of stuff you know but coming back to manchester there's so many key parties that are really clued up and they're educating you in a way that you just can't get from being on the internet. You're hearing records put together in a different way that really makes you want to express yourself as well, if not as a producer, but as a DJ. When you speak to people in Manchester, there's a classic party called Eyes Down. and you can so hear that in my productions especially in the first album you know I give nods to Eyes Down and John Kay as well because you can hear all these different records that I've sampled that were all classics at this club night basically so you know it's very important where you come from really how you get in influenced into that it grows an in-depth knowledge before you even get to the point of producing you know because anybody can learn to produce but if you don't come with that mindset and that knowledge of the sound that you actually want you know are you you trying to express then you've got a very deep learning curve before you even start, really. I mean, do you think what you're describing, was that true of your particular generation or do you still feel that Manchester is like that? people are absorbing all these different sounds. Well, I mean, you have the warehouse project at the minute. I mean, the lineups are ridiculously crazy. You know, as a young kid growing up and if you go into those pies, I mean, it must be something on par with like the Hacienda, the way they're being educated. I guess, you know, but you say that, but then there's people from like Belfast, you know, like Space Dimension Controller and A&D, people like this and, you know, Feel My Bicep guys that are coming with all this knowledge. They're from Belfast, you know. So I don't think it's too important. at where you come from. I think it's more the people that are around you, you know, and who influence you. It could be anybody, you know. There's a killer DJ in every city probably. I heard a story, I don't know how true this is, about your first track that you made. something about an absolutely insane amount of time it took you to make. 20 minutes was what I heard. And it was the first track you got signed. Well, yeah, I did a school of sound recording in Manchester, which is like an intense kind of six-month production course that I was doing when I was doing a master's in business and stuff. I learned everything from that, but they were telling you more about the sound from compression to EQ and all this stuff. And I really absorbed all that knowledge. But still, we were using Cubase at the time and I just didn't find a flow or an influence from it. And I literally got onto Ableton using my gear with Ableton. And the first time I turned on Ableton... you know I had knowledge of cuba so I mean I knew how to use like you know the aw system or whatever but um When I first used Ableton, I literally was on it for 20 minutes and I made that Nards track where I sampled, you know, I forget what I sampled now, but anyway, but yeah, it's a long time ago. But yeah, I literally cut it up, did a few things with a utility tool that I was loving at the time where you can phase stuff off and like break a sample down into three different loops from the same loop. which blew my mind. So, you know, you're sampling things, but people going, oh, I know that sample, but it doesn't sound like that on the record and not understanding how you did it. And that's always music for me. When I kind of hear something, it turns me off if I know how it's done. But when I don't know it's done, that's when the music comes back at me. And I think a lot of people find that when they're producing records, that music becomes a little bit jaded to them because if they know how it's been done, it kind of kills the magic of it. But yeah, literally when I sat down and did that, I sent it off to the Still Music label and I got a reply within like minutes. It was so bizarre. It must have just been like that kind of timing, you know, magic timing. And he was like, I'm really digging this. I want to put it out. It's just like, you know, it was the first label I hit up. I just did it. One of those things where you'll just lay it at night and you just think, you sod it i might just try this so you quite literally became a producer overnight yeah literally just put that 12 out and um you know and he's like have you got any other tracks and i was like yeah yeah but i didn't so you know that night i made a couple more which were the b side which was like a this kind of hip-hop track called browns um and the good god track which is one of my best licensed tracks you know to date Do you remember what the sample was on that? Yeah, it's from Bad Luck. Teddy Pendergrass, Bad Luck. And yeah, so yeah, I mean, I spent longer on those two to finish them. but essentially they were done in pretty much the same time as well because once you got the knack for doing it you know you just flow it's just like a tool like riding a bike once you've learned how to do it you can then do stuff really quickly but you could never do that in Cubase you know it's so clumsy the way that was made but Ableton just lets you flow into something very quickly I mean, do you feel like your kind of history with record collecting and crate digging, that kind of thing, facilitated that kind of approach? Yeah, definitely. I mean, you must have had a lot of samples like wearing around in your head. You know, you listen to people like JD and stuff and it's like, it's all about the sample, you know. You can't polish a turd, as I like to say. If you have a good sample from the beginning, then... you know you're good to go from the as soon as you start sampling you will come up with a good idea so definitely a knowledge of records and listening to records and understanding what you want to do before you even start you're off on a you know on the good foot straight away So, you know, I had this record for a while that I wanted to sample for the Nards track. And I heard what I wanted to do, but just wasn't capable of doing it until I hit on Ableton. I mean, were you like hitting up shops with the express name of like digging for samples? Is that something you'd kind of... Well, you know, I kind of came into the whole thing from my love of hip hop, like JD and Tribe and all that kind of stuff. and once you're into the hip-hop and you dig in then you know you're always trying to find the samples of what it's on so I was like crazy you know jazz is still my biggest collection today and I was crazy into buying jazz, and what I sampled for that was a jazz record, but it had like this jazz disco thing, from jazz you get into disco, and then I started getting into all this kind of Kenny Dix and stuff, you know, and then I got into what they were sampling, and then that changed my mind of what I wanted to do, so you know, I was just doing the same thing hip-hop guys were doing, but I was doing it with... disco instead you know to make house tracks um so yeah you know Was Moody Man kind of a gateway producer for you? Was that kind of an entry point into house music? Yeah, I mean, the way it started, I deeply got into JD because I wanted to know who made a lot of the Tribe Called Quest stuff. And then from JD, I got introduced to like Dwele and Amp Fiddler and Slum Village and all this kind of stuff. And then I was just rooting through, I think, a friend's record bag or something. And they had the Forever Nevermore Moody Man album in there. And I saw in the back that Ant Fiddler was playing all these keys on there. So I was like, oh, I've got to check this out. And as soon as I played the album, I just went, this is my shit. This is what I want to do kind of thing. This is my sound. It's embracing hip hop, house, soul And more or less from there, I then got into house, you know, the whole Theo thing, the whole Detroit thing, Alton Miller, Kerry Chandler, you know, like it just starts to express itself into a huge big circle and comes back around. And then, you know, from there you can, you know, there's so many branches into different genres and then, you know, you've got 20,000 records and not much money. It must have been at least a little bit pleasing to be compared to Moody Man when your first album hit. Yeah, I mean, you know, that's what I was saying before, that record, that track I did in 20 Minutes, it was actually, I think, the best-selling record in the UK on vinyl in 2007. And Piccadilly Records gave me some award for the best-selling record there and stuff. And I still think a lot of it was down to, yeah, people like the music, but the whole kind of way it was packaged was on a black label. and they felt it sounded so much like a Kenny record that they almost thought it was Kenny. So it was quite funny going into, like, Manchester's a funny place, I love it, but, like, they're not very good on, like, helping their own, you know. So you would walk into these record shops, and people would know me and would say, you know, have you checked this record out? I still love the music, like, just write it in your bag, I love it, you know. And thought I'm not going to say anything and then they're like yeah it's definitely Moody Man it's definitely I'm like right whatever you know so I let that go for a year and then when I heard all these people who are kind of bit of talkers you know tell me how hot this record is and then I tell them oh it's actually me they couldn't really go back on the word you know what i mean because they've already told me all this stuff and they know it but i know they would never have supported it in the same way but it's too late by then you know i was on to my third record at that point so what is that is it this is a competitive edge in manchester or i don't know what it is climbing over one another it's like compared to america like in america they really want to pump you up and like really push you and support I don't know if it's a northern thing or just an English thing in general, but yeah, I don't know. A jealousy thing or competitiveness-ness? I don't know. That's not even a word, competitiveness. But, you know, it's just a case of I still can't put my finger on it today. If anything, I love it because it keeps you grounded. in many ways. You know, you don't really go off with the fairies of thinking how good you are. They bring you down to earth pretty quickly, you know. But yeah, I still don't know what that's about. Tell me about setting up prime numbers. Well, you know, this came about, those first three records that I put out are still up for music. I'm still chasing for payments. You know, I'm the classic example. of uh you know make sure you get your contract sorted the paperwork all this kind of legal jibe but um did they just go quiet on you or what happened just went quiet it went quieter on a lot of people to be honest you know but i probably shouldn't talk about it too much because it's all through the legal cases at the minute but um you know i just kind of got sick and tired of that and decided you know if you want to do something right you got to do it yourself um So I decided to set up my own imprint. I mean, I guess it was no small matter if you had one of the biggest selling singles. Exactly, yeah. I mean, I was in a really good position at the time. So distribution wise, you know, I could have had my pick. And I collabed with Fat City Records in setting up the label. So they kind of run the back end and I can A&R and do all the enjoyable stuff basically. And I was tight with Linkwood and all these people at the time. And they had so much music that they were giving me that I was excited to put it out as well because it didn't necessarily fit the Firecracker mold. It was a bit more housey than what they were doing. So, you know, it was just good timing, really. I mean, did you have a particular vision when you started out? It's a completely open book. You know, like what we were saying about Manchester before, like my taste and everything. I just, you know, I mean, I guess it's a house label, but there's stuff on there that isn't house as well. There's techno on there, there's soul on there, there's some hip-hop stuff on there. There's techno now as the new remixes and everything. So I just wanted to put stuff out that was timeless. I've never treated it like a business. I've never pumped out like these labels where they need one out a month. I've only ever put stuff out when I felt like, you know, it had that kind of X factor to it. And would I still be playing this in 10 years? And do people appreciate it? It's not necessarily music that I would always play myself, but I felt like it was good enough to be out there and other people enjoyed it in their way, you know. So sometimes I've gone eight months without putting a record out. And sometimes I've gone every month putting a record out, but it's only if you have the music, you know, then you should put it out really. I mean, you do accept and listen to demos and that kind of thing, because ostensibly it seems like quite a tight knit group of friends that make up the roster. Yeah. I mean, that's how it started out really. I, you know, I wanted to concentrate on select people and really like push the EPs, you know. from them but then you know people deviate and then go off with different labels and all this kind of stuff so you know i do listen to demos that come in but you know obviously my emails flooded with uh with promos and all this kind of stuff but you know like just recently i signed massimo delina which i didn't really know who he was at the time but the track just you know sometimes i don't listen to anything sometimes i'm bored and listen to something and this track just hit me you know i've signed it and i've put it out so you know i i do i do listen to demos But, you know, I try to keep it around people that I know and I kind of keep it, try and keep it very UK based as well. And you released some of the only actress stuff outside of Honest Johns and Work This. How did that come about? Well, I remember listening to his first album and, you know, just obviously being so keen and putting vinyl out, love of vinyl and all that kind of stuff. The two tracks that I really liked off there, I just felt needed a vinyl release. So it started with that really first. And, you know, I just wanted to be able to play out on vinyl because I hate playing CDs. And then he hit me up with this other track as well, like Ghost Over Heaven. And it just blew me away, you know. and before I knew it, I had an EP with him. And we were going to work on an album and everything as well, but obviously Honest John's hit them up, so, you know, I'm not going to... hate on that because i would have done the same thing but um yeah he was just someone that i found really interesting he fits that kind of prime numbers mold of just completely being an open artist you know he's not a journalist it's just good music it was around that time you released your second album wasn't it yeah certainly the same year in the red yeah it was very much a collaborative effort it seemed like yeah well i'd actually sign a deal with fat city so The first two albums, you know, I had to kind of do. And working on the first album was very much like exploring kind of sampling. But I did work with some musicians as well to kind of beef up the album and change certain parts. And I really enjoyed that process. So I decided the second album should be very much more studio-based with musicians. And I just wanted to push myself and test myself, really. And again, maybe, you know, it was maybe something too soon to do. I should have been, you know, doing this more kind of tracky club thing because that's where I was playing. So it's a definite sense of throwing yourself into the deep end. Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's something maybe I should be doing now than I was doing then, you know. But I learned so much from doing that process. It took me a couple of years to like really learn to get it to the point where I But I'm still proud of it and I still like the vibe and the sound of it. I know people who've got it are really passionate about it and stuff. You had some impressive guests on there as well. It was like Amp Fiddler and Paul Randolph, Dame Funk. Yeah. Did you get in the studio with them all? Yeah, well, I was very lucky, actually. Prana Head, I did that with him in Detroit. But Amp Fiddler actually came through to the Warehouse Project and I hooked up with him and his bass player and brought them to my studio. and we jammed for you know maybe like eight or nine hours and the first two tracks on the album is literally from the jam sessions you know made into tracks after um i mean he gave me literally eight hours i've still got it somewhere on some hard drive like eight hours worth of jamming on different synths and pro ones and voyagers i mean there's tracks for days on there you know i need to actually i need to reopen that up But, you know, but getting that amount of music can actually make it more complex because then you have so much good music to kind of cut through that it's almost like you're sampling records because you're sampling these musicians now to create the sound that you want to get. And, you know, if you're quite nitpicky like me, you can take quite a while. to commit to one sound, you know. How would you say Prime Numbers has kind of changed down the years or has it changed down the years? I mean, I feel like it's progressed in a way as I have as well with my taste. but you know, I'm quite happy to go back to what we were originally doing. If someone gives me that music, you know, and it's there, but it's just not there at the minute. I'm not being given it. So I'm going with the. genres and the sounds that i'm feeling at the moment um i kind of want it to be like that it's not that i'm trying to make it shocking but i always soon as someone pigeonholes it i'm quite happy to take them a different way you know but it literally is what music i'm given uh at the time if it's good enough then i'll put it out one thing i wanted to ask you about actually which um kind of stuck out and some interviews i'd read over the last 12 months you're in singapore for a Is that right? Yeah. What was that all about? Well, well, a woman, obviously. Either way. Yeah. And there's no simple way around that. I mean, yeah. I mean, that was the whole kind of break period kind of when I was with 30. You know, I was just I was living out in Australia for a little bit. in Melbourne and staying with friends. I still really love it out there in Sydney and Melbourne. Just like the energy and the vibe out there. It's a little bit too far away from home to be a DJ. You can only play so many times in Australia or Japan. But yeah, Singapore was a base because it was in the middle. of both places. And there's a little scene there as well. And there's a lot of potential. People don't seem to realize as well that English is the first language. So it's super simple to live there. It's like seven star living. You know, when you come home from Singapore, you feel kind of like a Neanderthal. You know, the way we are living over here is completely different. You know, everything's efficient, works, it's right, it's clean. you know, food's cheap, accommodation's right. Everything's just right over there, you know. Is that reflected in the style of clubbing out there? Is it all quite high end? Yeah, the clubbing is quite high end, but the problem is, well, it's not a problem actually, but there's a lot of potential with the young kids out there. You know, they're quite hip and they're pretty clued up and they've got money. And they're wanting to do something creative. And there's definitely like this kind of wave of people that I've met out there that are doing not necessarily just music things, but creative art things and galleries and all this kind of stuff. And it's growing as a country, you know, because it's. It's a city-state, but it's still so small, but there's so much money floating around that if you want to do something cool, there's potential to do it as well. So I was pretty turned on by that kind of goal, and I still am. It's not something I've switched off from. Thank you. Bye.
