you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Italian producer Donato Dazzi's mature and considered take on techno isn't without precedent or followers, but he simply does it better than almost anyone else. He found his sound as a DJ through residency. panorama bar, seeing that his hypnotic tracks worked best early in the morning when they were given the proper space to breathe. Soon after, he began playing at Japan's Outdoor Labyrinth Festival, where his sets have become the stuff of legend. Production-wise, Dazzy has always been good, but his latest album, a collaboration with fellow Italian, Neil is a step above. It's called Voices from the Lake and stands as his finest hour yet. We went to Rome to talk about all of this and more in February. you Tell me about the first time you played Labyrinth. When you knew it was something special? Okay, so I knew basically a few minutes before to start because somehow I didn't have the time to notice or to figure out what was going on. I just heard sounds which were good sounds but I couldn't see any sound system or DJs so just a few minutes before to start I saw that wonderful crowd and Matthew Johnson came to me and he said "Donato, this is really the best thing ever" and he was right. Yeah, that's how it started and the set was something I still remember. Had you played Japan before? No, that was my first time ever. Okay, so it must have set the bar pretty high. Yeah, definitely. So there were many expectations before. I, of course, didn't know what the spirit was in there yet. I just knew that I was excited because it was the other side of the globe, because someone who I didn't know, and I thought that he didn't know so much about me. So I was pretty surprised by that booking. This is Russ that you're talking about? This is Russ, yeah. Why do you think your sound, what you do, has resonated so much? I wanted to start with this, I guess, because it seems like it's become a defining thing about you. I think he has been the one who realized this sort of potential. I was coming... from intense after-hour experience in Berlin, but I never experienced yet at that time an open-air festival like Labyrinth. So I basically arrived there and I could notice that the sounds I've always been falling in love for. were making sense in that context. So how did we get to Labyrinth? I mean, where... What did Russ, I guess, hear in what you were doing before that seemed to be... Yeah, he was convinced to book me after hearing a remix I did for Reynald, a track called Over There, and it was released by Persona. At that time, I was still living in Berlin, and Russ thought that that was perfect for... sound which also was like that in my mind because I was very close to move back to Italy at that time and I was about to go to on the beach side of Italy so the West on the yeah on the west coast So all the sounds were inspired by this next move. Was that a sound that you were sort of reaching for? Or do you think that's a sound that you'd come to and that was your sound finally? I could feel something in that moment. It was clear that the hypnotic... side of things, the use of delays, reverbs, all these things were catching my attention, kind of monotone things. So I just noticed that that was a path to explore further. And so that's what I did. You know, what were you listening to? And, you know, where were those sounds, those hypnotic sounds that kind of got you to that? place where you started creating techno in this way. This also came from the DJ experience because I noticed that year by year I was more focused into playing certain records instead of other ones and creating you know kind of history between all the things I was playing. I'm in love for bass lines and stuff like that. It took a while. Yeah? It took a while. Because I'm... Yeah. You know, it needed years in my case because I was just... finding the right way to go. I was never happy. So I started having the feeling that things were going in a better way when I started playing at the Panorama Bar. And there, I for the first time had the chance to spin over six, seven hours. In Italy this is not even thinkable. So I started playing some records instead of others because that came by itself. So I was probably voted to become like that. So through the burning experience for sure this came to surface. But the next step was still missing because I didn't learn by the experience what it means to play these sounds in the proper outdoor context. Tell me about Berlin. Why did you move there? Well, yeah, I moved there because I needed to breathe a little bit outside of Italy, which is a country I love totally. I grew up here. I still live here. I just was not happy enough with what I was experiencing before. I've been DJing here in town for a long time and basically I was kind of sick of it. So also I needed probably to relate myself to people with different origins than me. I needed to see new faces. So also in a better way to understand mine. And that was enough motivation to go. It seems like a very obvious thing in a way that, you know. needed to go somewhere else to find a little bit better more about yourself honestly I don't miss anything here. I live well and thanks God I'm happy with what I do. But at a certain point of life it can happen to anyone, I guess, to have this feeling. You just need to go and check it out. Did you move there knowing you were going to be playing at Panorama Bar? I mean, did you have a job, so to speak? The thing is, I got my first booking in there after probably just a week that I moved to Berlin. And I didn't know what the Panorama Bar is, what it represents, what you can do inside. And that was a good thing because I'm a kind of emotional guy, so I'm, you know. I never get used to. Somehow I went there thinking that the Panorama Bar was a bar with a nice view. Panorama Bar. Yeah, yeah. And actually when I get in, I... I started realizing that it was something else. And I just did what I could feel to do. Because All The Way was still about to start, and it was very, very nice. That's also another gig that really is kind of unforgettable. I didn't know that I can probably express my best potential after a certain hour. So everything came maybe by accident or maybe who booked me had a kind of intuition about maybe letting the guy play a bit later would work better. I don't know. But it worked. That's for sure. What else did you learn in Berlin? How long were you there? Just a couple of years? Three years. One of the things I learned, a bit more of my country when I was in Germany, because I could see my country with an external point of view. and also I could understand a little better of the culture of the people who live here. This through eyes of people who is, you know, the German people in general and in Berlin especially, there is a very open up culture and many, many different ones are mixed together. As an Italian, I was part of the community and I was one of the few. the rest of the things I learned from other people and I guess that from when I came back to Italy after that experience I started feeling slightly better and enjoying better the place where I live you know tell me about your first record store when where was where was your local oh yeah store well The first was Goody Music and in the 70s was called Sam Goody near the very center of Rome. And in there I was a little kid and my sister bring me there by car and I could go buy some vinyls for DJs. How old were you? I was... when I started buying disco music stuff I was maybe 13, 14 years old. And yeah, that record store is still there. and this is something nice. They had an important role at the beginning of the 80s when it was the Italo Disco phenomenon, and most of the Italian catalogue is under the full-time records, and it's still in there. Were you into Italo? disco was disco the first thing for you oh not not really that was something that also i got in touch with of course because it was part of the scene here but not so big like has been as a revival i guess So that was part of the options you would have. I just knew as a kid that there were a lot of Italians involved in the music market. But I didn't know how many or who was the biggest star. I was not prepared at that time. I just tried to buy the music I liked. What was the music that you were buying? From Simple Minds to Bob Marley going to Malcolm McLaren and Depeche Mode. stuff like that. Was there a moment or were there records that got you in deeper into a love of music that sort of guided you? Of course, because of also the random type of buying records sometimes. how to say, you just buy something not being sure of what are you buying. And through that also I discovered then music that I never heard before. And then it started the chain reaction basically. Also there are some b-sides or tracks, just instrumentals from the Simple Minds, which I still listen to. And that was something that was catching really my attention at the time. All these pads, all this atmosphere, I was feeling right when I was listening to that. What was some of the stuff that, when you took a chance, that really caught your ear? Well, one of the biggest, I was even younger, it was in 79 or early 80s when The Chase. I'm George Moroder. was starting being famous and that was a big impact over me and and then immediately after I fell in love with the talk talk music and that was another huge influence I didn't know that time but there was people like them using the 808 and I just liked that time all these sounds and Actually, now I like the same patterns. Sometimes I listen to them again and I see the connection with the childhood. Did you have an idea that Giorgio Moroder was Italian? Did you connect it somehow to your... Later. Yeah? At the time, he was the big American. He was just a star. It was normal. So many Italians moved to the United States, so it doesn't affect me really to hear that an American guy has an Italian name. So I didn't think about it. I knew that there was something really catching my attention, all these sequences. an atmosphere created by synthetic sounds, were something really, really nice, really nice to listen to. Did you immediately want to try to make that, or were you just interested in hearing more? No, I wanted just to learn how to DJ as best as possible, and interest to the technical aspects about how to make it. That came only maybe 10 years after. So tell me about the DJing. When did that start? Yeah. Who was your DJ? I mean, as a Roman, of course, I grew up here with having people like Marco Trani. Peter Micioni, Paul Micioni, Corrado Rizza, all these DJs from the earlier generation than mine. And all these guys were exceptionally skilled. And you could see, I could go in a club and see these people spinning with three decks and incredible sound systems. There was a huge nightlife in here when I was in the right age to start experiencing it, of course. And after I was lucky enough because I have become friends with a few of them. And especially in the early period, Paul Micioni and his brother, Pietro, Peter, took care of me. And they introduced me. What do you think they saw in you? It was actually Pietro, Peter, that was looking for a kid to help in the club in summer in the place called San Felice. The club was Nautilus Club. You're smiling as you remember it. Yeah, of course. My sisters were going there, not me. I was too young. So the first year that I could go there as a customer, there was this DJ that I knew by name because he was famous in Rome. and he was looking for someone for helping and another friend in common we had introduced me to him and after a week I was the guy that was on test in order to become the second and finally it came the night where I was supposed to spin and he give me his headphones and say, okay, it's your time. And I was shaking. And I did it right. So he, you know, he was like, oh, you have skills, man. No, just take it easy, stay with me and... - And you've just been watching people, you've been practicing of course. - At home a lot, yeah. I always had my turntables when I was 13, my mother gave me, bought me the first Technics, the SLB 2000 or 200, I don't remember. with a very small wheel for the pitch. And when I was 17 years old, I got my professional technique once. And I've been spinning always at home. And then when I was 17, 18 years old, old I started going in private parties and then that summer which was the summer of 1990 it was my first experience in a real club so it was so exciting to me I mean so so so exciting you were playing all sorts of things Hip-hop? Well, at that time, there was a lot of house music. So I was lucky enough that because that time, let's say, that we didn't need to play any real shit. basically you could give a good vibe to the party. So that gave me a definition about how things could be, potentially. But also later when I had my own experience, when I had to deal by myself with people who was running parties, I had to adjust myself to many different styles. And also this was a kind of good thing for me because I learned many things about music that I would never have got in touch with if not by that experience. So everything is fine. So you came back from the summer and you were feeling pretty cool, I imagine. I was feeling totally cool because I was not even 20. I was 19 years old and already I had a season as a resident in a club. And then when I came back to Rome, I keep on... on meeting the new friends, Pietro and Paolo, and they bring me into their studio, which was an A-class studio. And I learned from the beginning how things need to be done in the most proper way. What was the big lesson immediately? You said, you know, the proper way. What was the thing that really struck you when you walked in? there. Yeah, to see everyone never sitting down in the same place for more than three minutes because there were so many cables and equipment to adjust, to fix. At that time they had just one computer which was mostly used as a sequencer but the rest of the things were made using tapes and proper equipment. So I could see a lot of action, physical action from the people and that was really wow. I didn't think that making music has so much physical involvement but actually it does in that way. But you said it took you another decade to do music. Yeah. To be that interested. It's like that was the first, let's say in the 90s, I had my first touch with the studio. So I had some little cooperations with them, giving my little point of view on some aspects. on the same side I was learning a lot and then maybe seven, eight years after I was able to make my own tracks but still in a very, let's say, immature way. It took a while, also because I couldn't find... I grew up exactly in the transition between the analog and the digital. So I didn't know really what to follow. So at the beginning I started collecting some digital equipment but I wasn't feeling completely comfortable because I was used to see my mentors working in a different way and also I was maybe missing all that physical action and so over the years I kind of adjusted myself. in a way to make myself comfortable. I use, of course, the computers, but there is a very strong analog component in that. Let's go back a bit. Tell me about Rome in 1991. Yeah. Like, what is the scene like? What are the... clubs like i would say i i should say from 1988 everything really started on the electronic side of the things because the first people who was playing house music and some acid house was the people of the devotion after our party which lasted guess a couple of years and it finished as a beautiful wave. But that was a very small party, so not many people could get in, only if you knew who was organizing. So I knew about DJs going outside of the club just to hear, try to hear what the records that they were playing, because it was stuff no one heard before. And then in '89 things started being bigger and some of our national talents were starting spreading the sound that later had become the sound of Rome and people like Laurie Dee Leon Ibaldi and a few others, Mauro Tannino, these were people that were starting playing these techno beats that were kind of a strong connection with the electro, earlier electro. There was a kind of... hip-hop component also in the way of production. And there were these synthetic sounds, very strong, very rude, and everyone freaked out here. So they started with maybe eight, seven hundred people, and after one year, four, five thousand people was going to each of these parties. They immediately made a connection with the underground resistance people in Detroit. Who did? Laurie Dee, for example. Yeah. He did a piece a couple years back, which we'll talk about a little bit later. He was one of the guys that every single person mentioned as like one of the godfathers that you have to know Laurie D if you want to know about Italian techno. He's one of the godfathers. And he's one of the ones who has a name, a reputation outside of the country. He was honored to have... collection on Reflex, you know. So there was a clear connection to FX Twin. They were playing later in the, back in the years here in Rome. There is a mutual respect between FX Twin and Lore D. There was also other people who was very famous here, local heroes. But maybe they never had the fame that maybe they deserved. People like Paolo Zerla, he was another monster behind the decks. You were watching these people, and even the people that you were talking about earlier. A few times, yeah. What did you learn from them as a DJ? Like watching them, what did you pick up that you're like, I want to, that's something I should know how to do. Because they were amazing. So actually, I wanted to do something amazing because they were doing amazing things. So that was the example, the thousands. younger people was getting as a normal thing because it was a local phenomenon and we had the chance to have international DJs very early Richie Oten came often to play in Rome who was you know what was the connection who was bringing them to Rome specifically well there were these big events that were getting bigger and bigger and they started making these huge raves with called l'ombrellaro brezaula and many other always very colorful names and more dedicated nights Let's say, first there were people like Frank DeWool, Frankie Bones. Together with Detroit there was a strong connection to Belgium. Immediately what came after the new beats age was something that was immediately catched here in Rome. And immediately after there was a connection. Speedy J was one of the first ones who came to play in Rome. So it started the connection between the Sound of Rome and the Plus Eight movement. What was the Sound of Rome? The Sound of Rome was a movement basically founded by a few people here, where there was Laurie Dee, Andrea Benedetti was involved, and all of these found a form in the... ACV records which then spread out of Italy a lot of records that have become classic for many of us and not only for the Italians. There are records that are still so beautiful if you listen to it from that catalogue and that was the moment when the Italian scene really grew up in a very strong way. But there was not only the Roman phenomenon, there were also very strong things happening in Veneto, where there was the famous Triade making really, really good records, and one of the most famous was then Sueño Latino, you know, the rearrangement of the classic Gochling track, and Gemolotto was behind this, and there was as well a very strong movement in Tuscany. So, yeah, I mean, I think Italy has been always a very creative country and it's not surprising from my perspective to say that, yeah, we had a huge thing going on here. Tell me more about ACV. That seems to be the one that you mentioned that kind of, among others, went international. I guess a lot of people internationally know about it. You can still find in good record stores, in the back catalog or secondhand, there is always an ACV somewhere. I know SCV as a customer because I was going buying records and SCV was one of the things that always was there. And they were probably the most advanced of the labels that got reputation out. And there was of course Sounds Never Seen, which was the label that Laurie Dee founded during the remix store. which is still there, I mean also Remix Store is, and this connects me back to what I was saying about the stores in Rome, there was also when the techno age started, the Remix Store has become the center of kind of meeting point of everyone who was involved and who just liked the techno music so if as I did you would go two three times per week in the store you could find all these local heroes being there and it was something so you would go there and you'd see Laurie D most definitely And he was really, really a character. How so? He's a big guy and always with this long hair. It was not just easy to go to approach him and say, hey, okay, how are you? You look at him like a legend. His same stories goes with Leon Ibaldi and other ones that were just so good. I think all these kind of feelings in all of us were coming because of the huge respect we had for these people who made us able and lucky to listen to the sounds that we never heard before. Sounds never seen. Exactly. So it makes sense, I guess. You also mentioned Leo and Ibaldi. When I actually mentioned a record that he made in a piece I wrote a while back, Dino Sabatini played it to me. It was called Fusion One. It was made in the mid-90s, and it sounds exactly like something you would play. Exactly. In fact, it's something I play, and I still listen to, because that is the type of voodoo feel that I like in things. You can totally get the tribal side. of him and the music approach he used to have. You mentioned that in him and in Laurie Dee, you could hear a little bit of Goblin in the minute interview to me. How so? In my perspective, Laurie Dee is the... is the next step of the whole Goblin project. This is the Italian prog rock group. Exactly. Because they did their things in Rome. Goblin is a legendary Roman band. people from my age, actually Lory D is one year older than me, so he grew up surrounded by the legend of these guys and of course the huge impact that the soundtrack they did for Deep Red. Somehow you can still feel this sinister approach and friendly but not too friendly sound sometimes. And anyway, he has a unique way to do it. And somehow, yeah, there is a connection between him and... You mentioned Remix, The Shop, and I think that seems to be the shop for a lot of people. Absolutely. I was one of the lucky guys that was there when I was younger and actually I cannot even express by words. Over the years I've been keeping on going there and when I was a bit older started also having cooperation when we... put together the "Electronica Romana" label So I can see Sandro Nasonte, the owner, as a legend on one side, as a legend because he was the owner of the shop that for me was the reference shop. And on the other side, because he was also producing himself, so giving all himself to this. And this is something that who come from my generation keep always in mind. This is our scene. He seemed very, obviously, in tune with the music. Yeah, he knows. When did the store begin? Was it when electronic music sort of hit? Yeah, so basically it's at the end of the 80s. So I started being a customer there when it wasn't during the 90s. and I don't even know how many techno records I've been buying there. I started having a few friends from that period and it's people I'm still in touch with. And basically also the work from Sandro Nasonte was to select the music because there was no internet. He was the filter, the moderator who was in charge to also the responsibility to bring the music to the town. When did the label start, Electronica Romana? Electronica Romana started... as a real thing in 2004. So we started talking about it the year before. It was me and Giorgio Gigli. We were delivering a few demos and we started having some ideas about things we wanted to release. And Sandro catched the spirit immediately. By this time, you had been DJing for quite a bit at Brancaleone? Yeah, at that time I was a resident in there. How did you get to become a resident there? Oh. You know, Laurie Dee was having this enormous amount of success early on, all these people. Yeah. I get the sense that your career was a lot slower rising. It was low, and also I would divide it in two sides, two periods, because the period when I was going to buy my first techno records and... getting more information about all these DJs, I was studying at the university, so I couldn't take it too seriously, but still feeling it. But after I got graduated... Did you know before you graduated, though, that you were going to take it seriously? No, no. So you were studying with the idea to become a banker? No, no, that's not... I mean, I should have done something else, but anyway, that was not what I wanted to do. Also because... I got graduated and that was year 2000. And I made also the military service. So I had kind of 10, 11 months to just think about what to do. And then I, by chance, by a friend of mine, I went to the Brancaleone club. And that happened actually at the end of the 90s. And so in the moment that I had my free time to think about what to do, I already knew that there was a very nice club in Rome where I would have loved to spin one day. The scene must have been quite different by then from the early 90s. Yeah, it was different. Now we were already in the age of the social centers where most of the underground activities were spread out of the ordinary channels, let's say. So I went to the Brancaleone, which was, you know, at that time, a very active social center. and I was impressed by the sound. That was something I didn't really know. techno, most of all was drum and bass and very good sound system, which was probably the best in Italy at that time. And so during the military service period, I met one guy called Massimo Trodini. and he was in touch with the guys of Brancaleone and we had the idea to try to put together something to book someone in the club. for a second, I can't imagine you doing military service. Well, yeah, this is what everyone said when they saw me with all these clothes and stuff. Okay, we can go on now. I just had to put that out there. Okay. We will make an exchange on the phone. And so basically we, the guys of Brancaleone said, okay, you can organize your own party here. You have to do it under your own risk. But we give you the space. And we bring the Tiberi Corporation there. That were very unknown at that time. But we made the club really packed and it worked well. We did the same type of... How did you promote it? Did you put up posters? Everywhere. I was going with Massimo all over the town, putting, you know, as it's supposed to be when you start. doing things of course and we were also djing as well and so that was a good experience so the people in the club saw a good potential from on our side and they asked to become resident after a few months that we were doing things there. As I understand it, it isn't exactly a club. No, I was saying it has been, no, it's still in there. Let's say at the end of the 90s, beginning of 2000, the club was very, very famous. And so their also political activity got a bigger resonance. What was their political activity? The political activity was based on two different things. First, the... let's say, the refurbishing of the environment, fixing parks and guesting students in the summer in the space. So something useful for the neighborhood. And on the other hand, they are extremely left-oriented. They have been trying to do what the ordinary channels were not doing. They've been connected because of the music. But I couldn't ignore also the... the other aspects of what they were doing. And so for sure, I was fitting right in there. How does a club participate in that? Or did they have an organization where during the day they... It's another group of people. No, no, no. It's always run by the same people. And they took this building that was abandoned in 1990. And since then they started their political activity in there. Let's say they made different things. There was an alternative cinema inside where they promote alternative movies. There was a school for visual graphics and stuff like that. There was also a culture about the biologic food and spreading that message and of course about the music, which was one of the biggest, that of course, latest in the 90s has become one of the biggest activity. because if you think that over the weekend probably over 5 000 people was going around the club which is a huge amount yeah so and and also when i was there i could immediately notice that the interesting people was there as a customers people that just don't want ordinary sounds. They want someone who expresses something. So I was lucky enough to have my training in there. Who else did you bring in to play? You were promoting when you were promoting. I have a very long list of people. It's very difficult. I remember Ricardo Villalobos in 2003 maybe. I remember another great set about Laurent Garnier in there. And it was 2003. Another one that really impressed me was iCube from Shutterfly. That was another highlight over 10 years of Brancaleon. So it was mostly house and techno guys that you were bringing in. I was bringing these type of things. I was pushing for that because it happened before that sometime someone was coming and playing some techno. I remember in the middle of the golden drum and bass period, Ken Ishii came in Rome and played 100% techno set. and the people loved it completely. So I for sure didn't bring techno inside, but I bring techno more constantly, that's for sure. So we started having a few years with people coming because of that. And there was another great thing in the Branca Leone, that there was not only a main... stage but there was also a chill out area where sometimes I even prefer to go playing because I could just spin whatever I wanted and it's there that I started having very long sets and first and only place in Rome where I could do that and I didn't need to play anything for a dance floor because that was just a chill out bar But many times it happened that people started dancing all over the place and that was, you know, something nice. So there's really no sort of legacy or tradition. There's no tradition of long sets in Italy. people playing all night and things like this. I mean, there are longer sets when clubs or, no, especially parties, they get some... longer permissions, but this is something that comes sometimes. But the rule is that around 4, half past 4, you have to shut down. And I just could feel that time that I was feeling, I was warming up at half past 4 and I had to go home. And yeah, but also that was a meaningful experience because then... how everything made sense when I moved to Berlin and I could see what happened after half past four and much later. Before you got there, the label started and everything. Elettronica Romana and that time I started running together with another friend called Dennis. the Orange Groove. And we made really a small amount of productions, but also that has been the other baby. By this time you'd started to make music. I already started. We're trying things out. But I started having tracks that sounded like I wanted they sounded like. How long did it take you to get tracks that sounded like... Years. Just years. I needed to wait that all the periods I had were coming to a turning point. point. So I had enough experience listening to reggae and dub and understood that on the music I like I wanted this sort of effects. It took time to understand why I like a bass line. I just liked it. But then once you have to do it, it's another story. It's another pair of gloves. And that also took years. Was there a first instrument that you got that you were using? The first instrument was, yeah. was my Roland 606 and 101. At that time I was also using, especially I was using the computer and I started making experiments just plugging the two machines with them because they can work if plugged to each other and okay. baseline over baseline over baseline patterns and say yeah I really want to do sounds a bit like this but then also once you understand what type of equipment you want to use Also, it takes a long time to understand how to record it, how to equalize it, how to make it sound better than before, how to emphasize all the harmonics and all the rest of the things. And that's why it takes years. And you said that it was also this, you were coming into production at this strange moment where... People were starting to use digital. Exactly. So you weren't sure what to do, almost. Yeah. I didn't know, really. I had only the experience before in a studio full of equipment, as I told you before. And just it was strange to me to sit down and... create everything through the computer. Who did you look to and who did you talk to when you were first starting? I mean, yourself in the studio. Well, from people of my same generation, I had to say at the very beginning I talked to Jacopo Carreras a lot. He's another of my very good friends and he was learning. so much fast, everything. He's still like this. And so he was a very important reference point for me. And he never... We always fight because I was lower than him. So, Donato, it's so easy. You have just to do like that. And I couldn't make it. And immediately after him, I learned a lot from Brando, Brando Lupi. He's a name who always comes up when I talk to you, I think. Yeah, he's a real brother. same as a brother, we had to go through all our periods and we are very good friends. Yeah, he's a beast, he's one of the best editing guys I ever met, so he really gave me a lot of tricks, how to approach to Pro Tools, which is the software I still use for making music. Yeah, he's something. When was the first time that you finally felt like in the studio that you had something that got to the point, this is how I want it to sound? Was it the first record that you put out? Yeah, because the first ever was on Orange Groove and the track "Minded" was called "Minded" that was somehow expressing the kind of trip I want to relate to the music I do. Now, after many years, I listen to it and I still like it. But it's like it's many, many years ago. This is the feeling. I think every satisfaction is related to the age you are experiencing. That time for me that was the best thing that I could express. Now I'm still fighting with the mixed downs and every time I try to say, "Okay, this is the best thing I've ever done." So it's a kind of never-ending process. Tell me about starting the labels. Why not... Mamma mia. Why didn't you just send it to someone else and say, I'm making some music, would you like to put it out? I remember Loredi telling me, he told me something very... when I was in a sensitive age about what to do with the stuff now I'm doing, he said, "No problem, you have just to press it yourself. That's it." And I was, "Ah, easy to say." But actually he was more than right, because... If it's true that it's good to have things released by someone else, it's also true that you need to make someone motivated to release what you do. And the best way is to show to people that you believe in what you do and do it yourself, I guess. And then if someone knocks on your door, it's because they really are interested in what you do. I guess it was quite easy to have that mentality when you have someone you are talking to or can just watch who did it themselves. Yeah. You know, the ACV records. This is all projects born in little studios and places, you know. So we all had this example in front of us. So we want to do it. Let's do it. Orange Groove. What was the idea of that label at the beginning? That Orange Groove is the transition from my trip-hop period to the electronic music. I was liking the real trippy side of trip-hop. And once I started understanding, I could express these type of feelings through different forms. then it was probably time to produce techno music and relate. And on my way there was this guy called Dennis that I mentioned before and he just was coming from a big experience that he had on a quite big label at that time for the trip up and lounge music which was Stereo Deluxe. and I met him because he was working in his label and then we have become good friends and we both realized that we were starting liking things that were not directly related but still related to that world. And yeah, we did it. And that was another of the reasons why I wanted to move to Berlin. Because I realized that if I have an idea over there, I could express it. It doesn't take age to produce a record, you just need to want to do it. But obviously the other label... Romana has Rome in the name. Why not stay in Rome? Actually, this is not... I mean, I had this idea about Elettronica Romana, the name. This is because I was driving my car back from San Felice to Rome, and there was... this big, big, huge spot out of the street saying Romana Electronica. But it was a shop selling components for washing machines and whatever. And I thought, yeah, I should maybe just switch these words. And this was expressed. a movement of people who make music in Rome. So I told this to Sandro and he was very enthusiastic. I have to say that when it's about being a... you know, to express the way to be, Italians or Romans especially, it's always very color-filled the way, so why not to say, okay, it's elettronica romana, we are from here, no problem. Everyone like Rome. Let's do that. You said it was started with demos from you and Giorgio. And Giorgio, yeah. But immediately after also Brando was in there. and then Maurizio Cascella and Joe Casagrande, and then all the other people, Rossella, the modern heads, Gianluca Meloni and Dino Sabatini. It was becoming quite a big family. How did you meet Giorgio? I met him because we were part of the same environment. We were DJing, liking basically the same music. But at that time he was still living in Latina, not in Rome. But since I have the house in San Felice, Latina is very next to my place. And so often we had to interact. We had the chance to meet each other. And he knew me because that time I released a record with my band, together with Jacopo Carreras and Michele Braga called The Kitchen Tools. And we had a band. knew about this record he liked it a lot and uh what did you play in the band we were three three guys so jacopo me and this other guy called michele and we had a contract with virgin italy so we started with a major basically Even if, of course, who was taking care of me was a more independent side, but still the reference point was a major. So it was a pretty unusual way to start in the business. You said there was quite a family. Yeah. It does seem like all these people around the same time were gravitating towards the same... hypnotic techno. Yeah, I have to say, yeah, yeah, yeah, there was a kind of distinct kind of sound, a kind of distinct approach, I would say, to the musical way to deliver a track. Wave after wave, and I could see that I didn't know that time, but... When Sandro got the first demos from Joe Casagrande, Maurizio Cascella, we were all like, wow, this is absolutely something that connects each other every time more. And then also Dino and Gianjo, they arrived with their musical approach and it was something absolutely compatible to what we were doing. And Rossella as well. So Brando also was doing with me the first very successful record from Elettronica Romana, Destination Eskimo. What was the approach in your mind? And why? Why in Italy? You mean about the music? Why to do it that way? Somehow, I think something happened because it had to happen. Because we had the background that was Loridi and all the others. So the darker side of things was not unknown to us. Using a word. Yeah. But actually this is the proper word because... Is it? Yeah. Okay. Because Rome is very beautiful. It's very, let's say, fascinating town, full of history, but it's also strange. has some evil aspects. I guess the evil component of this town is related to the history that the town has. The sculptures you can see just walking around. you will notice that a lot of the sculptures of the beauties are expressing something dark. And as a citizen... I'm kind of used to, but it's always in there, so you feel always surrounded by this. And somehow I think in a subliminal way this has been influencing generations over generations of music producers and art performers in general. We certainly go back to Goblin. Laurie D as you mentioned seemed to you to be the I see definitely a connection I believe Laurie D would tell you the same you know there's also the idea and I don't know how much you should make of it, the political situation, especially right now. But the thing is that you have to consider several components. And one of these is also the presence of the Church here, which is so strong and so... influenced so many minds around. And... also there is the political situation itself where also so that the church somehow is involved. So the world's political structure here is a bit complicated and has many levels. It must be... What do you want to know? I don't know. There's so much to know. Yeah, there is a lot. I guess I'm most interested in perhaps you feel like it does affect you in a... appreciable way like that you can feel it. It actually did because being interested as a person to the history and to the art in general this is something that has been giving me a big impact over the years and the rest of the job has been done by the music that I've been surrounding with. coming from here. That was of course not only dark music, but was music made with a lot of conscience, conscious knowledge and feeling and musical attitude. Why do you think that sound works so well? I think there is a sense in this because the way to let the beats flow, the way to let the atmospheres have a dominant role in the music, it's something that it's so related to. to the way the town is living the daily life. It's so related also to the prog experimental component of the Italian culture. kind of sinister approach to the production in general. It's funny though, I feel like your music in particular has a lightness to it. that someone like Giorgio and Obtain right now with Suloft or Claudio Piercy, that's dark. That stuff has, it is, there's a lot more sinister element to me than it is to yours. There's always a light at the end of the tunnel with you. Yeah, but there is a tunnel still. You are still in a tunnel. That's the point. The fact is, I guess, just related to the period of life you are going through. There is a moment for extreme darkness, why not? And if you feel it, it's well done. And I also have been going through darker periods and making maybe darker beats. I don't know. I just know that from since at least a couple of years the musical way I do is going together with the experience in life I'm doing right now. So you'd say you're... So I feel I'm quite optimistic, really. And yeah, I still like hanging around in the darkness, but always... popping up and trying to see if there is a sun to see something like that. There's a moment in the new record that you did with Neil that the chords come in and it's just like, it's like, oh, thank goodness. Yeah. Yeah. And that gave me also that same feeling because it was time to step over. All of this is just following the path of what I'm doing in life. And I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. I always like to ask this, not to put people on the spot or anything, but I wrote this piece called Italians Do It Darker. What did I do? What did I miss? Aside from people's names. What did I get wrong? What did you not agree with? maybe well i basically i'm fine with this because um has been done by someone who didn't grow up or didn't touch the scene in the daily life basically what it's obvious here it's something that someone else outside of Italy might also not consider and it's fair. Basically the whole thing also gave me a good view about how the character of the Italians is. which is to hate and to love at the same time. Of course, if you say Italian do it darker, many Italians go dark, and many Italians would be deserved to be mentioned in that article. Yeah, and I missed, I didn't name a lot of people. Absolutely. But you didn't organize a kind of process. in an article by intention. You just did what you feel to do in that moment. And now we have the chance to talk about, again, and for sure we can go a little bit deeper, and mention a few of the darker Italians that can, of course, deserve, of course, to be on the spot. I guess it's also a question of international recognition at the same time. It's also that. But it's also related to the ego of the Italian. And this is something that brings us on good levels in the art, in many aspects, in the cinema. Italians are colour-filled. They get angry and five minutes after they love each other. So everything has been always surrounded by this approach, hate and law. I think, especially with articles like those, my philosophy is that it's a starting point for people to go further. Definitely. It's just sometimes difficult for me. And I really want to say that. It's difficult because when it's about articles on some aspects of the Italian music, and I'm involved in that many times. my name is there and other people would like their name to have the same sure and in many and I'm sure they also deserve this but it's also like that it's it's it's I guess normal that if someone gets more popularity is used as a reference and I guess we've already talked about it. You would agree, though, that there is something strange and there is something there. There is a type of techno that is being made by Italians. That is spread now. You know, you look at a label like Prologue, which is from Munich. Exactly. And there's a lot of people surrounding it that have either been making that music for years and Prologue said, oh, bring this in. Of course, that fits the sound. It was tough when I was writing it to say. just Italians because there's tons of people around the world who have the same idea but it just seemed strange that there were so many. Yeah, this is also because of the great job that Tom from Prologue has been doing and also you can feel he's doing that because of passion. He has a family, he has two kids. and for him the music and the label is his toy. How did you get in touch with him? Because of the music. Some of my friends, Dino first was connected to Tom and then after a while, of course, that is the connection, that is the sound. It was of course a step to do and I'm glad that it happened. And somehow I also feel to say that basically he could really see what the potential of Elettronica Romana was when we did that. And of course that was a wonderful moment also during the "Electronica Romana", especially in the beginning, and also because of the character that we have somehow, the situation was not anymore under control. What do you mean? Can you say? I can say that basically got the power and the feeling that was proper of electronica romana and somehow from Germany he was able to go further with that. And somehow the "Electronica Romana" project, after the start, got stuck because of our character. Because at the end everyone, I guess, loved each other, even if we couldn't at the end work together because of differences. ideas and being Italians being Romans especially it was difficult to to put all these characters together and it took a German to put all of these Italians in order I personally, this is just my personal way to see how things developed over the years, but I see a natural connection between the electronic Roman and prologue. Do you worry that this is a sound that is going to get stale somehow? No, the only thing that I'm concerned to say is that the things get stuck or to a dying point in the moment. There are no ideas behind. And I believe it's all about refreshing our musical ears and the ears in general. and be open to do something different. Same tripping but using different mentality sometimes. This way you keep yourself alive and you keep a label alive. the music you do live. I suppose that's why you collaborate so much, in a way. Yeah. It depends also by the period I'm experiencing, but sometimes I just do love to spend, to share the production time with a good friend. It's the best thing ever. Tell me about the album. Yeah. It's called Voices from the Lake. Yeah. Where is the lake? Is the lake a real thing? Yeah, the lake is real, and it's located in Sabaudia, next to San Felice, which is the village I used to live in. And it's basically, the whole area is a national park. its full and powerful nature. there is just a few people living in there and I was lucky enough also to grow up when I was a kid in there and then probably spent the most significant period of musical production of my life in there. So it was of course the step after was connecting with the local people. that was doing things completely different of what I do. So I was just tripping out of my music in my studio, but when I was out of it, I was staying together with people with dust. absolutely different things. And one thing that we shared in common was the pleasure of making parties together. And they immediately joined the experimentation way, which makes every party different. one before. So in occasion of the birthday celebration of the twins, they are two of my very good friends in there, and they have a private space in this forest next to the lake. and it was made really for a great party so I was DJing for them in there now quite a lot of years ago and From that moment we started regularly putting private parties together. A few years ago also Neil Pepe joined us and slowly we just figured out that we had to do something to celebrate that. Because it's a very heavy and... important component in our musical stability every year. We do a lot of professional gigs, a lot of traveling around, but then we need to go back. to the place and make a party at the lake just to reset to zero everything where did you meet him um neil came to the studio to the brancaleone to listen to to me when i was playing maybe it was year 2000. and he was 17 years old, shy enough to not talk to me for the next two years. And then through common friends, they told me, really, this guy is promising, he's a young talent. just came from the south of Italy and slowly we started talking and becoming friends. I could see how he was dedicated not only to the musical approach itself but also on the technical aspect of things. He's a mastering engineer. Yeah, no he's not. Wasn't at the time. No, at the time he was a good DJ. Yeah, he started really being obsessed by the technical view, how to make a record sound good, and now he is the person who is in charge to master all the things I do. and a lot of my friends do mastering through him. Somehow it's the perfect situation now, also because we have a lot of fun doing music together, so it's the best person to deal with. Was there a particular thing that you... talked about or idea that you wanted to pursue with the record like was there a record that you both said yeah that's the thing the thing is we are both techno guys of course but we wanted also to to do some techno that we didn't used to do like okay Let's make it techno, but let's make it slower first. And then we realized after a while that we were building up things at a slower BPM that we were absolutely now used to this BPM and anything faster was sounding too fast, just too fast. So we thought, okay, we go. under 10 and let's see if the people respond to this. I think that people can dance at any BPM. It's all about the mood and the right position in a slot. And all of these things were carefully prepared. So we spent, let's say, a period in June while we had talking, but not even too much because we know each other well. So we just knew that that was going to be built up for the Labyrinth and we know the Labyrinth very well. Pepe came just for dancing the year before to jump on stage in there. So he knows what we are talking about. And so it was not a problem to decide what the mood was going to be. So you just said 110 BPM or slower. That's perfect BPM. Okay, let's go with that. And everything worked because the people could listen to it. That was also the slot after that. the sound system was shut down for the night break. So we thought, okay, let's still make the people move, but in a more soft way. We have been really calibrating the sound before in order to not offend anyone after such a day of music. And that's basically what we only have been taught. The rest was just going in the studio or just sitting here in the living room and jamming, making new music. beats, new loops. So was the album basically created for a live show? Yeah, exactly. And we organized all the equipment to bring with us just for that occasion that we collect together. So I don't guess we are going to build up such a list of synthesizers again. After the time you spent in Berlin you came back to Italy. Why? I just wanted to go back basically. I wanted to go in a calm place, silent and I had that chance, that time my parents could give me the house. This is the house that you said you were just sitting there making music all the time. And it was one of your most productive periods. Yeah, the most. And yeah, that was that option. Basically I learned all the things that I was looking for and especially I was feeling good. That's the point. So after three years living in Berlin I was a happy guy. So I thought okay now I can go back and join my family a bit more. I can just focus on the music. When I was living there, I was feeling absolutely all right relating myself to the people, to the town. I still have a lot of friends in there. Would it be wrong to say that you kind of... found yourself as a DJ in Berlin and then you found yourself as a producer when you moved back to Italy? Correct. Do you think you needed that time to be alone for a while to work on this stuff? Totally. To get there? Absolutely. to this is because not only because of me but for example I'm very thankful because that time I came back and my parents helped me so much just giving me the house that was a gigantic chance for me so I was also not that young so I was about 37 years old already starting my back problems and saying okay now it's really time to rock it and so as more I was doing as more I was getting happy with what I was producing and I was more I was feeling happy with myself you mentioned that you were 37 I mean it seems like but now it's many years ago but it seems like an age at which you know wow like you're still devoted to it and you're finally finding your voice it's kind of like a amazing thing to think about that it took you that long to get to a place where you finally felt yeah here's what i have to say yeah definitely and i was in italy i was unhappy for some reasons not only because of the music, for all the things that were happening in life. And then I moved to Berlin, but my problems were following me, of course. And then in Berlin, find yourself. Most of all, that was the point. Find yourself. And then translate this in the music thing. So Berlin was the... the moment of the focus of all of this. And I was alone enough in there because people, if there is another good thing of Berlin, is that if you want to stay alone, people just let you stay by yourself. And then I was ready to really go and stay by myself because in San Felice I didn't have anyone many days to talk with. especially in the first period. But later all things were sorted out in the perfect way possible. So now that I'm back in Rome, I just feel all right. Where next? Where do we go from here? You know, it seems like you're enjoying a lot of international gigs now, maybe probably more than ever before. I don't know. And you say your back hurts. Oh, yes. And, yeah, this is actually, this is really a problem for me because I like going playing and I realize that sometimes my body doesn't react to my enthusiasm. And this is frustrating, I have to say, also because the type of problem like... It's not easy to fix. It's just... It's something that you have to take care of very carefully. Because if you are blocked, you are fucked. Especially when it happened a couple of years ago, I was in the States and I couldn't move anymore. There is not so much to do about this. And so I just need to be careful. This is one of the reasons why I tend to stay really short time when I go playing outside of Italy, because I'm sure that if the problems start... I have enough time to go to the airport, go back to my place and be stuck, but at least in my house. And every year it happens quite often. What would you like to be doing in five years? I guess in a few years, probably the only thing I will be able to do would be to do music, sit down in the studio and do that. And about gigs I'm not sure. I need to be careful about this. We will see. Anyway, what I know is that despite the problem... I really find a lot of stability going and relating myself to people, to lovely people, especially over the past two years. Now that the music is getting more defined, what I do, also the crowds I deal with are more defined. And yeah, I love all of this. So maybe in five years I will be sitting in the studio doing some music. Maybe, I mean, I would like to do music for documentaries or stuff like this. Are there any plans for the label, Aquoplano? Okay, the "Acquaplano" is another chapter. Basically, it's the toy that me and Manuel, Noel, put together. It was 2008 when we decided, okay, let's do something. And that reflects the friendship I have with him. And somehow also reflects the kind of personality we have. We are both a bit lazy. Yeah, we kind of made really a few amount of releases, but good ones from our point of view. And basically we would like to make it a bit more, giving more continuity, also because we have a lot of ideas of things we want to do. about the music, next steps, it would be cool probably to increase the releases to at least two, three per year. Somehow I don't see that happening. No, but yeah, in fact we... But maybe, but now many things changed because... I can't be too lazy. I mean my wife is really bringing a lot of balance to so many negative aspects of my character. What were the negative aspects of your character? That I'm fucking lazy. Yeah, I do tomorrow. This is always the way I do. And, you know, it's difficult to speak about this. But... Yeah, this is one of the negative aspects. Then, let's say, yeah, I'm very obsessed, compulsive, I would say. Always priority to the... When I'm into the music, I'm like, I forget about anything. around and this can be very dangerous from time to time. Yeah. And it can be a good thing as well. Yeah, it can be a good thing because of course having such an attitude means that when you are in the studio you have to reach the point. And then I get that's the base of the obsession. So I just keep on going like this. But I try to be better on some aspects otherwise. Or your wife will make you be better. Yeah, I believe so. Thank you.
