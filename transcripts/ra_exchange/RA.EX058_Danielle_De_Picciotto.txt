See the little fish swimming in the pond. Never knew the sea, never saw beyond. Couldn't learn to fly, didn't have no wings. to be encased in the dark birthplace little specks of light shining through the green golden in their cage peering through the screen all those little things Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artist labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. A few weeks ago on Resident Advisor, we presented a video about Berlin's clubbing scene and took in its history and how it operates currently. Such films can rarely tell the entire story, however, which is why we supplemented it with interviews with people like journalist Tobias Rapp, DJs like Dixon. This week's RA Exchange adds further to that ongoing conversation as I sit down with author Danielle Di Picchiato, who moved to Berlin in the late 80s. Her recent book, The Beauty of Transgression, highlights some of the important characters she met through her work as an artist, fashion designer, musician, and door person at some of the city's most famous clubs, like E-Vurk and UFO. It's a wonderful read. I talked with Danielle last month about the book and her life in Berlin. Which is great and tall, backling me. ♪ Shining through the green ♪ ♪ Golden in their cage ♪ ♪ Peering through those green ♪ All those little fish Dreaming of the sea Born to bear a fate that's not How did you find yourself in Berlin? It's obviously in the book, but if you could just sort of explain. You were already in Germany before you came to Berlin. What was the decision? I originally came from New York. I was living in New York and New York in the 80s was quite different from New York today. It was extremely dangerous. I had people being shot, friends, teachers. I was studying at FIT back then and raped, murdered, robbed. It was horrible in a way. I mean, it was a very inspiring time, of course, but it was bad. And I lived in a continuous state of fear constantly. When I came to Germany, I was shocked at how not dangerous it was. Also, I went to Cologne first because I was offered a job there as a fashion and costume designer for a company. And I was shocked at how Cologne, you know, you could just walk down the streets. You didn't have to know who was walking in front of you and who's walking behind you at all times. So I was like, wow, it's pretty impressive. Then I got bored of Cologne because, as in my book I wrote, it's a great town, but it's a little safe. So I went out to, I went to Berlin to check it out. and was amazed at how safe this city was as well. And on top of it, how cheap, how incredibly cheap. My first apartment that I mentioned in my first room in a big loft cost about 30 marks per month, around 15. with all costs include, like all costs together, it was just, you know, a couple of marks more. It was just a joke. So I was like, wow. And on top of that, it was as creative, if not even more creative than New York during those times because... When I went to Berlin in 87, New York was starting to ebb a little lower during that time. I think that Andy Warhol died shortly before. It was extremely creative. So I was like, okay, it's safe, it's cheap, it's creative. I'm staying. It seems interesting that you describe it as almost exactly the same situation. except this safeness. We did an interview recently with another writer who talked about how a lot of Detroit techno people would come into town and how it must have felt. very similar to Detroit because it was kind of dirty and kind of like run down and, but it was completely safe. And that was the, that was the enormous difference. That's a big difference. I mean, if you're constantly scared. It affects your whole life. And that was the case. I mean, being scared all the time is a horrible, horrible feeling. When you got to Berlin, you describe it in the book sometimes as there's this like existential dread almost as though it's... And other people I've heard describe it as an island. You know, obviously it's an island in the middle of East Germany in a way. Did it feel that way to you? feel like you were cut off from everything almost. Oh yes, of course, because back then you were cut off in a way. I mean, you know, Berlin did not have people constantly coming in and going out as they do today. In fact, after coming to Berlin, I hardly left Berlin at all for a long time because, I mean, of course you could, but flying was a lot more expensive back then. And going out by car or by train was just an ordeal. I mean, going by train was always, you felt like in a movie because, you know, it would stop at the train station within East Berlin, but you wouldn't be able to go out. You would look out the window and there are machine gun patrol stations everywhere. It was like in a movie, like, you know, during the war. And it was very, very obviously still a post-war city because it still looked as if it had, you know, had a war not long ago. And you still had that feeling because there were all the different, you know, the French and the English and the Russian. areas. So it was, it still was. I mean, today, if you go to Bosnia, you have a similar feeling. Countries that had a war 10, 15 years after, you still can feel that, you know, a lot. Of course, this was a bit longer, but you still felt it. It's interesting, though. I mean, it was longer. You had these buildings that were completely deserted for 40, 50 years by whomever. It seems like there were also, it was strange that there were a lot of buildings because of the way the city was carved up right in the middle of the city, which I think is a... When the wall came down, it was sort of like there's all this enormous playground in the middle of the city, which seems kind of shocking and strange, you know, because so much of like New York, for example, it gets pushed out to the suburbs and further and further away from Manhattan as gentrification continues. Well, I mean, you know, in the 80s. there were a lot of bomb buildings in the middle of Manhattan too. I think that with Berlin especially, it was because it was kind of held in this timeless capsule of being an island. That was also the feeling that I thought was just amazing. I mean, that's what kind of got me most. It was like you were in a place that did not have a real time. It was a mixture of past and present, which I had never experienced, and I have not experienced since then anywhere else. Because it was surrounded by the wall and because all the people were there to upkeep that it wouldn't change, that was basically the idea. We're going to keep this city in a state so that nothing can happen. We're going to guard it so that nothing changes, that they don't suddenly get some ideas again. And you could feel that. I mean, there was nobody coming in to invest. There was nobody going out. It was just, you know, completely in a kind of dream thing. One of the places that you wrote about that you lived. also that I found such a striking image was you live right next to the wall and can sort of look over to a school, I believe. Yeah, kindergarten. It must have been to have, I guess the way you describe it is you were kind of looking two ways every day. Yeah, every day. I mean, it was. I was confronted with that all the time. You could hear it, of course. I mean, you know, you hear the sounds and you heard the cars and you heard the children laughing. It's hard to say how weird that was and how never it never stopped being strange. You wrote about traveling over to the east though to meet go to some parties and things and to meet people in fashion as well some designers. What was that like to go to make just the simple act of going past? I mean were you getting Searched quite a bit to make sure you weren't smuggling in contraband and whatnot. Oh, yeah I mean it was always scary I would always had to take checkpoint Charlie obviously because I'm American so You had to get in line for quite some time then you had to go through this little house I think it's I'm not sure if it's still there that you can look at it or not It was like this, actually, I think only part of it is, it was a pretty long kind of barrack and you had to go through different stages and they would check you, they would look at the stuff that you do, they would ask you all kinds of strange questions, which didn't really make sense. And of course you weren't allowed to stay longer than 24 hours. You had to tell them exactly how much money you were taking in and you had to be able to take out the exact same amount. Otherwise you were smuggling. And yeah, I mean, it was always, you were always kind of worried that you weren't going to make it in. And then obviously we're always worried that you weren't going to make it back out. Do you think you seem more suspicious or less suspicious because of being an artist of some sort? I think everybody was suspicious. They didn't trust anybody. Tell me about Geniale Dilettanten. Geniale Dilettanten. Thank you. What was that? It was a group of people and I think it kind of started like everything kind of starts without meaning to start. You know, just a lot of people in Berlin that were creative. And because, I mean, the striking thing about Berlin back then was that... They didn't have there weren't all those stores you have nowadays with all this different stuff I mean there were basic stores of food and clothes and even that was very basic a lot of secondhand stuff But in general there were not very many things to buy. I mean it was very very sparse So if you wanted it to have anything special or interesting you had to make it yourself And if you wanted to get something specific, you'd have to get it out of West Germany. You'd have to order it or have people bring it or go there, which was a pretty big deal. So it was limited. Everything was limited. It was really, really the basics. And people were not rich. There was not. very much money. A lot of people that came there came because, you know, guys because the army and other people came because they wanted an alternative lifestyle. So that whole feeling of not being or not living a luxurious life was very, very dominant. So if you wanted to, for instance, do music and buy an instrument, a lot of people wouldn't be able to. or if you wanted to buy fashion or if you wanted to whatever, you know, so you'd kind of make it yourself. And Geniale Dilettanten was basically a group of very experimental artists and musicians that just started doing their own thing. either because of lack of money or because that what was being offered was not interesting to them. They were also people in general that, and I mean, you know, a political kind of revolutionary stance was common back then in general anyway. I mean, there was a very political situation in Germany as such, of course. So a lot of people came to Berlin because not agreeing with politics or wanting to have an alternative lifestyle. Was it an active political stance or was it just like I just in general disagree? For a lot of people, it was very active. I mean, you know, the demonstrations. In a way, I find we're taken a lot more seriously back then by some people than nowadays, where sometimes it's like such a thing that's so like, oh, shall we go to a demonstration or shall we not go today? Back then it was... a real, I mean it was the whole anti-atomic movement and all those things, it was new and people were very, very much against it. So for many people it was very political, even coming to Berlin. It was a kind of saying that I'm not going to go along with the things that are happening in other places for a lot of, in a political level. So this group of people, they were very precise about saying, we do not want to follow standard thoughts or the standard way of doing things, even doing music. We're going to do it completely differently. And how different can you be by not learning the basics of how to do something? We're just going to ignore that and do our own thing. And I mean, a lot of people that were participating back then still are that way up to today, just in their way of saying, I'm going to decide. exactly on how I do something and I'm not going to learn how to do it by common standards. That's kind of how it came together. I mean, there were a lot of different people and there were people that wrote manifestos like Wolfgang Müller. and different people that had different ways of going about doing it. But in general, it kind of was founded on that state of mind. It all sounds very serious, but in reading your book, I also got the sense there's a lot of humor in it, a lot of absurdism. Absolutely. I mean, there was a feeling of Dadaism and Surrealism throughout the whole thing. And I think that's why it was so successful too in a way because it was very serious. But at the same time, they kind of, I mean, if you put everything into question, you also have to put yourself into question, obviously. And that brings with it a sense of humor. You can't say I'm not going to believe in anything but is right, but I think I'm right, you know. So you're going to obviously say, well, you know. everything I say is true, everything I say is a lie, and even that is a lie, or even that is not true, you know, so. Where did you first run into electronic music? Was it, you were seeing Dr. Mata at a certain point, was he sort of the gateway into that thing? For me, I mean, I was dealing with musicians from the very start because the place I moved into at the beginning already had musicians living there. And obviously experimental electronic music kind of was around a little bit already anyway, just but more sound quality things, not necessarily doing music like it would come up later on. And the real, I mean, up to... when, like, I think it was 80. probably. That was when I started hearing about electronic music together with Dr. Amata because he was always getting sent records because he was a DJ of course from the very start and he was sent records all the time. Our whole apartment was covered with records. We always kind of had to get rid of them every half or he did. Every half a year, like 2,000 records, he would do sales and stuff. And so he was sent records and they became more and more electronic within '88, I'd say. And a lot of those records seem to be coming from England. Yes. England and Detroit, Chicago, of course. But England was the first place. And you made a memorable trip over there. The way you stayed in nunnery? Yes. I don't remember exactly why that decision was made in the book or if that was even described. Well, we were poor. I mean, DJs back then earned, I think, seven marks per hour. Motte was working at Turbine, his club, and I was working at his club, waitressing, so we weren't very rich. And again, flying was very expensive back then. It was always a pretty big decision to fly somewhere. and London was already expensive back then, and we didn't know anybody there. So my mother, she said, she had been in London, and she said, I stayed in this really nice place. My mother's kind of esoteric. She said, I said, it's a really nice place, and it's very, very cheap, and so she gave us the address. She just gave you the address. Yeah, it turned out to be a nunnery. It was really strange. Yeah. We were praying all the time besides going to tech. Well, we were listening to praying. You snuck out after everyone else went to sleep. Over the wall. You weren't allowed to actually go out after 10. There's this big bell in the gates. And I just love the way you describe it. You describe it as though you're following hair colors to where to go. Yeah. I mean... It was great. We hadn't seen any of that. We hadn't, I mean, Berlin didn't have anything of those colors and fashions before that. So for us, it was like going into some kind of, yeah, trip or something. I mean, people were already... As someone who's into fashion, though, I mean, in the way you talk about it, it... My conception of Berlin in the late 80s is just gray, black. There's no color for some reason. Then I look at some of the photos in your book, and maybe it's just because they're wearing your own designs. It's actually really colorful. And there are designs and prints and all these things. Well, there were specific fashion designers that were doing things like that. I mean, like Shida Bawa, for instance. A lot of fashion designers were doing fashion back then that were very Baroque. I mean, Berlin as such was gray and black. And the feeling, the existentialist feeling was very dark. But especially the fashion. I mean, it was kind of like a Baroque vampire fashion. I'd say that was very popular back then. People wore extensions, but kind of like in a Louis XIV, like a French. curly-haired wig extension thing and they'd wear a very heavily brocade, heavy brocade or velvet, stuff like that, with lots of trims. So it was, I mean, it wasn't brilliant colored, but it was colorful. Costumey. I mean, that's another thing that's kind of typical. It was typical Berlin back then, too, which you kind of forget, which I even forgot. If you go to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum, you kind of see that in some things, or if you see old documentaries of the times back then, people were wearing self-made clothes. Creative people or people that went out to clubs were wearing self-made clothes, almost everybody. So you didn't have, I mean, I remember the first time people really, in my crowd, that people started really wearing. like Carhartt or fashion designer stuff was probably in the, I don't know, 94, 93, unless you were really very, very rich and you would go out and buy that stuff because, you know, that's when it slowly started coming to Berlin. Before that, people were wearing secondhand clothes or self-made clothes. And if they made their own clothes, obviously they weren't going to do like sportswear. They were going to do something that's out of the regular kind of, they'd do something that's kind of costumey. People were very, very costumey. So even the excess, like even, you know, like Blixa or Gudrun Gud or the people that were like in that genial little tent and scene. They wore black, but they wore very extreme clothes, like riding boots and huge leather coats that would wave behind them, you know, like float behind them and stuff. So it was, in the fashion, it was colorful. You mentioned Gudrun, and you devote an entire chapter to your relationship with her. What was it about her that was so striking to you that was so different? Well, for one, we just obviously had a very strong connection from the very start. I mean, you just had that with specific people. But she was somebody who was, well, she was one of the few women that kind of, from the very start, participated in that whole music scene. I mean, there were quite a group of women. But in the Guignol and Little Lieutenant scene, she was one of the few that immediately from the start was as dedicated and as ambitious as the guys, basically. I mean, there were a lot of women that were doing things, but I guess that she was one of the most ambitious ones that said, you know, I'm not going to step back. At all, in any way. You said that she fought poverty and chauvinism. Yeah. I mean, what kind of, do you remember specific instances of her coming and being like, ah, this guy, or like, just in general, were there certain things that you were just like, this is ridiculous? Um... Well, I mean, chauvinism is something which is always there up to today and which is not necessarily done in a very blatant manner, but which is kind of more done through networking. I think that the strongest weapon of chauvinism and of that whole kind of world is networking. And it's very, very difficult up to today as a woman to be able to not necessarily infiltrate it, but just to become part of that networking as a man very easily can. And women still do not network as much as men do. And back then it was much, much stronger, of course. Although in Berlin, within Berlin, that was a special thing about Berlin. It was consciously, actually, in a way, boycotted by men themselves, even though it was still there. So in a way, because of course, Erudite was putting everything into question, also that was put into question. But maybe it's just a natural thing, I don't know. And she just completely ignored that. I mean, she just somehow, the way she is, was part of it. I mean, she has very many male characteristics. which can be positive or negative, but which probably helped her to be part of that. Like, for instance, being very pragmatic about things, like not getting hurt quickly. People could say very, very blunt and unfriendly things, and she would just completely ignore it. she wouldn't even listen to it. Where other women would be hurt and men would just, I mean, men are very often very good at just not listening to things they don't want to hear. She's good at that. And I think that's one of the reasons why she was part of, I mean, she was, you know, the founders of Neubauten and of course, back then already the Neubauten crew was very strong-willed. So to actually have done that, as Beate Bartel too, that kind of shows that she was cut out of a different wood. At the same time, you mentioned in the book that one of the things that set her apart, maybe from other women at that time, was that she was also willing to be very feminine. Yes. I mean, that's what has been the fascinating thing about her from the start and up to today. I mean, she's very tough. She knows exactly what she does and she will not let anything stop her. I mean, even her own insecurities. I love the story. For a long time, she was only doing her record label now, right? But she started performing, I think, about two or three years ago on her own. because she said that as a record label, it's so difficult to survive that she was putting the little money that she was earning through her own performances into her record label. And at one point she was like, this is ridiculous. I'm an artist. as well as the record label and I want to do more of my own things without putting everything into my record label so she started dividing that more and more and her first complete solo performance she was so nervous that she was she got sick like before the concert twice and then she came on stage And everything went wrong to the extent that the audience actually almost jumped on stage to help her because they felt so sorry for her. But something like that would not ever stop her. I mean, if she would be scared, if everything says no, she would continue doing it. So that attitude together with still being very, very feminine, for instance, fashion-wise, or even, you know, loving interior design details and liking really fully feminine things. I mean, that was like this kind of contradiction, which I think makes things... fascinating anyway. I mean, that's what I love in general, contradictions. Is she the connection to Dimitri from Trezor? Because I know you did that installation, I guess, in the basement for her Ocean Club thing? Uh-huh. Or was that, had you met him quite a bit before then? Actually, I introduced her to Dimitri. I was introduced to Dimitri through Dr. Motte, and I immediately started collaborating with him a lot. He always was somebody that supported projects. in a really fantastic way, financial and always, he always had some kind of space somewhere. He was a collector of spaces. He always had five, six, ten different places either that he was using or just keeping for something that would come up. And I started doing stuff with him pretty immediately. He was amazing from the very start. I guess it's something that goes under. recognized is the fact that he wasn't just you know into techno he was supporting you know art installations in the club and doing all sorts of other things yeah he was I mean he's one of the very few business people and he is a business person definitely who had who managed to stay idealistic and realized that you have to continue investing into art if you want to stay in touch with art and not just become... A lot of things just at one point they're so obsessed about money that they forget where they come from. He never did that. Up to today, he still invests into artists and art. He was supporting artists throughout the 80s and 90s by paying their rents. Artists that he considered good, he would pay rents. He would pay complete exhibitions. He would finance spaces and projects. He tried with everything that he did. Like at the beginning, I don't know actually if space beer still exists. He did this beer thing. And even there, he would, for instance, ask artists to write poems that were supposed to be put onto this beer bottle or draw little cartoons. So everything he did, he always used a part of the money to invest into the arts. He even had a secret treasurer thing where he would... give a specific sum of money once per year to an artist that they thought was important to support and give them money once a year, like give them this kind of grant thing. So I don't know anybody else, not anybody from all the club people internationally that I know that to that extent has supported arts as he has. It's not only that he did it to support artists, but also because he himself just absolutely loves art. And I think that's great if somebody who's such a businessman has that side too, which is another example. That's why I feature him in my book of somebody. Most of the people I feature in my book have these two sides within themselves, which are contradictions to what people very often are. And I think that these contradictions always bring about something really special. What was one of the first, I mean, Dr. Mata had his club. Was UFO one of the first clubs? First, you mean... That you were going to and sort of involved in, in any way? Yes, absolutely. What was that like? what was that place like? It was I mean that feeling of excess and madness that you had in in the 80s clubs that was still in that club it was a mix I mean it was one of the very first ones obviously so every all of the first clubs were kind of still merging fashions and styles and I mean music why musically the UFO of course from the very start UFO had electronic music, but you still had all kinds of different people coming in there that were like, you know, figuring out what they were going to be listening to in the next couple of years. So it was, it was still, it still had that feeling of being really experimental. I mean, like for instance, at Tresor, same thing. At the beginning, Tresor was playing all kinds of different musics. They had different rooms for different music styles. So you had that feeling from the beginning. Also there was the Fischbüro in Kreuzberg, which also belonged to Dimitri, where Kid Paul was doing his first parties down in the basement. And that was like a typical... Berlin 80s space. I mean, you had to go down like this wooden, really steep kind of ladder, which was kind of scary because it was wiggly. And you'd go in and it was like a completely, I mean, the floor was dirt. The walls were old, like brick walls that were super dirty. And everything was just so incredibly dirty. It was incredible. And Kid Paul was DJing on this piece of wood. I mean, he didn't even have a table or anything like that. So it was super underground. And that's kind of what the first clubs still felt like. I mean, they were incredibly underground, all of them. Did Planet feel like a step up? Well, no. I mean, it wasn't that dirty. We kind of made that. cleaner but it still had I mean it still had a very very mingled crowd I mean Dominique Kutsendato who was an artist who was doing a lot of the decoration at the beginning and Elsa from toys and from Miriam off later on and these were all artists which were not at the beginning, you know, they didn't have the techno, that techno style thing at all. At the beginning it was just, I mean, Domenico wasn't a surrealism. He was kind of more of a Dali personality who looked like him and acted like him and everything he did was very surreal. And he did a lot in the clubs. decoration wise so the beginning was very surreal so they weren't really listening to the music so much before they were decorating they were just decorating how they would decorate yeah it wasn't necessarily fit to no i mean the decorations that i did had nothing to do with the later techno style either i was working with photocopy art and um I was more into erotic kind of, still kind of Baroque, Rococo things that were slowly getting a little bit more digitalized. But it was all very frilly. It was, I mean, I think that's one thing that is a real... Up to the point that Dimitri said, okay, now I'm going to decide on what the Trezor look is going to be like. And he had the whole thing renovated again and put into one specific style. You could actually almost say that it was frilly. And a lot of clubs were until it became clear that it was going to be going to more of this kind of digital sparse. feeling which then became like the techno style planet was kind of you describe it as alice in wonderland even looked like it yeah from the outside yes yeah who was in charge of that can you well of course hilla the mother of all techno clubs She was a very impressive woman. She started working in Potsdamer Abkommen, which was one of those places which formerly had been, I think, a strip club or a brothel. She was the... manager of that place and she worked in all kinds of very you know basically all the important clubs and bars in Berlin until she decided to make herself to liberate herself from the shackles of being having a boss and Together with Andreas Rossmann, her boyfriend back then, she basically decided, it was basically her initiative that really moved things. Plinio was on the spree. Right now, it seems like there's a ton of clubs, a ton of nightlife. You know, there's this kind of, they're hoping to keep it that way. Was it the same sort of bustling? nightlife back then along that? Not at all because from the when the wall came down the whole Spree was actually lined with big factory buildings and on both sides kind of and At the beginning, when things were being discovered by people, like broken into, at the beginning, people mainly concentrated on small things. Because you were still not really sure, is this going to be okay or not? We weren't really used to breaking into places. I guess nobody was. Of course, back then, nobody really knew what was okay and what wasn't okay. The things that were okay were the things that nobody had an idea about. So, of course, you could break into a place that didn't belong to anybody. And breaking into a place did not mean destroying something, but actually upgrading it. So a lot of things were kind of saved. by people going in there and upgrading them. But usually it was small places. So the planet was one of the first bigger places that was turned into a club. That slowly became more and more. And I remember going across on the other side with Carl, who I describe in the book, with whom I discovered a lot of places. and kind of sneaking into a broken window and checking out these huge places. But they were so big that it was kind of like, if we do something here, because of course, obviously, if you were doing a club, if you were doing some party, you had to be careful that nothing could happen because a lot of these places had holes in the floor. They had a lot of things that could burn. They had a lot of wood. So all of the party people that were organizing events and opening clubs were very, very careful to do it in a way that nothing could happen. And it's pretty incredible that nothing actually did. We were doing part, like even the EVAC at the beginning, the first party we did was in the top floor. All the pillars had at one time, for some reason, they had plans to kind of destroy the place, and they had already done these little bombs around the pillars so that there were holes around them. So you had to be incredibly careful that people wouldn't fall through. and these places around the Spree were all like that. So those were the places that were kind of taken at the very end. I mean, I think the Spree, when was it? Beginning of maybe 2000, that it was really starting to be turned into a party place. Before that, it was just too iffy. With e-work, You devoted a chapter to that, and that was the club that came after Planet, correct? Well, there was the first Planet, the second Planet, and then the EVAC. Right. Yes. Tell me, it seems to hold a pretty special place in people's minds. You began working there when it first opened? Yes. What was, what were you doing there? I was at the cash register. The way you sort of describe coming, even just coming into the club is really fascinating. So you're almost entering a different place, a different world. Yeah. I mean, it was the universe, which was protected by a huge gate. and to be able to get in you had to basically enter a small gate within the big gate and then there was this little space where you entered and then you had to basically come to my little cubbyhole thing and pay entrance fee and then you would go through another gate there were a lot of gates and then you'd enter into this huge kind of open space of the club because the club was had two entrances I mean I had one main hall but it also had another hall So you were in this kind of, I don't know, this open space place until you would enter another door. to get into the actual club and um there was always a huge line of people i mean christmas in the year christmas in the years because there was a long a long road leading down to the gate so christmas in the year we'd actually have to um move like get a truck and stand all the way in front with the security because there were just thousands of people that wanted to get in. It was crazy. It was really scary even at times when people got, you know, restless and you had the feeling inside that they were going to push in that big metal gate because there was just thousands at the MTV party. It was like that, for instance. interview awards. Yeah. And at the first gate, you'd have the security, you'd have the bouncers, you know, choosing the people that would be able to get in. Is it hard to get in? Yeah, absolutely. And then I remember in another interview, someone talked about. Named the bouncer at planets who was a bouncer in like New York. Mickey Mackey. Yes. He was like sort of this figure. Yeah. This DJ. Like if you could become friends with him, then yes. Wow. Mackey was an entity. And a very lovable person, too. He's a great, wonderful person. He's back in New York now. Yeah, there was Mackie, and there was Angela, and there was Alexandra. And there's a whole, like, four or five people. They all became, you know, superstars. They were very strict. They had a group of about five or six people protecting them. Protecting the bouncer. Yes. And then people would be able to come in and then they'd have to prove themselves to me because I wouldn't let them in if I didn't like them. So they not only had to get past the bouncer, but they had to get past me. And I remember a couple of journalists I wouldn't let in that were screaming, but I am from... Oh, whatever. It's like, sorry. It was like the typical thing. You really only wanted people there that would keep the club as special as it was. Of course, it was a huge club. So there were thousands in the club. So, I mean, you know, we weren't as strict as we were in smaller clubs because in smaller clubs, we were even stricter. Like the planet was a lot smaller. So you had to be, of course, stricter. And then, you know, in the courtyards, there were little booths where you could already get some drinks and food and stuff. And then inside, it was like this huge space. I mean, I don't know. I guess anybody that knows Palladium in New York. kind of can compare that with that. I mean, Palladium was larger, but still in the room, the evac was larger than the Palladium with its many spaces, but the room itself was kind of comparable to Palladium. And I don't know, it just had this atmosphere of over-the-top madness at all times. It was great. I mean, there was one place which was the planet gear, the planet where, you know, the clothes that we designed for them where I had... They asked me to sew, I think it was 10 meters by 10 meters piece of fur, where I wrote Planetware on it in leather, and they hung up from, I mean, those were the sizes of things, and underneath there was a little place where you could buy clothes that was still self-made from all kinds of different designers before the fashion labels. started taking over the techno look and There were different places where you could buy drinks and different places where you could You know buy food or whatever you mentioned When fashion designers took over the techno look, uh-huh when did that labels? Well, I think it started around 90 To and you that early pretty early on yeah, I guess it was the cool hip new thing this yeah designers as on it as most people can be. I mean, I remember the first store. I can't remember what it was called. It had like this apotheca thing, this cross, this drugstore, typical pharmacy cross. And the owner was Bandnef. He was the first one that had the really cool designer techno clothes store. In Berlin, it was in Schroenebeck. What was the typical, what were like the stereotypical, this is techno fashion? Bright colors, tight, tight fitting designs. And the most, I think the most important thing was that they quite early on started designing unusual fabrics. that again dealt with, you know, people were really scared of acid rain back then and like being contaminated by the deteriorating. pollution and world's climate and stuff like that. And pretty early on, they were very conscious of worrying. I mean, I remember I was thinking of designing, I still was doing fashion. I was thinking of designing something completely in plastic and in rubber. I mean, a lot of things were out of rubber back then too. to be able to protect yourself from acid rain and stuff like that. People were very conscious, or like fabrics that would help you breathe better and stuff like that. That's kind of disappeared again. It's funny, you kind of forget about that. But back then, that was one of the new fabrics were very predominant in the early techno. To get back to E-Work, one of the things I found interesting in the way that you talked about it was the location of being sort of in the middle of the city and how people were splayed out on grass afterwards, like after they would come out, that there were these, I guess, parks sort of around there. I think Dimitri in our film put it, kind of eased their way back into reality, almost. Was that also the way that you saw it? Well, that's a polite way of putting it. Okay. What's an in-play? A very polite person. I mean, you know, Evac was... I mean, you had to walk on this kind of street to go to Evac, and on the sides of it, there was, at the beginning, it was just grass, and at one point, it became a parking place where they parked their cars. So most people, at one point, would... you know, just a lot of people came from afar, you know, from somewhere else. They would come from cities. They would drive for hours to get there. A lot of people that came were not even from Berlin. So. a lot of people would just go sit in their cars and sleep off their hangover or just go on partying in their cars. I mean, there were a lot of cars that would go on partying. And then they would go back into the club and then would go back to their car. I don't know why they did that. I've always wondered why they would want to go and party in their car next to the biggest club in Berlin. but maybe it was because they could be even more excessive in the cars. I don't know, but you would... Like I usually made a point when I was working at EVAC, this was after I had worked in clubs for years, I made a point of going home around eight. I didn't feel like, you know, working until one or two in the afternoon because I was doing a lot of art back then already. So I kind of said, you know, okay, my limit is eight. And the clubs I worked before. I very often got home at 1, 2, 3 or 4 in the afternoon. So I would go home, I would leave at 8 and then I'd have somebody that would replace me. And at that time, definitely, the whole parking place would be full of people partying in their cars or sleeping or sleeping outside because it was too hot if it was in the summer. And it would just be... Kind of like, you know, Woodstock feeling. Were you writing all of this stuff down as, I mean, did you keep a diary as this stuff was happening? And you sort of looked back on notes when you came to write this book? No. I never, I always tried keeping diaries, but I was really bad at it. I kind of, it's one of the things I always, I'm still trying to do. I'm not good at it. I always forget. But in '95, I was, I actually started writing it when I went to visit a friend in Albuquerque in New Mexico, because it was so different from Berlin, and it was the first time I'd actually been somewhere in the US outside of New York that I could remember, 'cause I moved a lot when I was small, but after my father moved to New York when I was 15. I always went to New York if I would visit him. And because flying was so expensive. So when I was in Albuquerque for the first time, I had this bird, the first time that I had a bird's eye perspective of Berlin. And I was like, wow, you know, the things that I've experienced there, this was 95, were crazy. So I started just writing it down kind of as a story because I was like, wow, I wonder, you know, what this would be like a story. So but I did it in the diary form, but I was actually consciously writing it as a story. And. Then I realized that I was starting to forget specific things and I was really shocked because the concept of forgetting, I had never thought of that because everything was so clear. I mean, '95 was basically eight years after I had moved to Berlin, so it was all pretty fresh. But even then I was starting to forget things like from the first years when I had come. So it's like, okay, this is, I should actually start really writing down things. So in a way, I continued writing in that style that I was always eight years later. And I'm really happy I did because now if I think back. I really can tell that there's things that I have difficulties remembering, like small things. If I'm talking to people that were there back then, then you can kind of remind each, but you forget so much. Things you think you would never forget is crazy. Of course, because you're experiencing a lot of things all the time, and I am because I'm touring all the time and I'm doing things all the time. So I continued writing in that manner until at one point I showed it to the Gestalten Verlag, to the main editor, and I said, do you think this is interesting for a book? And he was like, absolutely. But you, I was, you know, I had... Probably I was writing and speaking about at least 100 more people than I have in my book now. Like every page had 10 to 15 people I was speaking about and presenting. And he said, this is way too much information. This is crazy. Nobody's going to be able to understand a word. And also I had kept myself out of the book. completely because my initiative at the beginning was basically to just write about what the things that had happened within Berlin, how the things had developed musically, artistically, and how the city had changed. It wasn't my idea to mention me in any way at all. I was completely out of it. And he said, you have to put yourself in because people, when you're reading it, you're like, this person that's writing the book experienced all of these things who is it that's a big turn because it's quite a personal yes account it's a big turn and it's also a very difficult one because I'm not somebody normally that kind of, you know, speaks about myself a lot, not. And I'm actually a pretty private person who, you know, has my artistic figure and then my personal figure. And so then I kind of had to think about how to do that. which was not easy. But then when I had to rewrite the whole book, I had already written half of the book, actually. And I'm not a writer, so writing is very difficult, I find, especially if you're representing other people. You have to be very careful of what you write, because one of the things I did not want to do was to write a scandal book. I did not want to write about scandals. I did not want to... write about things that would harm or hurt people. I wanted to write about the special state of what Berlin was and what it is and what makes it special. For me, that is this kind of unconventional way of looking towards things and wanting contradictions, not wanting to be. fitting in, not wanting to be fashionable, not wanting to do things the way you're supposed to do them, but on the contrary, actually do the opposite or at least... Question why it's considered normal. That's what my thing was. So I had to rewrite the whole thing. He said, concentrate only on the people that you think were important. for more than only a personal relationships, people that kind of started things in a big kind of way, you know, that influenced things internationally, which was very difficult to do because there are a lot of people that I haven't mentioned in the book that did very, for me, important things that did influence things in the long run. but it was just too much information. So I had to think about how I represent the people. I had to think about, okay, what do I want to speak about myself? What is important? And I realized that if I'm going to do that, I'm going to have to be honest. I can't be superficial in presenting myself because that's what Berlin is about. It's kind of like the honesty and the kind of, yeah, not fashionable, trendy thing, the kind of like down-to-earth, basic reality. The beauty of transgression. Exactly, exactly. So I thought, okay, I'm going to have to be really honest, which was really difficult. But it was very interesting on the other hand because I had to question, I mean, obviously I had to write down things and I questioned myself, why did I do that? So the whole thing was a pretty transformative thing for myself too to write. It was an interesting experience. What's been the most surprising? thing that people have reacted strongly to to you the thing that for me is the most interesting about the whole thing is that when I had finished writing the book the Gestalten Verlag said actually we think this is too good for us well not too good for us but it's too we think a bigger publishing company should release this book So they contacted publishing companies and I contacted big publishing companies. And I contacted them in England and in the States. They did in Germany. And it was very interesting on how we got the same answer from all of them. All of the big publishing companies said, and I've read this quite often lately in newspapers too, that biographies are really, really hard to sell nowadays if they're not written by very famous people or if they have scandals. And they said, if you add scandals to your book, we will immediately sign you. You will get a big advance. And it will go out in a big number. But if you don't, we're not going to take it. We can't. Because we can't. People don't want to hear it. So I said, no, I'm definitely not going to do that. I could. But I'm not going to. That's not why I wrote the book. I mean, maybe someday I'm going to write. want to write a scandal book but that's not why I wanted to write this this is about something completely different and it would be completely off the line of what I wanted to do and they said well good luck we don't think anybody's going to read it and That's what I like or that's what impresses me most about the whole thing. People react very, very strongly. I've gotten reactions from people in Hong Kong. That's a good thing about Gestalt and Falak. They have a very good distribution. So it's distributed internationally. I've gotten reactions from people internationally saying that they wish there were more books like that. that the honesty of not only my story, but of also the people that I mention, that I present, that books like that should be written more. And I'm not saying that because I think that I'm so great, but I completely agree. Because while I was writing this book, I was also looking around to see see if there's books that have been written, you know, about people that do not have a scandal like biographies. And it's very, very difficult to find. which I think is a pity because I think that a lot of people are interested in hearing about the true story and they don't always want to have the dirt, maybe once in a while. But, you know, and that's the main reaction that I get in general. I mean, the tour I just did to the U.S. People were, it was always sold out and we always had very long Q&A discussions afterwards with people asking questions about Berlin and they weren't interested in the dirt either. You know, they don't want to hear about scandals or about, of course everybody's interested in sex and drugs and rock and roll, but the questions that were being asked were not about that, which I found very interesting. I think... One time somebody asked me, so what about the drugs? You know, tell us more. And that was it. Nobody else really asked about that, which I found very interesting. So what about the drugs? What do you want to know? Gosh, I got myself into a hole there. What was the drug that you were seeing the most of? Everything. In a way, you know, in a way, I think that you can say that about every city. I mean, New York had all the drugs. London had all the drugs. And of course there's a lot of stories that one can say, but in a way it's the boring part because people are always same on drugs. That's not what makes a difference. You know, every drug has its effect and every effect is the same. And some, of course, there's lots of people that did things, famous people that did. things on drugs and they say that they did it because of drugs. I don't agree. I think that the drug is only an accelerator and that the people that did the things that they did on drugs would have done them without drugs too. Everybody I've ever met that did things did them with or without the drugs. So for me, it's actually boring. Of course, it was everywhere and there were crazy situations that came up and positive and negative. But the really interesting things have nothing to do with that. Don't waste the time I've left my home for a dream Some call it misery Some call it joy I've seen the ships leave shards to flames, bodies cried, tied up in chains. I've seen the world die. Swing the light of a black dawn break into me
