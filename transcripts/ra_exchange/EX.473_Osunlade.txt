Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Born originally in St. Louis, Ocean Ledet learned his trade as a gun-for-hire producer and songwriter while couch-surfing around Hollywood in the late 80s and early 90s, landing gigs with the likes of Patti LaBelle and Freddie Jackson, as well as producing for major labels. But he moved to New York, saw him engaging with house music, and eventually entered the foundation of his label, Yoruba. an imprint that communicates his deep spiritual ties to that ancient tradition. But although Ocean Lede is best known for breakthrough house hits like Envision and Dion, his muse as often as not leads him away from house music and back to his roots in soul and jazz. As Christine Kikari found out, in this interview recorded at RA's Berlin office last month. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at RA-Exchange. The exchange with Ocean Ledet is up next. I guess a really good place to start is that this year is the 20th anniversary of your record label. Yup. Yoruba Records. Yeah, Yoruba Records. 20 years. I never thought I'd... You didn't think about it, you know? No? No, I didn't think about it. It just kind of crept up and I'm like, oh wow, okay, it's 2019. It's 20 years. It makes me feel old. I mean, I think that big anniversaries like this, they always seem to lend themselves to kind of becoming reflective and kind of taking in the full scope of whatever that anniversary is. Yeah, where you're going. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's definitely been that year for me already. As well as the climate of the business has changed with the distribution and everything. And so we've stayed a vinyl label throughout all of the changes. And now it's the most difficult time for making vinyl. I have so many records ready to go. four months, five months to get a vinyl done and the cost. So it's like, it's very, it's very interesting 20 years after seeing like where we are, you know, with the streaming, the entire change of everything, but, you know, still do it for the love. And, you know, we have a good fan base. So that makes it really important and worthy. Is your motivation? behind what voice Yoruba has? Is it still the same or do you think it's been affected? I think it's changed. I'm 50 now, so I started the label when I was in my 30s. So yeah, it's definitely different, even the music I'm doing now. And also the label has changed in the sense that it's less about me. and more about opening the doors for other artists that I believe in. So I've kind of the last, I'd say six, seven years, I've kind of stopped putting a lot of things out of myself and focusing more on the, and you know, the sales are not the same, but I think the approach and the love and the passion is the same. And also I get off on mentoring people and seeing the development, the evolution and hearing, you know, the first record. the second record, you know, okay, well, let's go here now. And, you know, and watching those people grow personally and professionally, you know, so it's kind of like you're like a kid, you know, you watch them grow and you're like, oh, well, no, that's not right. You're not, you made that song about that. That's not what you're going through. You know, it's, you know, you have to, because my family. the label is a family for me. So it's really, yeah, it's been more important for me to just kind of push other people. You know, it's like I'm settled in my musical thing. And also I'm doing a lot less house stuff now. It's more back to the soul and funk and stuff. So that's kind of taken more precedence for me personally. So yeah, it's just kind of been, you know, back and forth with trying to maneuver all the things, you know, and I four years ago, 2015 Yuru Basol, which is focusing more on non-electronic stuff, which has been good for me as well. So it's just kind of all these things in one thing and, you know, of all of the things. But yeah, it's changed, but I think it's... It's just like, you know, it's like a grandfather. You know, you watch your kids, you watch the grandkids. So it's changed, but I think the passion's still the same for sure, but the direction is different. And as well as I've had to kind of, I think I'm definitely more patient now. I sit back instead of trying. twenties, you're like, you make the world happen. You know, now I'm like, okay, let me just chill and watch what's happening and make better decisions on what to do. And so I don't rush into things. I think it's probably, nothing's urgent for me now. That's the thing that's changed. So, yeah. So you said that you're a lot more patient now, but it seems like you're no less prolific. I mean, you've just said that you've got like a No, I'm definitely more prolific now, I think because I've taken the time to just like, you know, when you're working with other people, you have all these other energies that you can build off of and vibe off of. So it's kind of one of the, and also I think it's, I'm more prolific now because I take more time to do the music. I play a lot more out, I DJ a lot more and I perform more. So I don't travel with any kind of studio. So when I go home, it's like full fledged. So if I'm on the road three months and I'm home a month, that month I've probably written two, three albums. It's kind of like that for me because I just don't do anything on the road. I kind of block my mind and I get home and I'm like, all these experiences, all these people I've met, all these things, you know, I put them in that moment. Have you always been that productive? I have, but in spurts. It's never been as frequent as it is today. Like in the last, I'd say the last four months, I've probably written about seven different projects. Complete. That's a lot. Yeah, and you know, the thing for me, it's always, it's really interesting for me to be in the place and kind of hear. objectively, the difference of them all and, you know, and how it relates to my life or whatever. But yeah, it's an exciting time for me just to be, it's kind of sad because I'm, like I said, it's so difficult now in the climate of things financially and as an independent label and trying to keep. the vinyl thing going and you know for me it's it's really important i keep going to the vinyl thing because it's really important for me especially for younger artists you know anybody can have a digital file you can change the name on it and have it be you but when the artist picks up a record he's got his credits He's got his name and, you know, and it's a thing of accomplishment. And because I started to label and we were a vinyl label, I just kind of always had that thing. Like it's a solidifying, validating thing. This is going to outlive you. You will die and be in the ground. Somebody in some place in the store will have this record. And this is a representation of you. So it's difficult to. sit back and go, I got all these records ready to go. How am I going to finance them? You know, so it's all those things. And we also started, I started a festival this year as well in Croatia. So, you know, it's all these other things. It's kind of like expanding on a shoestring budget. Sure. You know, so creatively, I'm probably the most happy I've been. You know, I worked on an album for seven years, my next album, actually, for seven years. And it basically took everything out of me. When I finished that, all these other... projects that I was mentioning before just started coming because I had this seven years of stuff like get out of me already but but it's been done and so it's but again sitting on it so what so if you had to kind of characterize what those seven years of trying to like exercise well that That album is called "Aché" which means the universal energy, the energy we get from whatever the universe has. The premise of that record was I was in a place where, like I said, I had stopped doing so much house stuff for myself and I was really getting back into the funk and the soul where I come from. I worked with an artist in Melbourne that had an orchestra. And I said, you know what? I want to put an orchestra on my album. So I literally spent the last five, six years, all my money from DJ gigs, went down and got an orchestra and did that. So that was the whole, the main thing was like, I wanted to make something that was cinematic and big. And yeah. And so you went to Melbourne to work with this. over five years back and forth and just recording and yeah. And like over your kind of very long and very detailed music career, hopefully we'll be able to touch on a lot of aspects of it. Why was it now that working with an orchestra seemed like the vital next step for you? I think it's always been in the back of my mind. When I used to produce for the major labels and I would work with artists and we had the budget to do an orchestra, I was like, one day. So it was just that thing. It was like, okay, now's the time. And I committed to, I think for the first time in my life, I committed to it financially. Like, okay, I'm going to play my ass off for two years. I'm going to take money and I'm going to go down here. And it was also the benefit of having someone who had an orchestra. So I was like, okay, you can conduct. You can arrange this thing for me. I can, you know. So we did it together and it was just right time, right situation. And the guy who did it was, I can't even say how beautiful. He made my black and white color. You know, it's totally that for me. Wow. Okay. I think, of course, having an orchestra, like as you were talking about this, immediately I was thinking of kind of like the halcyon days of the music industry when in the 70s and 80s an artist would bring in... It was just standard. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. You're not having an orchestra on this? Yeah. But considering that you're such an accomplished... multi-instrumentalist and vocalist and, you know, there's a lot of stuff that you can do on your own. Yeah, yeah. What is it about having that ensemble energy and working with a conductor that... It was the appreciation of the trust of someone touching what I do and adding what I couldn't do. And it was interesting because the way I... worked the album with, his name is James, was I didn't send him any lyrics, any songs with vocals, no melodies, just the basic tracks. And some kind of way, universally, it just worked out. Literally, the attitude of each thing was specifically the way the song, what it was about. You know, if it was dramatic, he did dramatic strings without even knowing. So, yeah, it was just that thing. Like, I knew I couldn't do that. You know, I've played strings and stuff on keys and stuff like that, you know, emulate things. To have that thing. And I must say, you know, working in a studio with strings at eight in the morning, you're like, wow, I want a quartet at my bed every morning because this is amazing. When you hear it, I mean, it's just the thing. It's like when you hear, I was hearing, listening today to Benji B working on something with a string. It's just, you know, there's sounds that you just can't replicate with anything else. A 15-piece orchestra. Right. That's serious. I want to ask you a little bit about, I mean, you talked about having this kind of unspoken connection with this particular conductor and his orchestra. And I know that faith plays a big part in your life generally. and we'll talk about that in detail in a little bit. But I'd love to know, like projects like this, the collaborations that you do, are they kind of primarily driven by these unspoken feelings or signs? Yeah, there's so many facets of my brain always working that I'm like, all right, we got to do this now. And it's always at the moment, you know, I just. you know, from collaboration projects to live things to whatever it is. It's always that thing of like, you know, my idea of my existence is my music. I only exist because my music exists. When I'm gone, that's the only thing that will outlive me. So I live in the frame of mind that I make music for when I'm not here. I make music for when I'm dead. That's kind of my thing. So it's like, I'm here to please myself musically. And if you get it, cool. But this is my statement to say I'm here. So in my mind, that's always the first thing, like self-satisfaction of what I can accomplish within myself to, you know, to go, wow, yeah, that was good. Or shock myself and go, well, you did that. You know, because sometimes you go like, well, that came out of you. So it's just those things, you know, you have so many and traveling also expands the person so much that you have, like I said, I take these moments when I'm on the road and I come back and I'm like, wow, I just had three months of amazing experiences. All that energy in one place in the studio by yourself, nothing around. You're like, it just comes out. It just comes out. So, yeah. You mentioned earlier that you've been traveling around a lot more doing DJ gigs. Too much. Well, this, I guess, kind of plays into my, what I'd like to ask you next is about, you talked about the energy that you feel and how it kind of fuels your studio projects. Yeah. As somebody who is really kind of tuned into energy and spirituality what is that process of being a touring working dj I mean, there's been a lot of conversation the last few years about how destructive this kind of lifestyle can be. How does it work for you? For me, you know, I think I've probably had the same experience as many DJs, especially starting out. You know, you get crazy young, you party. For me, it's literally, I am, first of all, I don't listen to house music outside of the times that I play house. You know, for me, the process is I get all these promos or music that I make or whatever I'm going to play a week before I go out. I spend the time and get my sets, my music together, my selections together. I'm pretty much kind of in a kind of linear space now at this age to where I can hang with the best of them. But I don't get crazy. For me, I spend probably 90% of my time in flights. Like I said, I sleep a lot. But like I said, when I go home, that's my downtime. Like nothing else matters, like my mom and my music. So that's kind of... my reset time. So when I get on the road, it's like, it's funny because after two weeks of sitting any place, I need to be on the road. I have to move. My body is just like, I can't survive being that stable for so long. So I think it's kind of in my DNA now. know I could see you know it's interesting you asked the question because I also take in mentoring some of my artists I take them on the road for me with me and my objective is you need to learn you need to experience what your life is going to be like when you get into this this is not just you know this great life you're going to be djing and having all the best things in the world it's like no you're going to see airports hotels, restaurants, and clubs and repeat. And maybe you'll sleep a bit. But, you know, so it's just a thing of like, I think it's been a learned thing for me. You know, I had to actually grow up in this. You know, it's not an easy life at all. And people think like, hey, I work my ass off. You know, and sometimes, you know, there's a... I have a mantra. Like DJs, I mean, promoters clubs or any kind of event, you don't pay me to play music. That's free. You pay me to leave home. You pay me to go through the fucking security. You pay me to go through customs. You pay me for all the inconveniences that I have to go through to get there. The rest for me is free because how great is it that I get to spend this time looking at all these people. and enjoying the music that I like with them. You know, it's like, what better job in the world is that? You know, so, but it did, again, it did take me some time to learn how to have the lifestyle and be able to be a little bit stable with it. It's not an easy one. But generally speaking over your life, you've been pretty mobile. Yeah, yeah. I'm a nomad for sure. Yeah. Yeah, I'm a gypsy. Well, where is home for you right now? I moved home, back home in St. Louis to look after my mom. I was here for, I was telling you, I was here for like a year, about a year from 16 to 18, 2016, 18. And I was quite depressed here. Oh, why was that, man? I think it was just Berlin. Okay. It was in the winter, for sure. Bro, that's your first mistake. Yeah, and you know what the funny thing is? I didn't realize until I moved home, I didn't write one song when I was here. Not one. And I moved back home and I was like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I was like, how the fuck I was depressed? And I didn't And so moving back home to look after my mom was actually looking after me. So I guess that's the second part of the answer for your thing. Home for me is the part that stabilizes me because I don't do anything but look after her and make music and cook. So I think that kind of keeps me, you know, like you say, you go home, it's just a stabilizing thing. You know that that's the route. So I think going back, you know, I've lived in Europe since 2005 and going home, you know, after 11, 12, 13 years, yeah, it was the best thing I could do, especially at my age. You know, it's like I needed that stability. and to have this moment with my best friend. So, yeah. How has St. Louis changed for you as a place to call home? Well, St. Louis was never, well, I can say it's never really home, but it was always that place that I never really felt I belonged, but that's pretty much every place for me, but because it's very segregated. And I'm just not that person. So I can never understand that thing. You know, it's just like every inner city in the States. And so growing up with that thing where I'm playing music and taking music classes with Asian and white people, you know, I got friends, you know, kids. And I'm like, well, what's going on? You mean I can't go over to Johnny's house and play? Because we don't do that. And so that thing is still the same. You know, they It's the whole racial thing in the States. I mean, St. Louis is a, I guess it's pretty much the poster child of every inner city, you know, in the States. It's a sad place in some ways, but. Again, I'm isolated into my own world. So it's like even moving around the world and living, I make my own position and situation. So I don't kind of, I don't assimilate very well. It's a nice place to be. I won't be there long. Where do you think is next? Australia. Oh, really? Why is that? I fell in love with Australia about eight years ago. I just think it's really special because they have created such a specific culture. that's not like anything else. They're so far away. And that's the reason I haven't moved there because it's so far away. And I'm like, how can I make money being this far away? Nobody's trying to book me from Australia. But I just think the people are amazing. I think that when you go there, everyone's there. Whether you're German, you're Greek, you're Turkish, but they're all Australian. So that's the thing that I like. I think I have a stronger net of friends in Australia than any place in the world. That's really interesting. As an African Australian who left Australia because it was so far away, it's really interesting to hear somebody, especially another person of color and another black person, saying that's the place I want to go. Yeah, I've experienced the racism, you know, but I mean, comparison to the States. nothing you know what i mean i just think that there's a moral sensibility there and i like that you know the first place ever in the world that they had the first gay prime minister you know just their ideas about you know there's not this big religion thing there You know, they have partners. You know, just the idea of like, you're you, I'm me. We're just human. We're here. Things are not so serious. You know, it's like, just be. You're cool. I'm cool. And I like that. You know, cost of living? Don't like that. But, you know, but that would be, you know, for the nature. for the cleanest food, the best wines. Yeah, I'm down. Melbourne, best music, baddest musicians. Yeah, I can do that. I'm from Sydney, so. But all I can do is agree with you. Yeah, I mean, you know, even Adelaide. Adelaide's like now my best. I love Adelaide now. Yeah. But yeah, it's just, you know, it's like everyone's a freak without being a freak. Yeah, right. You know what I And, yeah, it's just love. And I like that feeling. Like you're not – there's no pressure of anything. Like everyone has the best fucking life in Australia. Quality of life between there and Switzerland, I think those are the two countries that got it going. So do you feel like when you kind of recognize that Australia had something to offer for you, do you think that you were looking for that when you were – No, no, no, no. I just understand and accept every place. You know, when you travel, you kind of go in and you realize, okay, well, most places are just the same. It's the people that make the difference. And yeah, most places, the people are just not as nice as I'm sorry to say. They're just good people. And, yeah, yeah, it's just kind people. And I just like, you know, it's like Canadians, same kind of thing, you know. But Canadians have another thing because they're too close to America. So there's a whole other thing going on. You know, you put people that far away, it's like this is just our thing, you know. And just creatively, I'm just really inspired by everything that's happening there. You know, it's just really, really, really promising. What is your experience as somebody who is a performer kind of travelling to different parts of the world? Because I know that you are, that there are specific kind of like soulful house and spiritual house scenes and kind of concentrated networks of people who are really into it. Do you find that there are differences in different regions or it's kind of an international? I think it's all an international thing now with all of the fanfare of the DJs, superstars, and everybody's a DJ. I think the whole culture thing has totally homogenized everything to where it's, you know, there's no like, bro, it's like everyone's playing everything. It's just, it's more about the DJ's name as opposed to the music now. and everybody's playing whatever, you know? And it's like, well, what is that genre? Is that techno? No, well, that's techno. You know, so it's like what everything is supposed to be, whatever it is, it's not really that. Or is it? So I don't really know that, like, I don't find the demographics specifically. You know, in the States, I think it's definitely more. You know, there's definitely smaller demographics of like, there's a deep house, there's a sofa house. The rest of the world is not like that. It's just, where you playing? People ask, what club you playing? It's like, I'm just gonna play what I play, you know. And then, you know, you see some clubs, they'll give you the most, actually, they give you the list of who's played there before when they're booking you to give you an idea. Like, it doesn't matter to me. The people are going to come. If they're going to come for me, we're going to have a good time. So I think that, yeah, the musical thing for me, it's just like, you know, I see a lot of the, half of the DJs. now I don't know their names. And I'm sure most people feel the same and half the people don't know my name. But, you know, there's just a whole other thing going on that I'm too old to get into, you know. And, I mean, you know, some of it's good, some of it's all right, but I think it's just such a, it's just such a, it's just so big now. So I think it all has to be, from the way I see it, I think it's all kind of one thing. It's just kind of like, all right, you have the deep house, but is that the deep German house? Or is this, you know, it's just our house. So I want to know more about your festival that you mentioned earlier. Is this something that's like a response to what you've just described? This is, yeah, I think kind of. And I think it's also... It was something that I'd kind of been working on out of demand. I've been playing Suns of Beat for the last nine years in Croatia. And there is an after-hour spot that's not associated with the festival called Vortex. basically become the after hours spot. And it's not really kind. The festival is not really kind. So anyway, long story short, I teamed up with this guy because after so long of them kind of fucking with us to not, to kind of not have our thing. I decided let's just do something on our own. And it was probably the most organic festival I've ever been. Not saying that because it was mine. It was just kind of like the universe opened it up and go, okay, yeah, you have this. And I couldn't have asked for such a blessed start. So hopefully we plan on doing it, keep continuous. So we'll see. And this year was the first? This was the first. It was the last weekend of May, from 24th to 27th. And I think next year we're going to do the second week of June. And it was basically just Yoruba artists and a few affiliated artists like Charisma, Adjaz, and Bodhi. You know, a lot of the artists that have come out of the house. But, you know, some British artists as well. We had some Croatians as well. It was a small one. It was like 300 people. We did a good thingy. It was definitely the most family-oriented thing I've ever been to, festival I've ever been to. People were literally taking care of each other. Anyone, something happened, I was like, whoa, okay. By the end of the first day, everyone knew everyone. And musically, I was really happy because everyone brought their A-game. It was not a bad set. So it was promising. We'll see what happens next year. Let's change tack a little bit. I'd love to talk a little bit more about your history because I feel like everything that I've read, every subsequent article or bit of information adds another kind of fascinating facet into your kind of life story and musical story. I read earlier that you, I guess you could say your first DJ performances were in your parents' living room. Yeah. Is that correct? Very, very true. Yeah, I was two years old. My parents used to play, my mom and dad used to play bid with, with their friends, card game. And they would put me on the, in a chair, a high chair, and put the 45s next to me. And I would select the music while they play cards. And that was my first ever DJ gig. They used to do that. And that was how I pretty much discovered music. There was music always. My parents were party people. Like, they were like, you know, every weekend there was 50, 60 people in the house. You smell weed. And they would party to sleep over. It wasn't like party and you go. It was like weekend parties. I'm the kid waking up, stepping over people. So I got that whole, like, you know, black 70s, black American 70s experience, you know, like proper. So I was thrown into all of that. You know, my parents were very liberal and very, they didn't hide things from me. They weren't like really, you know, covering things up or anything. They were just like, this is our life. And this is, you know, so I was, I was very much. I think my parents were really kind of like, well, you know, he's got that music thing. So as long as he's not fucking up anything, let's just let him do that. So they didn't really, you know, I was the only child. So it was like, you know, just me and my music. And that was it. I didn't really have that. you know, a lot of friends and yeah, it was pretty, pretty isolated and kind of secluded in myself and introverted. And that's thankfully for music, you know, that was my voice, but yeah, that was my first gig. I mean, do you, do you have any recollections about like putting on a particular track? I remember putting on a particular track. Pretty much every song that was back in the day that really sparked me. I remember Grease. The soundtrack of Grease was really big for me. Anything by James Brown, because my father just loved James Brown. And Evita Franklin was always in the house. I was one of those kids that would like the geeky things like Grease. and pop music. Remember pop music, the German group? Yeah, stuff like that. That was like, you know. But there's a lot of things like, you know, I'll hear something like, oh, that's my jam. You know, but yeah, nothing off the top of my head, but I do recollect like specific things as a kid, like songs that were, you know, Stars on 45, the Beatles thing. Oh my God. That for me was like, you know. So there's a few things. I think it wasn't until Prince, I discovered Prince, that I discovered I wanted to do music. Right. What was it about, Prince? It wasn't about him. It was about the sound. I was at my grandfather's funeral, my father's, my dad's father, in Milwaukee. And we were preparing to go to the church for the funeral. And I heard Soft and Wet on the radio. And, you know, first time I seen my father cry. And I'm like, I've never seen my father emotional like that. And I'm like. I could not be sad for him. I swear, from the car ride to the church to the repass, I was like, what was that song? That was the only thing that was in my mind. I was like, I've never heard anything like that before. And I think by the end of the night, it played again. And I was like, okay, that's it. And yeah, that was my first identifying thing about that's for me. And my allowance as a kid was two records every week, every Friday. My father would take me to the record store, and that was my allowance for doing my chores or whatever. It wouldn't give me money. It was like two records every week. And I think one of the first records I ever bought was Madonna's Everybody 12-inch. And I was a kid. I didn't really know a lot of the music, so I would go by the album covers. So I think a lot of that now is like my aesthetic with album covers is that kind of thing. If it looks good, it's got to sound good. Not really true, but at least you have something to look at. And so after St. Louis, I believe you were still a teenager when you left the nest. I left St. Louis right after high school. My father, actually my mom and I weren't getting along that well. So I moved out when I was 16. And I had a band manager that was actually a manager of some real estate property. So he gave me an apartment and he was managing our band to get us gigs. So I was like, I'm moving out. Independent. And my father's way of kind of mending my mom and I's relationship was, I know you want to go to L.A. You like that music thing? I'll sing you. If you make up with your mom, I'll sing you to L.A. I was like, all right, cool. So I went there and, yeah, I worked with Tony Basil. I was going back and forth for about a year or so and worked with Tony Basil and some other stuff. And that's kind of what kicked my start in my career off. That and then Jeffrey Daniels' album, which was quite horrible. But anyway. And was this around the time that Tony Basil kind of had her breakout hit? No, no, no. That was in the early, late 70s, early 80s. I think it was early 80s. No, I met. she was working on a movie called Rockula, which is still, you can find it. It's pretty cheesy. But it was her, Thomas Dolby, and some other people, Bo Diddley, and one of the guys from Sopranos. It was, you know, one of those B movies. And she wanted me to write a song for the movie that she would perform. And at one point, I was struggling so bad in L.A., like homeless and the whole thing, and I just went and lived with her for like three months. And that's how the Sesame Street thing came about. She was choreographing for Sesame Street because everybody asked me about Sesame Street, so I have to tell this story. Please do. So I was staying there and, you know, I had my little drum machine, my little setup, and she would have choreography and other dancers rehearsing. And it was just, they just used the beats that I was making while they were dancing. So it was like right place, right time. Thank you, blessing. You know, kind of one of those things. So it's like, I never got to Setsubuchi. I never saw Big Bird. I never, you know, it was never this whole That was my first, like, Hollywood, you know, this chick has been around since 60s, 70s. She's worked with all these, you know, Devo, Bittler, you know, she's doing it. And so I got the first, like, Hollywood. So she knew, she was in the whole Boogaloo. So all the guys that was in Breaking, B Street, all those guys, those are all of my friends through her. So I saw firsthand the whole, like, Hollywood thing you know i was kind of old school so i was the guy that would come to that was how i made my living i would do demos for them and yeah nothing happened from any of that stuff but i did make um some good relationships that's how i met dorado and did rico suave from that whole breakdance because he was part of that thing. And at the time, so I have to go back a bit. When I first moved to L.A., when working on this album, I met a guy named Hilary Bercovici, which was an engineer for this movie that I was working on. He basically became my engineer. So I was working with Hilary, and he was the engineer for Bobby Caldwell and Michael Cimbello. So I'm like, dude, you recorded what you want to do for love. And you work with Michael, you know, Michael's a maniac and all, you know. And so Michael, of course, was Stevie's guitarist. Right. Right. So I'm in all these, you know, Bobby, Bobby Caldwell. I used to go and take his keyboards from his house. We would go and be like, I need some gear. So I was just this black dude in L.A. working with these guys. And this whole thing, all my mentors are these guys working with Stevie and Bobby Collar, all these writers. So that's where I got my craft, production and stuff. But going back to the whole Gerardo thing, I took the song. We did the song on a four track. And he was working on a movie. He was an actor at the time. He was working on a movie in Acapulco. And he took the four track and he called me. He goes, I rented the crew for a day and we did a video for the song. And I'm like, dude, it's a four track. We don't have a song. So anyway, he brought that back. I took it to Michael Cimbello. Michael took it to Jimmy Iovine. It's the first record on Interscope. And at the time, the owner of Interscope was this guy named Ted Fields. And he was like, So that was my first, like, actual, like, thing in the business. I mean, it sounds like you really kind of right in the thick of it, like, making all these connections with these really well-established stars. I think for me it was just like, you know, I'm this dude in the no man's land. I don't know anyone out here. So any opportunity, like, literally I was couchsurfing for probably like two years. So any opportunity in anything, I was like, let me just whore myself. Let me just go. So that was what I was doing. And I think that we were talking about earlier, you know, when you have that thrive at the 20s. Now I'm 50. I'm like, I ain't got that energy to do that shit no more. But I had a great struggle in L.A. L.A. was a great struggle. From there, I went on and had some. production with Warner, Epic, BMG, and quite a few other labels and get about a good five, six year stint of producing for majors. And after the, after the, at the end of this, for me personally, it was like, I listed them using them like this shit is not me. You know, it was all these, you know, you go to the office and like, this Teddy Riley song. And you're like, that, I can make that. Let's sleep. So you do it. And then, you know, you can think about. No shade to Teddy Riley. No, no, no. I love Teddy. That was my dude. Actually, we worked together on Black Girl. So. Another thing I didn't know. There you go. I'm a 90s girl. It's my fault. Yeah, so I had this whole thing. And after a while, you know, you listen to the music, you're like, this doesn't have any reflection of me. It's all these things that a 17, 18-year-old kid was like, I want to be rich. I want to be the next Teddy. So that was my frame of mind, of course. But after that, I was in, I can't say I found Yoruba. Yoruba was kind of always around. I kind of ignored it. But at that point, when I decided to leave L.A. and go to New York, it was mostly about I'm just kind of done with this scene. the whole music industry, it kind of felt like my soul had been stolen. Or I gave it away. Either way. And so I moved to New York and, you know, I got enthralled with this house music. And I've always been around house. You know, growing up in St. Louis, Chicago's right there. So I've always heard it. But I had never experienced clubbing. you know, so I'd gone, and I'm just talking like 93, 94, I'm in the clubs, and it's like, I'm hearing Louis, and Joe Carsell, and Ron Tran, I'm like, what is this music, you guys are playing live shit, on house music, and I'm, So I was like, okay, back up. So then, you know, I just started getting involved with it. And again, like I said, I've always kind of been around house and I've even had some house stuff together and blah, blah, blah. And I think about a year or two living in New York, I was introduced to Tommy Musto. who owned Northcott Distribution. And they owned like Suburban, Sulfuric, you know, all these house labels, big house labels, Fourth Floor and all this stuff. And I played him some of my like stuff that I had from like early 90s and he loved it. He's like, you want to start a label? I was like, okay, cool. Let's do it. So that's how the label started. It was literally like by chance, just first meeting, you want to do this And so, yeah, we started in 1999. And I think by the second release, which was closer, I get, we kind of got on the mark. because of Body and Soul, Joe Clausel, Danny Krivit, and Francois Kay, sorry, started playing Closer, I get, and they put it on their compilation. And I was like, okay, we're solid. And so from then, it was like, all right. But I also immediately realized, oh, fuck, I got to get other artists on this label. What if I'm the only artist and I fail? so that I just start signing people. But yeah, that was kind of the beginning, the birth of the label. And you said that Yoruba was always around you. Spiritually, yeah. For the uninitiated, how would you describe what Yoruba is? Well, I mean, Yoruba, well, the premise of Yoruba is it, is a nature faith. It is basically paying reverence to all of nature as the component of God that sustains our life. So instead of saying, there's some dude up in the sky, it's like, no, no, no. the wind is giving us coverage. It's blowing shit away that we need to get cleared out. You know, the sun, you know, the rivers, you know, all these things, all these elements are actual life, the actual living and breathing things. And so the idea is to pay reverence and be in connection and balance with these things to learn. How to balance your life, you know, so all of these energies like a rock is just as alive as us. And, you know, you see places in the world that are sacred. Why are they sacred? You know, it's because nature is the thing that sustains us. That's our God. So it's just, you know, Yoruba is actually the practice of our ancestors that learned which herbs to make. a bath with to go to the river and make an offering or which, you know, foods they like or, you know, whatever. You want to get pregnant. Let's go to. oh, tune, you know, let's make an offering to her. Maybe she'll bless you with a child. You know, those kinds of things. You're not, you're just basically using the balance of nature, the nature to balance things that are imbalanced. And that's my premise of it. I've really never gotten into the whole like house thing or temple or the whole, because, you know, it's, it's, it's, you definitely, I mean, I have a house, of course. I You know, I think that like any spirituality, it's such a personal thing that you don't need a reverend to tell you your connection with the universe. So I think for me, it's been really personal. And as I've gotten into it, it was such a... I can say a life-saving and magical alteration of my life. Like literally, I am not the same person I was before. And there's an idea that when you become an initiator of the Orisha. that you're no longer here. You are in honor of that. Yeah, my ideas change. You look at the world totally different when you understand that how we see it is not how it really is. You know what I mean? Yeah, I think it's just made me a lot more acceptable to my own peace. So whatever that is to anyone, for me it's knowing that. all right, I've been on the road and I just picked up some negative energy. I need to make this bath, get these herbs, or I need to go, you know, or I need, you know, just like you get some sage or whatever, you know, everybody has their way of. you know, balancing what's in balance. And I think for me, that's, that, that was the one thing. Like when I moved to New York, it was like literally, I think for about six, six to eight months, like literally I would turn around the corners and like, I would have ladies stopping me. Hey, I need to teach you how to read it. Like, so it was always around. But when I moved to New York, it was like, my answer was like, okay, now it's So I took two years out from leaving L.A. and moving to New York and became a priest in that time. And then starting to label, I was like, okay, well, this is really serious for me. I want the blessings of the Orishas, so I have to give it. It has to be Yoruba. And they've given it to me. They've allowed me to be creative and expressive and vulnerable. What does being a priest involve? It's different for everybody. Again, it's a personal thing. I mean, some people, their life is to do things for other people. My life is too hectic to do anything for anyone but myself. Although I can say that I do. I do some readings. I do some cleansings. I have people that are, you know, people in the business that have called me for, you know, specific things. And I just tell them, all right, take this, do that. You know, it's mostly, again, just balancing and using nature. Nature is amazing. When you learn, when you know the power of, I don't know, just things, you know, if you collect water, rainwater from May and take a bath with that and watch the Different things that you learn. And that's the, I guess that's the magic and the power to have a priest to show you and to teach you the right way. Because I've seen a lot of ill in this as well. Because it's human behavior. So, you know, again, for me, it's just it's I've learned that it's something that's so personal that I don't need to be with others to be with others. Right. You know, so it's definitely just my own idea. You know, I mean, I kind of. Everything that makes sense to me, I bring into my life, you know, into Buddhism. And, you know, there's all different things. It's all the same energy. It's all from the same energy. It's different ways of accessing things. And I like to keep my options open. I'm one thing or the other. I'm just this being that's walking this place trying to figure out how to do best and the least damage. So with the establishment of Yoruba, the record label, how much do you think your spirituality helped to form the sound? It was everything. It was everything. I mean, for me, I think the one thing about my sound that I think, I may be wrong, but I think that is... I'm very vulnerable when I create. I don't have anything in my mind outside of how do I feel. If I'm hurt, you're going to hear it in that song. You know what I mean? If I'm happy or, you know, it's all these things. It's just the honesty of creating and not having that filter. And I think that that was the thing specifically for the label. my approach was I was hearing all this Afro-Brazilian, Latin-infused house stuff from, like I said, you know, my brothers Joe, Louis, Ron, and everyone else that was doing house at that time. And I was like, how great would it be to make folkloric Yoruba music to house music? It's perfect. The beats are already there, you know, and it's just call and response. The primal... form of communication from any tribe. I was like, yeah. And so the first thing was, yeah, it was a native tongue. So, you know, from there, I just kind of found traditional Yoruba songs. And, you know, and just that and my other focus was to make house music, to make soul music that was at a house tempo. So I never looked at it as house music. I was like, well, this is soul. This has got a 4-4 beat. So those two things were the elements that were my focus in starting the label. Okay. I find that really interesting that you said that you were making soul music. At a house tempo. At a house tempo and with a kind of. I guess like a steady 4-4 beat. Because I know that at some point, I can't remember exactly which year, that you'd put out an album and said, this is going to be my last house album. Even though you went on to release like very, very successful house singles. Singles, yeah. Well, that was because I spent, I think, three years on that album. Which album was that again? It was Pyrography. Pyrography. 2009, yeah. Partly because it was an art music project, and I just put a lot, again, Australia. The partner who did the art was an Australian pyrographist, which I learned what that was, which is, you know, pyrography is the art of burning with fire. So this guy named Scott Marr, I met actually one of my artists, one of my cohorts and peers, Ezell. He sent me a picture of this art. And he goes, you're going to love this. I said, man, this is totally me. I reached out to the dude. I was going to Australia the first time I'd ever gone. I was in Sydney, actually. And he lives in Blue Mountains. And I was like, dude, we got to work together. He didn't know shit about me. He met me. And within five minutes, he was like, blue. I went to Blue Mountains and stayed up there for, I think, probably a month and a half and taught him about the Orishas. Because the Orishas, every Orisha has, all Orishas have specific numbers. colors specific foods specific so this guy he goes to the bush to source all of his pigments so he doesn't make anything everything is from berries tree sap blood from um what was the wombats and he would use anything of nature so it's actual dna in the pictures and so my thing was When you look online for anything Orisha, Orishas are the gods, the Yoruba gods, that's the name. You look online, they're all depicted as superheroes. They look like Marvel superheroes. I was like, no, no, no, man, this is not right. We need to make this. We need to give them the face that they are. They need to be African gods, you know, so. I basically stayed there and taught him, you know, the premise of each. I wanted to do the main elements of the main Orisha. So basically, where every point of nature meets, there's a different Orisha. So where the waterfall meets whatever, that lake or whatever, that's a different Orisha. The waterfall is different. The lake is different. The ocean, you know, every form is a different thing. So we wanted to concentrate on the main orishas and make them organic. And the fact that this guy has living DNA in these pictures, I was like, what better? So we had to source out all these colors. So for one orisha, which is the ocean, she's the mother of the world. because it's the ocean. So she's, of course, her color's blue. There's no blue in nature. Right. Natural. So I had to go find lapis lazuli, something like that. I had to go to Turkey and buy this one stone to crush and melt for this thing I'm trying to show you. Yeah, I was just trying to make everything a little bit more organic. And so the project was that thing. So I spent... I think about three years on the project and we released it. And literally within, I think three days, I went online and it was already for download, like 80,000 sites for, for download, for legal. And I was like, during that period, you know, and I was like, it was such a, just a smack to me. Like, wow, all of my work just given away for free. You know, I was like, no, I'm not doing this again. And for me, it was more about the thing of house because something about house, like, again, although in my mind, I'm writing soul music to a different, to a higher tempo, a faster tempo. House music comes very easy for me. Very easy because it's beat driven and with drums I just have a flow. Making other things, it's a little bit more challenging because I'm starting with different elements. I either start with a piano or a guitar or a bass or something. Drums, it's like, all right, let's get drums. I can make a beat like that. It's a little bit easier, I guess. So I think I felt like, wow. And I think also at that time, there was not such a file sharing thing. any other kind of music but electronic music. People were really, really, you know, back then it was like every DJ wanted to have that song. It was like, I need that song, you know, and it was like, there's no shelf life to any of this stuff. So I just felt like as a sound, as a genre, sorry, not a sound, as a genre, I think there was just so disrespecting of it. You know, it's like, well, no one, you don't see these R&B dudes file sharing all, you know. And so I don't know. It's possible. But I didn't know. So I just felt really raped. And so I was pissed. And I haven't done any house albums since then. But funny thing that you mentioned that because I've just actually released an exclusive thing for Bandcamp about a month ago. which is just some old tracks that I had sitting around from the time that I met Tommy. Same period. Same stuff. Haven't touched it. Just kind of vault stuff. And since then, I guess about a month and a half ago, something weird happened. I came up with a house album. So it's actually, my words are biting myself. I'm biting myself in the ass now. Because I've actually done a house album and it's up now for pre-orders. So it's an interesting thing because, again, going back to the climate of how to make records. So, yeah, I did say that. I guess the lesson is maybe never make declarations. You know, I don't mind. It's all right. I don't mind. I like being wrong. It's all right. It's always a lesson. Any lesson is a good one. And I believe that Envision was on Pyrography. Did you have any sense whatsoever of the scale? I did not. I was so anti-everything. And my agents hated me. Defected hated me. So like, man, this song is so hugely beefy. And I was like, I hate Ibiza. I'm never going to Ibiza again. And that was like, you just need to go once. I was like, nope. Of course, after that, I went back. I went to Ibiza and I'm like, fuck, I should have come and played. But I didn't realize because for me, I don't. I mean, I do know the song was a success, especially from Ahm. You know, it's funny because Dixon, I played it at, I think I debuted it at the Movement Festival the year that Carl Craig did it, the year that it was coming out. And Dixon comes in the booth and he's like, does that say Inner Visions? And I'm like, no, it says InVision. He's like, no, I gotta have it. He's like, no, man, it's We licensed it and let Amdi remix it. So that was a big push to it. They did a really good job. And so I was happy about that. How did things change for you after that point? Because obviously you'd been... I stopped doing house for the most part. Oh, right. Okay. I was just like, whatever. Interesting. So you didn't feel, I don't know, like tempted or kind of compelled to? No, I don't. I'm not like one of those. Like right now, I've got many situations that I always wake up and I'm like, you know, I can call people and go, hey, let's do this. Let's make this happen. I'm just not that dude. I'm like, I'd rather, for me, everything is about the music. and I don't want to do anything that's not integral to my belief. And sometimes, you know, it could be on the teetering thing. So I just stay away from it. It's like, you know what, if I made the music, if the music is good, it's going to stand. You know, if it goes well, fine, then I'll eat a little bit better. If it doesn't, fine, I'll make something else. But I don't make music with any of those things in And so that's my thing. It's literally the honesty and the vulnerability of my life. Whatever I write about, even the titles, I have in my phone now. It's like title after title after title. It could be from a conversation. I might write a title from this conversation. And that'll be a song because it's a part of my life. And yeah, so I think it's, you know, I'm pretty easy with that kind of pressure on myself. I think the only pressure I put on myself is musically. Like, how can I not do what I've done before? Right. And since... Since Envision, I feel like the track that you put out a few years ago, Dion, was another huge... Yeah, that was funny because that was like 15 minutes of my life. Right, okay. As in the process to make it because of the sample. 15 minutes, done. Sampled it, 15 minutes, done. And I was like, all right. I was like, well, if this blows up, then... This Burt Bacharach, I can't fuck with Burt Bacharach. They're going to kill me. So I was like, well, let's just do it and we'll see what happens. And luckily nothing happened. But the thing was, it was this 45. There is a 45. And it started going for like a hundred bucks. And I'm like, what the fuck is happening? This is like really weird. I'd never had anything like that happen before. And I was like, this shit is crazy. And what it showed me was like, you know, I was like, repress. I can't get the thing. I'm like, nope, leaving it. And then the Khaled thing happened. The DJ Khaled thing happened. What's the DJ Khaled thing? DJ Khaled sampled Dion That's all the Dion. I had no idea. So they called me Friday, the weekend before the Grammys on Monday. DJ Khaled, sample your song and we're going to release it on Monday. We need your, this is what we're going to offer you. I'm like, you think I'm an idiot? I was like, go ahead and put it out. So I let him do it because for them that gave me the leverage to make sure that Burt McGrath got paid. Right. And that he wouldn't come after me. So it was like, yes! So, you know, I waited and let that work out. And then also integrally, see, this is the kind of thing for me, you know, it was like the deal they gave me, I could have had points off. Then I was like, no, no, no, no, I don't want to be associated with any of that. It's crap for me personally, musically. So I was like, it's not something that I want to have on my wall or something that represents me. So I was I think I'm still a little bit startled because I'm like, anyone that's like somehow connected to Beyonce, I'm like, oh my gosh. Well, you know, I mean, for me it was just, really strange. I was like, wow, you guys are calling me three days before this is happening. And I knew it was all a payola thing because this is the way they do it. And it was like, I think by the Tuesday it was already like number one in the crushing, whatever the upcoming thing. And I was like, yeah, you guys are paying for this. So I basically waited until I saw there was no bullet on the billboard to make the deal. I guess they didn't realize that you're kind of industry inside of knowledge. I know how it works. Which I have to say that that was, working with the majors was the best lesson, the best education I could ever have because that's what allows, or at least allowed me to continue running the label the way I do. You know, I'm basically just an A&R guy. I'm just a music guy. I just choose what I like. And, you know, and it's all about the integrity and the honesty of the music. And, you know, it came from the old school where none of that, that doesn't exist anymore. You know, it's funny because I get a lot of daily. demo submissions, you know, even though on the side, I'm like, we do not take, do not submit demos to me because I'm a mentor. I like to mentor people. You know, it's, it's, it's a process of watching, you know, someone with that raw talent, like fuck me up and surprise me. You know, and again, like I said, it's like my kid. I'm like, wow, I'm happy. It makes me proud. And it's also something that when people give you your music, they trust you with their music. For me, it's like that's such a big responsibility. And I have to make sure that I'm going to treat it better than I would treat myself. You know, because it's like, you're on my shoulder now. You know, I have to make sure that you're not going to be screwed over. And so that's really important to me. And I think that's why there's taken such precedence in the label and the functioning of it and less about me. What do you hope for the next 20 years of Yoruba? I hope to achieve an amazing... distribution deal that allows me to just pump out music and because you know it's like we have so much music excuse me it's backed up from years from years and years and years that's you know again i i don't rush into anything and i learned a great lesson from simon dunmore from defected you know um he's been distributing the label since 2005 and We have both gone through all of the changes of the business together. I've known Simon since the 1990s. And we've watched, you know, the... From the vinyl to the streaming to the CDs to now the streaming. It's like, what the fuck are we going to do? We've had those meetings like, how are we going to sell records? Now he's on top. He's doing his thing and I'm loving it for him. He's got a great brand, but he's taught me one thing, never to rush anything. And so for me, I keep that equated to the music. The music's good and there's no rush. Even if I die, Somebody hear it? So that was a great lesson for me in running the label that and just learning how to A&R and develop artists, you know, taking my own money out and taking an artist on the road for a month and go, hey, this is what you want. Let's make sure. I guess as a final question, I'm going to be a little bit cheeky talking about the history of Yoruba. Yep. Fifi Iku. Fifi Iku. What about him? Who is he? I have no idea. Is it you? Yeah. You got the scoop. Yeah, it is me. Thank you. So I'll tell you a story about a fefeiku. Please. Fefeiku is my name in Yoruba. That's how Olodumare, which is God, sees me. Doesn't see Oshunlede. I'm named a fefeiku after my Orisha. So it's interesting because when I became a priest and I was named that, it's interesting when I create with that frame of mind because it is a different energy. You know, it's definitely a lot more aggressive. And I think a bit more electronic as well, which I think for me, working on my own stuff, my frame of mind is always about beautiful chords and melodic things and pretty stuff. So I think that there's a difference, but there's also a difference of personality that goes into that. So yeah, that's where that comes from. And it actually means the winds of death. Oh, that's a very, it's kind of a morbid name. Well, Oya is the wind, and that's my mother. So Oya is the orisha that deals with the dead. So when your ancestors die, she's the one that takes you to the cemetery. So, you know, it's kind of, again, it's one of those things of faith. Like I'm guided by my ancestors and then I'm a priest of the one that deals with the ancestors. So, you know, it's just all these things. It's like, okay, all right, universe, I get it. You know, so it's just a thing of seeing the signs, accepting the signs and understanding how they work. They relate to you. And understanding how you can balance things out.
