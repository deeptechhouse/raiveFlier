31 seconds 31 seconds Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week on The Exchange, we travel to Portugal for MEETS, a female-first conference for music industry professionals organized by She Said So. Among the talks, workshops and music showcases that took place there in Portimao last October was an interview with Sonar Festival's Head of Communications, Georgia Talietti. Since the late 90s, she's been the international festival brand's digital marketing mastermind, the center of its international media network and guiding hand behind its PR and online strategies. In conversation with Martha Pazienti-Caden, we learned from her wealth of experience in the industry, covering how to deal with stress, the importance of network building, and tips for navigating high-pressure professional environments. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Georgia Talietti is up next. Dark tunnel. I felt that I was in this long, dark tunnel. I felt a dark tunnel. I'm Giorgia Taglietti, I'm the head of Comma Sonar since '95, meaning the year after being created. I've been working with Sonar forever, though I share with Maria, Ben and the people that have been here, which share the same frame, time frame. I've been a booking agent first with Sonar, also know a lot of things about music and the music business. And then five years ago, almost not when it was created, but almost, I met Andrea via a dear friend that is not here actually. She's called Joanna Seguro, which is fantastic also. music hero of mine in the music business and she said there is this platform join this platform you will like to meet the creator and I met Andrea so now I'm the board member of She Said So I like to be called the Italian Spanish mother because I'm 53, which is very important to state. I don't believe in age. It's like age is not the limit. You know, I have a very dear friend also that she's 18 and one day she did a fantastic speech about her ageless future. because, you know, kids don't look at me like, oh, you're a grandma. They look at me as like, what do you do? What can you offer me? What can you tell me? What can I give you? So that's The giving and taking of the intersection into generations is such an important thing to state. There's many things in my mind right now because I've heard, I've listened to all this conference and I know what I would like to present myself with. But it's important to state that it's 25 or 26 years in the business. has taught me a lot, but it's still so much to learn. Learning all the time. So when you first started working in the music industry, what were you working as? When I started working for Sonar, I started because I was assisting design in the catalog because I've always been an early adopter, as most of you already know. And I had a computer, a Mac, which almost nobody had. And that computer we did design is assisted by the computer, which is now stupid to say. at the time was pretty special so I came in to do the catalog and the guys which are three men kind of spot me out and started saying oh how many languages do you speak and where are you from and blah blah blah would you be able to share with us some kind of early memories of sonar like what was it like when it was first starting out can you describe the parties for us Well, I have a mentee through YouTube and we were remembering the first years with her because it helps a lot to understand that we were six people or seven. And we were already, the first sonar that they did was 7,000, but the second sonar that they did, it was 14,000. So the jump in capacity and people was huge. And the ability to stay alive was pretty tight. So we actually had, I would say, three to four years with no mobiles, which is very important in our state, and no... nothing digital, but we were doubling capacity or almost doubling capacity year per year. And, you know, you don't make a profit in the first year or the second, but at least the team was getting bigger. And we had like, you know, we had to adapt the venues all the time. Actually, if you see the story of Sonar. It starts with a small venue, then the next year is another venue, and then in three years, that was the Marbella, which was a historical place near the sea that we used for, I think, I reckon it was three years or something. But then again, we had this. So working for the music industry back then, I was in a booking. So it was horrible. Horrible meaning I worked for most of the techno DJs of Detroit, Lauren Garnier, Richie. I worked with Maria. I was with Maria and a couple of women more. We were the only women working back at the time. for sonar and booking was pretty tough but really, really like fantastic time in which you never sleep. You know, basically you never sleep. It's working with something that you know that is endlessly alive and endlessly changing until you will reach a certain kind of point of maturity which we reached after the 2000. The first five years were incredible, but we were building everything. So we put all our energy at the time. I was 30. Well, all of us, the three bosses and me, we were 30 at the time, 35. And electronic music at the time was so niche that everybody that cared about electronic music... kind of flagged the event instantly. And one of the first journalists which we're still very much in touch with was Anne Hilde and Nisette and Rob Young from The Wire. They came in 96 and we became friends. That's when the direction of the festival decided that I was the head of international media also. And I think that... electronic music community back then was very tight so we knew we know each other very well and we knew what we were doing what what kind of music we wanted to push for and you know as as I agree with Ben I think that Sona was the first festival to put DJs at the same level as the artists So, meaning that the DJ wasn't the end of the party, the beginning of the party was the party. So, that changed and shifted into a different paradigm that right now is what we all live for, you know, and Resident Advisor beyond everything is like DJs are the main part of our community. And, you know, it's what I think that at the time was like, the DJs are the selectors. We were the selectors for them. So, yeah, the media, I mean, we communicated by normal phone, fax. So normally when I register press, when they started coming, that's a very funny story. I started having a lot of press, like a lot of press. I actually love it. I was super happy. But we had to do all the accreditations by fax. So normally we spent like the whole week and weekend. by sending fax to them of the confirmation of the accreditation. But literally, we spent like 18 hours preparing faxes and sending to the people saying, you can come to Sonar and you need to pick up your little badge here. And that was huge. I think, you know, I was so happy when the email came to my life. I was like, thank you, internet. It's a game changer. Totally. So would you be able to break down for us exactly what your role requires today? Adapting to the technology and internet is very important in any job. And that's my skill. I'm really fortunate because despite of my age, I love technology. I'm a bit of a nerd and I think that technology has helped me understand how to network and how to build a network properly. I think what you need as a skill, basically, in the basics, is that you don't reject technology, first of all, because even if we hear that the new generation is very connected, it's not true. I teach, and when I talk to them, they don't know what very connected means in terms of jobs. They have fun, they Snapchat, they tweet, but they don't... use technology or they don't use the online world to really network. And then they come back and complain to me, oh, I couldn't find any contact or I couldn't work there. And I was like, how is your LinkedIn page? How is your social network? How are you working around it? So it's very important to balance online branding and offline personal thrive work. But I think also the very important thing is to think that it's not a comfortable job. It's a very hard job, especially for women. We were discussing with my Italian colleagues, I don't know if they're here, things about the period. You are working with festivals, you're working with... endless nights and you have a period and you're like, nobody, you know, nobody plays games understanding that you're kind of ill once per month with something that happens and you are there at four o'clock in the morning like, yeah, I'm giving it all back. So for women in the music industry, it's very important to kind of feel that you are... You have other people to discuss these kind of issues, but also you need to be prepared to be quite strong. So train and mentally training. do agree with meditation and learn from mentors I really like the mentor scheme I always wanted to be a mentor I hope that I've been a good mentor to Andrea but I I think that mentoring is what will stay after my life is like this is really something that I leave to the world How have you navigated having meetings with being like the only woman in the room? I was a machist woman. I was trained to like men. I was very comfy with men. And I always had men's boyfriend in a way. So it was like men's friends. So I'm still very comfortable with men. I get along very well with men in general. I can't share. really bad experience in my life. I've been, you know, I've been traveling and living alone since 18, so you're kind of toughen up a bit. But I think that when I realized that I wanted to turn my life into something different is when really you feel that there was a shift five years ago. Not only she said so, five years ago something happened. You know, one of the directors, Sona, which is the most creative one, always said that everything is up there and you bring it back. We all connected and you just go up and it's time to bring this idea up or this trend up or this thing up. And I agree with that. I think it was a timing. festivals are very important when they happen. Sona had a great timing. It's like, what made Sona very special? It had a great timing because it was the perfect time to do that at the time. So it's like, she said so was the perfect thing to happen five years ago. And I think this is how we navigate around the shift into a man's... music industry into okay that's enough but it should come as something that you you know it's the right time because i think there have been trying in the past but it has to have of people believing that it's the time to happen. So with me and men, you know, I've been with Ben in different conferences. When I married, I married late. I met my husband, God bless him, at 40. He used to, the first years of our marriage, and he was so accustomed to see me like, she's the woman, the rest is all men. And he was a bit jealous in the beginning, like, it's all men. He's like, what is going on? And it's like, you know, it's always like that. So right now, and he's been very supportive about the change that she said so well represented in terms of panels and music industry. And now we all, I mean, even I would quote my friend Amy, the fact that we... bond together also because we're women it's a fantastic thing it's not that we work together it's the same if it's a man or woman but the fact that we're bonding because we are women in the business it's an add plus extra to our friendship and relationship so I think it's a fantastic thing. What would your tips be for navigating either a meeting or a high pressure environment like during a festival? for where you are finding yourself when you're one of the only women there to get what you want out of the meeting and get your point across what would your tips be Well, yesterday with my mentee, still a user, because it was a really inspiring session yesterday, I said, you know, experience helps you a lot to navigate around this because you never know when... You know, I do a lot of... People don't know, but I also do the whole clearances of the festival. And I need to be in the pits a lot with my team. And normally, you know, I'm short. blonde and I don't look like the boss. So they say, oh, this must be somebody that comes here just, you know, maybe somebody with the artist. And so all my security, which is my security, the security I pay, has quite a difficult time to understand that I'm the boss. So I always have my assistant say, she's the boss, take care, don't say anything, behave, because she's the boss. It's not me, I'm a man, but she's the boss. So it's a very good exercise that we all laugh about, especially in the Sonic Club stages, 15,000 people, very big pit, very serious one. And I always use my assistant to go first, the man, and he introduces me to the people. And then they understand that if I say stop, out, in, it's me. It's like not him. So we still have some kind of, you know, backstage. stage in the production and in the security areas is very much a man's land still very much a man's land so you need to kind of be be sure of it. I'm Italian, so I have a very bad temper when it comes to somebody trying to, you know, be injustice or unfair. So I was like, move out of my view or stay there or do that. So I think projecting your authority is needed. People need leaders and you need to accept the leadership. So it's a very simple thing. The moment you doubt of yourself, it's the moment you lose the power of making people doing things, especially in a night venue or with a certain environment, which is kind of harsh in a way. So when you're at the festival... Tell us about what you have to take care of, what you have to look after, what are your responsibilities on the site during the festival? Do you really want to know? It's like, maybe we have an hour. No, it's fun. It's like, during the festival I have a great team. But it's depending on this. I take care, I am a head of comms, which right now for me means digital marketing, international media, international and national PR, and the whole strategy of online communication with Paul, my... lovely content manager. So we have more than a million and something followers and he takes care of all of it, though I started doing all of them. I take care of all the clearances for the festival, for all the stages of the artists. I take care of personal, I mean, more professional issues with headliners because I'm... the face that everybody knows and I like that. Also there, there is a kind of very important feature that I would like you to consider that is like when you work with headliners, the environment is really unfriendly. So... the only way to go through a manager, tool manager, or anything that happens within the headliner crew and environment, you really need to project that you are the boss. Because, you know, one of the things that I would like to happen less and less is that the artist owns the festival. which is not true. You own the festival and the artist is guest of the festival, part of the festival. So, you know, this attitude is also something that maybe we haven't addressed yet. The importance of managers during the festival to understand that you are the boss and you are paying them instead of feeling that you're working for them. So this is a very important thing that still hasn't overcome in the backstage areas. Aside of it, I assist my directors if they need me to. Normally during Sona Noe, we have a big crew and I thank all of them. But, you know, I basically am a vital connection to everything that is out there about me. Yeah, everything public-facing. Okay. And throughout the rest of the year, are you working at the other Sona auditions, the ones in other countries? I supervise communication, but I don't need to go. Right now, we have a lot of projects in the pipeline for 2020. I think that it's me, it's more about the corporate communication about the company too. The company of Sonar is called Advanced Music. We do also Sonar Plus D. We do a lot of other things, especially in 2020, a lot of other things that... related to music and culture and education that need my attention in terms of how to blend the image of the company into all these products and make sure that everybody has a kind of clear idea of what the differences are in between them and what we do. The export of sonar is very important in order to get in touch with local talent. So I'm very proud actually and a shout out to Sonor Istanbul because the girls from Sonor Istanbul, Malice, thank you. follow my Instagram and one day contact me saying I want to do she said so Turkey and I was like you do and he's like yeah yeah I always followed you in Instagram and I see that she said so so she actually is the creator of she said so Turkey she's doing an amazing job there and you know it's difficult country to do an amazing job there so I think that the stoner family Right now, for me, it's blended into the Schuesserts family and the family we are. Oh, that's so nice. So the rest of your working year, what are the kind of most intense moments, obviously around the festival, but is it around booking time as well? Yeah, I mean, November is pretty tough now. All the festivals want to announce as soon as possible with a lot of lineup. It's very competitive out there. So yeah, I think October, November is the thoughtful month of thinking strategy in general, is that we get bored. very easily so we never sit down on our success or we never we're restless literally which makes sometimes a very stressful moment but you know being restless in a market of music it's so important it's like you look around and you watch the other festivals and you watch what they're doing and you know for me benchmarking right now it's very important like to learn things that I want to learn from others and accept that you can create a formula that is all yours now everything is shared which I love, and you get this idea and you get that and you do that. So I think actually to be a bit future thinking, I think 2020 will be a pretty important year for festivals in general because the formula is out there. Some of them is dated. Some of them need to survive. Some of them need to reformulate everything about it. And I think it's very important to understand that our business never rests. And you need to be... Always online and always in touch and always listening to other people saying, have you got this problem? Do you know this? And what is your target to learn a lot every day? So yeah, now is my time to learn and then to apply what I've learned. The new stuff coming in. I think Sonar has a really good reputation for being very innovative. How do you guys maintain that? Well, when I met them, I was in jazz. And they were like, why are you in jazz? It's like, electronica is your music. And I was like, no. It's like, yes, because now you work for us and you have to learn. So they took me to, one of the directors took me to a Laurent Garnier set that we were doing. And I was like, no, no, no, I work on it, but I don't want to listen to that. Because it wasn't my generation. I come from South Europe, that techno wasn't a reality in 93. So I was like, okay, so I went to see Laurent, I fell in love with Laurent. this music and I think that I because of the embracing technology embracing computers embracing the non-vocal side of music actually there's a lot of relationship between science and electronic so I thought that this is so forward thinking and that's why I was thinking about time before Electronica Sonar Festival. That's why it's called Sonar. We anticipate sound before they come to you. And this is the, you know, the technique of Sonar is this. And brilliant name, by the way. And at the same time, I think that we always kind of searching for something. So somebody forgot, but... I still have it in my heart. For the 25th anniversary, we launched 32 trucks into space to an exoplanet called Luter... Now it won't come. GT something. But we still have the website on. because it would probably take 25 years of our life to reach that exoplanet. And lots of artists collaborate for that. Jean-Michel Jacques, Kurt Neun, Cora, Novoa, and lots of people. And for me, this represented the ultimate goal of Sonar, which is we never rest. We always go towards the future. And when one of the directors had the idea about the space and all of us, we were sitting and everybody took him seriously. Nobody laughed. It was like, how do you do that? Shall we contact the Astronomy Institute in Norway, which is actually in Tromso? How do you send a micro track to space? So all of us, we were completely bought into it, saying, okay, fine. It's like, do you want me to email my network in order to find out how do you deal with astronomy? And we actually did. So I think this was the, and is still, because it's an ongoing message. It was the total example of what Sonor is about. And so is it a part of your job to go and find out a contact in space and organize that? Well, I do believe in LinkedIn. They haven't shared their shares yet with me, but I started LinkedIn a long time ago with a friend of mine that was part of the... really kickstart of the network. I have like 10,700 people in LinkedIn, which I think it's pretty cool to reach somebody that it's this startup or this thing, and then I go on LinkedIn and I find the person. And normally I contact them straight away for personal and professional reasons. I think you need the content. That's why she said, so the platform is so good because you're like, I'm looking for this in Norway. I mean, this is the strength we have, as she said. So it's like, if you're looking for something, just email the girls. I actually tested with Laurent because Pat, which is also here, one day saved my life for a thing that Laurent was looking for. And Laurent was like, I'm looking for that. And I don't have enough licenses. What do you do? And he's like, I emailed, she said so. And he was like, yeah. And he's like, yeah. I mean, we all work in music. Somebody will have a solution. And Pat actually had one in half an hour. Thank you, Pat. And so that's the useful thing about connecting and working. I was a born collector. My mom sat me down in a bar. We used to have a house in Caracas near the coast. And I was a chatter, you can tell. But I was such a chatter that she sat me down. I was like seven or eight. And her friends and her, they were asking me, okay, what happened today? I was starting. I listened to that. I heard that. Somebody heard that. and blah, blah, blah. And you should listen to that. And so I was a bit of the radio. So, you know, that's my role, I think. Sonar Barcelona this year was on a different date to when it has been. As head of communications, could you tell me about how you navigated that? Because it was like a talking point in the music industry. Eyes were on Sonar. A lot of other events on off Sonar happened around that time. Tell me about how you handled that this year. We were forced to change the day two years ago by the trade fair organization which hosts Sonar because there was a textile fair coming in. Never happened before to us, so we weren't happy. to say it was a challenge because of July. We never wanted to, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't own to which festival goes sooner or something else. You know, it's a pretty special festival in the format and in the content too. So it's like it was the wrong time, really the wrong time. I think we, my aim was like to test in digital marketing basically. because that's what you should do. It's like I'm going to a different month with different target, let's shift the target objective. So we had a lot of meetings about how to market tourism, how to market certain people that actually are in Barcelona but they want to come to the festival because we know that we were losing the French market. July is a very bad month to be. a Spanish festival for France. They have a lot of festivals. They have a special kind of holiday moment. So I knew that I was losing one of my, well, not losing, but I was already losing people coming from one of our main markets. Our main markets are, well, Spain, of course, UK, France, Italy. So I pushed a lot on Italy. try to over push on France, especially the coast. You know, that's the way you do. It's like, who can come to sauna? So another thing that I would like to leave as a tip, which is a very interesting thing for festivals and for music business in general. and venues is that all the nations have are obliged to give out the information about tourism in a very public way so you can download any information about the flow of tourism from all the you know you say tourism in Spain during July 19 to 2020 and you will have a prediction you will have the post prediction And this is so important for us. We are a seasonal event. So actually I discovered this kind of side of things, like you have all this information that grab and get it in order to re-target your public. Past year we started, well, it's now two years that we are part of Offsona, the Offsona label, not Offweek. And so we worked together with digital marketing manager Robert, which works for both brands. It was a challenge, but then again, we had other challenges this year that were very hard on us. I think that every challenge that comes kind of helps you restart again. And you've kind of mentioned to us your passion for technology and that's like seen throughout Sonar. Would you tell everyone a bit more about Sonar D and what we can expect? Sonar D is the evolution of something that we've done from scratch. Since '95, actually since '94, the three directors never thought of Sonar as a music festival. We always had art and conference and panels back then. And then we had a kind of, you know, because there was no internet. but there was already tech installation at the time. One of my favorite, we did an installation called Telematic Dreaming by Paul Sermon, and without the internet, without anything, you had this bed in which you can lay and touch an image, and the image was reacting. you and that was if you find it online it's a fantastic installation you know every time we did this kind of installations I always thought you know we one step closer to the internet we one step closer to online we did one of the first experiments in Barcelona about geo localization That was also fantastic. You had this, I can't remember the name of the people, but we had all these people kind of trying, geolocalizing themselves, which now seems stupid, but it's not. It wasn't possible to geolocalize people at the time. So from Sonamadika and all this... activities when we moved to the trade fair building we had the congress palace and that was the perfect occasion to create something a bit more articulate which is what sonar plus d is is a congress about you know technology creativity and business is about discussing how technology embracing technology and discussing how technology is actually helping or can help the evolution of creativity and arts in general. So I think it was very much needed. It's actually, this is sonar to me, it's like you go to see something that happens on stage with the most advanced technology and immersive or whatever that we could do because immersive technology is still very expensive. But when you go to Sona+D, you see what it will be. So that's very important. You have the future here in a small scale, say you can do that and that and that. But then some of the artists actually bring it to life if they can or if we can. But that's the interesting transition in between Sona+D and Sona at the same time. It happens at the same time as Sona by Day. So it makes total sense for me and now it has its own audience. What are your aspirations for Sonar moving forward? I mean, I love this forever changing moods to quite the Style Council band in the 90s. we're always changing. And I think we should always change. You know, and I hope you all adapt this kind of style of life because our neuron system needs change to maintain a life. So as much as you train and you do yoga, you do meditation, you go running, or you do whatever you do in your life, Moving your body is very important, but moving your neurons, it's even more important. So, you know, it's actually, I was reading a very important article on Alzheimer's and, you know, every single doctor will tell you that the way to keep your brain alive till the end is to learn a new language when you're 60 or do something that you never do and escape the comfort zone every time you can. And this is what I do and this is, I think, what we do at Sona. We escape the comfort zone. The moment you say, oh, this stage is fine, everybody's looking at it like, oh, boring. He's like, what do you mean? Fine. We need to change something, you know? And I think that's how Sonar Excess, the stage devoted to Trap, were born in April, which literally was two months before the festival. We had a meeting and the director said, you know, we need another stage. And I was like, okay. And how do you do? So Sergio, the director, said, production. The other is like... I have all this talent and we don't know where to put them. And I say, oh, that's great. It's something that I can communicate anytime. And what about your personal aspirations? Are there things in the music industry that you've still always wanted to try or areas that you're keen to move into? That's an interesting question. I think, yeah, I was talking with Rachel that it's, she said, so France, there. I am feeling that I really need to know more about publishing. And because I'm so connected online. And I, you know, I love data and analytics. And publishing right now, it's data and analytics a lot. So, and I, you know, if I had a second life, I would probably be doing what Rachel does. publishing is so important to sustain the industry and to understand how publishing can be actually profitable for both the artists, the publishing houses, and how music is distributed. It's so important, you know. And I think, yeah, I think publishing is right now something I would like to scratch ahead and learn and do like, learn how it works and understand because... It's my... It's the moment in which I was never obliged to get into publishing and never obliged to get to understand it, but I definitely want to know more about publishing. And another thing is that I actually helped, you know, one of my friends to kind of his career. And at the same time, I... you know music is a 360 degrees function in which there's a lot to know and if you don't know something because it's not about being specialized on production but I love production you know if you want me anybody wants to hire me for a production moment I'm available because it's about the sync of everything that happens at the same time and if you know what you're doing it's a fantastic orchestra, the production. It's like directing an orchestra and it's a very fulfilling moment. Well, we are just coming to the end of our time together today, but before you go, we know that you never rest, but you have had an amazing career in the music industry. So what is your piece of advice or your tip for taking care of yourself when you're seriously committed to working in music? Well, you know, there's no way to avoid a certain type of stress, but that was, again, that was something that I was sharing with that night. I mean, our work includes... serious amount of good stress, which is adrenaline, which is, and a serious amount of bad stress because you don't manage the stress the right way. So basically it's first of all to de- This stigmatized the word stress. You know, stress is not only I'm stressed. I'm naturally good stress because I have all this to take care of. So I embrace my good stress and I manage this stress the way that, you know, breathing or running or I walk, for instance. I walk, I work daytime and nighttime at Sonar with my teams. And I walk. I walk like 30, 40 kilometers because, you know, the venues are huge. But by walking, I order my priorities. And I also think that walking, I think it was Alison talking about walking. And walking for me is a way to not run. Meaning if I can't be there for that time, I will tell. everybody that this is my time to reach that place or that interview or whatever because you master your time in a different way so you don't run to the things you walk to the things knowing which is your priority I think it's a very good metaphor about what I think is the future of this stress management. It's not to be running around. Running around has no point. You know, when somebody say, I'm running around, you're like, why? It's like, I don't know. Either you're going somewhere, either you're staying with me, but running around doesn't really explain what it means to master your energy, physical energy and mental energy that you need. So, you know, for me, meditation doesn't work. I'm sorry. Though I have calm and headspace and I'm trying to be very Silicon Valley oriented, but it doesn't work.

Thank you to you all. Thank you.
