Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Steve Lawler is an artist we've long wanted to get on the Exchange. He's a DJ that has been around long enough to be open. about the ups and downs of a career in electronic music. Time spent throwing illegal parties in Birmingham, almost giving up his career right before he got a residency at Cream, and going on to massive acclaim for his sets on the Space Terrace in Ibiza. As you'll hear in this conversation, he had a brief moment of indecision at the height of his popularity, unsure whether or not playing the biggest hits was the way he wanted to go. Soon after he re- affirmed his dedication to forging his own path, crowds be damned, with his wasted parties and his respected Viva imprint. There's plenty in between those highs and lows too, so we sent out RA's Greg O'Halloran to hit those points and fill in the gaps as well in this revealing chat that took place late last month at Lawler's residence on the White Isle. you It goes back to when I was about 14 years old and I was actually a skater. I used to go skateboarding with some friends and where I used to buy all my skateboard decks, trucks, whatever from. was a shopping mall in Birmingham called The Oasis. And they used to have a record shop literally right next door to the skate shop. And when I used to go, I mean, I used to listen to, I liked Erasure, Depeche Mode, New Order. And when I was at the skate shop with friends or whatever, I would see the record shop and I was just instantly drawn to the, just to the look of the vinyl. You know, they'd have these picture discs on the walls or colored special vinyls and stuff. And that really drew me into going to take a look. And I was just really... excited by the whole thing you know i'd go into the record shop and look for you know the the bands that i knew like erasure and depeche mode and then you'd see like a see-through yellow vinyl version or a japanese version or promo triple pack test pressing all these different versions of the same records and over over time i just ended up spending more time in the record shop than i did in the skateboard shop until eventually that's just what drew my attention. So were you interested in the idea of DJing and creating the music yourself then from an early age? Not at that point, no, because when I first started buying records, I was 14, and I wasn't buying them to DJ, I was just collecting them because I liked. the look of the whole record and having a copy of a record that I liked. And in this record shop in the Oasis, I remember they were playing this music over the shop speakers. and it was just so alien to me it was just this instrumental weird bouncy noises and and this is going way back to i don't know 1986 87 something like this so you know i was young this uh this sort of music was alien to me no vocals no synth lines no melody no structure just very um simple groovy bouncy noises which i wasn't aware of but at the time was acid house and the guy in the shop was actually playing a pirate radio station called pcrl So then I got the frequency address off him and I went home and I started listening to the show, started recording it and taping it and just enjoying it that way until eventually after a few months I really wanted to find out. where I could buy this kind of music from and on this pirate radio station there were adverts of a record shop called Don Christie's anyone in Birmingham that is old enough will know that record shop upstairs the main shop was a predominantly black music shop reggae hip-hop but downstairs in the basement was just house and techno And in those days, we're talking about 1989 here, it was mainly US imports, Belgium, German imports. And they all looked amazing in the shrink wrapping and with their proper record sleeves. And in those days, most things that were English were pretty much on white label. And I just very, very quickly just was obsessed with buying records. And every penny I had. My phase of being a skater just ended. Everything else just ended because all of my money was going on records. So, I mean, at that stage, obviously, the music was really important, but did you get involved in going to the raves as well? Yeah, around that time, I had an older group of friends. I remember we were hanging out in Solihull and they invited me to a party at a club in Birmingham called The Hummingbird. It was a night called The Snapper Club at The Hummingbird. a little dubious to go there because in previous years I'd gone to nightclubs with friends and you get on the train, you go into Birmingham and then I'll get there and because I'm 14, 15, the club wouldn't let me in because I looked too young. And it was awful. All your other friends getting into the club and then you getting turned away at the door. So I was really afraid about going to nightclubs at an early age. And these older group of friends said to me, look, the hummingbird, they're not going to check you for ID. They will check you for drugs and guns, but not ID. And that kind of thing excited me a little bit. I was like, wow, OK. And I went there and upon my first experience, I was just. Blown away by the whole experience, by the whole, not just the music, but the environment the music was in and the room was full of the same people. Not like a normal discotheque where you had all your different areas of people hanging out and not going on the dance floor because they don't want to dance. It wasn't like that. It was just this real unified room full of people and flashing lights and smoke and energy. And I was just instantly drawn to it. And from that point, I was interested in straight away. Who is up there doing it? Because in those days, the DJ wasn't on a stage or on a platform. He was tucked away in the corner. You know, he didn't even have any lights on him. No one could even see the DJ at that point. And you didn't even know who it was unless you personally knew him or her. Yeah, but for me instantly I wanted to get near that DJ booth and see what was going on and see how it was done. So you had a kind of eureka moment as many people who are involved in the scene do where kind of it takes over your whole life almost. When did that kind of change from being, I mean you mentioned that you were looking at Obviously, as a lot of people do, they look to the DJ or to the promoter, whoever it may be. When did you realise that you were actually becoming involved in doing something within the scene itself? Well, I never really looked for promoters or for DJs. That didn't occur to me at the time. I just... I just carried on buying records. And I started like, I mean, at this point, I'd already started a collection and I was only 16. And so for me, the idea of playing in clubs didn't even cross my mind because I'd only just got over the fact that I could get into one, let alone playing one. So I was just collecting music and then eventually when I had such a big collection, I wanted to, the next desire for me was to play my music to other people because what I was already doing was I was inviting loads of friends around my house into my bedroom and playing them all these new tracks that I just got and getting really excited about playing them stuff and showing off with the kind of music I had. And that grew into me wanting to do it on a bigger scale and that's when I started doing my own parties because I knew that, well, it just never occurred to me that anyone else would book me because I was too young to get into a club and I didn't even know how to go about doing that. It's well kind of documented that you threw some parties underneath the M42 motorway. M42 motorway, yeah. It was amazing. Somebody sent me some pictures the other day and I saw them and I just couldn't believe how young I looked. It kind of started out, I mean, around those times I used to smoke weed. Well, I still do smoke weed. I've smoked weed since then. And we used to drive basically into the middle of the countryside. And me with a bunch of friends would pull up our cars and just, when it was sunny, get out, sit on the fields and smoke a few joints. And we came across this. It was a tunnel, which was basically a throughway for tractors between farms underneath the M42. And we did a bit of graffiti in there and we hung out in there and just had a laugh and got stoned. And then it just sort of like. let's throw a party in here. It wasn't just my decision, it was a decision of myself and my friends. I had decks, I had the music. All we had to do was rent a generator and some lights and some sand and then we'd invite our friends. And the first one that I ever did was literally only for about 50 people because it was just of our mates and a few of our mates' friends. But that was amazing. We were there for 10 hours just playing music to each other. It was amazing. By the second one that we did, there was about 300 people just by the second one because everyone heard about it. It was talking about what a great time we had. By the time we did a third one, there were 600 people, and then it became something. But along with it becoming something that was amazing for me to be involved in and actually experience being a DJ, it was also starting to... I was starting to realise how irresponsible it was. when I saw people completely out of their minds on everything, just, like, wandering across the motorway without a care in the world. And I thought, fuck, man, if someone gets... killed it's going to be on my conscience and i think we threw six parties in the end and by the last one there was cars getting stuck and no one could leave and the police were coming and looking for me and i was getting arrested and it was all just getting fucking way out of control and And I just couldn't do them anymore. But by doing those parties, other DJs heard about it. At the time, there was a DJ called Tony DeVitt. This was before he was a mixed-mag superstar. He was just a DJ on the gay circuit in Birmingham. He came down and played. Scott Bond, who was a DJ of a night called Choose Right Easy and Mellow, which was cream but with the initials. He came and played. Anthony Papa just flew in from Australia to work for Renaissance. This was in like 91. He came and... played and it was really weird it was really bizarre how people were hearing about this 50 miles away you know it was just so weird because I didn't know anybody in the industry at that point you know this was in um we're talking really 1991 when it started so it was quite exciting for me and that's kind of how I met people and ended up playing at clubs in Birmingham city centre and ended up getting a job in a record shop and just found my way into the industry, just a natural progression. I'm interested to know how in, say, the early 90s, you kind of became aware of what sounds you liked yourself because... Over the years, I mean, the scene's become a lot more fragmented and diversified into all sorts of different genres. Back then, there wasn't really any genres, but the music was still just as diverse. Yeah, well, what I remember was London was always a harder sound. Anything that was south was always tougher. And anything that was up north... was always more garage, you know, Graham Park, Sasha, you know, this kind of anthemic sort of vocal garage house, more US-based, whereas things from London were more techno-German-based acid house. There was the exception of people like Danny Rampling doing his Shoon parties and others, of course, but, I mean, as a generalisation... You know, sort of darker, tougher sands came from down south and more uplifting sands came from up north. And that was just the only way you could divide it really in the early 90s. You know, me talking about my things that I noticed while this was happening, I was going out as a punter, you know, every weekend because our tunnel parties, we only did like three a year. And in between that, I was going, I was driving. with convoys of friends down south to go to Shume, up north to go to Hacienda, Stoke to go to Shelley's. I mean, a London Astoria. We were travelling around the country week in, week out, popping loads of pills, listening to all this different music everywhere. And amongst that... I got the hunger for buying records and I would drive to Manchester to go to Eastern Block Records because they would get everything. I would drive down south to go to record stores and so on. And I was driving... all around the country to go to parties and record shops. So I very quickly was just sucked into this whole thing. And it was just a natural progression for me to follow the DJ route. I always, from that point on, literally from the first ton of parties that we threw, as soon as I had 300 people in front of me, I knew I wanted to be a DJ. because there was no other feeling like it in the world for me. Towards the mid-90s, you began getting gigs locally then? Yeah. Well, I started working in a record shop in 1992, a shop called Global Grooves. And by working in that... that shop in those days, in those earlier days, you know, all the sort of stars of England worked in record shops, Graham Park, John De Silva, Gordon Kay, you know, they were all based in record shops. And a lot of promoters came to record shops and asked the DJs that were selling the records to play at their parties. So that's kind of how I started getting gigs locally in Birmingham. I was playing for Wobble, Crunch, Fun, Marco Polo's, Cream, not the Cream from Liverpool, but a night in Birmingham called Cream. But what I noticed very quickly, there was myself and another DJ called Matt Booker, who used to, you know, we were quite... It was tough for us in Birmingham because we didn't play all the obvious music. There was a lot of DJs around back then that just played piano anthems, piano anthems after piano anthems, scratching records. It was just really cheesy. There was just no depth to it for me personally. and I would go into a club like Fun at the steering wheel and play what I loved, what music I would be collecting, and it wouldn't go down as well as what another DJ would come on after me and play all his big anthemic records. But over time, that was a benefit to me because those guys came in quick and disappeared quick. But over time I sort of gained a reputation and then the first big break for me was actually going to Ibiza for Cafe Mambo. Well, you've pre-empted what I wanted to talk about next, actually. I mean, we're sat here in Ibiza. It's kind of the same way when people get involved in the dance music scene. A lot could be said the same for how when people first come to Ibiza, it kind of, you know, that's a pivotal moment. I mean, for you, you started off doing stuff at Mambo and then with Amnesia, kind of Jason Byer was doing the same sort of thing. Yeah, it was Jason Byer that invited me along. Well, I've been coming to Ibiza since 1990 with my parents and sneaking out of the hotel room and going to Koo, which is now Privilege, and going back to my hotel in the morning. My parents wouldn't even know I'd left the hotel sort of thing when I was 17, that was. But the first thing that I got from Ibiza, before I came to Ibiza... In 1989, 1990, I was collecting basically US house and German techno. When I came to Ibiza, I experienced what was called a Balearic sound. And then when I went back home in 1990, I started also searching for bands like the Happy Mondays and The Farm and stuff like this because I heard that over here played in the same context. as house music. So really Ibiza was the place that opened me up to just music in general, rather than it being just electronic, which it had been for a couple of years previous. And I'd been coming here for a few years and a friend of mine, a girl from Birmingham, a girl called Jane, she had a tape of mine. And this tape I just did for friends, which was my Balearic tape. which was just a mix of everything from My Bloody Valentine, Andy Weatherill, The Farm, Happy Mondays, this sort of music, all actually mixed together. And a lot of DJs that played this did not mix it at that time. And there was a few people that heard it. Charlie Chester heard that tape and was hunting me down. And at the time, he was a very big promoter in the UK. And she was at an after-party with Jason Byrne, a few of her friends, and she played this tape. And Jason was like, you know, what the fuck is this? Who uses this tape? And she said, oh, it's a friend of mine. Birmingham he works in a record store blah blah blah he said get him out you know bring him out here I was already planning to come to Beef on Holiday she called me and said bring your records I was like you know the happiest kid in the world I came out here played at Mambo and the owner of Mambo Javier and his son and everybody was there going wow this is amazing please come back and play more And the following year I started my residency there in 1995. So people who don't know kind of what Mambo is like, try and explain the idea of being a resident there. Well, what Mambo was like then, I know for a fact, it was just a magical place because you had the beach in front of the cafe and the bar. and in the daytime I would play for eight hours a day and I'd play seven days a week so it was quite a demanding job but it never felt I was just the happiest I could be just playing my music constantly in front of people and in an amazing environment to an amazing you know what i could see was incredible you know the the ocean and the sun and the sand and people sunbathing and happy and buzzing from the night before and my job was to really just set the mood and be their soundtrack for that day so in the in the afternoon i would play very chilled out instrumental, hip-hop, you know, downbeat, trip-hop, ambient, slowed, sort of more jazzy drum and bass. And it was great for me because I got a chance to really go through my collection of music. amazing music like air when they first came about you know just i would be out there searching high and high and low for the most incredible weird beautiful down slow music for this job so every aspect of this job for me was uh was just an absolute pleasure and then as the sunset would fall I would play ambient music so it really touched people in their hearts and it really really gave them an experience and then as the night would fall I would sort of slowly build into deep house and then there would be a guest DJ that would come and play the last few hours and that was my job every day and it was an absolute pleasure. You know, I earn about £50 a week and lived on a sponge in a room with cockroaches. So it was pretty tough as far as what I got out of it. But, you know, it was an amazing experience. I mean, Mambo's become kind of like a rite of passage for a lot of DJs, whether as a guest or as a resident. It did, yeah. I mean, one of the things that happened to me... What I didn't realise at the time was the audience that I was playing to was all the biggest promoters in the world at that point. You'd have Darren Hughes from Cream sitting over here. You'd have Charlie Chester over here and the guys from Clover Corrine. here and they were all interested and a lot of times I would get oh you know he's um you know let me take your number I'm going to call you when we get back to England I'll give you a gig and a lot of the times it never happened and funnily enough I got a um a message I was ill I caught pneumonia on one summer in 1997 and I had to fly home to go to hospital And Darren Hughes had came looking for me at Cafe Mambo to offer me a job. And Pete Gooden stood in for me and he gave the number to Pete and what, what. Pete told me and I was like, yeah, whatever. I'm fucking done with promoters bullshitting me, giving me this like, giving me these hopes and I get excited about it and then letting me down. I'm like, I'm just done with it. I'm over with it. And it was around 1997. where I just went through a phase where I was kind of ready to sell all my records and just, I don't know, just changed my life. I'd hit a wall. I wasn't making any money. I was really struggling to make ends meet. My parents used to come round to my house with carrier bags of food for me. because I was really struggling because I wasn't prepared to go and get a regular job because this is where my passion lied and it just wasn't really working out for me and I was kind of in a bit of a low phase at that time and And then I got a phone call from Darren Hughes. He said, come up to Liverpool. I want you to be a resident at Cream. You know, I thought it was a fucking joke at first. I was like, wow. So I actually went to Liverpool. Everybody in this huge office, and you have to imagine I'm this guy that's not been a part of this whole thing, you know, really. I went to this, like, three-storied office with staff everywhere. Darren had records, gold records on the wall and all this stuff, and, like, we wanted to be a resident of the club. Now, Cream was the biggest club in the UK at that time. It was the clubbing mecca. of England and it wasn't a trance club or a cheesy club which is what it became over years or whatever it was just the biggest club in the UK it was an honour for any DJ to grace the decks at Cream in Liverpool And my first gig was on fucking New Year's Eve following Paul Oakenfold in the courtyard, three till six. And now I know, Darren, I know that that was a test. At that time, I just thought, what the fuck is going on, you know? But I prepared for that gig for weeks and it was amazing. And then straight after that gig, I was signed up for a residency. And from that point on... my career had begun because within three months, you know, I had Mixmag and DJ Mag and all these different magazines wanting me on the front cover and wanting to write stories about me. I mean, there was all different tags like the new Sasha and the new tag. I mean, you know, it just all happened all of a sudden within six months. point for seven years I've been gradually trying and trying to do what I loved and it was going really really slowly to the point of where I almost give up and then all of a sudden in six months I was probably one of the most in demand DJs in the UK and press and I used to keep my money in a pencil case and Like, it's just, I didn't know what to do with anything. It was just all so sudden, really. The relationship carried on with Darren. You obviously went back to Ibiza, played for Cream, Amnesia. Yeah. And then he started home and you were an integral part of that. Yeah, I mean, you know, Darren left Cream. Only after a year and a half of me being a resident at Cream in Liverpool. And Cream wanted me to stay on. And Darren wanted me to leave, to go to his new venture. Darren was by far the riskier option for me. But he meant so much to me personally for the... You know, Lord... I'm big with loyalty. I still am. It's a very important part of who I am. But there was no way somebody was going to do that much for me and then me desert them. It wasn't going to happen. So whatever Darren wanted me to do, I was going to do. And I really loved all the other guys at Cream, James Barton and Jim King. You know, they're great, great people. And I didn't want to leave Cream when it was just absolutely going off for me there. But, you know, Darren was telling me of all these stories of a new club in London home and this, that and the other. And it didn't really matter. I was going to go with Darren whenever I had a lortie. But by going with Darren, it turned out to be a great decision. Because obviously home didn't quite work out in London. It didn't work out in London. That was the stepping stone to... Yeah, but also, you know, London was... My night at home in London was seen as a success. You know, when home first started, Darren put Paul Oakenfold on... on a Friday I believe no Danny Rumpling on a Friday Paul Oakenfold on a Saturday The Oak and Foles night worked, Danny Rampling's didn't. So when Danny came out, Danny said, do you want the night? You can take the night, do what you want with it. So I created a night called Deep South and I invited DJs along and this was in the year 2000 and I invited DJs along that was a massive inspiration for me like Angel Morea, Stanley Tenaglia. the more sort of darker, druggier US sound and Seven Fisher, you know, people like this. And the night was a huge success and I was at the helm of that. And that actually really helped me because, you know, at the time there was press about the night and so it was a good move in that respect. And then, of course, there was Home in Ibiza. When we first started out, the DJ booth was actually behind the bar and it was an incredible journey for me, the whole thing. And then space became my... I don't know what you call it, legacy or whatever. It's fair to say that from about 2000, 2001, I mean, that is kind of, you know, the pivotal moment when you go from international DJ or the rest of it to... Yeah. To superstar, DJ, whatever you want to call it, yes. And it was tough for me, I've got to be honest. I mean, you, I think, what was it, the king of space, king of the terrorists? Fucking... these were the kind of things that people were saying remember I was like I don't know how old I was what 21 22 23 I don't know it was a lot of attention for me to all of a sudden deal with And, you know, it was, I suppose, it was the biggest night in Ibiza at the time. The Sundays at Space was the night that everybody went to. And it was my job to close the terrace every week, like 10 till 12. But, yeah, it was an incredible time. I mean, it was the slot to play on the island at that point, I think. It got to a point there where I'd walk in the room and I would feel the energy just rise and just the anticipation of me going into the DJ booth. And, you know, deep down, I'm a shy person. I've come from very humble beginnings and worked really hard to get where I got to and all the rest of it. And it was quite, it was a little bit overwhelming, to say the least. And, you know, it was, like I say, it was an amazing journey. It was incredible times for me. And those times at Space are lodged into my memory as some of the best times in my life. You know, just the vibe in that room was... I mean, the Space Terrace will never be the same. I mean, it's a great room now, but it will never be what it was. And only people that was really there involving it then would know that. But... Yeah, it was an incredible time, but at that same time, you know, everything was just getting out of control. I was getting a bit out of control, you know. Certain vices were getting the better of me and just things were going a bit crazy and I didn't really know how to deal with the whole fame thing because it was fame, you know. It wasn't something I was used to and it was... As much as it was good, it was difficult. But incredible times. I mean, I've personally never seen anything quite like the Space Terrace as it was then. It was, musically, it was kind of, that was almost the second, you know, a second afterthought to what was happening there because of the atmosphere itself. But, I mean, that's... time as well you were i mean we're going to talk about this in a minute but um this is where for me anyway the percussive element to your sound kind of almost had its real embryonic stage where yeah kind of finding this moment where percussive elements and I don't want to say tribal but that's when it all kind of kicked off. Yeah well because I mean I'd always been more turned on by music with rhythm you know I was buying records from Benji Candelero Eddie Amador, Tenaglia, the labels in the US, Twisted, Tribal, you know, and I was always going to the US, went to the clubs like The Tunnel, where I heard DJs like Junior Vasquez at that time, and all their music was percussive-based music. I always had it, but I kind of always integrated it into my set. And there was definitely a time at Space when I would be following a DJ like Eric Morello, for example, who, great guy, great DJ, you know, he knew how to rock a crowd, but he was leaning more towards the commercial side. When David Guetta first sort of appeared on the scene and Bob Sinclair, and I found myself having to follow these guys. And they were coming on. the terrace and really just playing two hours of the biggest records of that moment and then I would have to go on and follow that and that was a very fucking tough job to do by remaining true to myself, keeping my integrity and playing my kind of music, but also rocking the crowd and not just letting people down and not changing the vibe too much. Very, very tough time for me. And it affected me massively. That mixed up with everything else that was going on. I found that really tough. I was specifically going in there, purposely dropping the music after someone like Eric would play and then just grooving it out for the first 20 minutes with percussion and groove because I had to bring people down to take them back up again. And I didn't want to play cheesy music. I didn't want to be a DJ that I wasn't. But over the time, the pressure got the better of me and I started to play more hands in the air records mixed in with my my sort of integral, groovy, percussive music. But, you know, there was probably a period between 2004... 2004, I'd say, was the pinnacle time for me where I wasn't happy with what I was doing. You know, I was partying too much. I didn't care about the music as much. I was just playing the obvious big records because they were easily... You could get a reaction to that easy. You didn't need to be a great DJ to play a big record. It was easy. Anyone could do it. And I just took the easy option. What changed then? Me. I'm my biggest critic. If I went to a club, around those times, I used to go to clubs and play 10-12 hours. And I would really structure my set. So it was a journey for people. So there was a real meaning to their soundtrack of the evening, what they would walk into a club. For me, music is not just about hearing a song. It's about creating a vibe, creating an atmosphere so strong that people don't even need to be on drugs and they feel out of their mind. That is down to the DJ and you can do that. A great DJ can create. an atmosphere and a vibe in a room specifically to people to lose their minds. And that's what I really prided myself on. That's when I was proud of myself. That's when I was really happy with my work. If I just went to somewhere and played for two hours and played big records, I'd feel pretty low about myself after. I don't know why that is the way it was. Because the money never mattered to me. It was making me earn more money at the time because I would be booked to go and play for 10,000 people in Portugal or, you know, in Madrid or whatever. And I was playing these huge, huge gigs. and then getting there, and then playing my kind of music, and it being kind of flat for half my set, and I'm thinking, shit, man, you know, people started booking me on the basis that I was playing some big records at Space, and the whole thing really just, you know, it just didn't wash with me, I just didn't like it. I just didn't like feeling that I was cheating. And so around 2005, I did actually start a brand called Wasted, which was these little parties. Because at that time, I was playing big, big parties. And I wanted to do something that was more personal. So I started doing these free little after-hour parties for 100 people. calling it wasted we'd make some little black credit cards we've just wasted written on them give them out to certain people they would come to the after hours and we did a couple of cds that were free and we gave them out and that was the beginning of me sort of making um a choice I'm not playing any more big records that people expect me to play. It's not happening anymore. I'm going back to me. I'm going back to what got me to where I was, what got me, you know, what excited me. Because I lost the love for it a bit in 2004, which is why I took the easy path. But like I say, it was a combination of vices and partying and different things going on in my life and girls coming and going and just the whole craziness that can happen for a young guy going through what I went through. Thinking of it from the kind of musical perspective, you talked about people expecting something when you went to play and the perception. And I know it's something that I've spoken to you before about when I've interviewed you, that there was kind of almost, or there has been, a kind of feeling that progressive or tribal, these kind of genres associated with who you are or what you represent. I mean, a lot of that was on the back of having released compilations. It was association. It was literally, I was signed by the agency that DJ, that Sasha owned. And for me, Sasha was a huge inspiration because I used to go and see him play at Shelley's in 1990 and Renaissance in 92. And Sasha... in my mind was was without a doubt the best dj on the planet he was technical when other people didn't even know what technical was um he was the first pin-up dj i guess and He truly did something that no one else was doing and I will always have the utmost respect for him for that. So I found myself on Excession, which over the years built a very progressive-based agency. An amazing agency to be on. I mean, everybody involved in Excession was incredible and it was a real pleasure for me. But the problem for me was... I was a little bit slightly on my own. albeit musically, because I didn't really play such big room music, I guess, such, you know, the... I guess, you know, when Progressive House was first originated in the early days of Renaissance, it was very much a housey sound, but over the years it built into quite a melodic, almost trancy sound, and I wasn't playing that. And a lot of the other guys on Accession were that sort of big room act that was filling stadiums and playing that sort of, you know, that melodic, trancy, progressive sound. I had a single on Bedrock and I had an album on Global Underground. Now, all of these brands were heavily associated mainly with progressive acts. But when you look at the whole thing specifically, and unfortunately media doesn't, unfortunately media isn't fair sometimes. And that's how it was for me. I've always felt at that time I was being tarnished with a brush of being progressive. Let's be completely honest. When Global Underground came to me and I did the New Breed CD, which I'm really proud of, and they said, well, we want to do a Global Underground with you, I refused to do it. My answer was no, because you're doing Dave Seaman, Nick Warren, Sasha, and you have a very specific sound, and I don't play that sound. I don't play music like that. I do something a little different. My stuff is more house orientated, more rhythm, percussive, drum orientated. And with one of the partners of Global Underground, James, together, he agreed that I wasn't playing the similar sort of music because they were playing very melodic-based music. I had no melody in my songs. It was always vocals, groove, drums. You know, very trippy-sounding, deeper, techy sort of drummy stuff. James said, we really want you on. Your new breed album did really well. We really want you a part of the whole Global Underground team. How can we make it happen? And I said, give him my own series. Give me my own series, which was Lights Out, so I can have my own identity. So I tried to, you know, I was not that what them guys was doing was bad because they were the biggest DJs on the planet at that time. You know, Sasha, Seaman, Nick Warren, these guys were the biggest DJs. And I had no problem with what they were doing, but it just wasn't the same music. They played a lot harder than I did. All amazing DJs and great people, and I really enjoyed touring with them and playing with them. But when it comes down to music, it wasn't the same. So for me, I did want my own series on Global Underground. And my record on Bedrock was, I think, the only ever vocal record Bedrock put out. You know, so there is a complete, you know, there is a difference. But the media never saw it that way. They called me Progressive and as Progressive became a dirty name as all trends do, you know, it's happening now with the whole hot natured whatever, it's a dirty name and before Minimal was great and it was a dirty name. I mean, the whole fucking genre thing bores the shit out of me to be honest with you. But I mean, you know, I've been around long enough to see the patterns and see the circles and the cycles that go on. And, you know, people get it wrong sometimes. And, you know, I was never ashamed to be associated with anything. ever i was just get it right musically don't disassociate me but you've not even heard me fucking play and you're doing a review on me or you've not even heard me you don't even know what you've not even listened to my cd and you're reviewing it you know this is what was happening sometimes and as an artist that can kind of bother you a little bit And don't get me wrong, it's not all the press, you know. It wasn't everybody, it was just it was happening sometimes and certain key people working for certain magazines were being what I thought at the time was a little bit unfair, sort of saying, you know, Lawless playing this boring progressive house and blah, blah, blah. And maybe in their opinion I was, but, you know. And sometimes as an artist, taking reviews, taking bad reviews and hearing people get quite personal, it can bother you a little bit. And I think every artist would admit that. But, you know, it's just sometimes for me, it just felt like it was. I was just getting tarnished with a fashion, a trend or a genre that all of a sudden became an untrendy sound or a boring sound. And I was getting tarnished with that. And I wasn't even playing really that kind of music. I guess that's what I thought at that time. Was that part of the reinvention you wanted to go through in your time about 2004? Absolutely, yeah. It was definitely part of... You know, there was a conscious decision from me to stop playing the bigger records and to go back to what I was doing previously, which was playing and making music that I loved, which was always more about the groove and about rhythm and about being lost in music. That was always my preference and flavour. And there were times when I consciously made decisions and that was one of them for sure. Another club you had a long association with was The End in London. Yeah. Right up until it closed in 2009. Yeah. Tell us a little bit about it. Yeah, I mean, when I finished my residency at home, like I said before, because the Deep South night at home was such a success. It closed because the club closed. The night was still doing really, really well, but the club was hugely in debt and the venue had to close. So I decided to come out of London as a resident and just do the whole touring thing. But as a DJ, because of the years, because of my inspirations and my growing up over the years. like I've, you know, the Tunnel Tanaglia residency, Vasquez residency, you know, a lot of the people that I looked up to and inspired me, you know, were all resident-based DJs. Sasha was a resident-based DJ, you know, all these people. So that's kind of my school of training. So it was always important for me to have a residency. It's somewhere that you can really, you know, really focus on your craft as a DJ and really be experimental. It's your place to be, to try new things and it's your place to be creative. So I missed it. After a year of not having a residency, I really missed not having a residency. wanted to find somewhere in London and at that point because of the success of Deep South pretty much every door was open to me. I never really was invited to play Fabric. I never really understood why I was never invited to play Fabric but for me it would have been nice to play there once or twice but it wasn't my target wasn't on Fabric because it wasn't a residency that would have been available and I've always wanted a residency in London. So the end was the perfect setting for what I wanted to do. And I loved, absolutely loved the fact that the DJ booth was on the floor. I mean, a lot of DJs didn't get that. But I'm telling you, it was sick, man. You used to party with people. I mean, it really was. I've still never played a club like The End. I mean, who has? Where do you go to a club where you walk into the middle of the dance floor? And literally a third of the way on the floor is a DJ booth on the same fucking level. You know, it doesn't happen. And there needs to be another club like that, actually. to be another end um because you're so at one with everybody it's it's insane and Harlem Nights was the most incredible atmosphere and a lot of people used to say to us we you know we go out in London and you know we you know there's no atmosphere like Harlem Nights I mean I heard that so many times um and I think the reason why it was like that was we were monthly And people that used to come was the same crowd. So like 70% of that club, they all knew each other after one year because they all keep, they all, there was all coming for seven years. The same fucking crowd came to the same night for seven years. Seriously. I mean, incredible. Some amazing times. I miss that club, actually. You mentioned the Lights Out series. That was one of a number. Between 2000, 2003, 2004, there was a number of compilations you did. It seems like you have a history of producing compilations. Is there a reason why you seem to... A lot of DJs just don't do them or never have done them. Other people release an album every year. Yeah, I've never... Well, I mean, the reason why I've not released an album to this day is because I've always been... I've never been confident as a producer. I'm totally confident as a DJ. I can do it with my eyes closed and my head turned backwards. DJing for me is just as natural as breathing sometimes. But producing, I've made so many records that people will never see because I make it, everyone else comes in and says, oh, it's great, but I won't put it out because there's just something about it I don't like. I'm very paranoid about making music. I'm very... I find it hard to put anything... Every single record that everyone's ever seen me release, you know, after I've finished it, I never really like it. Or I play it and I'm always afraid about playing it or I'm paranoid about it or what people might think or... You know, I've always got a real love-hate relationship with producing. It's kind of interesting to hear. You'd be kind of so honest and open about that, really. Yeah, I mean, I don't even know if I like my own music. I mean, I don't. You know, I'm always... How do you get to a point then whereby you're actually happy to release something? I'm never totally happy to release anything. You ask anybody that's asked me for a remix, I mean, sometimes they'll be waiting three months. It only takes really three days to make a record. But the amount of times I'll go back and change it... For example, a remix that was really big for me that everybody loved was the remix of Koma Koma for Radio Slave. The version that everybody now knows and heard was my sixth attempt at that remix. Now, I've not told anyone that before because it's quite embarrassing, but, you know, that's the way it is with me. I'll go, you know, I just, and even then I didn't want to give it in. But, you know, Matt was like, I really fucking need this remix now, you know. And so, I mean, you know, I just, I mean, of course I like my own music, but I'm always. trying i don't think i've achieved actually i know i haven't achieved the exact sound that i'm looking for i still haven't it's in my mind but i don't even know if what's in my mind really fucking exists in a studio um and i'm always striving to get that and eventually obviously i need to have a production career i need to release records i need to Because I want to, I love making music, I'm always in the studio, but I'm just paranoid about it. I just don't, I don't think I've ever written an amazing record, and I want to. I want to write a piece of music that is genre defying, that defies any genre, that really people go, wow, I want to write music like that. But I just don't know if I'm capable yet. But it's been a long learning curve for me. And remember, I've spent the last, God, 15 years on the fucking road. I mean, seriously, touring. like crazy. So I've had to gradually pick up, you know, all the things that I know in the studio. I've never picked up a manual. I've always learned from being in the studio of other people or doing whatever else, you know, it's a slow process for me. But that's why my album has never happened because now when my album does happen... I think it's going to really shock people. I think it's going to really upset people. I don't know. It definitely won't be what people expect. Is it then kind of, I don't know, I get the feeling it's almost like it would be a personal statement? Absolutely, totally, 100%. I take music serious, like you probably realise, but my album needs to be my experiences in life that have been sometimes absolutely amazing and sometimes really low. Like everybody else, I want my album... Personally, I want my album to make people fall in love or to make them cry. I want to really grip people's emotions with my album because I'm quite an emotional person myself. And that's what I think an album should be. Some of the music I love that could make me either fall in love or cry is predominantly rock ballads and just rock and electronica, music like this. I think every kind of music has its place in this world. Let's talk a little bit about record labels. You started Harlem Records in 2001. How do you look back on that as kind of a project? At first, it was all really exciting. The mistake that I made was going into partnership. At that time, I didn't know enough about a record label. I didn't know how to run a label. exactly have a lot of time in those days. Well, not that I do now, but I have a team now and then I didn't have a team. So I went in partnership with Plastic Fantastic, who owned a really great record shop in London and had some good people working for them that knew music. So it seemed like the obvious choice. And then the label got to a point, I mean, my memories of Harlem Records was a struggle. You know, I would get a record that I really liked, which was, let's say, for example, Cut Lab, which was this Argentinian duo of DJs, one of them Elio Rizzo, another guy, making some fucking amazing, weird... like tech house of sounds that, you know, people like me and Craig Richards and Lee Burridge would play. You know, we might only sell 3000 copies of this, which in those days, by the way, if you sold 3000 copies of something that wasn't considered very good, you know, um, and they would sign a record and play it to me. and be like this is what we need to sign i'm like yeah i'm not yeah i don't know i wouldn't play this and if i wouldn't play it doesn't feel right it being on my label it's not the way to enjoy running a label and eventually the bank um plastic fantastic went bankrupt closed And I tried my hardest to continue Harlem, but by this point it was like 10 grand in debt. And, you know, I had to call all the artists, myself, Daniel Porch, all these guys and say, look, I'm really sorry, guys. You owed money, but there's no money there. We're all owed money. The label's gone down. It's gone bankrupt. We've had to close the label. And it was my job to do that. And I made sure I did it personally to all And I vowed at that point if I ever start a label again I'm going to do it in house, on my own. And then the digital era sort of started to appear very early on. And I thought it would be nice to make the statement of doing a digital only record label. which there wasn't any at that time. There wasn't. There really wasn't. And we made quite a big statement about it. This was about 2005, 2006, yeah. Okay, and Viva was born. And that was Viva, yeah. Tell us a little bit about the philosophy when you started it. Was it just to have a label or were you already thinking about... kind of a brand or an agency and yeah well no but both to a certain degree I mean to be completely honest I'm the kind of guy that would always have a label I mean I'm a record collector I've collected records my whole life And it's nice to have a record label. It's nice to get an unsigned track and know that you can get it. There's like a little bit of like elation to that, you know, you feel good for that. And you also feel great when you get behind an artist and you see their career grow. It's a personal reward for me. I suppose it comes from the fact that Darren Hughes helped me in my career and I know how that felt for me. So maybe subconsciously that's why I've always tried to help other new artists. But it feels good. It's a good feeling to have a record label. Then very quickly, the idea of Viva Music was just for the label at first. And the idea of Viva came because, you know, it was my love for Spain, my love for Ibiza, and Viva, you know, live music. It just seemed like a good choice. But very quickly after that, I decided to try and do more with it, try and make a company out of it. And from there, an agency or roster developed? Yeah, well, you know, at first we were helping artists, namely Livio and Robbie, were two guys that I... was hugely passionate about really nice, super nice guys making amazing music and no one really knew about them because Romania then wasn't the coolest place to play. But for me, it was one of the best places in the world. I was playing in Romania way back. and some of the most amazing gigs. I knew the Romanian crowd was one of the best in the world. And they had some very, very talented DJs and artists there. And I got behind Livio and Robbie, but we never really had the company structure set up that I could really help them. All I could do was, if somebody wanted a record from me, like Cytec or Overmore, whoever, I would try and... persuade that label to take Olivia and Robbie remix and Olivia and Robbie weren't known then, you know, systematic as well, all these different labels to try and... I wanted to put them on the platform so people could actually hear them, hear what they were making, hear what they were capable of. And then when you look back, they got signed by Dice, very, very smart move by both parties. a perfect fit for them, great for everybody involved. And then it just kind of occurred to me, you know, we should probably try and nurture our talent more. You know, if we do build somebody... Try and keep them in house. Try and do more for them. Give them an agency to support them. Give them management to support them. And try and provide the whole package. Because just being a label, you can only really do one thing for them. How actively involved do you get in all of that? I was very involved. I mean, now this year I've tried to... We employed a new label manager. to come on board, to run everything. So now I have little involvement because I'm trying to write my album. And I'm really dedicated to writing my album now. But I guess I had totally control and involvement in it. I was really heavily involved in it. trying to hook up different agencies with different DJs and help people and do this and that and just push, push and, you know, just make, I don't know, I think for a few years I put my own career on the back burner and put a lot of my time and effort into the label and the artists on the label. for a few years definitely. Coming back to Ibiza this year there's going to be a residency at Sankeys. Yeah there is yeah yeah I love the club I played there last year Dave Vincent obviously I've known for years and I played Sankeys in Manchester which is a great club and he invited me to play he said look I want you to play the club. I know you're going to love it Steve now we've already had our closing party but why don't we just do another closing party and you come along and play and we'll do it like the 5th 6th of October when everything else is done after you've done your space closings so it won't affect that it won't affect this I'm like okay let's do it It was packed in there, it was a great vibe, great room, and it's really a good room to play. It's a DJ's room. One of the things, I mean, in Ibiza, it's notoriously difficult for clubs of any size, but of that kind of size, medium, small to medium size, to break the stranglehold of the bigger club. Why would Sankeys be any different? Why do you think it's got a chance? It's got a chance for several reasons. You have a great party in there. It's a good party. It's probably the second really true underground alternative in Ibiza. The first one being DC-10 and nothing... ever going to touch DC10. It's my personal favourite club. You know, I go there and hang out. But Sankey's will be another option for people that prefer to go to a more underground, intimate setting like that. You know, underground, you know, is a word that's becoming too widely used as well. for lack of a better word, you know, where you can be more experimental in a smaller room. You can be more creative as a DJ and as an artist. And I think that this year will be a great year for Sankis. You know, with the explosion of clubs like Ushuaia. and a lot of the new restaurant clubs that are opening on the island that are more leaning towards people with money, tables, you know, the more commercial sounds. Sankis has a place. It's a cheaper ticket for people. It's an intimate underground setting. It's a black room with a fucking ma... sound system where you can just get lost in the music and that for me is the original you know essence of a club really But that doesn't mean I'm not going to play. I'm going to play space still. I'm doing the space opening and closing. I'm playing some Kaikuma shows. And, you know, I might do some other things on the island. But I really want to try and do something this year for, you know, for our people, for our crowd. I know you have a new project that's going to be kind of announced soon. I don't really know much more than the fact it's called Life and you What's the plan? What's it all about? Okay, well, the idea came from just... I just always want to do something... You know, I'm a workaholic, I guess, to a certain degree, and I don't feel comfortable with contentment. I don't feel... If everything just feels like it's good and okay... It just doesn't feel right and something else needs to be developing or something else needs to be happening. You know, I just feel like I want to try and do things that haven't necessarily been done or at least not done to that scale or whatever. And that's where the idea of life came from, which actually, you know, I came up with the idea back at the beginning of 2011, which was, you know, the last few years, everybody knows that, especially in London, there's been more and more warehouse parties and less club parties. And that's been going on in London for the last four or five years. And all around the world, it's been happening. So I kind of took the idea of that, coupled with the idea of what I started my career on. You know, I did parties, like we said, underneath the M42. You know, I found a derelict monastery in the Midlands. that was broken down we went there and put a sound and lights in and did a party there and you know just finding the most bizarre locations and doing parties in them it's quite exciting when everyone turns up and all of a sudden you look and you've got a thousand people in this fucking bizarre venue and that's what i started my career on that's how i became a dj and And with the times now allowing certain things to happen, I thought it was a perfect time to do this. And when I mentioned it to my team and we all sat together, we all met up in London. You know, there was a team of 14 people around a table discussing. I told them my idea. I told them what I wanted to do. How can we make this happen? How can we really do something like this? Is it even possible? So the idea was to do it in 2012 to signify do 12 parties, 12 months in 2012 and for these parties to be in Berlin. London, Rome, Paris, New York, LA, Amsterdam, you know, the major cities in the world. And go into this city and go into a venue that is not a... club not a you know away from the usual disco lights and away from the usual setting of a club environment and go into a venue that has not been used before as a club or not been used before to throw parties something that's a bit different and actually go there and put a party on. And do it in this day and age, in 2012, with better sound, with more organisation than what I did in 1990. In 1990, it was me and a bunch of stoner friends doing these sort of things. And now having a whole team, we could... really do something special and really incorporate art into it as well and local artists and maybe have local artists do the flyer and just really try and... pull together different elements of art excites me. So when is this going to start? Have you already picked some of the venues? We've picked some of the venues. It's proving to be very difficult. I mean, it sounds easy on paper. You know, we're speaking to all these different promoters that we regularly play for in these cities like Rome or Paris or Berlin. And we've had certain venues, we've had dates put in and the venues have been pulled or the police have stopped. You know, it's already had its... It's already had. two cancellations that we haven't even announced. You know, it's been tough, but I'm going to see this through because I can't start something and fail. I need to see it through. But it's proving absolutely near high impossible and it's going to cost me a fortune, you know, as a DJ. that is used to going somewhere and getting paid for your services, this is going to cost. And it's okay because there's only a number of parties. It's not an issue about the money. The issue is making it quality. It's got to be not just another warehouse party. We really want to try and find some amazing locations that haven't been used. That in itself brings a challenge. Then finding local artists to get on board is another challenge. And the amount of people working on this is insane. But I really feel... I know that the rest of the team will feel the same. We'll all be very proud once this has been done and we've achieved it. Because we're not just... I'm not just... a DJ at 22 years into my career that is just taking gigs and turning up and playing I don't give a shit it's not the way it is for me it never will be and I never want it to be and doing things like this is my way of just keeping keeping things hard I guess making my fucking life a nightmare Well, I guess we're connecting the dots back through your whole career because there's a chance we might see a party underneath the M42 motorway. Yeah, there's definitely a chance of that, yeah. I mean, you know, there's ideas like HMS Belfast. There's ideas being thrown around that are pretty exciting. And there's been some really exciting ones that were planned, that were in the diary for March. The promoters called us up. The license has been pulled. They can't do it. We're like, fuck, this is going to be difficult. But we don't give up here. This might bleed into 2013. Who knows? But I'm going to see this through. 12 parties, these 12 cities. And we've now got the venue secured for Toronto and New York. The venue in New York is sick. It's not even a venue of making it out of truck containers. But we've got this area where we can do it. It's going to be insane. And I can't wait for these things to happen. And I've mentioned it to other DJs and they're asking me, can we come and play this? I'm like, look, there's no real money involved in this. Not for me, not for no one. I don't care, I want to play. So it's really nice to see that it's not just us that think this way. Bye.
