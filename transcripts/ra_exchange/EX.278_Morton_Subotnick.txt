Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is Morten Sabotnick. Practically everyone knows his classic Silver Apples of the Moon, the first label-commissioned piece of electronic music, and a record that approached synthesizers not as replacements for more traditional instruments, but as tools for making previously impossible sounds. With a career stretching more than half a century, Mort has lots of stories to tell. And when we met in New York recently, I was keen to just let him talk. We recorded this in the living room of his Manhattan apartment, so just as a heads up, you'll hear a fair amount of city noise in the background here. Not sure it matters. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. An exchange with Morton Sabotnick, up next. Your first instrument, if I'm correct, was the clarinet. Yes. And by all accounts, you were very, very good at it. Yeah. You know, if you're interested, I will have it posted on my website probably by the time I get back from Japan. I just found on Other Minds, you know, the website, it's a group in San Francisco that does new music. They do concerts and things. Anyway, I was doing some research for my book, and I found they have a recording that I had made in 1981 at a concert with doing the Beethoven Trio for clarinet, cello, and piano. And I had at that point stopped playing. I stopped playing in 1966, but this was a special event. It was the anniversary of the first chamber music concert done on their chamber music series in San Francisco, and I happened to have played on it, so they invited me. me to do it. And I listened to it and it was really good. So I actually have that recording now to show people this is what it really sounded like. Yeah, that was my instrument. Yeah, and you started at quite a young age and the story is that right after high school you left and joined an orchestra. Not quite. I think I have said that in interviews, but now that I'm writing my book, I actually have the actual situation. I actually ended up at the University of Southern California for one year, or one semester, I think it was, because I graduated from high school in January and went to... college in February. And then it was that end of that first semester. I must have been there for one semester. I think, I'm not really sure, but I was at USC and then auditioned for the Denver Symphony and went off and played there. I was about 18 years old. It sounds like though you were always a bit reluctant about it, you liked playing, but your musical interests were maybe elsewhere? Yeah, I started the clarinet because I had bronchial problems when I was very little, and the doctor recommended a wind instrument, so that's how I... got started and it was extremely easy for me. I mean, literally within two years, I was able to play almost anything written for the clarinet at that point. And at one point, I must have been about seven years old when I started. And by the time I was nine, it was a joke or a... I don't know what it was, actually, but I was able to play the Flight of the Bumblebee all staccato. So, you know, that kind of stuff. Anyway, they wanted me to go into the Major Bowes Amateur Hour. There was this whole thing, and that was my first instance of what... the world was like out there. And I thought, I don't want to do that. What am I going to do that for? So I played. It was very easy for me. And, of course, I excelled at it. So I was able, I was actually playing semi-professionally by the time I was in high school and on television. and things like that, and doing some concertos as a young man with local orchestras and things like that. So it was easy for me, and it was sort of a guaranteed living. But what I really got involved in by, I guess it was about, I'm not really sure, I think... Certainly by high school, but I think it was actually earlier I got involved in actually deciding I wanted to compose music. And so I basically was self-taught. Someone gave me... A whole library of music theory from orchestration, harmony, counterpoint, but it was old. It was really 19th century teaching. So I was doing species counterpoint and all the really basic stuff that had been around for a long time. and went through the whole thing and was self-trained and then began to compose. I mean, I was actually starting to compose during that period, so it was that that I really decided I wanted to do. How would you describe the style of some of those early compositions? Early compositions? Well, in high school, I don't really remember. Specifically, it was until I got to high school that I know what I did, because I was learning. And also, my work ethic has always been, from the time I was very little through now, is very extreme. So I would get up like it. five, six o'clock in the morning when I was going to school, you know, public school, and do counterpoint. And some of that would be writing music. It was just my period of the day. I wasn't for anything. It was just, and then I would go to school and sleep most of the day and then get home and practice the clarinet for four hours when I got home. And that was an absolute regimen. So I don't remember exactly what I wrote, but when I got into high school, it was a very... Also, my parents moved all the time, so we were... I was in four grammar schools, K through 6, and two junior high schools and two high schools. They were always moving, so I had very, very few friends. By the time you'd make a friend, by the time I got to high school, I... didn't even bother anymore. I mean, it just didn't make any sense. So I just did this thing that was music was my, what was the thing that I did. And, um, At a certain point, when I got into the second high school, which would have been, and it was always a year and a half, so I was always in the middle. I couldn't even start at the beginning of an academic year, so I don't know why that worked out that way. But I ended up at a place, North Hollywood High School in Los Angeles. There was a music teacher. I hated school. I just, I mean, I felt like I was in jail. And I had a jail term that would last until, you know, I got out of high school. And at this school, I was well known, actually, as a kid in the Los Angeles area. I was playing in major orchestras for kids and things like that. So the music teachers all knew me when I got into the... high school and the orchestra teacher said look he said um we don't have an orchestra good enough for you but i said what we'll do for you is you can play every instrument in the orchestra just We'll hand you an instrument, and you'll get to feel how it feels to play that instrument. That's what I did for a year and a half. I learned my orchestration just trying to play the violin and trying to play the viola and not being able to get a sound out of a trumpet, but sort of being there and knowing the literature and so forth. It was great. Were you as good at any of those instruments from the office? I could play the clarinet and the saxophone and the flute very well. But the other instruments, I never even practiced them. The idea was to sit in the orchestra and get a feel, because you hear everything when you're there, and you know the parts. I could wiggle my fingers okay, but I couldn't make sounds that were worth anything. But it was very useful. Then I discovered there was this teacher, I guess the orchestra teacher told me about him, the conductor. And he was a graduate. He had studied in Paris. Joel... Harry was his name. I think he died now. But he taught music appreciation and other things, but he also gave a course in harmony. And of course, I had studied on my own, but I decided I'd rather do that than something else. So I went to him and he gave me a placement test. And he said, how much do you know? And I showed him what I told him what I did. He said, well, I'm not going to even get close to that in this class. He said, are you interested in composing? And I said, yeah, that's what I really want. want to do. So he took me under his wing. I took the course, but what he gave me was, this was 1950, and he gave me the Ernst Krennic book on 12-tone music, and there were actually exercises. So I did 12-tone music while the rest of the class was doing. you know, 1451. And then the Monday evening concerts, which had Schoenberg, Stravinsky, you know, it was a great series of wonderful musicians and composers at that time. He would just take me to all the Monday evening concerts and introduce me to the music of, lots of music. But one was, he had a copy of Charles Ives' Concord Sonata. There were no recordings yet, I don't think. In any case, I didn't hear a recording. But I did have the score, and I just loved it. I just thought this was great. And he said, well... I forgot who was writing it now, but someone was writing a biography, famous composer, but I can't remember now. But in any case, I got a little correspondence going about Charles Ives and got this thing going. At that point... I started writing music very much influenced by Charles Ives. Concord's not the only piece I knew that I had. And for my graduation, I wrote this sort of cantata with a bunch of instruments and singers and everything. in two different keys and polytonal, polyrhythmic and all kinds of stuff. The teachers all liked it, but I don't think the kids liked it very much. Well, it sounds like from very, very early on, you had an appreciation for more challenging music, music that kind of got outside of quote-unquote traditional sounds. Yeah, that's what I say. I don't know what it was before that period, before that two-year period, a year and a half in high school. That year and a half. The Bartok quartets had just been recorded by the Juilliard Quartet. And I remember falling absolutely in love with the 4th and 5th. I think it was the 4th and 5th. I think that's the 4th quartet. I can't remember now. But I just absolutely, I thought, it sounded like noise to me because they were all the close things. And I didn't hear any tunes. I didn't hear anything. It's just noise. And I thought. "Whoa, this is great! A grown-up person is writing noise!" And I listened to it so much that eventually I heard all the tunes and everything. It was a little disappointment when it all came in. And then the Schoenberg serenade, early serenade, was recorded. There was very little 20th century music recorded and no scores to get your hands on. So those two works, the two quartets of Bartok and then the Schoenberg, became, I mean, I eventually started to learn to read scores by, started with Mozart and Haydn string quartets and then orchestra, where I could memorize the sound of it and then read it and hear it in my head, and I eventually got that to the Bartok. of the Schoenberg as well. So that's really what I was interested in. You also have always had a big interest in technology. And I mean, would that be fair to say? No, no, I didn't. Not until 1959, 60. But I didn't, I had no technology interest. I didn't know anything about technology. I wasn't much around, I guess. It wasn't until 1959 that it occurred to me to start looking at technology. And that was for a different reason. That was not for the technology itself, but that was because... Let me backtrack for a minute. There was a moment I discovered during that same period, that high school period. When my mother died, a box came. got sent from whatever, I don't remember who sent it, but it had my name on the box, and it was something that she had kept from the time I was in kindergarten and, you know, things from school. And in it, toward the top, was an essay I wrote. I didn't even know I did any work in high school, but there was an essay I wrote or a short story or something. probably the period that I was working with Joel Harry. And... There's a science fiction story in the future. And somehow, I was in first person, so somehow I was coming into a concert of late Beethoven quartet. And I came in and I was very surprised because the string quartet players were on the stage with their music stands, but they were strapped into armchairs. And there were no instruments and no sound. And the audience was all, it was a totally silent room. The audience were all strapped into their chairs, the muscles of their arms into these chairs. And I realized what was going on was, I'm describing it in the story, is that the two violins, the viola and the cello, are playing their parts by reading the music. I don't know how I described it, but I mean, I don't know what words I used, but the bottom line is that by reading the music and hearing it in their heads, the muscles to play the instrument were being articulated. And they were sending that mixed to each person in the audience. We're getting all four muscle things going at the same time. They were getting it. And that was then, so the brain hears it, excites the muscles to play it, and the audience is getting the muscles, exciting the brain to hear it. I mean, I don't know where I got that idea, but you would have thought that... There would be bands. That's why everybody did bands around the head. But because I played music, I knew that it came through the fingertips, that there was some connection between the brain and the fingers and the mouth and whatever you did. So I didn't even remember having written it, but there it was. So there was some connection. But in 1959, it was a very powerful year, a group of years, 1958, 59, 60. Electronic music had started in radio stations, Cologne. then one at Columbia, and I knew about those. That really didn't interest me that much at the time. I was interested musically, but I wasn't anxious to... I did some splicing of tape and things. Yeah, electronic music during that period meant working with tapes. And I know that I've read or heard you say in an interview that you thought that was a little bit clunky. Yeah, that was not what I wanted to do. I was interested. It was interesting. But right in that period, the... The transistor was used for the first time in a commercial object, probably a radio, I don't know what it was, but it was big news at the time, because everything was vacuum-tubed, so very expensive. This was going to be very cheap, extremely cheap, and there was some information about how cheap. I mean, it was a piece of dirt, basically. And Bank of America came out. with a first credit card. That was big news. There were cards like American Express, Diners Club, but you had to pay it every month. But this was a credit card where you could pay it off so you didn't need any cash to buy something. And you have now a technology that's going to be so cheap that this meant, in my mind... and not just my mind, but others as well, that there was going to be a revolution in audio and music which could not be heard. You couldn't hear the Berlin Philharmonic if you lived in Omaha, Nebraska. I mean, a recording over... We didn't have hi-fi. We didn't have any of that stuff. So you would not really hear them play, except maybe on the radio on Saturday morning they might have a, if your town had it, there would be a radio broadcast and they might have the Berlin Philharmonic. But it was limited, you know, how much people could do. People couldn't learn to play instruments like I did because, I mean, even though my parents didn't have much money, they did have enough to send me to a place where I could learn to play. And I didn't have to work after school, and I could, you know, 85%, 90% of the population of the earth could not do that, and they couldn't read music. You can't become... A serious composer of orchestral music, you can't become a concerto player if you start playing at 18 or 19 years old. It just can't happen. or later on, you know, in 2021, not possible. But it occurred to me at that point that technology would now open the door both to listening to music, which would be the way in which people would be more encountered with every kind of music that existed, would get the experience, and if they, at 18 or 19, suddenly... feel the urge and have the desire to be creative with music they wouldn't have to go back and learn counterpoint and everything they would have technology that would eventually well I thought in a hundred years would bring them to the point that they could do something with it that they didn't have to master it like the clarinet or something like that. They would have a different approach to it, and it would be a new music, and entirely, it wouldn't be based on the music I grew up with. It would be based on some combination of whatever it was they thought. And this is huge when you consider that fine art music was at least from the Greeks, and that's a long time ago. I mean, we know that. We don't know what happened before. It was the tool in the hands of only a tiny percent of the population, even back then. So suddenly, I mean, this was huge. This was, to me, the printing press for music. I mean, it was, when it did the language, this was going to do it to it. This was 1959. And this time when I got a hold of early McLuhan's manuscripts before the books came out, and thinking about it and hearing about it and then experimenting, and I realized that technology just meant everything to me suddenly like that. But I didn't know anything about it. So then I had to... To give up the clarinet was a big deal because by then I was playing part-time with the San Francisco Symphony. I mean, I could just call my shots. If they called me to play, first clarinets was sick, I would come in and play. I would say, well, I can't make two of the rehearsals. That's okay. I mean, I really could call my shots in my mid-20s. By then I had one child. very sick wife, so I needed money, and there was just no way I could see, you know, but I was determined that if I had the aptitude that I would somehow find a way to make a living, I'd give up the clarinet, give up everything else, and dedicate myself to it. but I had to know I had the aptitude. So I made a piece in 1961. I know because it's when my daughter was born that year. I was trying to create a piece for 100 years from now of what the stage with music would be like. I was working, I was writing music for the theater, and so the set designer was a great... artist built four lighting flats. It was an early way to, by different, there were shapes and things, so you could actually transform in real time. You could transform as if it were almost like, it was more beautiful in a way because it was actually drawn and handmade. But he had these lighting flats with colors, colored lights. And I got four musicians, and I got four loudspeakers and two two-track tape recorders, and I made a piece. And the audience was in the middle, and everything was around them. And it was 1961, and if you recall your history, the Beatles were 1964. The Trips Festival, which started the whole... love culture and everything was 1965. It was actually January 1965, I think. There was nothing called, you know, hippie or anything like that. The psychedelic movement had not started at this point. It actually had, but no one knew it did. But in any case, I did this piece in 1961, and the audience went nuts. And the review in the Chronicle said, or one of the papers said, a new art form has been born, and we repeated it the next week and repeated it the next week, and then I didn't like the piece, actually. But it was clear that I had an aptitude, that I was dealing with something that was, I mean, I'd never known it. I always got good reviews about my clarinet playing, but never anything like that. So that's when I made the decision at that point. And this basically sounds like it gave you the confidence to stop playing the clarinet and pick up an instrument that, I mean, didn't even exist yet. No, it didn't yet exist. In fact, my lectures this semester are going to be about that very subject at NYU. There were no, there was the RCA synthesizer, the big one. I knew about that. I'd actually been, I was in a group while I was in college that was brought to. Princeton to learn all the new things. And so Milton took us to there and gave us a demonstration. But that always seems silly to me because as a clarinetist, it's a big subject. That's what I'm going to deal with. In any case, music as we knew it was interdependent with musical instruments. To play that music on not a musical instrument doesn't really make any sense. The best you could do to make a... Beethoven's string quartet sound great is to do it as well as a great string quartet. If they can get a machine to do that, they'd be doing great. But you can't do it better. There's no such thing as doing it better. If you write music that musicians can't play, maybe you... But when that happens, it's like a cartoon to me. If a bassoon plays faster than a bassoon can play or plays higher and lower and does all these... crazy things. It's like a cartoon where a man stretches his hand. To me, and in fact, when I listen to some of that now, and I play it for young people who don't know what it is, it sounds funny. Because it's traditional music in a way. I mean, you've never heard that before. But it's played... with instruments that aren't as good as a real instrument and do things a real instrument can't do. So it's sort of like Goofy, you know, having his head spun around or something like that. It's fun, but that's what I thought about all that stuff. Yeah, it sounds like the synthesizers that came before the Buchla weren't really musical instruments. Well, there wasn't an analog synthesizer yet. The Moog... It came one year after the Buchla. So what we're talking about here is that there wasn't anything. There was only digital. I'm sure people had analog stuff that they were making, but there wasn't a full system of any sort. That's what Moog... Moog had been making things, but it wasn't until after we finished the 100, Moog had told me this, that he realized that... There was more to it than just modules, that you could actually make a whole system that was dedicated, an electronic analog system that was dedicated to making music. That's how we actually turned around and started going in the other direction. And my thought was, I was going to make a neutral... I put an ad in the paper, and that's well known. story now. Yeah, I love this story that you, well, basically you needed an engineer. You needed someone to help you make this instrument. You know, you didn't really have a good idea of what it was yet. And you had some succession of people come by your place to interview. And Don Bucla was like the first guy who wasn't either obviously on drugs or you could just have a conversation with him. Real conversation. And it turns out he wasn't answering the ad. I didn't know this until a couple of years ago because Don isn't that articulate. He doesn't want to talk too much. But he said that he came because he was going to borrow a tape recorder. at the studio or work at the studio with a tape recorder or something. But I never let him get that far because he introduced himself and what he did. And I just assumed, and to this day I don't know that he didn't answer the ad, but in any case, I just assumed that he was there for that and gave him this thing and he said, yeah, I can do that. And he did. And Ramon Sender and I had come up with a scheme, not that we thought it should be made that way, but it dealt with all the dimensions of music. And he said, but this is not the way to go. And then he started talking about transistors, which I knew about, but I didn't know what they were. And so that's when we got started on it. That was probably 1963. When did you have the finished product? The finished product didn't actually exist. I'd been working regularly with him over a period of almost two years. And we were ready at a certain point, but we needed $500, which for parts. It wasn't for him. It was for parts. And we didn't have it. And we finally got it. And that's another story, but we finally got it around 1964, 65. And then Don built it, and it came to the studio. It was for the tape center, and it came December 1965, I think it was, just before the Trips Festival. I'm not positive of the time, but it was like a month or two before the Trips Festival because it was used in the Trips Festival at that point. And I was getting ready to move to New York. So the first one was at the Tape Center. And then when I moved to New York, I... I had them buy me at NYU. I was artist in residence at Tisch at that point. They brought me, and I had them. buy a whole complement for my studio and I it was basically what the first one was but also some new things that that we didn't think of at the time that we're beginning to I'm beginning to understand it and I and so that came to my studio that was the second or third I think Usochevsky bought one of the first ones for Columbia Princeton and But that was it. And so the notion, my first idea was that it was going to be called an electronic music easel. Because I thought of the equipment, the modules, as the pigment. And the space between the speakers is the easel itself that you would paint on in some way. So it was not a musical instrument. It was something else. It also meant you could be a studio artist. You could make your music, hear it, do everything you wanted in your studio. That was a whole new concept. Now it's so ordinary that no one would think twice about it. And it was in the process of working on Silver Apples of the Moon when I was in New York. about a year or so, because it came out in 67. So I had to be commissioned in 66, which was almost the time I moved into New York, a little bit before that. And as working on it, I began to realize that the patch itself, the interconnecting of these modules is not... just a sound but it's a whole it's a whole network of things that are moving sound in space it's changing the timbre it's doing everything that that you would do and that you could actually perform on it but not like not like a musical instrument we have. You would be turning knobs, and I didn't want a black and white keyboard because the black and white keyboard comes from the lyre of the Greeks, you know. It would be basically... The whole idea of building an instrument that could make sounds that were never possible before and presented a whole new way of working, sticking a keyboard on it would basically just tie it to an older tradition. Yeah, not only that, but it's begging what it's offering to you. It's like asking you, when did you stop beating your wife? It's going to say, do anything you want, as long as it's tempered. It's got chromatic scales. And so, you know, that keyboard comes about in relation to music that had grown for all these years. Now, the thing is that it was, when Moog did it, it became, that's what everyone knew. And it makes sense because most people think of music, and this harks back to your first question, most people think of music. as music. I mean, that's it. But when you listen to other people's music, that's already different. You go to Australian and the didgeridoo is not quite doing the Beethoven quartets. But beyond that, if you have the ability to think beyond the physical object, what kind of music would you make? And this is not, do you know Francis Bacon's The New Atlantis? This is in the 14th, 15th century. And he writes about this advanced culture that he discovers, you know, Atlantis. And they have a music building or a space where you hear sounds like you never heard before. So this is not a new idea. Musical instruments aren't the only kind of music that could be made. But most people don't think that way. Whatever it is they're listening to, country, western, that's music. If you're listening to Beethoven and you're talking about music, I'm talking about a late quartet and he's talking about the last thing. And we're both comparing them without listening to it. And when you listen, you say, well, wait a minute, that's not music. That's not music. So to me, putting the keyboard on was A, assuming that you were going to write music, new old music, and B, you would have to have chops on the keyboard, which takes you back to the point. Didn't want to go. I mean, this was supposed to be something where you didn't need chops. So if you were a keyboard player, that wouldn't be too bad. As it was with Switched on Bach, he was a keyboard player. But for most people, they don't play keyboard all that well. They'll go to just playing a chord or doing something, you know, that's fun to do and everything. It sounds like something and can be even pretty. But it certainly wasn't what I was after. Well, to play the boucle, you do need chops. I mean, it's just a different sort of chops that you need. I mean, I've played one. They're not extremely straightforward. Well, the chops you get, though, if you're going to make a regular piece of music, it's not the best thing to do it with. But if you come up with a, for one thing, one of the reasons we've got what we've got, and most cultures have it, is that any object vibrates only one way. Church bells vibrate in several ways because they're alloys. So you have the overtones of the vibration mixing a little bit. That's why they have a slightly strange sound to it, depending on how many alloys are in it. But basically, you get a read, you get even the didgeridoos. It's the overtones of that particular thing you're doing. It has to start, it has to end, it has a way... If you're blowing it, it'll do certain things. But, well, what if we lived in a world like Francis Bacon was describing, where you didn't have that as a problem? So you could have any overtone structure you wanted. It's not dependent on a vibrating object, so you can do things that can't exist in nature. And that's what I was looking for. I was looking for ways in which to manipulate time and space and timbre and envelopes that would be responsive outside of the musical instrument. So the chops you're talking about is really in the brain to start with. It's how to conceptualize something you can play, and then how do you play it? And I was thinking at the time, I wasn't thinking of live performance, I was thinking of the proper place for this. Studio art was a recording. So that's why Silver Apples of the Moon. I was thinking that that was the new chamber music. I did play in public, but it wasn't anything like what I was doing with... I mean, it was much more, a lot of repetition and a lot of things because you couldn't get five Buchlas, you know, you couldn't play them even if you got them. So that's where it goes, and it goes into, it is an instrument. You have to develop chops to be able to even make the thing that you're going to record, but it's chops based on a particular thing. an instrument-like object now that you've patched together and it becomes this virtual instrument of some sort, but not an instrument like anyone has ever played before. Yeah, it seems like composing for the Buchla and playing the Buchla end up probably being sort of the same process. Yeah, it is. It's one you don't compose for it. You compose in it or with it. because it's a whole different prize like sculpting. I mean, you're not performing that act. molding a little bit and you stand back or painting and you stand back and you look at it and you change this and then it goes off and that's why the record seemed like a good metaphor for it but you can take it into public and that was the place that I went finally but I gave it up a long time ago because it was so limited what I had imagined is what became the DJ You have certain things you can do live because you can only get one or two patches or three patches on a system you can afford to. all around with you. So you have a very limited amount of things you can actually play live. So the rest of it would have been pre-programmed and when I was doing it I was taking tape recorders with me and loops and things like that and then finding ways to access those loops and modify them and move everything together. remix at any given point. It's only now that I'm really performing a lot because of the computer now and Ableton and things that allow you, and with the Buchla. So I have, the stuff is mostly made on the Buchla, but sometimes I've recorded materials, you know, with a microphone or something. And I'm remixing plus live, you know, live. Digital meaning my finger or a knob, but it is a kind of giant remix DJ-type performance. With Silver Apples of the Moon, this was really a brand new sort of record. It was a brand new type of piece of music, really. People really hadn't heard music like this before. And in terms of being a classical recording, it was a huge success. Was that a surprise to you? Yeah, I'll say. It was a surprise that I got the commission. And then it was a surprise. I thought they were making a terrible mistake, but I was happy. Well, it was quite a, I mean, None Such was a discount. They were the label that commissioned it, and they were mostly known for putting out like discount recordings, right? Yeah, things recorded in Eastern Europe or something like that. And Jack Holzman was the president, the head of it, and he was great. I mean, he had a real vision. And his vision was very similar to your vision. It was identical. Yeah. Had he heard of you before? I mean, how did this even come up? We never had a discussion about it. He may have, because people were coming to my studio. I must have been a kind of an anomaly even in New York at the time because people would just pop in and they said, well, you know, we're looking for this kind of stuff. Everyone says that this is the place to come to meet you and see what you're doing here. Yeah, I like this story, too, that you would work in your studio until very, very late at night. No, early in the morning. Early in the morning, right. And when musicians... would finish their shows for the evening they would come by your place and check out what you were doing on this crazy instrument yeah it was the the uh someone coined the term the mad scientist of the ecstatic moment because whenever they'd come in i'd be building one thing that i'd be working on it for weeks and weeks at a time and uh and it seemed like you know just a I don't know what it sounded like to them. It must have been pretty spectacular. So I guess just going back. You got the commission from none such, just happened to be kind of like exactly on the same page. And you record this piece of music. It's a huge success for both you and for the label. And yeah, big surprise. Yeah, it was a big surprise for me. I don't know if it was for Jack. It wasn't a financial. I mean, it was a success, but it wasn't a big financial success because it was, I think it was. 10,000 or 20,000 records, and by commercial standards, that's not huge. But classical music, fine art music, only sold, I mean, maybe 40 or 50 or 400. If you sold 400, you were doing really well, so 10,000 to 20,000 was a lot. So it was very surprising to me, and of course they asked for another one, which I did with The Wild Bull. And not only that, but they ended up on the charts, you know, the classical music charts. So both of them did. But the real shock, it wasn't a shock, I suppose, but the real success was the next year when Switched on Bach came out. And that was, that probably sold close to 100,000. And it sat on the charts, top of the charts, or somewhere up there for a long time. I mean, I... I can't tell you how I felt at that time. It was like when it came out, I didn't even hear it. And, you know, it was really well done. There's no question about it. But I hadn't even heard it. I was on tour in Kansas doing... three lectures a day at different places and people were running to my, I was in a different college three times a day and I'd come and the little room that I was going to talk in would be full and people would, you know, and this young woman is running by me and I grabbed her arm and I said where are you going oh I'm going to that lecture of electronic music I said oh that's great I said do you know electronic there's nothing out there she said oh yeah yeah and so I said what do you know I thought she was going to say silver apples of the moon she said switched on Bach I didn't even know about it because it had just come out so she ran to the room and I suddenly got a picture of what we were doing I knew what that was. It was like my whole insides became empty. It was like a hollow feeling of, I was so excited about the notion of people discovering new things and, you know, being part of that. And then what we had was exactly what I didn't want to happen. I mean, I can't keep it from happening, but. But that we would have, this wasn't even new old music. This was old music played on a new instrument. It wasn't even, you know, someone making a new piece on it and people flocked to it. And that was, you know, that was the big thing. From that point, I mean, I was still well-known. Silver Apples was still up there for a good ten years. I was supposed to go on the Johnny Carson show at one point, and I didn't go, and things like that. It was big news, but it wasn't the kind of success that the other was. Some of the commercial people, the rock bands and things, I think a few of them used Buchla stuff. But most of them went to the Moog at that point because it made sense for what they were doing. Yeah, I mean, for you, the important part about electronic music wasn't just that the music is made electronically. It's that the new tools... can bring about a completely new sound, a completely new way of conceptualizing music. I mean, is something like Switched on Bach or any number of contemporary electronic music pieces now, I mean, is that really electronic music? No, it's not. It's music made on with electronic instruments. So, you know, that's... There's nothing wrong with that. I think that's fun. It's fine. I don't have a problem with it. It's just, to me, it was actually more... If you think about language, for instance, if you don't have a concept... for a certain thing, you don't have a word for it, you don't have that feeling, that thing that happens. That we're so different now because of language and because of mixing with different peoples and cultures and things that our ability to experience life is much richer, at least in the world. in certain ways. Maybe in primordial days you could smell more or taste more. I don't know. But certainly from any standpoint I know, the potential of growth, even taking care of each other, of anything you want to look at, that we're... We have the potential for being more human than we ever were and certainly could experience deep feeling and beauty and, you know, the kinds of things that one could do, that this would... We would be looking for new avenues where people would come up with new expressions. And I thought of the music, I broke down music as not playing notes, but gestures, sound gestures with envelopes. And I actually used an envelope, I had an envelope follower made and I actually used that to... be the control voltage, the input would be finger pressure. And it was there that I thought we had that plus, not because they were new sounds so much, but they were new sounds, but they were new ways that a sound can be made that were not part of nature. So that plus using the very body language and the very gesture. And then because you could then put them together in ways that could be as elegant, perhaps, as the art of the fugue or something like that, that we would experience new things in that one person and then another person and, you know, not everybody, but at least people who were capable of it or interested in it would have that possibility. That's why I wanted to stay away from the keyboard. Well, electronic music or these new instruments, these new ways of making music, I mean, there was lots of music that was really suggested by these devices. I mean, thinking about... techno, for example, this relied on a synthesizer to make music that kind of couldn't have been made before. Was there music, popular music, that was sort of made after, that was made after the 1960s when you were first working with synthesizers that did feel like new music to you? No. And was that sort of disappointing? No, because I was thinking 100 years. So it wasn't disappointing. I'm surprised. Actually, I was very moved. Were you at the Berlin concert? No, I wasn't able to make it. No, it was great. And I was very moved by the audience response. And, well, it's almost been 100 years, but it hasn't been, you know, it's... that I'm still alive and I could experience that. It was very moving. I was very touched by the distance that's come. And it's still got a long ways to go. I have no idea when it gets there whether I would notice it or not. I don't know because I don't know what it is. But it is the first question. You can't ask the question, when did you stop beating your wife? Once you stop asking those kinds of questions and are looking for something that is intrinsically new, not just a new way to play a keyboard or a new chord or something like that. And that seems to be happening. There's a new... avant-garde, so to speak, that I'm seeing growing that came out of the pop world, most of it. I don't see it coming out of my world, the fine art world. I'm sort of sitting on the side in the fine art world. But there is a part of the young person's... and there has been for some time, they merge with the more pop thing with guitars and things like that. I think even Steve Reich and Phil Glass have sort of, I don't think they started that way, but it became part of that. McLuhan says, first you invent the machine and then the machine invents you. So they invented something, then people took it up and that changed them too. They held to their ground, but still it became... That certainly is what happened to me. I mean, my music doesn't sound like the rest of the festival I'm on, but you're beginning to hear more... Less distance between it. There's less techno and more thoughtfulness about it. Once you start saying, what is it I really want to say, and you don't use words, but you use sound to make that happen, or some words and some sound, that wasn't going on right at the beginning. It was mostly from dance music and things like that. I always wondered, you have a... Lyrics that are talking about the end of the world and you're all dancing to it. It seemed like a God relationship. Synthesizers, like right now, seem to be as popular as they've ever been. You mean the analog? Yeah, analog synthesizers. Some people call it a trend or a fad, but... Whatever it is, there's definitely something happening with it. And modular synthesizers, especially this Eurorack standard, has become extremely popular. What do you think of all of this stuff? Are you involved in it at all? Well, I'm using the Boogla 200E. I'm not involved in the whole movement in it. But it's theirs. It's not mine. I've done it. But I think the move toward the Eurorack and that kind of thing is in, that's why I was so moved, because that's the direction I would hope. where you've got modules and because of that you can say to someone I'd like a module that does this like when you once you do that then you're asking questions well it depends on what you're asking for I suppose but there's the potential there is that you're you're beginning you've taken yourself to a new place psychologically intellectually and aesthetically and that new place is now taking you to another new place, and that's taking, you're going back to the manufacturer. You can't go back to the manufacturer of the mini-MOG. and say, you know, we'd like to sing into it. Well, it doesn't make any sense. You wouldn't even think that if you were playing on a mini-mode. You'd say, I want a different scale. And, you know, at the beginning they couldn't even do that because they had divided voltages into 12 equal parts. So it was a choradic scale they couldn't do otherwise. I think they probably did something to change that. I'm not sure. With MIDI you could finally do that. You know, Lejeune, you are not a gadget. It's a book. Anyway, you might look it up on the web. His name just jumped out of my head, but he was sort of the guru of virtual reality. And he wrote about how early MIDI really constricted, by accident constricted, what people can do and what people think. Because you can't... easily make new scales and you couldn't bow like a violin or sing. It was a keyboard basically. It's an interesting book. I'm very encouraged, not because, I mean, I suppose partly because that's what I thought I would like to see happen and it's happening. And I don't think I actually influenced anything by doing what I did. I think it's a natural thing that people would come to. What I have influenced is sort of a, oh my God. This guy was doing it in 1960. And you know what? I did Silver Apples and Moon on the Book of the Wonder. If you try to do that, I wouldn't be able to do it now. That's a hell of a job. 13 months working six days a week, 12 hours a day to make that thing happen. And it doesn't sound... it sounds like it just flew out of the, you know, and it... Yeah, it sounds almost effortless in a way. Yeah, you know, you work with a Bugla 100, you say, well, how the hell did he do that? I say that to myself sometimes, you know, how did I know what I did? You know, I just worked really hard. So I think that fluidity that I brought is exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted to take my very rich... background in fine art music and give it as a tool, give it as a blessing to the next generation that was going to come to music much too late to be able to do that, that they can do it. They can go as far as they want with these modules. They don't require 14 years of five hours a day minimum that becomes part of you. In fact, it... It doesn't even want that. It wants you to keep thinking and to keep experimenting and to go. It's a whole different attitude about an instrument. So the ones that get rid of patch cords and have keyboards and things like that, they're not much of interest to me. And you didn't see much of the other. Now you're seeing a lot. The Eurorack, it's a lot. People are making their own. That's the exciting part. That's the jumping board. I don't think that's just a fad. I think that it would be a fad if they were going back and picking up old synthesizers. The secret, that's what I meant by that. The jumping board of the moment, the ground zero, is the making of modules, which is what we did. But now they're making them again with new minds. A lot of them are modeled after the book. I don't know if you know the Serge. Yeah, the Serge was my assistant during that period, and I brought him to CalArts. When we started CalArts, that's where the CERS got started. So that's why it's very close to that concept. And those things didn't take off. You see them starting to, the concept is starting. And that's because what I wanted to do, I really did do. I set a marker. I said, this is what you can do. And I made it known, and I was lucky because it... was successful, so it's out there. But I don't think people got started because of that. I think they would have gone to that. Maybe their modules, it was logical. And if you're going to start a modular synthesis, What we did, you would probably do over again, just exactly as we did it, or maybe not exactly, but it's not like it was a brilliant thing. No one would have thought of doing an envelope follower or an envelope generator. That's not true. Anyone would think that once you got started, something like it would happen. Obviously, technology has moved forward quite a lot since you got started with your first synthesizer. Let's not say forward. It's changed. It has changed. Well, that's a better way of putting it. Technology has changed quite a lot. I think that sort of the instrument of the future today, if you were thinking about what that would be, would look very different than it would so many decades back. What do you think that is now? What would the sort of... Well, I think two things. First of all, if you're going to preserve old music, Beethoven, you know, Palestrina, whatever it is, you're going to conserve it. We have a better chance of conserving it now because we can get our hands on it and we can make it happen. You don't need new instruments to do that. So one aspect of it is what's the delivery system. The delivery system of it is changing. We got to high fidelity, and then we put little earphones, and we'll probably get to a point, and that's not too far in the future, where we'll probably be back to my high school, walk into a room, it'll be silent, and we could go direct. through the muscles and through the, we're learning a lot about all that stuff. So I think that the transmission of existing music may actually change that. If I should pass that down to my grandchildren, because that article that I wrote, that thing may actually be a 50 years from now, 100 years from now. exactly what you're going to get or something, you know, very similar to it. So that is going to change down the line, but it has nothing to do with content. It only has to do with the transmission. The content of the music will change. There'll be new content that will develop. And I think we'll see. people making things that truly you couldn't. I mean, I think Silver Apples probably does seem that way to most people, but it really isn't that outlandish, you know, from that standpoint. It uses a lot of the information. My guess is that we're going to move to a place where new kinds of content will eventually evolve as... the machine and the person interface and and with that changing along with the transmission we're lucky that we use the technology for other things than fine art music because or music at all but certainly anything that that is new and different because we'd never have technology if that's what we were doing because it works for the home it makes your refrigerator go you know and that's not going to stop. That's going to keep going. It's going to get more complicated, more sophisticated, and more user-friendly. As you go so user-friendly, you won't even know you're doing it anymore. You know, it'd just be, I mean, you'll know you're doing it, but the technology will be totally elusive. You won't, like in your car right now, you don't know you've got computers. I mean, you should know, but most people don't. So I I don't think I would dare to think about the future. I mean, who would have thought that in the... This year, the 21st century, that's got to, if you were born in the 21st century, I suppose it doesn't mean too much to you, but anyone born before the 21st century, you know, it was a big deal when we got to the 20th century. Now the 21st century, who would have thought that at this point we would be having religious wars? I mean... Sweden and most of the Scandinavian countries couldn't find anything to do with churches. You know, we thought that was over. So who knows? I mean, I wouldn't want to predict. But what I'd like to see, and I think has a good potential, is this modular kind of development. And the technology itself will change with the rest of the technology. It'll become smaller. It'll become more neurologically controlled. And I don't think it's that far off. I think, you know... With the glasses, the Google glasses and various other things that are now happening, I would imagine we're looking at... max 30 years, 35 years before we see another paradigm, major paradigm shift in computing. I don't even know. We're talking about quantum computers, but it may be that when we get there, we won't even be thinking about that. It'll just, we won't need them. Like if you have the brain, you don't need the quantum. I don't know. An interesting study that was done. recently where they got monkeys working on a problem, chimpanzees working on a problem, and they got them wired. because they found certain parts of the brain that were being reinforced when each of them worked on a single problem. And so they got those things to transmit to another monkey so that they were all interactive in the brain, and they were able to solve these problems 100 times faster than some problems that they couldn't solve individually at all could now solve as a group. And that's the direction we're heading, I think. I don't know, not to be chimpanzees, but it's a whole thing that we never really even thought about before. ♪ ♪ Thank you.
