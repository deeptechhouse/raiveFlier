Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artist labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Sia is among a new breed of English techno producers that are taking the genre and making it their own. His OCS label has helped push some of these artists, namely Shifted and Truss. but it's perhaps his releases on. that have gained him the most notoriety. Living with Ghosts, his debut album, was released this year on Scuba's imprint, and while it received rave reviews, it also caused an amount of controversy due to its racy album cover. You'll hear his explanation on why he chose it, as well as his reaction to the lengthy forum thread about the record, in this exchange we recorded earlier this month. *music* I wanted to begin by talking about some of your influences that aren't musical. I was really intrigued by reading some of the interviews around the album. You saying designers. Yeah. Almost. Yeah. Yeah. One of the people that I looked up was Gavin Pugh? Gareth Pugh. Gareth Pugh. Gareth Pugh. Sorry. Yeah. His designs are quite spiky and experimental. Yeah. Totally. Like I think he's been described as like the enfant terrible of British fashion basically in the past. Like um. And I mean, I guess it's maybe an unusual kind of like area to draw influence from, like as a music producer. But, um... I don't know. I mean, I think I said in the interview, which you probably read, like there's something about the way these sort of specific group of designers kind of are able to sort of create this universe, you know, like they have this idea in their head and they, you know, actualize it. Like there's a... whole world basically behind it and I don't know if you saw any of like the videos which he shows and stuff as well like and you're definitely worth checking out I mean there was a period where any sort of like time I was feeling slightly uninspired or whatever like I go online I think there's a specific video which he showed for his I think it was like spring summer 09 or something collection and it's amazing man like the soundtrack's incredible like it's edited by this video artist called Ruth Hogban And just the whole concept behind it, like, I don't know, it just, everything seems to come together in it just to kind of create this really pure artistic vision from like the clothes to the sound to the actual way the video is edited. And that sort of thing really appeals to me, you know. I guess, you know, the immediate analogy you want to draw here is a great club with a great sound. and, you know, great crowd. Totally. It's like the complete experience, you know, like, which I guess is really what everyone's looking for, you know? Is that, you'd obviously found it before Berghain, I would assume. Where were the other clubs growing up that kind of... got you into it I remember you talking about one warehouse techno rave that well yeah that's the thing I mean I guess growing up I didn't really go clubbing at all and I mean I didn't actually set foot into a club proper until maybe I was like 22 23 um and I came to electronic music or dance music anyway pretty late so about 19. And so from 19 until about 22, 23, like I was just going to warehouse squat parties and forest parties in the summer. And it's quite a different experience to a club. Really, really quite a different experience to a club, I'm sure you know. And I mean, the thing which really appealed to me about those parties specifically was the freedom there. And that was what really put, I mean, I'd never been to a club, so I guess I was kind of, I wasn't really informed to make this sort of judgment. I remember saying to my friends, why would I want to go into a club where there's rules and regulations and there's people telling me what I can and can't do, where I could just go to an industrial estate and listen to the music that I love. it's a completely sort of liberating experience. Where was this? This was London? This, I mean, it was when I was at music college outside of London, actually, in the kind of Surrey Hills sort of area. And I was stunning guitar and literally just stumbled across this, this squat party one night with a friend. I mean, I had friends who were going to these things, but like I say, I was really not... Growing up, I wasn't into dance music at all, and so I was kind of, oh, it's not my thing, you know, I won't go. And then I just kind of went along one night for various reasons and was blown away, basically. So it was kind of like around Guildford, Basingstoke, Brighton. And then in the summer, there'd be forest parties happening in the kind of countryside around the more immediate area, basically, in the kind of like hills and woods and stuff. Was it mostly the party that got you into it? Or was it also the music? It was, I mean, the very first time that I went to... to one of these, I hadn't really done any drugs before either. And when I was at this, I was totally sober. And I think it was, so it wasn't a case of sort of like I was off my face and it was amazing, you know. But I think it was definitely, as much as the sound system and the music, it was definitely this kind of amazing underground culture, which I'd never experienced before. It was just completely like, wow, this exists, you know. It kind of felt like I suddenly had some curtain sort of pulled away from this thing and suddenly I could see into a whole other world, you know? You were in bands before this. Yes. And those are underground cultures. Yeah, no, no, yeah. I read you were in a noise band? I mean, it was, I guess, kind of like noise-esque experimental odd stuff, basically. It was kind of like a byproduct of smoking a lot of weed and playing with lots of effects boxes, basically, and occasionally bashing my guitar. I mean, great albums have been made under those circumstances. They totally have. They totally have. And I mean, I'd like to sort of investigate it again, but I definitely, if someone had sat me down and tried to get me to write a great album, then it wouldn't have happened. So there's certain bands that you were listening to around then, Sonic Youth, My Bloody Valentine, these sorts of... Yeah, totally. And I mean, I still listen to... I mean, on a day-to-day basis, probably more of that kind of stuff than I do straight-up techno. Either than when, you know, I mean, obviously when I'm writing or when I'm sort of... or going through tracks that I'm going to play or something. But if it's just a case of I'm in my apartment and I'm kind of relaxing, I'll probably put something more akin to that on techno, so to speak. I think one of the things about your album and Shifted's album is that you can really hear that basically, you know, it's like my... bloody valentine in a way with a techno beat well that that's the thing if you want to yeah take understand that that's an influence totally i mean i can i can see why maybe some people would listen to it and and kind of wonder what i'm talking about when i kind of cite these you know say shoegaze bands as an influence or whatever but for me I think the thing which really appealed to me about techno was the kind of immersive and hypnotic quality that it has, you know, this ability to really, to suck the listener into oneself, you know, and you really lose yourself in it. And that was exactly what I liked about bands like My Bloody Valentine, you know, and the kind of... kind of aspects. I mean with My Bloody Valentine specifically, like my favorite bits were always the interludes in between the tracks, you know. And so for me, I guess sort of then when I came to making electronic stuff, it was more, it was always more about the kind of like textural aspects and the soundscape aspects and then layering that with kind of rhythms and stuff like that as well. So, I mean, it makes sense to me to say that, and I'm glad that you can hear it as well. I mean, I'm sort of aware that it might sound odd to some people, you know, because, I mean, on the surface, the kind of two genres are a world apart, really. But the way that you describe them, I think it's so obvious in a way to me. Immersive. Yeah. You're in a club. Exactly. And I'm like, my bloody Valentine shows, you know, you come out of it and you're just really blown away. Yeah. I was just in something and now I'm not. Exactly. In that. Exactly. You know? So how do you. get from guitar school to making beats well uh at the college there were a lot of people on like a production course and things like that so there were friends of mine there who knew what they were doing making music on a computer basically um And these were the same people that I was going every weekend to these parties with. And so it was kind of slowly, you know, after the party would go back and they'd open Logic up or something and I'd sit there in the room with them and they'd be like, oh, you know, this is how you do this and this is how you do this. And there'd obviously be Dex there as well. And I'd start mixing really badly, like all sorts of stuff because everyone was into different things, you know And it was kind of a case, I guess, of slowly I really started playing less and less guitar. And, you know, a friend gave me like a really early copy of Reason. And I just started messing around with that, basically, like and stopped practicing my guitar. And then ended up, I left the college before I was finished with the course. I just thought, this isn't really what I want to do anymore, you know. And it was, to be honest, it was a difficult decision to make because, I mean, from the age of 14, I'd wanted to play guitar professionally. You know, it was kind of, my life in my head had been mapped out already. And then electronic music came along, techno. ruined it for me like you know I changed the plan I'm sure that's helped out by the fact that you've worked in record stores as well yeah when did that happen you worked at Black Market yeah in London yeah um a while ago now I mean I think I started there maybe 2004 2005 okay around that kind of time So you were still in school? I'd left music college at this point and I was like, right, so I've got no idea how to break into this world that I suddenly want to get into. And I was working in a closed... in Covent Garden and a good friend of mine used to work for Azuli before they went kaput and they used to have the office just above Black Market basically Black Market was like five minutes away from this clothes shop I was working and one day my friend came in and was like James there's a vacancy going at Black Market you should definitely apply for it so I ran down on my lunch break and he introduced me to Goldie, who runs the shop, not Metalhead's Goldie, but a different Goldie. And we got on really well. And I had a trial day the next day and it just kind of went from there, basically. And obviously, as someone who... you know, is obsessed with music in general. Like a record store is the perfect place to work. Yeah. For, I mean, obviously it's a well-known shop, but a lot of people probably listening to this haven't been there. What's it like? It's... And where is it located? It's in central London in Soho. There are a lot of record shops around this area. right there are a lot there are a lot less than they used to be unfortunately like everywhere really in the world but there are still quite a few i mean compared to any other city other than berlin i've been into like it's certainly the most concentrated collection of record shops i've found and i mean it's it's a lovely place to work there's a real kind of family vibe there It's not massive, but I mean, it really specialises in certain things like drum and bass and dubstep downstairs. And now I think they're doing dub and reggae as well. And then upstairs, techno and house, basically. And then a little bit of new disco and stuff like that as well. So it was, I mean... Were you working upstairs or downstairs? To start with downstairs. In the time, this is kind of the beginning of dubstep, right? Yeah, or at least what... It was around the time when I really found dubstep, you know? Okay. So it was the kind of like half-step kind of era, if you want to call it that. Like... And so, yeah, I was downstairs then. And slowly I convinced Goldie, like, I want to be upstairs now. Come on, let me upstairs. And eventually that happened, basically. And I mean, for me, the thing I miss most about working there, other than just the people, because it is a really, really kind of nice family vibe in the shop. is just the amount of new music that you can find because there is so much stuff that gets released every week and it's so easy for something to pass you by, like a great release. And even something which, say, might be on a label that you don't generally check or a genre that you don't even generally listen to. But working in a record shop, you know, in a quiet couple of hours, what are you going to do other than put on every new record that's just come in? And chances are you'll go home with sort of like five new bits of music that you would never have found otherwise, you know? No, and of course the people you're working with are experts. Yeah, totally. And they're like, oh, have you heard this? Or have you heard this? Or I think you'd like this, you know? And so, I mean, I definitely kind of feel, I mean, my wallet's probably happier for that, that that's not happening anymore. But I kind of definitely feel my sort of, my, not tastes have been narrowed, but my ability to, because no one has time to scout everything out. That's the thing. Whereas now, you know, I don't have that opportunity open to me to just kind of. Well, you could go down to hard wax and. spend eight hours there a day but i could be a little bit weird i totally could but i think they get sick of the sight of me pretty quickly to be honest with you of course Why did you want to get upstairs so badly? It just kind of made more musical sense to me, to be honest with you. I mean, around the time I started, I found dubstep was at a really exciting place, basically. And I mean, for me, I think I draw a lot of parallels between this kind of era of the dubstep sound, this really sparse half step. bass, really, really bass-orientated sound. Like, to me, like, there's quite a lot of similarities between that and the kind of techno that I make now. You know, it's the same kind of, like, very sparse, minimal, loopy, hypnotic kind of soundtrack, you know? And I was really into this kind of sound. And then the more sort of, like, abstract stuff, like Shackleton and things like that. But, I mean, obviously, as you know, that kind of sort of the popularity... I mean, at the end of the day, what does popularity matter? But, you know, when you've got a certain amount of records coming in every week and you're finding that you're into less and less of them, you start getting a little bit tired of hearing all the stuff that you don't like anymore, you know? Felt less of my... it all to you exactly exactly and so I was kind of really keen on on getting upstairs because you know that was around the time that techno was moving back or at least what we were getting into the shop anyway was moving back more into the direction of things that I was into you know What were some of those artists or labels that were releasing things that you remember that you were getting passionate about? I mean, I remember, like, obviously, Oscar Ton. Like, I think they really can't be, you know, I think, for me anyway, like, the importance of the role that they played in this kind of, like, blossoming of, like, a kind of... real techno sort of like renaissance like can't be underplayed um but then i mean there was also this the stuff that would get me really excited was i mean it's kind of become a real cliche now i guess but the hand stamp stuff that would come through and you wouldn't have any idea of the artist that made it or where they were from or anything like say the old the early like do not resist the beat stuff that was by milton bradley or the traversable wormhole stuff you know before that sort of was announced who it was, those kind of things. Because it's like you pick up a record and you'd have no idea, you know, who it was by or what it was going to sound like. But it was just, you know, someone would have given it to you and gone, you'd like that, James. Now it feels crazy to be like, oh, back in the day, but... Back when that was happening. I mean, there wasn't masses of that stuff about. That's the thing, you know. I mean, there really wasn't. Like, I mean, I remember it must have been just after, I think, Traversable Wormhole 3 or something had just come out. And I had to do a mix for Marianne Hobbs. And I thought, I need to get some more of this stuff. So I found his MySpace page, Adam's MySpace page. And I just dropped him a message on it. Like I had no idea. I mean, no one had any idea who he was at this point. I just said, I'm really into your stuff. I'm doing this mix. Like, is there any chance you could send me some bits? And it took him a little bit of persuading because obviously it was all anonymous. And he was just like, look, you can't, you know, he didn't even he didn't tell me who he was at this point. Yeah But he sent me through some bits and Milton did as well. And it was just kind of, it was, I guess, again, it was a little bit like this, this feeling when I first found techno, you know, it's like this whole sea of music is kind of there, but you're, you know, it's, it's, it's there for you to discover and it's. kind of slightly hidden, slightly anonymous. You're not too sure what's going on. Does that appeal to you? It does. It does. I mean, I think the whole anonymous techno producer thing has been so talked up. And, you know, especially over the last kind of couple of years. And I think there's something which it definitely appeals to me is in it's very purist. You know, it's like it's not about egos. It's not about image. It's not about anything other than here's some music that I made and I'm putting it on a on a vinyl with probably no artwork and just a handstand. And it's kind of very DIY. And that definitely appeals to me. But at the same time, I guess I'm kind of conflicted because I'm a vain, shallow person. And so I'm not going to lie and say that I don't think about things. like image and aesthetics and things because that's equally as important to me so I'm kind of at this you know I've got this weird mental contradiction going on constantly in my head it brings up a good point because I remember reading an interview you talking about how releases of yours especially early on giving off this perception or this feeling about who you are that wasn't exactly the full picture necessarily yeah Why do you think it was so hard to give out the full picture? I mean, I think I've always had a very concrete idea of what I want to do and the sound I want to make and where, you know, where I want to go with what I'm making now. I think especially with the earlier stuff, I mean, it's a learning process, you know. I mean, I've always made all sorts of different stuff. For me, the writing process is the most important thing, you know. And so one day I might be writing an ambient track and one day I might be writing something very Berghain-y techno track and the next day I might be messing around with something that's house-y. And I think it took me a while to kind of... to learn to say, no, like this track isn't coming out a sigh or isn't coming out full stop because it's not the right sound, you know. It doesn't mean that I'm not proud of the music that I have put out in the past, but I think maybe it gave people a different picture of me than the one I had in my head, you know. I mean, people still sort of come up to me and talk about, say, Roar or Shake. And for me, like, I mean, I'm really happy with those tracks, but they're definitely, they don't sound like Sire tracks to me. And even when they came out, to me, like, I was aware that they weren't, you know, if someone had come to see me play and they just knew me off the back of those couple of releases, they'd probably be scratching their heads a little bit I wasn't expecting this. Like, where's the slinky groove and the, you know, the syncopation? It's funny because as an artist, you want to get to a place where you can just put out whatever you want under your own name and for people to just understand that you make all sorts of different music. But the reality of this industry is that... If you put out one track that's, you know, has a breakbeat and then you put out a techno track, get a perception from audiences. Yeah. It's tough to kind of re-educate or something like that. It was the same thing with your album, I think, in a way, some of the more ambient bits. I also listened to it for the first time. I was like, oh, interesting, because I'd never heard that sort of thing. So I was kind of like, okay, well, where is this coming from? How long has this been in the process? I mean, to me, like the ambient sort of, the ambient tracks on the record makes sense. You know, it, to me, like. And I guess exactly what I spoke about before with the My Bloody Valentine and Shoe Gazy kind of stuff. The ambient tracks are intended to basically do the same thing as the beat orientated tracks, but just traveling down a different path, you know. But I mean, I guess something which I have been concerned about in the past is. You know, when you put out an EP or an LP in this case, like which ultimately is dance music, you know, it's intended for people to play in clubs. Like, will the ambient stuff get a little bit lost? You know, will people give it the time of day? Because, I mean, some of my favourite tracks on the LP, the ones that I'm proudest of are the ambient ones. But the response to them in general has been really positive. And I mean, it's kind of... probably the tracks which people have sort of talked about the most to me personally have been ambient tracks and they're the ones that people have been sort of, you know, getting back to me about basically. What's the process of creating? one of those tracks an ambient track or um i mean it kind of varies i think that with the more kind of traditionally dance music sort of stuff that i make you know i guess i'm a little bit more rigid with how i approach things But when it comes to writing something like an abstract kind of drone piece or something, I'm really relaxed with myself, you know, and it's sometimes like the other day I was out at seven in the morning recording dustbin men and dustbins and stuff. And I'll just maybe chuck that into a sequencer and kind of literally just start building stuff on top of it from there. I mean, the last track on the LP, Aokigora. was actually constructed out of four different pieces which I'd been working on separately. And then I gelled them together at the end, basically, and then sort of programmed on top of that and automated stuff and things in and out. And, I mean, that's a world away from the way I'd ever write something that was designed to work as something on the dance floor, you know? I mean, I ask it because I think it must be tough to... not have any constraints, where you have at least a grid where you're like, okay, I know I need to... I mean, it's funny because it is in a way, but at the same time, I think it's so freeing. Like, I mean, in the last kind of month and a half, to be honest, I've been really struggling with sitting down and writing like, you know, dance floor techno or something that I can play out. but I've been making so much just ambient drone and it's such an immersive process. Like you can really lose yourself in it, you know? And I mean, I guess it goes back to what I was saying about, you know, I make all sorts of stuff and I think it's important to, you know, if something isn't coming, like move on to the next thing, you know? And it doesn't mean that you'll never go back and make something that's... a techno track or a house track or whatever again but I think it's important to move naturally where your where your kind of like feelings are currently lying Tell me about the last best book you read. The last best book I read. Actually, I just finished Just Kids by Patti Smith, which was recommended to me by a bunch of people. So I thought, I'm going to buy this and read it and see what it's like. And it was really good. What's it about? It was about basically her life growing up as a struggling artist, poet, basically. And specifically her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe, I think. And it was just really, as you'd expect, really beautifully written, very evocative and very sad as well at the end, to be honest. But I really, really recommend it. I mean, it was actually Tommy, 4'7", he was like, I've just been reading this book. It's really inspiring. It's about the life of someone who really wants to become an artist. And so I thought, yeah, like, and Harry Midland had recommended it to me before. And so I walked into an English bookshop in Berlin. It was sitting there calling me. on the counter so I thought I'll buy it and give it a shot and I'm glad I did it seems like you've talked in interviews in the same way about designers and art and things that you know reading books are an inspiration as well definitely I mean it's I mean that this book I guess just just kids it was inspiring because it was about the kind of struggle that someone had to become a recognised poet and artist, you know, and the sort of pains that she went through to get to the point where she is today. But I mean, in general, it's not necessarily, I mean, say a biographical book isn't what I'm talking about when I'm saying I find, you know, certain books really inspiring. And I guess, again, it's kind of like similar with, say, like the whole designer thing. It's not something that you'd necessarily like expect someone to be drawing influence from as a as a music producer. And I guess it's not a direct influence, you know, but it's just it's the kind of thing that really makes makes me want to sit down and write more so maybe than listening to like a bunch of new tunes or something. It just kind of gets the creative process kind of started in my brain, you know. What is it about someone like Ernest Hemingway or Brad Easton Ellis, who you've mentioned in the past? What is it about their writing that makes you want to get creative? I mean, I don't know, to be honest with you. It's like, I mean, Brad Easton Ellis, like specifically, like I love his books. And I mean, often very dark. But there's something about his writing. It's kind of very powerful and sort of punchy, you know? I guess you can immediately sort of see that there's a style there. Yeah, but I mean, I think... I think it's even more than that, because like I say, it's not like a direct kind of sort of influence drawn from his style of writing. You know, it's more so you read a book like American Psycho or I don't know, Glamorama or something, and it puts you in a specific state of mind. And I guess that's what I mean. Generally, I think I'm drawn to, whether it's in films or books or art, like sort of things that are maybe slightly melancholic or slightly dark. And maybe it says something terrible about me. I don't know. But these are the emotional states that when I get into them, like it really makes me want to sit down and make something. So I think that this is why I find those kind of books really inspiring because it just kind of puts me into the right frame of mind to make some music, for me anyway. For someone who's into design and the whole package and everything, the album cover, which is received. Some mixed reviews, I suppose, is the best way to put it. What was the thought there? How does that exemplify the album in some way? Well, I mean, I really wanted to get away from the whole sort of what's become a very traditionally techno, you know, like contemporary techno aesthetic of like black and white. grayscale images and this kind of thing. You mean Shifted's album cover? But the thing is, I totally love this kind of imagery, you know, and in the first kind of incarnation of the shoots that we were doing, like it was shot by a friend of mine who does all the OCS stuff, Jimmy Mould. And I sent him on midnight, like shoots around London and stuff. And it was just like, just. you know, photographed some weird people basically wandering around Soho and stuff. And we were looking at all these images and they were great, but it just kind of looked very techno to me, you know? Quote unquote, you're making air quotes right now. Yeah, quote unquote, air quotes. Air quote techno. And I just thought it maybe would be more interesting to do something that kind of moved away from this because the album itself is very bleak. It is very, quote unquote, bleak. Yeah, exactly. And so I thought maybe it would be interesting to do something which almost was a complete... sort of juxtaposition of what you'd find inside the album, outside the album, you know? And so I knew I wanted sort of very soft pink sort of hues and things like that. And there was this one scene which I kept talking to Jimmy about, like in Requiem for a Dream, where, what's the name of the actress in Requiem for a Dream? Jennifer Connelly? Yes, that's it. The scene basically where she's in a bath after just being, doing horrible things for drugs. basically. And she's just feeling, well, I'm sure she's feeling horrible. But there was something really emotionally powerful about this. And just this specific image of like her hunched over, basically really stuck in my head. And so when I started talking about pinky hues and stuff like that, like this image just kept cropping up. And so I started talking to Jimmy about it and we just kind of ran with that basically. Were you surprised by the reaction to it? When it finally came out, I wasn't. I mean, because by that point, I'd kind of started to think to myself, maybe people will look at this as, you know, it's a naked girl on the cover of a dance music album, which is, you know, not how I intended it to be perceived at all, to be completely honest with you, you know. I'm still really happy with the cover. and I totally stand by it. I think it's a really beautifully shot image. I love the whole aesthetic of it. I think it's beautiful. But by the time it came out, and I mean, I worry about stuff constantly. And so I've been sitting there basically, like thinking to myself, hmm, like, are people just going to like, look at the nipple on the album cover? And yeah, I mean, it's I've had like, you know, a lot of positive kind of comments about it, but I've had just as many negative ones, basically. And people are totally entitled to their own opinion. I'm entitled to do what I want as an artist. And that was what I wanted on the front cover of the album. So, you know, I think if people can't see past basically like nudity in a nipple. like maybe that's their problem and not mine to be completely honest for sure um there was quite a bit of talk on the ra forums there was about the album and i didn't necessarily get a lot out of it personally um i'm sure you may feel the same i think one of the things that What's interesting is that Ausgut has had enormous influence on a lot of people and people are coming to Berlin and now making techno. And that's the perception. Oh, wow, they saw this, they like it, now they're jumping on some sort of thing. Yeah, bandwagon, so to speak. Is there anything you can do as an artist aside from just doing what you do and trying to just say, just look at the work? I think that's the healthiest approach to it, basically. I mean, I'd be totally lying if I said that comments like that didn't really affect me. And I think anyone who says, oh, I can just forget about it, is lying, basically. You know, at the end of the day, we're human beings. And when you put time and effort into something, obviously, like I say, people are entitled to their own opinion. But when you get kind of such a negative kind of response, it is going to affect you. But ultimately, I think the most positive way to deal with it is exactly that. Just to say, you know, like I'm I'm making what I make and I'm going to keep making what I make because it's what I love, you I mean, I'm in a lucky position where I can release music, but ultimately it's the making of that music which is important to me. Like I said, I'd be lying if I said people's reaction to it didn't matter to me, because it really does. But what it really boils down to is the thing that I care about the most is sitting down every day and writing. That's the bottom line. You said that a couple of times and I find that interesting. It seems like you really enjoy the process. It's horribly frustrating and really depressing. Well, that seems like enjoyable things for you. You know, it's... Enjoy is maybe... uh, word that I wouldn't always apply to it, but I can't even, I can't explain it. It's something that I almost feel like I have to do. You know, it's like if I spend, I mean, obviously some, sometimes you can't, it's like you're traveling for the weekend or something, but if, if there's a day when say in the week when, you know, I'm, I'm here and I haven't spent at least some of that time attempting to make something. I just feel horrible. And I know that however badly writing goes, I'll be better off trying than just spend the day wondering about the city and then that evening just feel really unsatisfied, basically. You recorded the album on Hot Flush. Yeah. But you have your own label. OCS, Asset Killer Sound, yeah. Why? Why? Like, why do you have the label? Why did you decide I need this outlet? put out tracks? I mean sort of I guess especially since working in the record shop running a label was always something that I really wanted to do you know I think it's probably the kind of electronic music fans. So it was an idea that I had in the back of my head for quite a long time before it actually became real. I guess I felt that I kind of got to a point where... it was a possibility for me. Like, and I kind of landed myself in a situation where I had a Detman remix of one of my tracks, which wasn't going anywhere else, you know. And, you know, Marcel was really happy with it. I loved it. So, you know, I said to him, it's like, look, would you be happy if I started a label with this and a track? of mine it's like yeah of course like and so you know kind of i just thought well i'll be kind of stupid not to do it at this point you know it's one of my favorite artists is on the flip doing a remix and why not now if if ever you know and so you've gone ahead with it since then and now you have a couple of artists yeah and now yeah um now uh the latest 12 was by trust that just came him out a couple of days ago actually and shifted as well has done a bunch of stuff for the label and I mean they're both really good friends I think we've got a lot in common with how we kind of approach sound and And I think that there's a lot of common ground, like aesthetically and as well as sonically, you know. Shifted, I know is from the UK. Yeah. But not much else is known about him. Yeah. It's clear though that you guys have very similar outlooks on techno. Yeah, definitely. Which I find interesting. How did you find each other and how did you realize that you guys had such a kind of common ground? Well, I mean, I knew him for a while before I even knew he was making techno. I didn't know him really well, but in his previous life as a different, in a different genre, I knew him from that basic. and we'd booked him for a couple of parties that I used to do and stuff like that. He kind of got in touch one day and just wanted to send me some music that he'd be making. Yeah, he sent me, I mean, he didn't even have a shifted name for it yet. He was just like, oh, I've done these tracks and I think you might like them from what I've heard of your stuff. And I listened to them and straight away, at this point, he hadn't sent them to anyone else. And I just said, man, like, you need to really focus on this stuff because this is serious. He was, I mean, he still is so self-effacing. It's like, oh, I don't, you know, I don't know if it's any good. Like, what do you think? I was just, man, like, he sent me eight tracks and all eight were great. And his work rate is horrendously, horrendously quick, kind of depressingly so. And so within a couple of months, like I just had a huge shifted, like, you know, follower of tracks to the extent where I could probably have played, you know, a whole set of just shifted tunes. So we kept talking after that and it just kind of... became more and more apparent that it wasn't just kind of the music we were making sort of fitted into the same kind of category. It was the music that we were listening to outside of that was the same, you know, and our interests just in general were so similar that we just got on really well, basically. And I mean, now we work a lot together and stuff. And I think it's not easy to find someone that kind of really you click with musically. I think it's really important if you want to do anything collaboratively. Like, it's not easy, you know. So it's nice to have found someone to do this stuff with. Are you doing other sorts of music with him or is it straight techno collaboration? We're doing other sorts of stuff. I mean, there's definitely... I mean, I think right now, and maybe why it's so interesting, I think there's a very grey area in between a lot of genres, you know, like the whole kind of noise area is bleeding into techno. and vice versa, you know. And I guess it kind of sits somewhere in between that. Does that stuff work in a set as a DJ? Noise kind of stuff and things? Yeah. I mean, it depends when you play it in the kind of the... the makeup of each track, you know, it's like, I mean, I often open with a huge amount of like ambience and stuff like that and then work it up into more and more sort of heavier noise pieces and things. Or I guess if you were, if you were ending a set, it's kind of nice to end with something quite intense. But I think also, really, if you really want to go in, you can do things like layer stuff like that up with other records and things, which is something that... I mean, I remember I was asked this question about why did you put ambient tracks on an LP, which is basically a dance music LP. And I just said, well, if you really want to call it a dance music LP, like when I DJ, what's wrong with layering an ambient track over a techno track? and getting like three or four bits in the mix at once because it's just going to make the sound more cohesive and interesting over a longer period of time. So I think that there are all sorts of possibilities that you can use these kind of things for as a DJ. but I guess if you're just looking at it literally from the point of playing two records and it's going to make people dance, you've got to be a little bit more adventurous than that, I think. You've been talking a lot about the production side of things. Do you consider yourself a producer first? I think, I mean, I love DJing. Like, I get so much satisfaction out of it. But I think, I mean, the reason why I'm doing what I do now is because... I really, really love making music. I can't really go a day without, at least even if it goes badly, at least trying to write something. So I suppose so. But I think really, I mean, these days you can't really just be one. I mean, you can, but if you want to do it as a, you know, this is my job that I do all the time. you can't really, you don't have the luxury of just doing one or the other, which results in some terrible DJs and some terrible producers. But, you know, like, I don't know. I do my best. Of course, of course. What's next? for you after an album like that is kind of like there's all sorts of possibilities i imagine running through your mind yeah i mean i i feel like i learned a massive amount like from writing um and so i'm just kind of really keen on on cracking on basically um I mean, at the minute I'm working on kind of a number of different things like an ambient and slightly more down-tempo kind of project, which is no label, you know, there's no... label a sign for it or anything like that it's literally something I'm just doing for my own enjoyment and then we'll see what happens with it and then I'm I guess techno wise style wise I'm working on 12 for blueprint at the minute and just finishing a remix for Peter Van Hoosen as well and and supposed to be writing a 12 for OCS. We'll see if I manage to do that on top of everything else. I'm sure the label manager will let you know when you need to get that done. So, I mean, I've been really busy, basically, but it's kind of self-imposed busyness, which is the best kind, really. And I think I've always been one of those people that likes to have... different projects on the go. Maybe I've over-assigned myself this time. But, I mean, it's nice to have different landing points for things that I do, you know.
