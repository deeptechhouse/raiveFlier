Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. For many years, Jono Burgess simultaneously edited a magazine and threw parties, and it's clear he viewed the roles as being interchangeable. Jockey Slut became known as a source of forward-thinking electronic music. whose irreverent tone set it apart from the rest of the UK dance press. This was mirrored by his Bugged Out parties, which gave early exposure to acts like Daft Punk, the Chemical Brothers, and Kashmir, and helped lay the foundation for the techno scene in the UK as we know it today. Bugged Out held key residencies at Sankey's Soap in Manchester, The Nation in Liverpool, and The End in London. During this time it formed close bonds with acts like Errol Alkin, Dave Clark, Miss Kitten and Tiga, who came to represent the very essence of the party. These days Bugged Out is a London-based operation with a far-reaching range of events and an annual weekender. Ryan Keeling sat down with Burgess and Charlotte Hawthorne to reflect on a successful two decades in dance music. you So Giorno, before there was Bugged Out, there was Jockey Slut. I thought a good place to start would be to have you explain a little bit about the magazine and kind of how the whole thing came about. Jockey Slut was a magazine I started with Paul Benny. We were both at Manchester University and when we left university I stayed on as editor of the university magazine and Jockey Slut we did in our spare time using all their facilities. It was kind of like a hobby slash what the hell are we going to do with our lives kind of thing. And from literally from issue one it kind of started to connect with people. We used to like, only do we distribute it around the record shops in Manchester and then I think issue two we took it to Birmingham and Liverpool and posted it to Glasgow. And the feedback was just very strong pretty much straight away because I think we hit a niche that... was there at the time that wasn't being filled by the other magazines. Which was? There was Mixmag and DJ, but they were quite different back then. Mixmag was very club culture based, less artist led. DJ was very about DJ technology and less about features, about the actual... and what music they were making. People used to talk about what knobs they twiddled back then and how they made the music as opposed to who they were as people. I think we had quite a rock approach in a way to it because we grew up on... and me and Select and The Face. So I think we interviewed DJs as people rather than how did you make that record? And I think that's why Jockey Select was quite different. I mean, do you think that was because there was still something missing? surrounding the creation of the music. Yeah, I mean, it's still really new. I mean, we're talking, this is five years after Acid House, 1993, so people still didn't even think the scene would last, and NME still hadn't had any electronic acts on their cover, really. I think about six months after Jockey Slut started, they had LFO on the cover, smashing guitars up. in some kind of weird statement. The only way they could get their heads around it was to still have a guitar on the cover, even though it was being smashed up. So, yeah, it was just a very different time. But we also arrived at a time when... it was becoming more artist-based. The Chemical Brothers were starting to evolve. Daft Punk, in our first year, put out their first press release. Underworld were obviously a fully-formed band. So there's a lot for us to write about. I mean, from your perspective, were there people going out and listening to this music across the country? Yeah, I mean, weirdly, one of the first kind of nationwide touring clubs was Megadog, which had quite a crusty reputation. But they did put on people like Underworld and Andrew Wetherall, and that was massive in Manchester. The Hacienda was still big in Manchester, but it didn't really cover the kind of music that Jockey Slut did. So we used to have to go to... you know yeah things like mega dog and those kind of clubs to sort of hear the music or further afield i think back to basics was very um on it and championing techno and so yeah we traveled a lot i mean broadly speaking was the audience for techno um quite different back then to maybe how it is now It was probably less sexy than it is now in a way. It was a bit more male. The orbit in Morley near Leeds, that was probably 90% men sweating. So I think now... It feels like, you know, with all the Italians and stuff, it's a bit more, a bit more she-she than it was back then. So in terms of the club night. How did this come to be? When was the decision made that there needed to be some sort of outlet, some sort of real-world outlet? I think when we did the third issue of Jockey Slurps, some marketing chap from London spotted it and thought it was very edgy, especially the name, I suppose. He actually gave us money to put on a club night in Manchester, which we called Drinking Club. of a precursor to the heavenly social in the way because we had the chemical brothers playing uh when they were called the dust brothers they were like friends of ours it was in the basement of a pub with a band called old brutus on we had center tn djing and we gave away free cigarettes to everyone that came in so it was a very very kind of pub based club night And then they liked that a lot, the people who had given us the money to do it. So they gave us money to do something else. That was called Disco Pogo. And we just did three of those. Andrew Weatherall played Express 2, I think, again, the Chemical Brothers. And that's just the 300 people each one of those nights. And the owner of Sankey's Soap, which had not long been open, came to one of those nights, Andrew Spiro. Loved the crowd, loved the music, thought there was something new going on with it. And he offered us a weekly residency pretty much that week. He was like, our Fridays aren't really working, do you want to come and have a go at it? So, yeah, we literally had about a week to come up with the name Bugged Out, an idea, a plan. And, yeah, that's kind of how it evolved. Now, how did that plan look? I remember at the time as being quite scared of giving up every Friday night for the foreseeable future. I only think it would probably go on for a few months, if that. But I remember that being quite a big decision, having to go, right, every Friday, this is where I'm going to be. And, yeah, I mean, God, it could have been. called Okidoki which is what Sankey Soap wanted to call it and we were like please let us come up with a new name they were like you've got 12 hours so yeah luckily we came up with Bugged Out in that time What did it sort of mean to you what were you looking to put across with that name? To reflect what we were really doing with the magazine, it actually came from the magazine. Christian Vogel, a Brighton techno artist, had said, my music sounds bugged out, in a quote, and we were flicking through the magazine, and that's kind of what jumped out at us. So, yeah, that's where the name came from. Yeah, I loved the music at the time. was just sounded very wonky and wiggy and bugged out like a lot of Chicago techno from Kashmir's label Relief and a lot of the stuff of that time was from Detroit or Chicago so it's very much based around that music I'm just sort of interested to know what in sort of a a slightly broader sense what was going on in and around Manchester that time and sort of like where was Sankey's in the kind of marketplace Sankey's I think had been going for about six months or something and it was in Ancoats which was where all the dark satanic mills are and real run down area, it wasn't on your doorstep, which I think really was hard for the club in the first six months because we were always looking at the doorway for people to come in. But at the same time, the people that were coming in were really quality people who just wanted to come. for the weird DJs we were putting on. And over like six months, we got a very devoted following, which I think was key. If it had been in the middle of Manchester, we would have got all randoms coming in, townies, whatever, and it probably would have ruined it. So it's kind of striking to me that, or it's kind of gone down with your history, that you were really early. on some of the sort of key acts or acts that would later go on to kind of define the decade, I'm thinking people like... Yeah. ..Darth Punk and Chemical Brothers, as you mentioned. When you were booking these acts or when you were putting on these shows, did you kind of have a sense at the time that they were poised for pretty big things? I think the Chemical Brothers definitely, I think... because they'd done the early shows for us and they really defined their own sound and then they had the Heavenly Social Club around them in London, you know, and they were kind of, the NME could get their heads around the Chemical Brothers. There was something about the way they presented themselves that was more easily sold in the rock press. And we just saw them go from, like, you know, 200 people in a sweaty basement to sort of very quickly selling out the Hacienda or whatever. So, yeah, they seem poised for greatness early on. Daft Punk, less so. We did them, I think we did the first ever interview in the world with them in Jockey Slut, just because we liked their press picture and they were called Daft Punk. The record wasn't bad as well, but... yeah, I think they seem to have sort of less of an impact. But then when Defunct came out, obviously... That turned everyone's head. So after that, it was, yeah, these guys are going to be pretty serious. What was it like the first time you booked them? What was the show like? Do you remember much about it? Yeah, I remember they were really young. They were probably about 20 years old. And it was at Sankey's in October 1995. And funny enough, they brought Pedro Winter with them, like Busy P, who runs Ed Banganow. And he was almost like their voice because they were so I remember sort of being backstage in this really cramped space and I literally wouldn't say a word and he was like their mouthpiece. I don't even think he was their manager though, I think they just needed someone to speak to people. So I just remember that about them, that they're very quiet and their set was probably 30 minutes long so they only had about five tracks to play. But they were very good tracks. It's kind of interesting, something you said about the kind of crossover nature of the Chemical Brothers and... the rock press could get their heads around a little bit. Do you think that you yourselves had an air of that? Was there a kind of crossover appeal? Did you appeal to the indie kids? I think Jockey Slut's sort of aesthetic was very much like that. Yeah, we approached DJs a little bit like the NME would approach a band. You wouldn't just talk about how... you made a record you talk about where'd you come from what's your environment like so then we did the first ever interview with underground resistance based on that because mad mike banks would never speak to anyone it took about three or four phone calls to convince him and when he found out we were basically managed he was like i'm down with it because most is up like detroit and uh And he said, I don't want to talk about music at all. And I just remember sort of Paul did the interview. And yeah, the interview still stands up today. It's just, you know, it's a black American working class, very proud of what he does, but doesn't want to talk about how he toodled a knob. He wants to talk about his roots and what music he grew up on. And so I think that was kind of what Jockey Sub was very much about, very much about where people, where their heads are at rather than all the boring music stuff. I mean, throughout the 90s, would you say that the magazine and Bugged Out were very closely aligned kind of thing? Yeah. In terms of artists you were booking, covering, I mean, were these things completely interwoven in your mind? Yeah, totally. I mean, it was called Jockey Slut Presents Bugged Out for as long as Jockey Slut was around, really, which was until 2004. And yeah, I mean, whoever was on the front cover of Jockey Slot would undoubtedly end up playing a part. I doubt it was very much links. You talked about the conversation more broadly in terms of being very focused on music creation, but did you see the tone of the chat kind of shift? Did magazines kind of change during the 90s? Did you see a shift more towards your... your perspective or your way of doing things? Yeah, I remember when Music Magazine launched, that was a couple of years after Jockey Slut, and we were like, we've got some competition now, because they were very much a similar kind of approach to us. So yeah, it did definitely evolve through the 90s. So you were at Sankey's Soap until 1998, is that right? Until they eventually closed. What were the circumstances surrounding that? I think Manchester was really blighted with gang problems in the 90s and it took a long time to reach Sankey's, but when it did... always just had a really detrimental effect on attendance. And that's kind of what happened, really, unfortunately. So it was just a case of it then ended up on the radar of these people and just, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Unfortunately, yeah. And then in terms of next moves, you were quite quickly approached by Cream. Is that right? Yeah, we thought that was the end of it, to be honest, because there was no one else who managed for us to put the club on. Nowhere suitable and we wouldn't have even thought of going to Liverpool but luckily they're all-nighter which is at the end of every month which went till six o'clock. was sort of not doing so well so they wanted a fresh start and they approached us and I think we almost didn't take it because we were like how can an 800 capacity underground techno club fill a 4000 capacity space but we got our heads around it and again we approached it a bit like the magazine we were like right magazine now has drum and bass it has breaks it has house as well as techno. So there was a traditional techno room with people like Dave Clark still residing and then we'd have a big house room and then there were people like DJ Sneak etc. Then there's a smaller room for kind of whatever I suppose was the flavour of the month in a sense so it might have been breaks, it might have been I don't know, yeah, the more niche stuff was in there. So it was a bit like doing a big festival in a club every month. Similar to what the Warehouse Project is now, I suppose, in size and scope. I mean, did you have reservations over kind of aligning yourself with a brand like Cream? I guess ostensibly they stood apart or you had very differing views or approaches, if you like, to the way clubbing went. Yeah, I think Cream was still relatively... cool to an extent. Alright, they had sort of rooms of music that we didn't like but they also had people at LTD book and playing and Darren Hughes was still there and he was, I think he just left it actually. There was still some good stuff there anyway and it wasn't, but the main thing was the venue was brilliant. It was just like a huge warehouse space so we just kind of made it our own really and put our own stamp on it. I mean, just thinking back to around that time when it very much was the era of supercubs and superstar DJs and the like, it was kind of sweeping up everyone's attention. Do you feel that there was much of a counterculture, if you like? Were there people who were sort of defining themselves as being in opposition to this culture? Yeah, undoubtedly. There was a lot of... piss-taking, you know, against kind of Cream's brand exercises. I think we ran something in Jockey Slut where we put the Cream logo on tea sets and pillows and just stupid things just sort of go, this is the way it's going now and we think it's a bit daft. But, yeah, at the same time though, yeah, there were a lot of, obviously, DJs will always be resolutely underground and won't have any sort of part of that kind of thing, even playing at setting foot in the venues. But I think we kind of, as I said, we made it our own. People played for Bug Dad, not for the fact that it was in a venue that Cream was in on the Saturday. So we still had people like Surgeon playing and Harvey. Yeah, a lot of people that were resolutely underground. What was the music that was leading what you did around the Cream Years? How would you define it? I think techno is still very much at the heart of the club. The Courtyard was the place where all the real loyal followers of Bugged Out would head to. Dave Clark played every month. People like Richie Horton, Green Velvet. surgeon were all regulars um but the main room was you know house music was pretty vibrant at the time as well as i said people like dj sneak um roger sanchez used to play quite a lot as well um cassius basement jacks it was it was that era when house music kind of you know felt quite refreshing again so that was the focal point for the main room I mean, you talked about it in terms of having some reservations to begin with and wondering if you could kind of transpose this older model onto this bigger space. Was it successful? I mean, do you look back on that period as being a period of growth and success? It was successful straight away, which really surprised us. Like the first night we were... Well, we were lucky enough to have the Chemical Brothers headlining. And I think the second night we had Carl Cox and Ronald Garnier. So we managed to get the line that was right straight away. And so it was busy straight away. I still think it's quite a lot of people's favourite eras because so many people passed through the doors. As I said, it was nearly 4,000 people a month, which back then was quite something. With that, many others. doing something that you would consider to be similar around the time you know around the UK I think London had similar clubs like Tribal Gatherings Final Frontier I think on a Friday was a pretty big club that was probably for 2000 people Ministry of Sound had their open nights as well with people like Derek May regularly playing and and cashmere and people like that. So there was more of a scene for techno, I think, in that era. I just kind of wanted to introduce Charlotte at this time. Hi. Hi. So how do you fit into this, and when did you kind of, well, when were you kind of welcomed into the fold, and what was the introduction? I came in 2000. I finished university, I decided that I wanted to work at Jockey's Look magazine, so I just basically, you know, first job out of university, didn't realise what you should do, just turned up, just kept turning up until Jono so I could work. And then I stayed on after the magazine moved to London and I worked for Bugged Out. So then I was only at the magazine for like, I can't remember, a year maybe, a bit longer. And then I've worked at Bugged Out since 2000. So a while. Why did the magazine move to London? The magazine moved to London because we sold it. So basically, yeah, we've been running for seven years up in Manchester. And it kind of just got to a natural, we hit a natural brick wall, really, where it was still bimonthly. We didn't have the funds to make it a monthly. We didn't have the funds to really employ enough staff to sort of take it where it should be. You know, we used to sort of work all night regularly back then. And, you know, seven o'clock in the morning, taking it to the printers on the deadline. So it just got quite a strain. And someone looked at our accounts at Companies House and was interested in buying it. Probably just the right time because we were quite frazzled by that point because we were doing bugged out every week and trying to run this magazine as well with a shoestring staff. So when did the relationship with Cream Nation come to an end? In 2002, I think Cream actually left Nation. Cream kind of ended as a Saturday night club. we carried on a little bit with the same venue um but unfortunately cream when they ended there they ripped their sound system out or the sound system got sold so just the club was just never quite the same and it was a sort of a slow natural decline after that so we're like right that's obviously the end of that era at the time we were also living in london we had been for a couple of years so um it just felt time to really focus on the city were living in um sure maybe you could talk about the um you know in terms of a london home is eventually you guys ended up with the end yeah the end was I can't remember the years that we were at the end. 2002. 2002 till... 2009. 2009. And that was amazing. That was like, I think for me that will always be our proper home because the venue and all the people that work there were like a family as well. Not to say that all of the other places that we do bugged out isn't amazing, but it's great to have a residency where you live and it's a... to be for such a long time. Yeah, I mean, did you feel like you pretty much had free reign and you could kind of push on things and push boundaries a little bit? I mean, did you feel like you could kind of present anybody? I think the end year was kind of a real change for us because it was 2002 and it was, Electro Clash was happening around that time and there's a real big shift in music. It almost felt like starting again really. You could look at a bug that fly from a year previous to a one in 2003 and there's a whole new raft of DJs. Errol Elkin was our resident in room two. Quite funny really to think he was a resident in a room that held 250 every month for a few years but he really made that his own. And yeah, there's people like Tiga, Miss Kitten, Yvonne Smagg, Ewan Pearson, Damien Lazarus. Boys Noise. Yeah, Boys Noise later on as well. Yeah, it was a whole new kind of era for us, really. And it was really enjoyable, I think, after going for so long to sort of have this massive breath of fresh air happen. Even just personally, I think I was a bit bored with the way things were going. and suddenly wham, you know, a whole new outlook on things. When did some of these artists start popping up on your radar? December 2001 was when Miss Kitten played first and she was kind of mind-blowing, all dressed from head to toe in leather. Yeah, just the whole performance wasn't anything like what we were used to from a DJ. So it was kind of 2000, 2001, it was bubbling under. I think we really almost completely changed what we were about a year later. So, yeah, it really was kind of spring clean. I mean, did you almost take a conscious decision to undertake this upheaval in a way? Did you feel like things needed to be shaken up? Yeah, I mean, I think for a start, we were just going to all the clubs where, you know, you could hear that music, you know, Trash on a Monday where Errol played. There's quite a lot of East End parties where you'd hear people like Yvonne Smag, but only playing to a couple of hundred people. And we just very, we adopted them just very early on. And you want to go to your own club and like what you're going to and not go like, I've But it did have quite a detrimental effect on us as well because Liverpool were still running at the same time and we tried to enforce our new love of this music on Bug Day in Liverpool and it being such a huge club. kind of fell on deaf ears a little bit and also it was such a London thing I think to begin with so to be honest we killed Liverpool off but you know not I think we had to cancel last night because it had sold so badly and if you look at the lineup now it was like a who's who of what's what's quite big at the moment so yeah it was definitely a neat new beginning but that's that because we used to have in Liverpool the courtyard kids who would always go to the courtyard where it was the techno room. So they thought that we'd moved to London and got fancy electroclash. Do you think in their minds there was a bit of a geographical bias or something you were putting on it, kind of like wanting to say, oh no, that's London stuff? Yeah, it was very North-South divide stuff, definitely. And also I think a lot of the artists only really played in it. London because it was such a global thing. It was very Berlin, New York. The artists didn't just come from Europe and just play in Europe. So I think they kind of ignored the North a little bit as well. How do you sort of reflect on that time musically? I think it's kind of sad slash interesting that when Electro Cash does... get brought up these days that are kind of met with sneers in a way you know it's like oh that was you know very of its time but you know someone who was pushing that music or as a group who were pushing that music but yeah how do you feel about it in retrospect kind of thing I don't know I know the kind of electro class you mean which is I guess the sort of very robotic sounding 80s pop song type stuff But I think it evolved very quickly into Electro House with people like T. Schwartz and like Strobe. And even people like Ricardo Villalobos came kind of through that new era because techno was very intertwined with it as well. So it wasn't really just about the robot voice stuff. It was just like a new ushering in of... People like Ellen Alien and, yeah, it was a whole new world of people sort of came through that door, I think. So he was, we mentioned him earlier, but a DJ that I would still very much associate with Bogdano, Zerl Alkin. When did you guys first cross paths? That was Jockey Slut again. I went to interview him about Trash. in his bedroom in 2000, 2000 I think, and we hit it off, we became quite good friends. I weirdly went round to his to make a tape for that band The Avalanches, of new music, so based in Australia, and back then you used to put stuff on a CD and put it in a post and actually send it to someone the old fashioned way, so... I think we were doing that and while we were putting this mix together for them, Errol started playing loads of dance stuff that I didn't associate with him. And David Holmes, who was our resident at Fabric at the time, because we were at Fabric for two years. He pulled out that Friday and I just sort of said to her, why don't you fill in? If you can play this kind of music, forget your indie stuff, just play all this stuff and you'll go down really well, I think, which he did that following Friday. And I think he went down so well with such a breath of fresh air with the way he looked, you know, and the kind of way he put records together. It was so different. but the girls absolutely loved it. No one really knew who he was. They were just like, what's going on in this room? He was in room three, in the small room. And we offered him a residency on the spot. I think David Holmes. lost out after not turning up that night so i mean when you say kind of put records together differently like what what do you mean well he was still doing bootleg sort of stuff at the time so he's playing you know pop music as well as electro stuff and house music and it was just uh but also he looked like one of the ramones at the time so everyone else looks a bit like john digweed and more nice jumpers and so it's kind of quite refreshing to have someone that looked quite punky and looked like he was really enjoying himself for once. Yeah, and how he used to, like, he'd stand on the decks and you'd see him, like, striding across stuff and drinking out of a bottle, which sounds really tacky now, but... And you just see so many DJs since then try and copy him. And he was like the original person that would be like swinging from stuff and then he'd like fall down to the floor and press play and it would all just come together really well. And I always remember that about Errol when I first used to watch him. Do you think that's sort of symptomatic of coming from a more kind of rock-based background? Yeah, me. but he was just really natural about it. It wasn't like his tried thing that he was trying to make people like him or show off. It just came naturally to him. I think I've read interviews with him where he said that he'd be putting all this stuff together and mixing all these things in and then he'd have no idea what was going on and he'd just press play and it would work. And I just think that's a really amazing thing. That's why I think I'll always love Errol. I think in addition to Errol, it seems like these artists, or there have been artists down the years who have come to be very closely associated with you, whether or not they've been residents. I'm thinking people like Tiga that you mentioned, Miss Kitten, Dave Clark, Green Velvet. Have you actively looked to cultivate such relationships or do you think it's just kind of been a natural byproduct of doing it for as long as you have? I think in the early days, people like Dave Clark and Greenville were very closely associated with the magazine as well. So we would be interviewing them every three months, booking them to play every three months and then partying with them at the after parties every few months. So that's where they sort of. friendships sort of came from. Miss Kitten was the same. I think we interviewed her first and then five years later we brought her and it's like, oh, do you remember we did that interview? And it's very much kind of like that. So, and obviously it's such a social thing, isn't it? Sort of going to a club. So you're naturally hanging out with people. having dinner with them beforehand, having a drink with them afterwards. So, yeah, friendships do come out of it. Just to kind of bring things up to the present day, I wondered when did Bugged Out kind of start to become more of like the malleable? kind of modern day entity that we know it, you know, where it means many, many different things. And, you know, you have many different. facets of what you do? I think that's partly because The End closed in 2009 so we became wandering minstrels after that to an extent and we also sort of found there's quite a change in the scene in terms of it became a lot more about the DJs perhaps than the club night itself so we'd work more closely with the DJs to sort of put together a club night with them as opposed to just booking them and telling them what time to turn up so that was quite a big change then also the weekend really opened out what we're about as well. In terms of the here and now, what does the range of your operation look like? What do you have involvement with at the moment? We've got the weekend looming. The third instalment happens in Southport in a couple of weeks from now. So that's our flagship event. we still have our stage at Field Day, which we love doing every year. And then, yeah, we've just got a myriad of club nights coming up, everything from an audience live show to another boys' noise show to Andrew Weatherall playing for us again in March. You know, he's been playing for us since 1995. So, yeah, we're very busy. And our 20th birthday parties. Yes, of course. Just before we move on to talk about them, so where do you fit into this in present? Like, how would you describe your role, Sian? I've always done bugged out, but mostly at the minute. All of my time is taken up with the weekender. I think, you know, we start so early on it, as soon as the last one's, as soon as one's finished, we'll have a little bit of time off and then start on the next one for the next year. That is generally what I am spending every day, weekend, evening, planning to make it amazing for everybody. We've still got very much that magazine way of looking at things. So, you know, when we did the magazine, we didn't just like techno. We liked drum and bass and we liked house music and we liked all the little weird mutations of everything. That's kind of... The way we still approach bugged out, to be honest. And so it's great to do the weekender because, yeah, there's like six rooms to book over the whole weekend. It means you can book people that you wouldn't normally book into, say, a London club night. And yeah, 20 years of bugged out, there's a lot of people that have passed through the doors that you might not be able to look at, like, book. all the time so this has been really great to reflect that hasn't it we've got people that have played from the beginning to people that we've only been booking for the last couple of years. So hopefully it's a really great reflection of our history. What was behind the decision to change location this year? A few things. It was the date more than anything, wasn't it? Because doing a festival on the third weekend in January is a bit like club promoting suicide, even though it was really great and really successful. And also like our history is in the north, like the event Southport is an amazing venue. It's got a huge history. The rave rooms are brilliant. We were just there last week. It's really exciting that we're going to be there for the festival soon. But yeah. And there was some, just to kind of go back slightly, you actually threw Weekender back in 2000, didn't you? Yeah. I heard that, well, on paper the line-up was incredible, but it didn't go so well, right? No, it was a bit of a disaster attendance-wise, but it was kind of, looking back at it, we rushed it and it was very difficult to sort of... promote things back then. You can only promote with advertising in magazines, with posters, with flyers. And there's no Twitter or Facebook, so you couldn't... There was the internet, but people didn't use it in the way that they do now. So, yeah, I think the main problem was with this brilliant line-up and no one really knew about it. And there's a few other things as well. Kind of funny that it's going on at the moment. There's flooding all over the country. It was like a nine-hour train ride to get from London to the Weekender, for example. It wasn't like the train line down as well. So, yeah, everything was against us a little bit. Sorry, I was going to say, who did you book that year? Underworld represent Chemical Brothers, Carl Craig, Harvey, Dave Clark, you know, Richie Horton, kind of everyone. So by, yeah, to do a standard sum, pretty good. Yeah. So sort of in that time, would you say that your approach to curation has changed very much? Is the way that you... sort of approach things kind of differ from back then? No, I think it's always been a mixture of, you know, bugged out stalwarts who we love, like Kyle Craig's playing this weekend or as is Andrew Weatherill, they were both at that one. But we always like to have, you know, new acts on as well. Like we've just booked 10 walls for the weekend, for example. Back then, there would have been an act on the bill that was literally really buzzy. So I think it's always good to get that mixture of history with brand new things. Like Todd Turd, he's playing at the Weekender and his album's just about to drop, so that's really exciting. It sort of actually nicely leads on to the next question. Do you, after 20 years of doing this, keep yourself fresh and interested? It's down to the music, isn't it? And down to the audience. But it is generally sort of hearing a brilliant record like Inspector Norse by Todd Turge, it makes you go like, right, yeah, of course, this is why I'm doing this, you know. or Gotham by Tam Wolves or you know it is about the music at the end of the day at the moment it's particularly fruitful and that's why dance music is so buoyant right now. That's why when I look at the weekend, the line-up, me and Charlotte said the other day, you know, we have a blank slate when we start the next one and you're like, what are we going to book for next year? We've just had a great line-up and then, you know, after a few months it all comes together because the music keeps coming out. Suddenly you're like, wow, it's exciting again. So you're actually marking the birthday around the end of the year. Do you know how you're going to be celebrating at this point? Yeah, it's going to be a big event in London, a big event in Manchester, and also quite a special event in London as well, which will be quite intimate, but I think will catch everyone's attention. I just wanted to finish up by asking you about what's become kind of something of a London tradition with the New Year's Day party. The reason I bring it up is because I've attended it a few times myself and it's kind of a definitely a thing among my friend group but uh each year it seems like it's going to be the last one and um that never quite proves to be the point i was wondering like what i mean firstly what's the sort of history of you doing the old queen's head and um secondly what's up with the uh yeah the retirement yeah um well we started doing We started doing the pub, it was actually the social in Islington in 2001 and New Year's Day evolved out of that. Weirdly in London no one did anything on New Year's Day so even people like Rob Hose from Mother Over or Fabric Light, they'd all come down to this pub almost to unwind and that's kind of why we did it. We'd do a New Year's Eve party and then stay up. all day in the pub playing pop records. It was very much an after party, but it was very much a fun thing. And it moved to the Old Queen's Head in 2006 and kind of became a lot bigger than I think. But the only reason we stopped it in 2011 is because, I don't know, I think... when you do something for so long you almost think like maybe it's time to sort of pause this but we missed it straight away and we saw a year elapsed and people started asking you know why we stopped it and we're like yeah why did we so we're carrying on you
