Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Marcus Intellex, who's also known as Trevino. The man born Marcus K has the rare distinction of leaving a mark on both drum and bass and techno. He pioneered drum and bass in England's north, throwing parties in shady venues where calls for a rewind were often accompanied by blasts from a sawn-off shotgun. But these days, he's producing sleek, minimal techno as Trevino. Speaking to him in R.A.'s Berlin office, it was clear that experiencing both sides of the coin has given him a candid take on dance music, one that's kept him going in the game for over 20 years now. As always, you can find our full archive of... exchanges at residentadvisor.net or follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Marcus Intellex is up next. From the Manchester region, I'm from a small town. 20 miles north of Manchester called Burnley. 80,000 inhabitants approximately. It was actually in the late 80s, which is basically when I was growing up and becoming a teenager, it was actually the fastest decreasing populated town in the whole of the UK. Why was that happening? It was a bit grim, a bit poor. It was an old... town based on cotton industry way back in the early 1900s and obviously when that dried up it never totally got itself back on its feet. It's a warm, friendly place but in terms of culture and if you're... I guess most people who maybe go to university or whatever don't necessarily want to go back there. There's not, in terms of industry or basically business or anything, there's not a great deal going on there, you know what I mean? It's famous for its football club more than anything else, you know what I mean? And it had a couple of pretty good nightclubs in the late 80s and early 90s. people traveled from which I was involved in at the time actually. It's quite a hotbed just at the beginning of the rave scene around 1990 it kind of kicked off in another town called Blackburn, which is eight miles north of Burnley. And the guys from Blackburn were, from what I hear, they were all like an organised crime gang, but they were really organised and they put rave parties on. People from Manchester would probably go to Blackburn parties before they would go to ones in Manchester. It was 25 miles away, like I say, and it was... The maddest days, probably the craziest days of my life, just witnessing from nothing happening in the late 80s, it's been nothing, to within three years there being 10,000 people turning up outside a nightclub trying to find this party. And obviously it's way before emails, mobile phones, the whole thing. Just 3,000 or 4,000 cars turn up in an area at 2 o'clock in the morning and we all go searching for this party. Things like that and mix that in with me experiencing the Hacienda in Manchester. Completely changed my life. I wanted to be an accountant. Ended up being a DJ. Just because of that. So, like, when you were talking about nothing's going on until the end of the 80s, was there literally nothing going on, quote-unquote, in that city? The ridiculous thing is it was the opposite. It was violence. It was football violence. Burnley and Blackburn, the two towns hated each other. They were eight miles apart. You couldn't go... In fact, I went to Blackburn on a day out with some friends shopping. I shouldn't have gone. You just shouldn't go to the other town because if you get recognised as you're from Burnley, you'll get beat up. And we got chased out of town, literally. You could not go into somebody else's town if you looked. If you're in your sort of late teens, early twenties, you were quite dressy into the football kind of, if you're a football fan or if you're into that football fashions and stuff, you would just get seen as a rival fan and get the shit beaten out of you if you got caught or you just end up fighting basically. And so that sort of thing dropped off after Rave hit? Yeah, it's the same people. The same people just started taking ecstasy. and all joining in this completely different feeling where people wanted to talk to each other, sort of, you know, celebrate the scene, celebrate the fact that they were all doing something that was brand new and exciting. And even though there was realistically still a rival over there, at the weekend, if you're in the same club, you were from different towns, it had no, it didn't matter whatsoever. In fact, I do remember there was one guy that we all knew who had a reputation for using knives when it was a football fight in. And there was one guy from Burnley who got knifed in the same club as by the guy who knifed him. And they ended up talking to each other. which is just pretty crazy because that would have never happened three or four years previous. And that's a real extreme, but it did completely change the whole social aspect of clubbing and not necessarily football. It never really died down, but it was starting to die down anyway. That just kind of helped it really sort of change quite dramatically because it was the same people, realistically. That's really interesting. Like, obviously, that period of dance music history gets trawled over quite often and it's kind of, you know, in a glass cabinet, like, ultimate period. Yeah. But that kind of social effect is really kind of crazy and almost like a bigger deal than the music itself. To an extent, yeah. The way it just changed society completely. These people just growing up, basically everybody gave up what they were doing to go raving. Just the impacts of people going to the bar to have a few drinks, that kind of stopped. I imagine the traditional nightclubs lost a lot of money in terms of there's people drinking less alcohol, stuff like that. Everything changed. There's just the general... The weekend went on longer. You know, just, you know, in fact, the weekend never stopped for a lot of people. You know what I mean? It really, I guess it brought drugs more into the limelight than there'd ever been. or had been probably since the 60s, you know what I mean? It was just so exciting and it was all, I think half of it was the illegal side of it and people were breaking into warehouses and probably some of the most exciting things for me were actually trying to find the venue, just being with these thousands and thousands of people trying to do the same thing, police trying to court... cut you off and put roadblocks up and sometimes there's ended up being fights with the police and police cars getting turned over and stuff, which, you know, not necessarily condoning that, but just to witness it all, it completely changed my life forever. As well as the music, it's the actual way of life. There was nothing before to suggest it had been done before almost. Maybe it had. Manchester and the surrounding areas and also other big industrial cities in the north have pretty solid music histories, not just electronic music, or whether it's guitar bands or avant-garde music. The grey place is the grim. Entertainment's massive there. I guess that's part of it. The less money there is there, the less sunshine, the less beaches to go to, whatever, people still want to release and they find it through different things. I think that's the reason why UK musically is a great place because it is quite grey and a bit grim. For you personally, before Rave hit, did you have a sense of that kind of pride in the history and cultural output of your area? I was into everything from Manchester. I was into... I kind of bought most of Factory records, most of the records, or not most of them, but I probably had a record from each artist that appeared on Factory. I was a massive admirer of what Tony Wilson was doing, really wanted to meet him, you know, and just really sort of struck by what he did for music in Manchester. And the pride that he had, you know what I mean, and the pride of the North, he had a regular weekly Sunday night television program called... Shit, it's going to go now. I should remember it as well. It's pretty bad that neither of us can. Yeah, but just the pride he had with it and the way the first time I'd seen Storm Roses was on there, live on TV. I went to see them five or six times after I'd seen them. So Matt Hacienda, just the way they owned the club, the story of New Order, the story of Joy Division, which led me into other things from Manchester. It got to a point where that's all I listened to for a long time, just music from Manchester, because that's all I think I needed at the time. I think that stemmed from my love of the sound of synthesised pop music, like Depeche Mode, and I'm a really big fan of what Vince Clark was doing a few years before. That kind of led me to New Order, and then from being really into New Order, like pretty much owning every single record of theirs, and going to the Hacienda a couple of times, that sort of then... progressed through to being into American house music and, you know, and the sounds of techno, really. Yeah, sure. Something I was interested about asking with Hacienda, you know, it's cool to ask someone who's actually been there, is how diverse were the styles of music being played, like, within a single DJ set? Was it quite... No! The first time I ever went, it's quite interesting. I went to see New Order. I think I was either 15 or 16. I was shitting it. I didn't think I was going to get in. First time I went in the bar was that day. We went into the bar before I went to the club. I had a couple of drinks. I felt a bit more like I was ready to get in, but I was still really worried about not getting in because we bought this ticket and I wanted to see what Hacienda is. Literally from walking in there and what walked into a factory or a warehouse. was just really stylish. That was instantly a mind-blower. It's like, you know, I'd never been to a nightclub before and to walk into there, I just think, what the fuck's this? You know, madness. Just, you know, just really, real design behind it. Coming from Burnley, I'd never really seen anything like it, obviously. It was there to see New Order and the gig was okay. It wasn't great. I couldn't see. I was only a little short arsed and everybody stood up and it wasn't the best venue to actually see unless you're on the tops but it couldn't get anywhere near the front of the tops because it was so busy. So I didn't get to see much, just, you know, just tried to enjoy the music but... The catalyst was when the band finished, some music come on and it was electronic music. It was the early Sounds of House music mixed in with, I remember him playing a Mantronics track. I had no idea where the music was coming from, obviously the speakers, but I had no idea where the DJ was. You just couldn't see what was going on or anything and there was nobody on. on the mic saying anything. It was just continuously mixed music, which I was just like, what the fuck? I've heard music on the radio. People talk. People introduce music. Wherever you go, people introduce music. At the time, DJs had a microphone. They said, this is what this is. None of that. A, to not find a DJ. B, not to hear him. and see only to hear music I'd never heard before which was amazing that was it I was just like I need to know more about this I'm really interested in it um so that really that was the if there was one moment that was pretty much it just like right I want to be I want to get more into this coming from from Burnley I still lived in Burnley at the time The only radio I had was BBC Radio 1 and I think it was maybe Geoff Young's show had just started. He was that person before Pete Tong. That dance show had just about started so I'd been introduced to little bits of it but I didn't know much about it. I think Jack Your Body... Steve Silk Hurley had been to number one out of nowhere. And that was like the really beginning of consciousness of house music for me anyway. I was interested in it because I read another thing where you're talking about seeing Groove Rider in like 91, 92. Yeah. which is obviously a little bit before Jungle Drum Bass. But you said something like he was playing really pitched up, strictly rhythm records and really noisy Belgian stuff. It wasn't pitched up. It was all the same tempo back then. It was between 120 and 130, the fastest really, just in the early 90s. It's probably maybe just touching over 130. So I guess they were slightly pitched up. It was just the best of everything. Some of the Street Revision stuff, it wasn't like the obvious stuff. It was some of the really deep stuff. You know this idea that a couple of years before a genre really hits, like house or drum and bass or something, there's DJs who are playing lots of different styles which accumulate. in the kind of seeming like what that thing eventually becomes. It creates it, yeah. Yeah. You get people who recognise DJs for the music they're playing, which is the most important thing for any DJ, is the music they're playing. For me, anyway, you know what I mean? They might be the best mixers, they might be the trickiest. but it's all about the music. You can be the best DJ in the world technically, but if you're not playing the right music, I'm not interested. And I think that's what DJ culture has almost always been about and scenes have started because people have hooked onto DJs who've got this music that you haven't got. and especially producers who go out to hear these DJs, get inspired by it, and they go back in the studio to make something they've just been inspired by, and it's just this mad knock-on effect that I guess over time turned... techno house and techno into drum and bass it's just the way it develops you know what I mean and people I guess Shut Up and Dance were almost doing it before I'd heard it but it was a breakbeat and an old school riff you know what I mean And that was the exciting thing about it. It didn't just have to be a 4-4 beat that did it. And it was a bit rougher, a bit homemade, you know what I mean? What's excited me in the early 90s was the music coming out of London, a lot of it white label stuff. You know, no idea what it was. But it was all inspired by people being into the same kind of DJs. And the London sound was so much different to what it was up the north. I I felt like I was on my own at times, especially when I was still sort of doing the Blackburn parties and the parties in Burnley and stuff. I was going more in that direction. I was just pulled by it where everybody else, literally everybody else, just wanted to hear Italian house music, hands in air. vocals, you know, there was always that north-south split. Got past the Midlands, got to Coventry, Birmingham, and they were sort of connected to what was going on in the south. But as soon as you got up north, it was a bit commercial, a bit cheesier, really. It started happening in the Hacienda as well. I only really remember the Hacienda being good up until about 1991. And then some of the DJs changed and the music policy started to get a bit... Graham Park was starting to play a lot more sort of the US sound, sort of the real vocally stuff. And the North went with it almost, you know what I mean? It just got happier and more commercial. People used to come up to me asking for E-tunes. Have you got any E-tunes? I was like, what are they? You know what I mean? Because they didn't have any effect on me, you know what I mean? It's just too much. It's too happy, you know what I mean? I don't transcend towards happy music. I really struggle to get into happy music. And and the more progressive sounds of London, they were trying different things, you know what I mean? It just appealed to me far more. So is that why you started doing your own parties initially? Yeah, I mean, I started the Friday nights in a place called Angels in Burnley. It went from having nobody in to having coach lords of people around from Scotland all over the UK. It was sell out. I think the capacity was like 600, but we had 1,100 in there every Friday for like two or three years. And the music started to change. That was the same time when it was just leaving the sounds of the Belgium sounds and it was getting more UK and the breakbeats were coming in more and more. And it did slowly peter out because people didn't want that. It become too rough for them. It become too... No, just a bit too nasty in a way, because the music was a bit nasty and really rough. I was excited by it, but you could see that the demand for it was really slacking off. The other DJ I started the night with, he went more in a commercial thing. He decided to move to Saturdays so we could separate Sonic away the two nights. and the Saturdays just went bombastic. It was massive because it was just commercial as hell. He played the same fucking records for 16 years, pretty much, you know what I mean? It's ridiculous, you know what I mean? In the same order, you know what I mean? And... But that's what people wanted, you know what I mean? So it's almost like we're fighting against something you just couldn't stop. And Manchester really suffered in the same way because that music attracted a clientele the clubs didn't want. You know, people from the surrounding areas. There was a lot of trouble in the clubs for a start. There's people bringing guns in there and stuff. So the club owners didn't want it. So the actual sound completely died in Manchester. And the North, and I was working in a record shop. Eastern Block. Yeah, before Eastern Block, a place called Spinning. Oh, right. Well, that's basically all we sold. The new jungle sound sort of reinforced, all that kind of stuff, suburban bass, everything. And we were selling shitloads of it. A title we could get 100 in, it would go in a week. We were selling loads of it. So the demand for the nights are there. just couldn't get anything together. It was just really difficult to put nights together because clubs just didn't want it because of the fear of the type of people that would come there and the trouble that might bring in. And it was, it was rough, it was dangerous. So you can kind of appreciate where they were coming from. But as a DJ, it was impossible. I just had no gigs for about three or four years because it was... You know, because, you know, especially in Manchester, people wanted it in Manchester, not necessarily in Burnley, but they wanted it in Manchester. It was a good scene for it. In theory, I just couldn't get it off the ground. It took years to really try and get something going. You're pretty frank in admitting that it was part of the clientele that was going on these things. How did it feel from your side being a promoter and a DJ and having that negatively affecting, bringing in authorities and stuff like that? You just get on with it. When it's out of your control, it's out of your control. You'd see other people that you knew weren't really good DJs, but because they're playing different music, they had loads of gigs. From the feedback I always got, everybody's like, you should be doing this, you should be doing that. I'm like, well, I can't because there's nobody. playing this music and this is all I want to play. I don't want to play something I'm not into and I've always been like that. If I'm not into it, I'm not playing it. It's just a desire to play your favourite records to people. That, to me, is what DJing's about. You know what I mean? Some people would just do whatever to get gigs and I was like, no, we'll just wait it out. We'll sit and wait it out. And I guess when the jungle thing really happened in the sort of 93, 94, it really moved into the ghettos. Rather than the ghettos coming into town, we went into the ghettos. And there was clubs in them places that were just open regardless. They just wanted the business. I remember people walking past with sawn-off shotguns and the thing there was a place called The Lighthouse. It was so exciting but at the same time scary as hell. If some people wanted to rewind, they'd just pull the trigger. It's just nuts. And there was a label called Sound of the Underground Recording, some London guy. who'd come up I think they brought it's just they put the Shy FX record out that was massive the one with Apache Indian sort of the ridiculously super fast vocal thing and they come up to do a night at that venue and they were just all hidden around the back just scared to death what was that? And we'd got used to it by then. The first time you hear it, you're sort of, what the fuck? But then it just became a regular thing and people who'd never witnessed it before were just scared, obviously scared for their lives. It was just this mad place. If I look at it now, I didn't even live in Manchester at the time so I had to catch a bus from Burnley to go and play in this place and then stay in the studio because of the studio in Manchester. Me and my friend XTC, we were partners and we played together. Is that Mark McKinley? Mark McKinley, yeah. We worked in the shops together. That's how we become partners. We made a couple of tracks together. We were DJ partners for a long time and we played together in this venue in Manchester. And it was one of the first real jungle events. It was in the city, one of the first real ones. And it was rammed. We played quite early. I think we were finished by 11.30 or something. We stayed around for another 15, 20 minutes and it just felt like it was going to go off. It was really, really moody. So we left. We walked up out the car park onto the street, sort of got on the pavement, walked past the car and then a car come. spurting around the corner and it was a fucking drive-by. We'd just walked past some guys and I'm just like, they look moody as fuck. That's what I said to my mate. Literally within two seconds, there's a car come round the window down and somebody's shooting at a thing. We're ducking behind a car. It's just like, do we really need to be doing this? You know what I mean? For the music we love. And the answer is yes, because there's no other options. If you love that music and you want to hear it, you want to play it out. This is what we had to put up with in Manchester for a long time. Some of the London DJs wouldn't come and play. It was moody. I ended up promoting in the city for... six or seven years and you won some, you lost some, but most of the time you lost because nobody wanted to pay in. So there'd be a gang of 50 people just walk up and walk through the door. Nobody could do anything. There was knifings in the club. There was all kinds of things. It was ridiculously moody. But a lot of people tell me they miss it. They just miss the excitement of it. There's a real, real vibe in there. It's on fire. It's dangerous as hell. But if you kept yourself to yourself, you weren't looking for any trouble. You'd be okay to an extent. You've got to know how to play it and it's not like you know what you're doing. But the good thing for us at the time was we were playing for the mean guys, the mean sort of... trims, if you will, you know? So we were looked after to an extent. Right. Pretty crazy shit. Yeah. So you're implying that like the, the clientele at the club would like know who you guys are and respect you as DJs. And then there'd be some form of like protection. Well, I guess so. Yeah. Yeah. You know, we were never given any shit. There were stories about people in there with bulletproof vests on and all kinds of things. You know, definitely, I've seen a good few people waving sawing off shotguns and just dancing to the music, waving a sawing off around. Do you know what I mean? That was the 90s in Manchester. It was crazy. It was pretty wild. And, you know... If somebody asked me to do it now, I might not. But at the time, it was all about the music. The music was the only thing that was important. And I'd been into pushing this music that wasn't getting me any gigs for four or five years. Now I'm getting gigs. Am I going to turn them down? No, I'm not. This is how we develop a scene. And it did develop from there. You know, Manchester's got a great history for lovely music and way before... I saw a video of a friend of mine who used to come in a record shop in Eastern Block, used to buy records, a video of him dancing in this club three or four years before De Hacienda got going. dancing to Adonis and stuff like that. It's a fantastic video. I watch it quite a lot. It's quite inspirational. Just the fact that Ascienda gets the credit, but in fact some of these ghetto clubs are just on it completely, playing black music, black-only music for pretty much a black-only audience. But they were fucking miles ahead. It's incredible. I've always worked in shops, pretty much a black music store we're working, we're selling hip-hop, we're selling R&B, you know what I mean? It's quite interesting watching the guys come in who were the Saw and Hip Hop DJs react to Jungle. They're saying they've heard it all before. It's just all music sped up, you know what I mean? Reggae and stuff, you know what I mean? We're just like, no, you're too old. You know what I mean? Just having fun with them. So it's just the way you can see music cycling. like first hand and now, you know, certain music fashions come back in when I was sort of getting into it almost, you know, and it's quite interesting. So working at those stores, did that give, in what sense was that like an education for learning about the music industry, like how labels work, how distribution works, what people want to buy, how trends change and stuff like that? Yeah, it's just knowledge coming in all the time. It's not like I'm there to... I didn't feel like I was ever there to learn, but I've just been one of them people that just instantly switches on. Just the way we could order. It's fantastic. It doesn't happen anymore. A guy would come in with a van and say, do you want this white label? And we'd play it and we're like, yeah, we'll have 100. And he's like, how many? It does And literally three or four days later, we're asking him for more. In terms of record shops, I used to love the way they were. It was only one record deck in the shop and you'd play a record and there'd be 20, 30 people in the shop. I'll have one of them. I'll have one of them. I'll have one of them. It doesn't happen like that anymore. It doesn't feel like it happens like that when I go record shopping anymore. That friendship doesn't seem to be there. It's like the people behind the counter and the people on the opposite side of the counter, the customers. There's more of a gap almost now, whereas I've got so many good friends from over the years who just used to come and buy records, you know what I mean? And you're meeting people who have the same love of you, the same love of music that you have, you know what I mean? Before I worked in shops, I used to just like going in there because I just wanted to hear what was coming out. I'd be on the record counter. I was the first person to hear these records sometimes. If you're in the record shop the most, you'd hear most of the new music because that's the first place you get to hear it. I remember being in Eastern Block with £15, which would probably buy me four records at the time. I stayed in there for... for two hours just loitering, waiting to hear something that blew me away. And I remember hearing Sugar Bear, Don't Scandalise Mine, an old sort of hip-hop classic. It was a big Hacienda tune. And I think at the same time it's when a recent Santonio, The Sound, come out. And I remember going home after being in a record shop for four hours with four records, and four records I just completely loved and cherished. Still got to this day, thankfully. Because this is around the time that you started your own labels and started putting out your own music and stuff. I just wondered whether... Well, that was a bit later, to be fair. So this is the thing where it's like the timeline of knowing when you were at these places. There's no information about that. No. I didn't put music out until 94. And that's kind of when the name started to develop. I worked in record shops until 97, actually owned our own shop. I think I was involved with that for about three months and decided I didn't want to do it anymore. At the time, around 97, we'd put a couple of things out. The first thing we put out with Flex, which is quite an interesting story because we met LW, who was one of them people who worked in a van and come into the record shop with his new records as a van distribution guy. And we knew he made music. So we'd agreed to go over to the studio with him in Huddersfield, which is about 45 an hour away in the car, to make a tune with him. We'd never done it before. So the day before we went to make a tune. What Arrived on the Doorstep, a brand new Mary J. Blige 12 into the record shop with an acapella on it. It's like, right, that's going to the studio. Just ridiculous things like that. And we made that tune in about four hours, which is pretty good for back in the day. Lee was really quick. we didn't know what we were doing, we were just pressing a few things and took the fork and we just made it work really, really easily. I remember saying to him, just change the bass line there, do that, and it was done and he added more breaks and just getting a bit more giddy almost or more jungly just so the breaks were all over the show. And it turned out that all I ever wanted from hearing, being in love with what Groover I would have done from 91 was to get a record in his record box. That's kind of what the idea was. That's all I ever wanted. Within two weeks he was playing that playing the track we made with our double on kissing It's the best record is there in two years, you know? And that if that wasn't enough to want to get in the studio more and try and build a career a bit then nothing ever would be you know, so For some people it might sound kind of insane that You described this as the first time you ever went into a studio. Did you have experience with the equipment and how to work a sample? No, nothing. He did. We didn't. He ended up being the engineer-struck music maker where we'd just come in with a few ideas, a few samples that he hasn't got. I remember having a little Korg 01W module or something and it had this string sound on it. And as soon as they heard that string sound, they went, we've got to make a tune with this string sound. And it was just a combination of the string sound, the breaks, the bass line, and the acapella. Tunes don't need much, realistically, just that little magic feeling where you're all like, if all three are just like, yeah, this is wicked, you know, you're onto something pretty much. I think that's one of the things over my career that I know, just knowing when something's good and not, you know what I mean? I think that's always, I never really sort of myself with being a technical expert on what I'm doing. It's just... Sometimes I think I know when I've got one and I haven't. Most of the time I'm ready to throw it out in the bin because I know it's not very good and that's just the way it is. Yeah, see, I think your knowledge, even though it was completely non-technical, could have been so much more important than someone who knew how to use everything. And that kind of flips the whole thing around. Absolutely. Perfect example is the guy I've become a partner with, ST Files, who is just one of the most gifted music makers I've ever known. He's sick, but he can't write. a tune he can't finish five minutes he really struggles to get five he'll send me two and a half minutes of a track and I was like that's done you've done the hard bit he could just he could never turn it into a track so he doesn't make much music in his mind his career never flourished as much as it should have done just a massive talent And if he did, I think drum and bass would be in a better place because he's sick. And as much as I've helped him over the years, he really couldn't help himself finish tracks. It was really a difficult thing for him where, as being somebody who DJs all the time, you just know what to do. You know what's needed. You know how to arrange it. And a lot of the time you don't. It doesn't matter that much. Don't let it be the main focal point. If the track's good, if you've got two and a half minutes of a good tune, make it work. I always had a desire to get on with things and never that technical, just like, right, it sounds like it's done. I've played it out. It's working. let's just let it go, get on to the next thing. The excitement is getting on to the next thing. The hardest thing if you keep thinking about how to finish a track is you probably might never finish it. You never think it's finished. You've just got to be able to move on. So I guess just by listening to music constantly in the record shop, DJing when you got home, you kind of knew how tunes should be put together. Even though it was, in that instance, the first time I went in the studio, it was done like that, literally. I think all three of us were all DJs. We all knew what we wanted out of it. Drum and bass is about a hit. You get the hit right when it drops, everything's right, and you can just roll it out and just keep changing a few things, keep it interesting. It's about the groove and how much it works. Once you've got that, you don't have to worry so much. I've never been one to focus on the minute details. Some people are great at it. I can't. I just hear the bigger picture of the track and try and get it finished. That's basically how I've always made music. You had to learn from somebody. So I learnt from somebody who went in the studio with L-Double. I learnt from L-Double and I also learnt from SD Fowl, so I learnt from L-Double. And if you keep going that route and everybody's learning the same methods, that could continue on forever. People learnt from me. The fact that there are different ways of doing it now and different ways of getting into it only makes it more interesting in terms of what can be made. I hear people complaining, like, well, we had to spend £3,000 on a sampler. We did, you know what I mean? But I don't have to now. It doesn't matter, you know? What's important is if there's good music out there and there's people playing it, that's the important thing and there's people trying different things. Otherwise all the music's going to sound the same. It just is, isn't it? Speaking of all the music sounding the same, I consider myself a fan of John Bass. Yeah. But being too young to have experienced any of it and not being in England... Yeah. ..means that the perspective on it is just completely different. Yeah. And, you know, as the 90s roll on into the 2000s and all these sub-genres start appearing, whether it's just because of critics coming up with them or whether they're real or not, you know, you've got tech step, autonomic, liquid. Yeah. So why do you think so many different tags and names got put on drum and bass specifically? I don't know. I don't know. I didn't make them names, but... It's never was important to me. In fact, it made it more difficult for somebody like me almost, you know what I mean? Because I wasn't part of that. I wasn't necessarily part of that. Or people would put me in the, I mean, the liquid bracket, you know what I mean? So, hey, we're doing a liquid event. I don't really play liquid, you know what I mean? So it just separated it for the crowd almost. You don't need to have a certain crowd going to listen to that and a certain crowd going to listen to that. Is it not better just to be able to hear a bit of everything? Put it in a way, in a context, that when it's time to hear that particular kind of sound, it gets played, and when it's not, it's time to hear the other one, or whatever, you can hear that. The breakdown of genres has made it... particularly difficult but I guess sometimes it's inevitable because scenes just go off in the wrong direction music goes off in the wrong direction you know I'm talking about me liking playing what I like I like 10% of drum and bass 90% of it I'm not into at all so I can turn up at gigs and I know nobody's going to like my music I just know that's for a fact you know what I mean sometimes I get given the martyr gig where we need to try something deep, you know what I mean? We need to try something that can sort of get our crowd that are into the shit stuff into the good stuff. Come on, Marcus, you can do it. I'm just like, no, I only get found out, I only find out about this gig when I actually turn up for the gig. I'm just like, as soon as I hear that, I'm just like, no, because it's quite painful, you know what I mean? It's just like You know you're going to struggle and you've only got certain records in your box because they're the records you like and I don't want to put anything in there just to please somebody. It doesn't work like that for me. I don't think I've had such a long career because I've been trying to please people. It's because I've tried to please myself and push something forward, something I believe in. And that's kind of worked on my behalf. But because of that, you do take a few gigs like that where it's just like, right, we need to try and change the sound of this club. It's just not a fun gig. It happens occasionally. So this big record you did with ST Files on 31 Records? Yeah. How you make me feel? Yeah. It's funny reading the Discogs comments on that one. That clearly had a pretty big effect on people. But was that one of these tracks which, you know, went on to... define these sub-genres that we're talking about? Is that kind of a track which pigeonholed you in a way or something? Yeah, people maybe call it the first liquid funk record, I don't know. It wasn't anything, we weren't intent, you never do intend to do anything when you make a tune. Again, that was another one that just fell into place so quickly, done in a night quite easily. I remember going back the second night to finish it off and thinking it doesn't really need anything. It was just a record that we were about. At the time, the music was quite hard. Ed Russian Optical, which was fantastic music, it was really progressive, it was amazing. I used to play a lot of that and Doinj and stuff like that and Fotech. It was all that, which was all incredible music. And then on the other side of it was the good-looking stuff, which again was incredible music, but was just almost like too far away from the other stuff, really, to all sit in. We didn't necessarily go in the studio to make a tune like that, but that's where our minds were at the time. I love the music side of it, but I like the energy side of it, and it's just trying to find that middle ground. It's almost like once we made that record, we found our sound. That track allowed us, because of the way it got received, it allowed us to have confidence enough to do exactly what we wanted to do, and then there was a sweet period for... a couple of years where whatever we did, it was just people considered it to be massive tracks. When I made that track, I had Groove Rado with the biggest label in drum and bass wanting it. Fabio wanted it for his label. Dot Scott wanted it for his label. Literally within two days, I had phone calls from all three of them. So it was like, well, we know we're getting somewhere here. We always had the intention of starting our label. But we kind of figured that the best way to do it would be to do three or four tracks with these labels, get you the profile you need for people to recognise the name, and then you can start your label. So I think the label started in 2001. Up until today, it's still been quite successful. It just felt like it was the right way to do it, just to build the profile, just to get your name, like a household name. before you start another venture that people, you know, people always say as soon as you meet, wow, we're going to start a label. It's like, I think the best thing to do for any artist is to get a profile. It's not hard to run a label. But there's no point doing it if nobody knows what your music's about. As far as an artist's concerned, you need to get that profile out there and people recognise what you're about before you actually start having grandeur plans of doing anything else. I would suggest concentrate on the music. It's the most important thing. And some people don't want to start a label and I respect that, so they can concentrate on the music. Some labels are better than others at promoting, which is more important almost than the money these days. And I've never run the label with the intention of it being the biggest thing. I've always run it by myself or with SD files at the time. Never really wanted to have to hire anybody, which would then suggest we'd have to put more music out, music we don't like. Didn't want to go down that road, you know what I mean? Just wanted to, if we hear something, we release it. Not necessarily sign artists. If they wanted to go elsewhere and do it, we'd just have a good time deal where we make sure everybody gets paid and We're releasing music, we'd buy ourselves, and that's kind of the only thing we ever thought. We don't ever want to have to put a track out to keep the money coming in or whatever. I've seen it happen to other labels, and it kind of waters down the actual sound, and it's never really been anything that has interested me at all. It's not a money thing, label, it's just a way of representing what you're into more than anything else. just it's another facet to what it's all about almost so with the solution parties was that do they exist before they were in fabric and was this all coming and this was like coming off the back of the label gaining steam or yeah it was it was all at the same i think the first solution part it was in 2001 we did it in I did it in Manchester. I got Marky to come and do me a favour. I'd played in Brazil a few times for Marky in the early 2000s. Probably, no, I might have only just done it for once with him at that time in Brazil. I did it for Peanuts. It was like 200 US dollars or something, but it was in Brazil. Hey, who cares? You know what I mean? So he agreed to come and play a gig for us for 100 quid in Manchester. And we'd probably turned about 300 people away that night. It was just before he got massive. We'd had a really good relationship with him anyway. Me and him were pretty friendly at the time. And we're just like, right, Mark is up for it. Let's just do a party. It was always something we wanted to do. And it defines what we're into. I'd been promoting in Manchester for seven or eight years before that. No, probably five or six years before that. And I felt like I was starting to put DJs on I didn't want to hear. Again, it's the same kind of principle. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to represent anything, anything at all, if I'm not into it, regardless of what the financial income might be. It just doesn't work like that. I don't want to feel like I'm a fraud. It's important to me for whatever reason, you know what I mean? So I stopped doing that. The guy I was if you want to carry on, you can carry on. It was doing well. I think the last party we did, it had like 1,500 people in there or something, but just hated it. Just hated the music. I was beginning to sort of dislike it. What was wrong with the music? Just the DJs that we'd booked were the popular DJs. I'm not going to name any names for obvious reasons. But like with the sound. They weren't playing the brand of drum and bass I was into. It was a successful event, but just the sound of it wasn't really what I was into. I didn't play anything like that. I didn't remotely like anything like that. so why should I represent it? So it was like a gap of about a year and a half. I'm like, right, this is perfect. The label's got, we've got a profile. The label's starting to get a profile. Mark is coming to play with us. We just got really friendly with Calibre. I'm just like, this is perfect. Let's just do it. I wanted somewhere so we could introduce Calibre to Manchester because out of all the... people I'd met through drum and bass and got close with, he to me was the most talented person in the whole of music I'd ever met and he didn't like DJing he was always really nervous and uncomfortable so I wanted to help him, A by helping him get his music out but B by putting him in an environment where he could play his music where he wouldn't feel as pressured as maybe some other places you know what I mean and that's Solution was a lot based on that, on being able to help him, but at the same time for us to have him and build something together because his music has always blown me away, always. So we're almost getting to the techno phase, almost, because that's like... mid to late 2000s you started dabbling with that did you maybe 2009 or 10 is i think 2010 might have been the first release so maybe i've always dabbled in it that was the thing but i i could never finish a track i could i've always done because i've always loved it even like working through the drum and bass times in the record shop in Easton, but we were next to the house counter, so I've always collected house music, I've always been interested in it, never sort of, it's never left my heart to an extent, there's always been certain techno records, well, gotta have that, you know what I mean, so I wouldn't buy many, I'd buy probably half a dozen a year, but half a dozen every year, right up until today, realistically, you know what I mean. So it was always there, but I always struggled to... I could easily write a four-bar loop, just easy, a 16-bar loop, whatever. That was the easy bit. The rest of it, I just couldn't do. Like I was saying about making drum and bass, I just couldn't, because I wasn't experienced enough in playing it at that time. I didn't feel like I could arrange it properly or the limitations of the software I was using, which was Logic at the time, just got me stuck in a rut and I couldn't get out of it. And it was a combination of hearing what was happening with the post-dubstep scene, which felt like the early 90s again a little bit. And me getting my head around Ableton, it just all fell into place just instantly. Just like, okay, this is how you do it. Because the way it works with Ableton, it doesn't work in the same arrangement method as you would with Logic. So I was actually just recording, having a go, just recording a groove for five minutes. And I'd finished loads of tunes that I knew were crap, but I was getting in the mindset of finishing them, just so when I had a good one, I'd be confident enough to say, right, let's get this finished. So for two or three years, when I started to learn Ableton, that was my main focus, was just to try and make some records that I used to love, the idea of the same sort of feeling of records that I used to love when I was growing up. Because inevitably, in your late teens, they're always the most exciting times of your life, almost. It was for me anyway, you know what I mean? So I just wanted to get that feeling back, almost. You've talked about learning how to produce it in a satisfying way and having various sorts of dissatisfaction with where Joe and Bass was going. But was there also an aspect of like meeting sort of people from the techno world, which helped like ease this process of moving over? Because, you know, you had a record on Martin's label and then on Apple Bloom's label and then Clock and stuff like that. You're not just running into them at drum and bass parties, am I right? I'd never met most of them. I'd only met Martin. I'd only ever met Martin. We put Martin's first record out. So in another way, I agreed to put Trevino's first record out with Martin. It just worked in that way. And we've got a funny relationship, me and Martin. Sometimes we get on well and other times we have a slight disagreement. I think we're both as stubborn as each other, which is, you know, I've not got a problem with that. It's quite an interesting relationship. But I liked what he'd done. He did it before me. He'd moved from drum and bass and sort of wisped his way through dubstep into this. techno world and I'd you know perhaps he was the catalyst in a way it's like fucking hell he's done it you know what I mean I'd like to do that you know so just having him as a point of reference for my music and saying what do you think of this what do you think of this and he'd be like yeah that's that that's good let's put this out you know what I mean that really helped enormously to be fair And I always send him everything first. And I think he got overwhelmed by the amount of music that all of a sudden got fired at him. I just loved it. I just really enjoyed being in the studio. For years, I hated going in the studio. So in mid-2000s, struggled for ideas. Logic just seemed to hold me back. Really struggled to make music for a long time. and just the way that the drum and bass was sort of floating in between sounds and wasn't necessarily grabbing me the way that it used to do, it was a bit of a difficult period, really. I still had plenty of gigs, and some of the gigs obviously were great. When I look back on it, it was Calibre almost that got me through, because... It was his music. He'd make 200 tracks a year, so I'd get plenty of his music. And then it was the things that got influence from Calibre in the mid-2000s that kept it going realistically. I wasn't looking for a way out, but I was looking for something that would give me a bit more inspiration. And I guess just the fact that I'd seen Martin do it and now I'd learnt how to use Ableton, it was just like, wham, I just want to be in the studio all the time, can't wait to get in there, just creating, creating. Because that's what Ableton does, it just allows you to create without actually thinking too much about the process of creation. It takes all that so you can just have fun, and it'd become fun. I just started to love making music again, probably for the first time, really, because after all these years, I think I started to think a bit more about how to do it, I had a bit more confidence. I've never been overly a confident person. You just get struck in situations, you just have to deal with them. I guess after all these years, you just... just understand a bit more about what you're doing and it's my chosen career path. So I've got to make the most of it. And all of a sudden I'm loving it. I'm just loving making it. So Martin just got given far too many tunes than what he could handle. A lot of them weren't that great to be fair and he was quite polite. Put it that way. I'd done this tune that I was just sure Ben Clott would like, and I know Martin had a connection. Martin really helped me out. Martin had a connection. I just said, do you mind if you give me his email? Him and Marcel Detman. That's another interesting, Marcel Detman's Resident Advisor mix in like 2007, 2008. It had this sound. slightly rough techno but not banging just reminded me again of the early 90s and that was really quite influential and with me saying right i'm back into this music and then um discovering shed things like that and shed for me was just like techno's dillinger almost just making these fucking records that were amazing. From 2007 onwards, I was just like, I've got to get into this. I've got to learn how to do this properly. So when I sent this record to Ben, I just felt like it would be a Ben and Marcel thing. I sent them both at the same time and literally Ben just got straight back to me saying, who the fuck are you and what's this track? Pretty much, can you send me some more? And I sent him a shitload more. He didn't like any of them. Just like, oh, no, here we go. So then the challenge was for me to make a Clockworks 12 because he wanted one track, but he needed two others. So for six months, I was just writing tech. I was like, I'm really... Because I don't think when I started it, it was necessarily techno that I was making. It was kind of in between post, dubstep, house. Detroit techno, but not really German sounding, you know what I mean? Nothing really, really minimal techno. So I'd have to kind of learn how to get my head around that, learn more about it, see if I liked it for a start, you know what I mean? Just... Discovering it properly, I just love the fact that it's the purest form of a really good groove. If you can nail a proper techno groove, it's the basic and the most pure form of a groove realistically, and that's what really got me into it. But I had to really work hard to try and find something that Ben would like. In the meantime, I'd made loads of tracks that he didn't like, so I'm still going through this process of just really enjoying it and I like the challenge. I'm going to fucking nail this if it kills me. And there must have been like 20 things with clock one, clock two, clock three, it went on for ages and he's like, no, no. But it didn't bother me. I actually thought it was quite fun, you know what I mean? I had this thing in my head like, I want to give him what he wants, but I don't want to give him what he wants. I want him to like something that I want to give him, you know what I mean? So I had to try and find this middle ground for ages. Managed to do it, but, you know, it's the same as me. I did it with some artists for my label your label to sound exactly how you want it to sound or you want to be able to say this is the best quality I can get out of this artist or whatever. Not to the same extent that I've done it with other artists. When I've signed a track, it's fucking amazing, but it's taken ages for a B-side or whatever because you just don't quite nail it. So I knew where I stood because I've done that to other people, but that just spurred me on. It's like I really want to be successful at this. I really want to be on that fucking label because it's a cool label and it's only had eight releases in ten years or whatever it It's a good look for me and I like all his records. I like everything that's on that label. So it just makes sense. So I just kept pounding away for ages. Was it the same thing with DJing in terms of when you started playing like... Sub 130 BPM, did you have a similar feeling of refreshment to playing records as you did to producing music? That's half the reason why I wanted to do it as well is I don't get nervous at drum and bass clubs. I don't necessarily... fear anything. It's all quite comfortable. It's a good thing. I'm confident. I do a good job mostly, you know. But I wanted to put myself back in a position where I go into gigs and I'm like, I'm nervous. I don't really know what to expect. When was the last time you felt nervous playing techno? When was the last time I played techno? You still get it. I like it. I'm still on edge. I've always found that the reason recently why drum and bass has been so comfortable is there's a small amount of music that I like. So in any given month, if there's anything more than 10 or 15 new tracks in my box in a month, that's a good month. when it comes to playing house and techno, and because it is house and techno, because I like it both, it can be ten times that, and I don't know what the fuck, I'm looking, what is this? I've got to practice all the time, not to practice so I'll know how to do it, so I know what the fuck they sound like. I've put them in that box for a reason. but I don't know what they sound like because there's so many of them, there's so much music. If I've had one thing struggle, it's that, it's knowing all the tunes. It's too much good music out there, it really is. Sometimes I think I have to say to myself, maybe I just need to... focus on one sound you know what I mean I think that's what people do to an extent but then I quite like it all you know what I mean it's it's yeah because you were saying with the drum and bass where it's like you know you've got your producers who you know you like sending you stuff and you're just kind of like sorted for looking for music yeah you know you've been doing the techno thing for a few years now yeah There aren't like any of those go-to producers who are just feeding you stuff and you're like... No, there aren't really, no. Interesting. Yeah. But I've not really put myself out there trying to find them. I've quite liked... Another thing I've quite liked, the idea of shopping or going online or walking to a record store. I don't... that many records, if I'm being totally honest. But just the idea of discovery, going out looking, trying to find your own sound almost, you know what I mean? And I think if you keep relying on certain people... you're going to end up sounding like them or somebody else who plays their records, you know what I mean? I do certainly have my favourite producers, you know what I mean? But I've not necessarily tried to get to know them that well or anything. Time's an issue as well. I spend so much time in the studio trying to make music and trying to do drum and bass and run the label. and have a girlfriend and, you know, live in Berlin or whatever and try and enjoy myself, it's actually quite difficult to find time to widen the circle almost, you know what I mean? The circle's almost big enough as it is, you know what I mean? It's... It's still a bit of a discovery for me in terms of I don't know what everything is. I just don't feel like I know half of it. It's quite strange. There's so much music. Every time you're like, well, I've never heard of this guy before. When you hear something, it's like, where's this guy come from? It turns out it's been going longer than you, Marcus. It's just, you know, I find it exciting. But I remember reading you saying that writing parts wasn't difficult at all. The aspect that was difficult was getting the sonic aspect right. Yeah, mixed downloads and stuff. Yeah. Again, I'm not... See, from like an outside perspective, you know, I'd assume that someone who's been making John Bass for years... their mix-down technique is going to be pretty solid as far as techno goes. So it was kind of surprising to read that a little bit. My mix-downs in drum and bass aren't very good. I'm not very good at it. A lot of it's trial and error. A lot of it's common sense in a way, in some forms, but then there's certain techniques that... I think in the last 10 years, levels have raised ridiculously in terms of production values. People have learnt a lot more, whether it's because there's more information out there or the way some software works or whatever. The levels of production have increased dramatically, whereas I think I could sit quite comfortably with everybody else 10 years ago. to an extent, not be the best, but be within that bracket. I think now it's a whole new ballgame. My ears aren't as good as, I'm not blaming my ears, but my ears are nowhere near as good. I don't have the, my ears haven't got the, yeah, but just the fatigue to get tired quick. My ears get tired quickly. Sometimes I just can't hear shit. I've just got to turn it off for a bit. But it's not that. It's, I'd never got taught it. I don't know the techniques. I learned off ST Fowl's and never got taught it, but was good at it. He did all the mix downs. I didn't do them. So when I had to do them for my own music, that was the biggest learning curve. I had to be, you know, I just had to keep going through trial and error and trying to work out how to do it. And now he hears my mix downs. He's like, how have you done everything's version 10, 7, 15, 30, you know what I mean? You've just got to keep doing it. Sometimes it feels like I haven't put a kick drum in there where there is one in there. You can't fucking hear it when you're having a mix between other tunes, you know what I mean? It just seems like no two tunes are the same. It's really hard to get something sounding good. You can't just instantly do it. A lot of the times I think I've cracked it and then I just basically have a mix and then I listen to my tune and I'm like, where's the bass? It's not there. There's no tops on this either, is there? No. In fact, the mid-range is not even coming through. It just feels like I don't know anything at times. So I just keep going and keep comparing it to others and try and get as close as possible just by comparing. And I'm probably not doing a lot of things right, but I've just got to get it in close. I just want to get it close, close enough to, as a DJ, you can play it. Because now it's like you can have a good idea, but if you haven't stacked up three claps on top of each other in parallel, compressed them and things like that, it's just not going to stand up against everything else you're playing. It seems that, yeah. As I say, I don't... I don't like doing that. I don't like putting sounds on top of each other and stuff. But, you know, it's all about the frequencies. It's getting the right frequencies to stand out and the wrong frequencies to disappear. And so they're not there. And some people met music or some people start a track with that in mind and I've never done that. I think, you know, the most important thing is a vibe and then you try and get the best out of that vibe you can. So I think probably I start tunes that are going to sound shit. They're never going to sound good, you know, just because of the sounds I've used with each other or whatever. Because of the mood of the track I want it to be and stuff like that. I sometimes overproduce tracks. I was just really trying to get the best out of it. Sometimes you can kill it by doing that. Maybe it's not the right bass drum. Maybe it needs a louder one or a bassier one or something. I think about it too much and I think when you start thinking about it too much you kind of overcomplicate it somehow. Sometimes the rough mixes are the best and I like a lot of tunes that sound rough, realistically, but it's an art to make it sound something rough and good, which is really difficult. It's fucking impossible, I think. I don't think I'll ever get any better at it. You just seem to learn one or two things every time you do a new mix almost or you pick something up off of somebody or whatever, you know what I mean? Best thing I ever got taught was if you put good sounds in, you'll get good sounds out. That's quite obvious. It's not always worked for me. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Bye.
