you you *Dramatic music* Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor of Resident Advisor. Right now we're listening to a track called Theo Goes Away by the Spanish artist Jass. She's playing at today's art festival in The Hague, which begins on September 21st. This week's exchange is with that festival's founder and director, Olaf van Winden. He's something of a notorious figure in The Hague and the European festival circuit as a whole. Growing up in Kenya and coming of age in The Hague's squat scene, van Winden... helped put the city on the map in the 2000s, fusing club culture with the then-emerging field of media and digital arts. He's of the view that culture should move out of institutions and into the public domain, and he's often organized works that disrupt and alter public space in thought-provoking ways. He's not one to flinch from confrontation and often asks difficult questions of those in power. which has seen him arrested and even beaten by police various times in recent years. Speaking to RA's Holly Dicker on the eve of this year's edition of Today's Art, he tells the story of his transformation from a DIY instigator to a key cultural figure in the Netherlands and Europe at large. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net. and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Olaf van Winden is up next. you I'm in The Hague with today's art director and founder, Olaf van Winden. Olaf, you were actually born in Kenya. Can you tell us about why you decided to leave and why did you choose The Hague? Yeah, well, indeed, Kenya. It's a while ago, and I think the decision to leave was not only my decision. I was still with my parents back then. I'm born in Kenya, and the rest of my youth I lived in West Africa. After Kenya, we moved to Togo, to Ivory Coast, to Mali, and then to Burkina Faso. I went to school in Bobo de Ulosso and in Ouagadougou. I did French school and at some point my parents decided to go back to Europe, in this case Netherlands. My father is Dutch, my mother is French. Mainly also based on, I mean, for educational reasons to continue studying. And then since my father was working for the Dutch government, the government is here in The Hague, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is here in The Hague, we moved to The Hague. So there I was as a 16-year-old kid raised in Africa. suddenly in Western Europe, which was actually quite a shock, I have to admit. So when I had to make some choices here to follow the rest of my life, I was like, okay, what can I do to, what will guarantee me a way out of the Netherlands and what can give me a way back to the rest of the world? So I decided to study hotel management and The Hague happens to have a very famous hotel school. So I signed up and... I studied for four or five years here in The Hague, and that's the reason actually how I came here. And when we last spoke, you told me that around this period you started squatting, basically. Can you explain why squatting is quite significant in Holland? particularly in the 90s and why it's changed since and also where you were living? Yeah, the squat scene was interesting because I was studying in hotel school, which is the complete opposite world of the squat world, for example. But this was quite an elite school and quite closed. And I noticed that this school was actually completely not connected with The Hague. And The Hague is quite a special city. There is a lot of talent. There is a lot of activity. But it was, especially back then, quite invisible. So I started digging and I found that there was a whole scene in the squat scene in the Hick. Back then there was a huge squatted building, it was called the Blauwe Aanslag. And I think there were more than 50 people living there. Sorry, so the Blauwe Aanslag. in English translate to the blue envelope because it's an old tax building, right? Yeah, that's correct. The old tax building, the tax office, when they sent us mail, it's always in this blue envelope. So this was the name of the building also. And a lot of cultural activities were happening there. There was a restaurant, there were people living, there were studios, there were events organized. And this inspired and actually this was feeding the whole scene. And at that time, our major club or stage here in The Hague, Parc van Trooy, was closed for renovation. There was a completely new building being built. So actually there was nothing really on the surface and everything was happening in... Empty buildings in very irregular spaces and also in quite irregular timings. And this inspired, you know, at that time there were so many empty buildings and there was such a need also for people to live. And that was, I think, actually the basis of the squat law that we had in the Netherlands. Or back then there wasn't a law that it was actually allowed to squat. It's a bit of a gray area, but if a building was empty, longer than one year and there was not real destination for that building, there was a possibility to squat it. And if you would enter the building, if you are there 24 hours and you can prove that you sleep there and that you can heat there and that you can feed yourself there and that it's locked from the inside, then you had the right to stay there. Interject. So I think in 1970... squatting was given legal protection and I think as long as you didn't there was no evidence of breaking in or violent entry then everything was okay Yeah, and also I think that there was a bit of an unwritten rule in squatting, like you would not squat from private people. You know, that's already if someone loses his house or cannot pay it anymore. This was a bridge too far, but from empty corporation buildings and things like that. So really trying to use the space in another way. And this came to an end, I don't exactly remember, in 2010. And yeah, exactly on that night when the squatting law came, we decided to squat an old theater here in The Hague, the Asta. which was empty for many, many years, which is in the city center, which was built as a film theater. Actually a perfect place to build a club or to build a creative spot in the center. which was 50 meters from where the city wanted to build a huge new cultural center for more than 200 million at the time that they were cutting the culture. So it seemed like they would build... top-notch building but not have enough budgets to fill it. So our statement was like, okay, there is a space here right now. You need very little to reactivate it instead of spending all these millions on a new building. And this was on the night also that this law came that it was not allowed. So we made that statement also and it was, I think, in the news as the last squat of the Netherlands. Within no time we were able, with the whole community here in The Hague, to organize a huge party. Everyone was coming with a sound system or an installation. A couple of beers left and fridges came and within half a day the whole city was dancing here. So speaking of squat parties, The Hague is particularly famous for one, Bunker Records. And I believe you met Guy Tavares as a 20-something in the squat that you were living at. What was it called again? I was not living there myself, but Guy was living there in the Blauwe Aanslag. We were doing other parties. We were doing actually drum and bass parties with my former partner Eero Vaas in an old squatted basement supermarket. parties were called Drummenfeest and Guy was living in the Blauwe Aanslag and yeah I met him there when when there was one of these parties one of the old school bunker parties. Can you describe what was happening and who was playing? I don't know who was playing anymore, but probably Danny Legoweld was there, Org Elektronik was there. The setting was a very dark, humid space. I think one strobe that was operated by Guy also still back, or already back then. with different frequencies, a smoke machine, and then mud until your waist, actually. But the greatest music, it was raw, the sound system was always a bit crappy, but there was a special energy. The fact that it was underground, that's a bit of... the essence of a club culture or a club it's a meeting space it's a meeting place and there was a big need of these places because there was nothing else so we created ourselves did you ever meet IF interference at this time yeah IF was back then he was a bit of a grumpy guy he was against everything what do you mean back then well In the years I also noticed that he's a very sweet guy with a lot of humor and everything. Yeah, I think he started with the record store, Hot Mix, and the Bruine Planet, and Naast Asta, which was actually, this was a venue next to the Asta, this building that we talked about just before, the last building that we squatted on that night, Naast Asta. And yeah, the interesting thing is that these scenes were actually totally... connected back then. Like, IF was doing his thing, Bunker was doing its completely own thing, and then there was... clone in Rotterdam which actually bundled these kind of things as a distributor and with the record label. Take us back to these drum and bass parties. Why drum and bass? It was a style we were interested in. There was quite an active skate scene here in The Hague and the skate scene was very related to drum and bass. I think also we saw electronic music coming to Europe and to the Netherlands at that time, house and techno. And we always looked also for different styles. And drum and bass sounded very fresh back then. And also other organizations were doing other types of music. So we found our niche in this field. And it fitted really well to that basement atmosphere, what we were doing there. It was in the main shopping street in the middle of the city, the Grote Marktstraat. There was no sign, there was just a blue door, but people were coming from Belgium, from everywhere, just to find this blue door on these irregular parts. What sort of acts were you booking at that time? We worked a lot with local acts, but we also managed to have Groove Rider there and LTJ Boekum and these kind of things. So yeah, a lot of the UK scene was coming here. But there was also a very active scene here in the Netherlands, in The Hague, in Rotterdam. And it was a bit, you know, drum and bass, breakbeat, this whole fresh sounds back then. So when did you decide, okay, now it's time for something bigger. Let's try a festival. Well, actually, when we had that basement, which was an illegal place, we started to communicate with the city. Like, hey, you know, this is a place in the center of the city. The city is in real lack of something like this. There's a bad image here. Can't we legalize it? Can't we start to rent this building? Because then we can seriously invest. and build on something. Because you were also, as well as throwing parties in this space, you were connected with the Art Academy and hosting exhibitions. I mean, since it was such a great space, it was 1,000 square meters in the basement. In the center, it was a great space for artists to exhibit. We worked closely with the Art Academy then, with art science and interactive media design. And this was the space where they were presenting their final exam exhibitions. So it really started to have a function. And this gave us, like, we were really inspired to start talking with the city. And this was actually the first contact where the city was quite supportive in our activities. They didn't own that building, so they couldn't really help. help us in that sense. But they started to fund our activities a little bit, even though it was in a squatted place. But back then I was still studying. So at some point I graduated and I left for a career. I went to Los Angeles and I started working first in an internship and later as a job for Hilton, the Hilton Hotels Corporation. Not in a hotel, but in the headquarters. And I was working for the loyalty program, Hilton Honors. a program where you get points and miles. And I was quite successful in that job and I got a lot of opportunities from the top management. And my career really began to develop internationally. I was allowed to actually develop the whole strategy of the loyalty program for Hilton, which was also kind of a new thing for the hotel industry back then. Now loyalty is becoming bigger. But there I was, you know, living in Beverly Hills, having a real good salary, having a great job, traveling around the world almost on a weekly basis. And I started to... feel really unhappy first, like where do I belong? Like, you know, being raised in different countries already in Africa, LA is not the most social place on earth, especially when you're not there all the time. So after one year, I decided to really step out of it. And I also saw like, okay, a corporate career is not difficult. If I want to be successful in this field, it's easy. I can always jump back. But I decided to, from one day to the other, to quit and to go back to The Hague. Because that's the city where I was actually the most... In Africa, I was way younger, but here I developed a community around me, and I felt that the city was in big need. There was so much going on, but so invisible, and everyone was complaining. And I was like, okay, it's just a matter of doing it. So maybe I can use my experience in the corporate world to really start building something here. So I came back to The Hague. and this was in 2001 I think. And we organized our first event on the Malifeld, a big square which is used for demonstrations also in the city, in front of the station. And the idea was to bring a festival of electronic music, which back then, you know, this was the time that Dance Valley started and these kind of big dance events. And already then we wanted to bring a more alternative sound. So we had a festival with five stages and there was one electro stage with IF, with Lego Welt and these guys. This was not the case in all these other dance festivals. But also I wanted to do something more. I felt always treated as a cow when I would go to these dance festivals, like these dirty toilets and everything. And I wanted to have something more, that you could have proper food, that it was well designed, that actually the design were made by artists. that you would have installations. And I saw also a new art form arising. You know, the traditional cultural world is really segregated. You have the visual artist is in the museum and the performer is in the theater. but with the new technologies and things like that, there was a new art form that was more hybrid and more crossovers between sound and image. And I didn't see that happening yet, so I decided to integrate that in the concept. So we did our first festival. It was a massive success in terms of attendance and reviews and people who were showing up, but it was a complete disaster. for ourselves because... Sorry to interject. So this was called Sound Vision? Sound Vision, yeah. As the name says, the combination of sound and vision. So a big failure for us because we made really all the mistakes we could make as a beginner. I think we had 25 colors of wristbands and the bars didn't know which... one were allowed to drink for free so at the end everyone drank for free. free and everyone came for free and it was like this free party that everyone is still talking about. Yeah, that sounds amazing. But wasn't the biggest issue to do with sound? I mean, what happened actually then is, you know, when you have a successful festival, but when you lost money, the only thing you can do is repeat and try to solve this problem. So we started talking to everyone that we owed money to and we said, okay, we're going to do a second edition. However, the mayor of The Hague back then, Mr. Deitman, decided that due to the war in Iraq, he needed his police people, his police force to secure the institutes because there's many international institutes in The Hague like OPCW for chemical weapons and the criminal court and things like that. So he decided, I was that we wouldn't get our permit to do it. So this was in real trouble because we couldn't do it. And it was an old guy. He really didn't like this type of music. And still back then, I think electronic music was a bit demonized. It was related to all kinds of bad stuff. from that perspective. So immediately we decided to go back, to go inside and to then, if it's not possible outside, then approach the cultural institutions because we also saw that cultural institutions had a big problem in attracting a young audience. Once I went with my mother to an Netherlands Dance Theatre premiere and it was totally abstract. The music was done by Yoji Ikeda. But when I looked around in the room, there was only people above 75. So I was like, well, there's a big problem here. Why don't we combine all these things? And this allowed us to, in the same year, we moved inside. And we were able to organize the festival in more than 25 venues, varying from clubs to empty buildings to museums and big concert halls. So we're now talking about Culture & Art, which was launched in 2003. Was the concept the same or how did it change? How did you develop from Sound Vision to Culture & Art beyond being inside? Well, actually, Kulturnacht, literally translated Night of Culture, was also based a bit on the model of Amsterdam and Rotterdam. They were doing the museum night. And we saw that model and we were like, okay, that's interesting, but it's very top-down. It's the museum opening its doors. Why don't we turn it around? We go further than museums because I was really pushing on the multidisciplinary already back then. Give us the space. We want to program. We want to bring what's actual and interesting right now in your spaces. And we want to bring your content to another place, like the Netherlands Dance Theater, the really state-of-the-art in contemporary dancing at that time. We were able to collaborate with them, but not in their theater, but in a nightclub, for example. So this mix of disciplines and these collaborations with all the institutions here gave us a very strong platform to continue. The first and the second year that it happened, it was really successful. And the city saw it and also were really interested in it because, like I said before, the image of The Hague was always really bad for a young audience. I remember when there was nothing, we would take the night train to Rotterdam and then come back. the city here was empty. Is there any reason why? Is there an explanation or what do you think, what's your personal take on that? Why it was like that? I think The Hague is a very formal city. You know, it's the political capital, ministries are here, the whole government is here, all the embassies are here. It's technically the second United Nations city in the world, third, sorry, after New York and Geneva, with the criminal court. So it's attracting a lot of expats. It's actually a beautiful city. It's very green. There's nice buildings and there's the beach and everything. But it doesn't have a university. So there is maybe a bit less young people or when they are finishing high school, they leave to another place. And yeah, I think there's, I don't know, it's a bit the... I think that the city was also not very supportive in creating spaces and had a different mindset in how to, you know, they even came up with the city marketing slogan, The Hague International City of Peace and Justice. That's not super sexy. And even if you go to that theme, which is still actual right now, we had that theme, we attacked it several times in our festival campaigns. But a while ago, I even wrote a letter to the mayor and I said, you know, if you want to be a city of peace and justice, why don't you create a safe house for Edward Snowden or Julian Assange? You know, why don't you say, okay, come to The Hague, you will have a fair trial here. But apparently peace and justice is something else. What was the mayor's response to that? That it was not her responsibility to take care of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden and these kind of things. Whereas I think, well, then don't market your city as a safe place for these people. So we'll come back to that attacking the peace and justice thing in a bit. So you had a couple of editions of Culture and Art. And then in 2005... Decided to change the name to Today's Art, which you are currently operating under today. Why the change and was there anything more than just a name change? Yeah, the change was for several reasons. First, you know, like I said, Museum Night, Culture Night, it really had a context in the Netherlands. It was based on a specific concept that people knew here. Being raised internationally, already my ambition started to grow further and to see, okay, what's possible also outside of the Hague? How can we build collaborations? I started connecting with Club Transmediale back then, now CTM in Berlin, asked them if we could have a collaboration. Very quickly I got in touch with the scene in Detroit through Derek May and we were talking about the collaboration there. And I realized that the name Culture Night in Dutch has a context, but in English it doesn't. It didn't sound really appealing or something that would work. So this was one first reason to think about a new name, to have an English name or something more appealing in that sense. The second thing is that The Hague was for many years hosting the Norsey Jazz Festival, a famous jazz festival. That suddenly decided to move to Rotterdam because there was a better building, they maybe received better funding in Rotterdam, anyhow. They decided to leave and this was actually a big fight between the two cities. They started competing on this kind of thing. So the city made a call and they said, okay, this festival is leaving, let's make a call for new initiatives. And I was pretty sure that they would receive only new ideas for a jazz festival. And I was like, you know, what's the point? There was already a world famous jazz festival 20 kilometers away. and between The Hague and Rotterdam I think there is only one windmill and maybe three cows so it's really close. But for us a chance to write a nice concept and then I wrote this plan and it was called Today's Art and the subtitle was Festival for Art, Music and Technology. I saw really technology coming up and I was like, okay, this is for me really the center point of all these things. Like in music and in art, I see that it's playing a crucial role. So I wanted to build a festival around it. And so it was called, and I wanted to be very urgent. Not too pretentious of the future and what's happening tomorrow and not too much referring to the past, but just what's happening right now and the name Today's Art came. So that's why we changed it. Take us back to this idea of multidisciplinary, which is something that you've had from the start and is still very much an important strand in kind of everything that you do. Why is it important to have a multidisciplinary approach to culture, to cultural programming? Yeah, like I said, there was this new art form rising through the use of technology and artists are always quite used to adopt these new technologies quickly and see what they can do with it. More and more you saw the crossovers between these disciplines. There was not really a platform for this. And I thought it was really time to address art also in a broader sense than just art with a capital A, but maybe talk more about creativity. And creativity includes all these disciplines. It can also be design, it can be fashion, it can be architecture. So we got interested in all these things and I really wanted to bring to an audience a program that would really be, that was diverse and that would inspire. And through the new collaborations... that we started by working abroad. It was really also, we felt it as our mission to our discoveries that we see there to bring it here. And club culture has always been, I think, the center point of what we're doing, like electronic music. Club culture was the basis of, has been the basis of the whole concept. And club culture, not so much. There is, I think, a different... There is the discotheque and there is the club. The discotheque is loud music and a lot of beer. The club is a social place, is a place for gathering, is a place, especially in the 90s, the club culture in Berlin. These were places where philosophers, writers, politicians would gather in a free environment. And for me also a place where a lot of innovation had happened. You know, the visual culture with the VJ culture back then. This created a whole scene that I wanted to explore. And I always said, let's not specialize ourselves too much in one direction, but let's try to be quite generic in all the directions. and be very open. And I think another important element to what you do is reclaiming and reinventing public space. You've had quite a lot of disruptive art pieces happening over the years. Can you talk about some of them and why disrupting public space, especially in The Hague, is so important? Well, the first question is actually to whom belongs this public space. And I think it's us, the general public. It's our space. But reality is that actually it's quite different, the way it's structured, the way it's planned and everything, especially city centers, I think. most city centers of middle size or big cities in the world, they start to look the same. There is a monoculture going on. And it's all organized. It's all... Actually, the square meter price is so high. It's all planned by project developers. There's big economic stakes. So every square meter needs to be sold. And to me, the public space is something different. It's something that we use where we don't need to consume and where we can be free. And this city specifically, the city center is... It's almost only shops. So at 8 or at 9 in the evening the shop closes and everyone goes home and the city is empty. And then you need to put cameras and put police guys to secure this public space. Here they were always afraid of the youth culture and the club culture. So they were pushing even these initiatives to the outside. And then what's the end is a dead city. So I was always trying to show the city also how can we use it differently, how can we inspire the people to come and just hang out. What's very successful in most cities is just a park. Look at Central Park in New York. You can just go there and sit there, and this creates already an atmosphere. Yeah, by using the public space and by disrupting it sometime, or I always use the example, you know, in design it's called the elephant path. If there is a park and the designer said that you have to walk like this, but people actually walk straight over the grass and there is a new path coming. This is exactly what I mean. Let us use this public space and something else will come out of it because we don't design it from a drawing board. from above but we use it so yeah we tried to uh we did some large-scale installations we once had a landing strip with 148 speakers facing the wall in over in the shopping street over a distance of 400 meters and this was We created a landing strip with the sound of a Boeing 747 running through that street every 15 minutes. One year we made a concert with 12 trains at Central Station The Hague. It's a final destination station because it stops, there's the sea there. And it's 12 tracks and we approached it, we made a sound installation with it, the whole station was wired. contact microphones everywhere, even inside the trains. And actually the trains were symbolically the faders on the mixer. So when they would come in and out, this would amplify the sound. Huge piece, but super disruptive because this was done at the most heavy traffic hour of the day, around six o'clock. It was also the opening of the festival, by the way. But there were people coming back from their job, entering the sound piece, and people thought that there was a massive attack going on. We did warn them at every station before. There were volunteers going on the train and giving a flyer to everyone, like, hey, you're going to enter in the sound piece. But also the first, I think, video mapping on a facade. It is considered as the first one of this scale. We worked with a Spanish artist, Pablo Valbuena, and he did a video mapping on the city hall of The Hague, which is a building by Richard Meyer. and it's totally abstract, white and modular. So it was the perfect canvas to project something on it. But this was before there was software for mapping. So he was there in a container for more than two weeks mapping everything by hand, creating his own software. But this was a huge piece and everyone was really impressed by this. So we tried also, and the point was in this digital art, media art that developed further back then, it was considered very niche and quite nerdy and technological. And I wanted to bring this outside, not only inside in closed and dark spaces, but to really bring art. and creativity to the public space and to confront people on another level. It's this idea of bringing together high and lowbrow elitism and DIY, which I think is another element. Yeah. Well, I used quite often the sentence, you know, highbrow. Lowbrow or maybe Nobrow. I've noticed that's the title of a book on your bookshelf. Exactly. That's a big inspiration. Because we were pioneering in this field of media art and things like that, we became quite specialized. And because of this specialization and having a community of artists and followers behind it, In 2011, 12, I was asked to become the director of the Netherlands Media Art Institute. So I went even in these higher arts fields, found a direction in there as well. But for me, it was always about connecting and bringing it down to a simple level that everyone could understand. And that's also my critique to art. Personally, I don't like museums. It's more like a mausoleum. And I really want to confront as many people as possible in the largest sense. So the public space is the best. But the public space is also sensitive. You are touching all kinds of backgrounds and you have more responsibility. A very simple example, if you have a painting or a photo of a naked woman in a museum, it will be considered art. If you have this in public space, there will be a completely different reaction to it. But then again, I think this does not necessarily need to be planned. Let people use their space. Let people be creative. how they use the environment and things like that. And has this sort of disruptiveness, this rebelliousness, ever got you into trouble? Yes, several times. I always managed to get out also, but I had quite some, I have quite a history of contact with police and even... have seen prisons from the inside. First year was in, well, you know, when you squat, you have contact with police. And when we were having this squat, we were actually in good contact with police. Back then in these years in The Hague, Remco has designed a tram tunnel where they would have like two stations and the metro or the tram would go underground. And like most of the building projects in the Netherlands, it took way more longer than they needed and it went five times over budget. This tunnel was empty for a long time. Plus, it was built next to our basement squat. And because of the build of this tram tunnel, we started to get water in the basement. So we needed to put pumps and things like that. So one night we decided to squat the tunnel. And we made one party in the tunnel. We invited the media and the press and people to come. We said, okay, we do the music, you bring your drinks. The police came, of course, within half an hour, but we were in good contact. So we said, okay, don't put out your uniform and come and see, and you will see it's really great. They gave us the permission to continue on one hour longer. So there was always that, you know, it's a bit this cat and mouse game, but you always stay within the limits. You don't bring people in danger and things like that, and it's all fine. In 2009, we were thinking of the festival's programming, which, as the name says, today's art, it's very only actual. things that's happening around us in the world. And 2009 was the year that the financial and economic crisis really kicked in on the world. There was a big problem with the swine flu. The elections in Iran just finished and the young generation went into the street and protested against the result. So on the big global scale, there was big things happening in the direction of conflict. And a bit closer to home, or very micro level, we had our own conflict. We lost half of our funding also due to this economic crisis. And thirdly, the city I live in, in the city we organize this festival, The Hague, is where the criminal court is and is where the conflict management of this world is trialed. So we decided to address conflict. And conflict is... Actually, we tried to address it in a very positive way. We had a subtitle underneath. Conflict is the beginning of consciousness. You need a conflict before you start to realize. That's the same idea like peace doesn't exist if you don't have war. And the city marketing slogan of the city is the Hague International City of Peace and Justice. So in the idea there's no peace without a war, we turned it around. We said the Hague International City of Conflict. The campaign was very powerful because we also realized conflict has a lot to do with power. So we made images of very powerful leaders. and the other one was a suicide bomber. And both the images were my face, very photoshopped. And the dictator was a mix of my face with Assad. from Syria. And the suicide bomber was with all the symbolism that you would see on these pamphlets. And second, we showed, we brought conflict very close to home. So we had a poster with a crater in the city hall and we made little films for YouTube where a plane was crashing into the Ministry of Culture and they were all... faked with cell phone recordings and this was spread out over the internet. We even hacked the 8 o'clock news at Lowlands where the speaker was telling the news and we put another image behind and another sound and people were really thinking that... So there was a clear message in it. It was also very clear that it was presented by today's art. But this campaign started to... go on the internet and the images of the burning city hall, the poster was hanging in front of the American embassy, I remember, it's a beautiful image. But the secret services of the Netherlands freaked out and two weeks before the festival they arrested me with brutal force, really on threats of inciting terrorism. And then I realized, like, fuck, there's really a problem in society, you know. We live in this tolerant country, but apparently there is fear. And this was also the time when right-wing governments were coming up. And this fear in society was, you know, me being arrested, the interviews I had in the police office or in jail. were really on the highest level of, I call it, it was the national coordinator of terrorism who was interviewing me. And then we went all, oh, oh. And I had to look at my YouTube films on the old crappy bash computer with a crappy internet connection. And I said, you know, if this is your research on cyberterrorism, I'm not going to tell you anything. You're going to find out yourself. I was released and immediately, I mean, I still had two weeks to organize the festival. And I invited the mayor to come and discuss this issue because actually it was the mayor that put his signature to arrest me. And I didn't understand because, you know, I'm funded by this city. Not famous, but people know me in the city for doing this. So this was the first time. Conflict is the beginning of consciousness. And the year after, it was nominated for the Dutch Design Award, this campaign. So what was the outcome of the discussion with the mayor at the festival? The mayor was very distant and I started to realize that the problem was way bigger than I ever expected. This was a new mayor, Mr. van Aertsen. He used to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs a couple of years before during the war with Yugoslavia. And the Netherlands had quite a controversial role in Srebrenica. Since he was Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was very involved with this topic. And apparently in that time, there was a lot of infiltration from Serbia inside political organizations. While I was addressing the theme of conflict in the campaign, we also had, of course, a program which was about conflict. And I invited a curator from Serbia to make a program with artists from Montenegro, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, etc. This program was political, and we invited also the ambassadors of these countries to be at the opening, and some quite left-wing journalists to be there and to write about it. So my campaign, plus this program, plus this... thing with Srebrenica in the back and this mayor that just became mayor in the city and had to deal with this. This was a cocktail that was very poisonous. And when I asked him, he said, we will talk about this when you after your trial, because I don't know. So actually a year later the trial came and I was discharged. And then the mayor stepped up to me and he did the opening of the festival afterwards. And he apologized in front of everyone. He said, as you know, Olaf and I had some rough beginnings, but I really respect this festival. I'm happy it's here, blah, blah, blah. How's today's art? What's their relationship like now with the city? And I guess it must be another mayor now. I mean, the relation with the city is... I had a couple of other contacts with legal forces and police. One was with the squatting law on the last night. Of course, this was amplified. because there was news around it. It was on the last 24 hours of this law. So again, the news came and, you know, you have to imagine at that time I had a board because we are a non-profit foundation and there is a board also operating. The chairman of the board was the chairman of Siemens Netherlands and Dan Roosgaarde was also in our board. but these were good friends of the mayor. So every time there was shit with me, they would call each other and they were like, again, what's he doing? Then the budget cuts came in 2012 and there was a protest from cultural institutions because really a lot of institutions, also the big ones, were cut for half and some were even cut for 100%. At that time I was also director of the Netherlands Media Art Institute in Amsterdam and this institute was cut for 100%. So there was a protest. And on that night, people started, on the night that it was a 24-hour protest, people started a big walk. from Museum Boijmans van Beurningen in Rotterdam to The Hague. So they walked in the night. And I decided not to walk, but I was like, shit, they will come here in the city, there will only be two shawarma shops open. You know what? I'm going to open a club, or I'm going to make a party for the people coming. So we welcomed them in the club. They danced till the morning. And then we went to this Malifeld, this protest field, for a protest. And I think there were 10,000, 15,000 people. highly respected directors of the biggest museums and things like that in the Netherlands. This was on the day where they would sign the cuts. So we went to the parliament building and we were sitting in front and then the military police started to attack. And I was first in line and I was completely beaten up and jailed again with half-broken neck in jail. And I didn't do anything. So again, I was trialed, and the trial came one year later and again released. But this was the third time. So I have a bit of an image of being a conflict curator, yes. On one hand, there is huge respect because we are pioneering in the city. At the same time, when we started, it was also very weird what we were doing. Even in the funding, there was no structure to fund this hybrid art. There was funding for music, for theater, for dance, but not for this crossover disciplinary thing. And now I see a clear difference is that actually this form of art... becoming mainstream. The artists that we were programming 10 years ago are now doing their solos in Tate Modern or in MoMA. So this field grew and also our reputation grew in that sense. And somehow we're highly respected, but we're seen a bit as enfant terrible, for sure. So let's bring things a little bit up to date. You are in the throes of preparing for the 14th edition of the festival. What are some of today's art themes, political or otherwise? What are you kind of addressing with this festival? Yeah, this year we will, last year it was a lot about data and amounts of data. Now we will go more in the direction of, we call it bubble visions. There is so many parallel worlds actually. I realized when I was visiting Transmediale in the winter in Berlin, the narrative was all about fuck Google, fuck this, fuck that, from a very Western perspective. And I started to realize, like, you know, this is completely irrelevant if you live in China, because there is no Google in China. or if you live in Ferke-Sedougou or in a remote place. But still there's data and still there is a lot of technological improvement. We are inviting actually a lot of artists this year that are working on this field, like what is advertisement, what is even democracy in these years or in these eras of data. And how far is this technology going to integrate into our lives? Like, will we come to a point where the machine will take over our jobs? Which I think we're very close from it. But this is a certain kind of job. Like everything which is repetitive, this can be replaced. Jobs that are around knowledge can also be replaced. You know, a judge knows only what he read. A machine can combine everything that's being written. Same for a doctor. But creative jobs is a different thing. The machine has no creativity. So that's, I think actually that creativity and art have always been the same. been considered soft capital. You can even see in the budget cuts in 2012. This was what was the topics that were being cut because this is only costing money to society. I think now we will come to a shift and we will start to realize that creativity, interdisciplinary approach, interpretation of information. is a key for the future. But therefore we need to change our education radically because that's still based on knowledge and it's still based on putting things on your hard drive that are actually available somewhere else. Yeah, so fake news. We will for sure avoid the name Trump. I think it will be in... No text. But it's a lot about borders. We have one panel. It's about creativity beyond borders. And we will have all kinds of organizations that are working in remote places trying to build a future. So that's the discourse. program so now let's talk a bit about the music i'm zeroing in straight to friday's club performance with a very special detroit uh undercurrent so you've got underground resistance presenting depth charge can you tell us a bit about this project and also tell us how you met underground resistance because you and mike go way back do you not yeah um Well, that's actually related to the... I met Underground Resistance when I was working with Kevin Sonderson for Detroit's Electronic Music Festival. That was our second year of involvement, the year before we worked with Derek May. And how this happened is I was seeing Derek May here in Amsterdam. He played somewhere and... Somehow we end up together at the bar and he was telling me about his festival in Detroit that was soon to happen. And I asked him, what's your program? How is it structured? And he told me that it was very complicated. He took it over from Carl Craig and it was an artist-run festival. There is no funding in the US like we have here. And it was a great concept, but there was actually not a real strong business model behind it. And I said, can I help? And he said, come to Detroit. And so I booked my ticket and I went to Detroit. And I remember the faces in his office because Derek is a very open person. He probably says it to many people. And they looked at me like, oh, fuck, there's another guy who follows Derek and will come here with a bullshit story. But I told them, okay, we have possibilities to apply for funding. Let me work on it. And we were able to. actually fund the whole stage. Well, let's talk about the 2004, some of the artists that you brought over from The Hague. I'm looking at the flyer now. Yeah, I think it's not only artists from The Hague. It's actually Dutch artists because we got actually Dutch funding. But the funding was more for travel, accommodation. and also some production, but I didn't have any money for fees. And the festival was also not selling tickets. So I approached people who I knew were very Detroit-oriented in their music. I mean, this is a list that is very much the clone list. Lego Welt, Nova Man. But we also wanted to have a mix with Detroit artists. And the interesting thing is, Derek... When we were able to fund this stage, he gave us the underground stage at Hart Plaza, which is a dark space. And then from the cross-disciplinary approach, I said also I want to have visuals there. So I invited also a team of VJs. Back then they were called Photonic. They don't exist anymore. But I made one mistake. Like I had a slot for every DJ, but I had only two VJs for the whole weekend. And they were like 24 hours VJing the whole time. They did something radical. They printed black and white and they projected on the black and white with distorted images. So it was super interesting for Detroit. And the program was great. But I contacted all these artists and I said... we have a possibility to play in Detroit. And everyone confirmed and everyone went for free. And I think this was the power also of Detroit's electronic music festival back then. It was almost like a Muslim going to Mecca. You would go to Detroit if you were in that music field. So with huge support from everyone, we had a crazy success. But, you know, free festival. Derek couldn't continue anymore and it was influenced or taking too much of his own career also. And then Kevin Sonderson said, okay, I'm going to take it over. So he contacted me and he said, hey, you did some great work for Derek. Are you interested in collaborating with me? I said, sure, I'm on my way. So I came and Kevin had his office at Submerge, where Underground Resistance is based. So I was staying at Submerge. I was working from there and stayed a lot there. That's how I met Mike. and Cornelius and the rest of the crew. And we did the second edition. There I was not too much more into having a stage, but it was more like trying to get sponsors and funding for the whole festival. I arranged a sponsor deal with Function One then that did the whole festival. Yeah, great experience, but again, you know, tough to organize in these circumstances. So you must have been quite an asset having this sort of commercial experience and experience with funding because from what I've read about this whole organization that it was very chaotic. Yeah, I mean, what do you expect? Touring artists and running a festival like this is a huge responsibility and there's a lot of money involved. I have to say that the city was very unsupportive also. It was almost like we would bring in funding from abroad and they would almost try to tax it to get the funding back instead that they would go to the artist. But still that vibe that was around DMF, what I felt so powerful then, it's like... You know, all these artists like Carl Craig, Jeff Mills, all these guys, imagine, they have their career outside of Detroit. So their families, their community there, they have actually no idea what these guys are doing. And then once a year there was this... music festival where the rest of the world would come with high respect to what's happening there. So the backstage was always full of families barbecuing. It was such a great atmosphere and such a motivation to support and to work in something like this. So the year after, when, yeah, it seemed... It's completely undoable to organize it in such a way. Then the city opened a bid or did an open call and I think Paxhau then came in and made more commercial model with ticketing. I remember back then we had a bit of talks also with Mike, can we do an alternative version next to it? Because we thought that the ticketing was the thing not to do in this festival. It should remain a free festival, really artist-driven, no matter how hard. But yeah, the whole point was also like I got involved, but I also realized like, yeah, I'm this white kid from Europe in this African-American community. I don't want to be pushed forward as the one leading this festival. So leave me please in the back. I want to arrange things more on another level, but I don't want to be the front man of this festival. So that was in 2005, and I guess you and Mike have carried on a relationship. You told me last year when we spoke that you went on tour with Underground Resistance. Yeah, I got really impressed by the whole attitude and the whole philosophy behind the music in Detroit. And not only in techno, in many. Detroit is actually an amazing city for music. The approach of Underground Resistance, so supportive to actually try to create an opportunity for kids in their community to step out and to get a chance for an international career, that appealed very much to me. And of course, there was already people knew about Underground Resistance. They played at Tresor in Berlin and these kind of things. But I invited them to play in the Netherlands and it was one of the... first time that they came and it was I think they played in the part with Interstellar Fugitive and we had a whole program first a screening of a film then artist talks and then they were on stage I think the whole techno world of Netherlands and Belgium came I think if you would have dropped a bomb there they wouldn't have been techno for another two years being produced But it was great, but there was also a bit of, how to say, not jealousy, but there were a lot of people that were like, but who is this guy who is suddenly inviting underground resistance here and taps into this network? which is not in the field of clone and these type of things. But we invited them, huge success. The year after they came, this was the moment where they took off their masks for the first time here in The Hague. And, you know, when they came here, they also saw a festival which was different. We still joke about this, but we had a performance on the Grote Markt, an outdoor performance. And this was a concert with washing machines and ironing boards. For them, this was so creative and they so loved it. So every year they wanted to come back to also discover what we were presenting. And since we were starting to work in this network of festivals also in Europe with CTM and these kind of things, a lot of people started to ask me, can you arrange Underground Resistance? So we went to Norway, we went to CTM. We went to MUTEC once together. We went to Romania. So we're talking about ECAS, ICAS, and now SHAPE network of festivals where there's, that's all European-based festivals. There's another one called We Are Europe, which... Yeah, so all these networks. And I think, you know, a festival like Today's Art and many of us, these independent festivals, we always have a lot of collaborations. And I think this is also the power of it. It's quite a, actually a small scene internationally. And we realized that it makes a lot of sense to collaborate, to develop our artists, to develop our audiences, and sometimes also to help each other with funding. Some have access, some not. So it started first a bit informally, then out of all these informal networks where we started to invite each other, we saw a possibility to apply at the European government. We tried one year, it didn't work. Second year, it didn't work. And then suddenly, boom, we had funding. And this was the first network was called ECAS, European Cities of Advanced Sound. And we had a budget for three years with 12 festivals. CTM was in there, Future Everything in Manchester, Insomnia in Tromso, UnSound was in there. But again, we made all the mistakes we could financially. We all lost quite some money in these projects, but we realized, okay, this collaboration is interesting. And these collaborations even went beyond just our European networks. Organizations like MUTEC started to tap in. And then we created a network a bit bigger than that. It's ICAS instead of ECOS, so International Cities of Advanced Sound. This remained informal. There was no financial relief. in between. But the group who started ACAS after this project was finished looked for another possibility to collaborate. And based on the experience we thought, okay, let's make something very simple in structure. And that's how Shape was initiated. Shape is 16 festivals. collaborating for three years. Every year we make a list of three artists per festival. So that's a list of 40, 50 artists. And my commitment to this list is that I have to program at least nine of them. It's emerging artists, so it's also really great. for developing these careers of these artists because they are sure that if they are on this list that they will have at least a couple of gigs around super cool festivals in Europe. And once a year we do a presentation outside of the EU. Once we did at MUTEC in Montreal. Last year we were in Rio, in Brazil. And this year we're going to Africa, to Uganda, to the Nyege Nyege Festival with 16 artists and 16 festivals. So, yeah, super interesting to work on this field and on trying to do these kind of things. The third network is a bit different. It's not so much on the emerging artists. It's more the bigger collaborations. This is called We Are Europe. This is eight festivals. In this one we are by far one of the smallest because this is including Sonar in Barcelona and Visonor, Co-Pop in Köln, WeWorks in Greece. Elevate in Austria Insomnia is in there and what's interesting is you know in this network we try to do the bigger collaborations the bigger tours one of the examples is we had our own stage at Sonar two years ago And we commissioned Anti-VJ and Doppler Effect with a new project. It was premiered there. But the interesting thing of this network is you have a very big organization like SONAR and you have an organization like Insomnia in Tromsø, Norway, run by volunteers. But still, this network, it functions amazingly. We finished the first cycle and we just heard that we have another three years of funding. from the EU, so this will develop even further. Thank you. you
