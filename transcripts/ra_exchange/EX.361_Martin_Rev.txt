Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Martin Rev. As one half of the band Suicide, Rev combined minimalism, rock and roll, and noise into a sound that changed both electronic and punk music and continues to influence artists in the present day. Rev was born in the Bronx and grew up on a musical diet of classic rock and roll and free-thinking jazz, which provided an unlikely grounding for a style that would influence avant-garde and DIY culture. He's just released his ninth solo album, so we had Matt McDermott meet up with Rev in his native New York for a career-spanning look at his life in music. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Martin Rev is up next. Okay, we're here with Martin Rev. New York City legend. Martin is preparing for the release of his ninth solo album, his first new material since 2009. This one is called... Demolition 9 and it's being put out on Craig Leon's label. He's sort of come to notoriety or re-entered this sort of underground music world in recent years thanks to the re-release of of his record Nomos, this really bizarre and beautiful record. But obviously, like Marty Thau brought in Craig Leon to engineer the session for the legendary self-titled suicide debut. Can you tell me how you met Craig? Well, that's how I met Craig, when Marty brought him to the studio. We knew on Marty's recommendation, Marty's choice of producer was going to be Craig Leon, but I hadn't known Craig Leon before that. Neither of us did, Alan or I. So we all met together in the studio for the first day of sessions, which actually is where we basically recorded the whole album, because it was a live album, so it was done like 40 minutes or something. Craig and I ran into each other accidentally in New York maybe once or twice at the most, maybe once in the 80s or 90s. Since that time, we're talking about since 77. So we spoke briefly just a year or two ago concerning the Barbican show, Suicide's last show. Otherwise, an occasional email on a tentative project, but we never work together or saw each other. Otherwise, it's always you. And it seems like with Demolition 9, one of the most interesting things about your solo catalog. you know, with the self-titled record from 1980, that was sort of an obvious step from Suicide. But since then, you know, it's really been all over the place. Like Les Nymphs is a really sort of interesting record that gets into everything from kind of exotica to house music to industrial. Stigmata is a more orchestral record, from what I understand, dedicated to your late wife. But on this new one, it's maybe your toughest album since the Suicide Days. It seems like you're trying to remind everybody that you can still get pretty gnarly. Well, not consciously, but it's maybe more affected by... Live shows, which I've been doing many of in the last quite a few years, and a lot of that sound definitely seeped in, and some of that was conscious. I wanted to. see how much of that live sound I could replicate in a pure audio setup. But obviously not in every track. But it must be just the way I'm responding now to the decisions that the music demands from my ear. The other albums were based on those aspirations or decisions. At that time, as you change, as you live and you listen and you, you know, to more and more or experience more and more in general and especially in music, you tend to go for the next step, whatever that is for you. And you don't always necessarily reach it. You try to. as far as you can to reach whatever your original expectation is. But of course, that changes as soon as you start because you realize you're in a total no man's land, you might say. It's interesting when you mention live shows, because one of the things that we cover a lot of on our site is DJs and DJs are supposed to react to the club and to the audience. And I know that's something that you think about a lot as well. Like, oh, this is this is how I would play a club show. You know, I played beats. when I'm in the club, like how is your reaction or, you know, general affect with the audience changed over the years? Because at the beginning it was extremely confrontational. And at this point, it's like, okay, you know, I'm in a dark nightclub. I'm going to play beats. Well, I do dig when I'm playing live to play live, you know what I mean, especially in a club setting. Because I guess that's what I would want to hear in a club. That's what I want to feel in a club. So I'm really entertaining myself first. It's great when an audience digs it too and you start to see, maybe you're starting to move like now, you see a lot of that. Because the beats, and not just the beats, but maybe the way I'm handling them is very infectious. But of course when I'm playing... around them or with them or what I'm doing with them is not necessarily something they would have expected or is that easy to digest. Knowing me a little better than, say, when we first came out of suicide, I'm not a total unexpected entity. A club referee... like dance music, basically, you know, as much as beats or just a dance orientation. Now I'm doing, in every show just about, I'm working with a great projectionist named Davino Fon from France. That also opens up a panorama of audiovisual. So the audience has a lot of things they can touch base on. a combination of the way the audio plays off the visual and vice versa. So even if I'm playing the most extreme, however they hear it, extreme demolition sounds right in their face, it blends or they have other references too. Plus the fact that they know me or know me from another day, like some are. young enough to say, you know, never to have heard the Suicide record when it came out or the first couple of solo records. But they've read enough now in retrospect or whatnot so they can say, okay, he's in a... Like, you know, the general press, in a way, can... kind of put you in a bag now where they couldn't necessarily do that before, even though now it's not necessarily correct where they're putting you. But there's a reference point for me. And sound has changed. You know, music is, in a way, a lot of stuff in the clubs and everything has become, I notice, even more avant-garde. in its own way. Some stays mainstream, but a lot of pretty abstract stuff goes on in clubs. So I think when I come out, it gives them something to move to, maybe two, as they're getting a little bit of an assault, which I'm not doing intentionally. I'm just playing what I hear is right, sounds right to me at that point. So do you go out to listen to music in clubs? I know that you spent the last 40 years in clubs of one sort or another, but do you ever go out with friends to hear some new music? I actually don't anymore. Yeah, I spent the first formative years, many, many of them, in clubs hearing everything around, especially the scene I was involved in. Now, I'm at my, you might say, music or my thoughts or my processes. That's French, processu. But I'm at that enough during the day that there really isn't time. I don't find there's time. I don't find a necessity. although I would definitely gain something from it. But when things are that close to the world I'm already in, I tend not to learn as much. I kind of tend to size it up in the first five or ten seconds. It could be great, it could be not so great, but I know where it's coming from for me anyway. So I tend to look for things that be surprised or things that I don't get right away. And that's usually, you know, I can access those quicker on a radio in terms of surprises or CD, be specific about what I'm looking for or not expecting. And, you know, it's a lot less time consuming. And so the new record is 34 tracks. Many of them are... very short, you refer to them as vignettes, you know, which sort of capture a mood or attempt to evoke a certain visual setting. Can you tell me a little bit about, you know, some of the concepts that you were trying to get across as well as some of the influences that went into that? Yeah, well, actually, whatever I said when I was asked to write something about the record, which is not, it could end up being a strong point, but not. something I feel I know about enough to even write about and I'd rather other people do. So I might throw around a word like vignette or I see when the press says about yearning for unattainable artistic aspirations because now you're in a word world and I'm searching to find one. So Craig said, you know, if you can just give me a couple of lines. we'll expand on it. But maybe unfortunately I gave a line or two that now is repeated in every announcement and that, you know, it's okay for one or two times, but I don't necessarily know what that means either. So the concepts, I would say, of the tracks are purely musical to me. I didn't have any visual concept, specifically musical concept, partially coming out of Stigmata. It started me off that way, but then it went somewhere else. And when I heard that possibly what I had was okay, but it was going maybe too far in one direction, not balanced enough for my taste. I would add other but musical things that I dig out of my experience of music, of rock, jazz, you know, whatever, however it's been distilled. So each one is a challenge, as they usually are, of musical decisions. And the combination of all of them is a... Putting together all these diverse elements is on a musical level totally. So in that sense, there was no concept. I mean, I just hear the way two notes or three notes work together, and immediately I can hear, well, that's great, or that's wrong most of the time, or wrong, or that could be changed, or I can take it here. And when you rearrange it a little bit, then you get another idea from it and what comes after it. is affected by that. It's all musical stuff on that level, that language. And that's where it went all the way through, really. I'm interested in the idea of musical choices stretching back to the beginning of your career, because it might not be that well known, but you grew up with... rock and roll. You got extremely interested in jazz. You had sort of a larger free jazz ensemble. You were going into sort of universities to play there. And then perhaps the reason that you were able to record the Suicide 1977 debut with Craig so quickly is because you had been playing those songs for many years at that point. Like it was extremely well rehearsed. But what I'm curious about is you met Alan at... the Museum for Living Artists at Broadway in Waverly and immediately identified him as somebody that you could work with or vice versa. But for the first few years, it was just pretty much like a wall of noise, right? Well, going back just a bit, it would have been nice if I played universities, but I couldn't even get close to one, musically speaking. Maybe a couple of art little galleries with my previous group, Reverend, not many. Meeting Alan, a lot of what kind of cemented, fermented our bonding was that we were both in the same very radical place as artists, more than anyone else around us in that environment. with ideas of total commitment and going further. We were like the last guys in the museum to be up and wanting to experiment and had ideas in mind of taking it further. Alan coming from a visual artist background, going into music. So the beginning was, yeah, it was, I would say... as I may have said before, possibly, it's like starting with a block of marble for a sculptor. It was very natural for me because I was coming out of, at that time, free electronic playing. I evolved through, of course, through rock. At that point, when I went into jazz, I never left rock. But the jazz discipline was a tremendous challenge in study. So that was for many years as a teenager. And I kind of developed and evolved through all the stages of jazz, starting with bebop, basically. Although I went sometimes backwards, say, to bebop, because I had to reflect my time, which was Coltrane and Miles, and then study. What came immediately before that? I evolved eventually into playing free, being more influenced by what actually the environment was at that moment, which was the so-called avant-garde of jazz, Cecil and Bill Dixon. So starting with Alan and him having not had any musical background in the sense of actual... learning, you know, tremendous amount of listening in his whole life and loving it. He was also playing, he started out playing trumpet and it was a total like free trumpet, you know, a.k.a. like... kind of in the world of Don Eiler. So we started that way because we didn't know where we were going except we knew we were going to perform it somehow. Rock at that point was the only really open frontier that you felt you could still do anything because you were still young enough. Jazz had had an incredible history already, evolving into the avant-garde, as I mentioned. And now it was like really super developed. And there weren't a lot of big open spaces like there were for Charlie Parker, Coltrane, and Miles Davis in my generation. But rock was still open. Rock had just started in the 70s with a theatrical reference with Iggy and Alice Cooper. And so the idea was, if we're going to do anything consistent, let's just bring it into this rock or medium, this rock scenario. But as far as the music was concerned, we didn't have it yet sculpted. We were starting to chisel away at that slowly, but it was still a big block of marble. That's where you hear the wall of sound totally. We heard what we were doing, but it was still in that kind of framework. Alan would have maybe four sections in a gig, and it'd probably be over in 20 minutes, and Alan would have four quick word things on each one, screen them totally, and I'd have a different, slightly different approach to each one on sound. And to the average audience, I guess it was probably just totally one block of sound with no break. And we didn't break on anything either. We just went one into the other. It was finished. But we were sculpting it down. And then the basic change, I imagine. Well, it started to be when I started looking for an approach that would get more and more, I guess, not even that conscious about that, but closer and closer to the rock. roots who I come out of and something that Alan could not necessarily have to or be screaming on but we can get close because we couldn't make a demo we couldn't make anything like bring to a record company even a you know a little two inch you know those four inch tapes that we used to make our demos on but we couldn't bring them to anybody it's like impossible It wasn't really any different than the free stuff I was doing with Reverend B, which was often electronic. I searched for that at one point. I remember going into, I used to go in to use the pianos, which you can't do anymore at NYU because I lived around. I could just walk in, take the elevator, go up to the eighth floor, I think it was, and they had all the practice rooms up there. And in those days, I could just walk in. Nobody said anything. Nobody checked any stuff. And I would just sit down, and I could work out things. I even had a couple of sessions up there with a band once with the grand pianos. It was after all the classes were done, but it was still open. So one time in the afternoon, which was right around the corner, basically, from the museum, I walked in and I said, no, let me see if I can find something closer to where we're going now that we've gotten this far. And in about five, less than five minutes, right away, I found Rocket USA. I think it was the first one. And I heard it. I heard it and I saw it. I said, that's it. And I think soon after that came Ghost Rider, maybe Cherie, maybe not that. I walked out of there maybe with two tracks. And then that night when we rehearsed, I hit those two tracks. Alan hit something. He was able to come in with another approach. At some point, I said to him very soon after, try whispering instead of screaming. I think it's going to blend. I could hear that blending better, something happening. A couple of years later, maybe not until 75, or the end of 74, because I was trying to... get percussion involved, but I wanted it to be a rhythm machine, especially after my wife had come down to a session. I didn't want to replace her, and I wanted to, you know, when I heard this idea of rhythm machine, to me, I knew that was the place to go, but I couldn't afford one. Finally, around 75, I saw one in the papers that I could afford. It was a $30 rhythm machine. I brought that in. And I think it was that night we had another rehearsal. At this point, it was just Alan and I. And when I plugged that in, I played it, and then we had our rhythm section. That was the basic template of all the songs that came after, was that rhythm. kind of beat and those very, you know, those kind of, it was Ghost Rider and, you know, Cherie and all that stuff, of course. You can hear their relation. But it was a natural process of, as opposed to a lot of us or a lot of musicians or artists who start with a... a good idea, either from tradition or something they know they're going to do and they go right to it. We were starting from a total unknown and just, and just, uh, scratching it in. But once I did, I was scratching it out. Once I did it, I knew I was relating to what was innately me. In many ways, even more than jazz. Because jazz was from a time, a lot of the materials were way before my era. Although, you know, but it was also different because it was much more, it was mostly instrumental and very high, top of the line American art. So it definitely appealed to me maybe as much as rock in a certain way, but rock was my roots. I mean, it's something that... You know, I was hearing probably from the time I was, the first time the radio went on, maybe I was two years old or less. You know, you go to all your days, school dances, and you fell in love, you fell out of love, you were broken up with, you asked a girl to go with you. All that stuff was all to write. It was a soundtrack. So when I came back to that essence so starkly, I realized that is, I'm back to me. But it was backed in a very rooted way because that was the essence of, I think, I realized that's what always made it for me, was the pure essence of that rhythm, among other things, of course, vocal. But, you know, if I hear Little Richard today and I hear Lucille or something like that, it hasn't changed a bit. It's that driving, incredibly tight, rhythm and blues, boogie-woogie, rock and roll. Rock had become so developed at that time. We're talking about the end of the 70s or mid-70s. beginning and mid, with great, of course, you know, big studio productions after the 60s. In some ways, that had been lost, and that was a lot of the reason why I veered away from it around the time of the Beatles. You know, I said, okay, Beatles, but man, dig what's happening with Train and these people. That has the edge. That has the message. Of course, the Beatles were... heralding a whole other approach electronically and whatnot. But it was already getting very big production-wise, starting to. And it was a song form. So that edge that I started, that I heard in jazz at that point, was really what I heard in rock in the beginning. the beginnings of rock, which is really my generation. Seeing Elvis and Little Richard, Elvis on TV, all those guys, a lot of them, whoever got on TV. Do you feel like people understood how traditional and romantic the music was at that point, or do you think they just got thrown off by the stage configuration as well as the antics? Most people did, I think. There was always, even that early, there was one or two who even got, there were a few who got it, or they said, you know, however they got it, they weren't thrown off by it. The theater of it, you might say, or the sound of it. And it was incredibly loud, I imagine. It was incredibly loud and for most, of course, abrasively loud. It didn't touch any base of anything they knew too much of previous groups. There weren't also any previous instrumentation. There weren't any two-man groups playing like that at that time. Electronic. like that with a drum machine, no bass, no drums, otherwise, no rhythm guitar, no guitar. So it was considered, it was a confrontation in that sense, although it wasn't done for that reason. It was done for purely. glorious aspirations, you might say, artistically. But they're always, you know, and as time went on, there was some fairly early, especially after the first album came out, that would remark about the romantic quality and the, well, they heard Cherie and, you know, they had a chance to. and even the commercial, because the word then was always, the big concept was commercial. Yeah, a band, but are they commercial? Everybody looked for something commercial, the producers, the managers. That was the key at the time. And Suicide, whatever they may have been musically, that could have been commercial, in no way were considered ever. Plus the name itself, everybody knew, you know, was a no-no. Totally, you're not going to get on the radio with that, you know. And with that sound. Marty Thau, of course, being the maverick that he was, heard us very early on, but it was when he heard a single we put on a jukebox in Max's. that he says himself, I realized they could make a record because he booked us in a show in 72 and he talks about that. He said, wow, they're fucking phenomenal performance, but they can't make a record like this. So it took about four years when we got that record and Max has put out an album too with one cut. And one night he's having dinner and Max is and somebody plays Rocket USA, the single we made. And he said to himself, holy shit. He said, who is that? He asked somebody. He said, suicide. He said, suicide? Holy shit. He said, wow, they can make a record. He said, call us like the next day. He asked us if he could manage us. In terms of the setup. You mentioned that that was the pure, you know, going for the glory or you seem mainly interested in genres and forms where reinvention is still possible. But another thing that you mentioned earlier on was Alan was the only one at the museum who would stay up as late as you, who was down to work that late to you. Can you describe like... So it was full commitment for both of you guys. And what was the lifestyle like, you know, say prior to Marty coming in? Well, that was our lifestyle from a good six years, you'd say. It was just about before. Marty came in, trying to get a show wherever we could. In the early years, probably maybe three a year would be average. But Alan also was seeking a place to create that was fresh for him. And I was seeking that myself. I've always been. I think that's why, you know. Can you describe what the museum was? The museum, yes. The museum was a loft space on Waverly Place, Mercer and Waverly. The building is not there anymore. It was rebuilt as an apartment house. That was a co-op artist space. It existed before I knew anything about it. It was formed maybe a year before. of painters who were actually quite professional, many showing for years, veteran painters, who were really good, got together and decided, we're going to have a co-op gallery, we'll have shows every month or so, and we'll decide that. And he picked a board of directors because they weren't going to hang out and be around museums. These were all people who were already... Older, they were working, you know, they weren't street artists anymore, but they were ones who didn't become so celebrated, you know, it was beyond the abstract expressionists and whatnot. Modern cats, too. I mean, abstract painters, you know, from Ed Reinhart, Stiles, and beyond, Stella. And so they picked a, they decided, I guess, to pick a board. directors. Well, the board was the only ones who, I guess, would be out there enough to watch the place. And they gave keys to them. Alan was one of them. Another one was a great, incredible painter named Joe Cattuccio. gave keys to him. Maybe the guy that we started with, Paul, had keys. I'm not sure at this point. There were maybe five or six, but only Alan and Joe you could find there at any time you went up. So I did a couple of shows there with my previous group, Reverend B, because they would have events. Every night, every day was another. Radical kind of... The feeling was very strong in those days in terms of activism. It was during Vietnam. So they'd have film shows, Art Workers Coalition, all kinds of aggressive, active art groups would take museum for a night to show a program. And one was... They asked me to do a... a gig through a friend of my wife's at the time who recommended me. And I actually had heard of the name of the museum. I saw a poster lying on the floor when I rehearsed Reverend B in another space called Studio We at the time, which is a total jazz of art gospel, incredible space. more funky down on Eldridge Street. I did that gig and somewhere soon after that it was cold outside. I was walking around the streets downtown in Manhattan. I said, "Well, let me jump upstairs to my museum and warm up and see what's happening up there." So I go up. The only person there is Alan with his head into a wall and sack tape recorder trying to squeeze out whatever he could. you know, whatever feedback or any, out of a Wollensack, one of those old white ones. And Paul Liebgaard, who was another visual artist, was just trying to squeeze out stuff out of a guitar. It was a little easier for him because he had a guitar. So it was warm enough. I just, you know, sat on the floor. nice, beautiful, maybe 3,000 square foot space, and listen to them. And then at some point, I went to the back. I looked for something to beat with. I found some industrial springs, if I remember. And I sat on the floor and I just started doing a drum track to them. They didn't know me. I didn't know them. After that, you know, getting to know Alan a little bit because he was there every day and that could be, that was kind of becoming a shelter for me. You know, I realized his past, previous past right up to that time was where he, he was a visual artist. He went to college. He was. And then he was married in Brooklyn, and he was looking, looking, looking. His work was incredible when I finally saw it, of course. It's so intense. And when he saw Iggy at Forest Park in Queens, it changed his whole, he said, I have to, I can't be an artist anymore unless I perform. He walked out with that thought in his head. So I met him coming out of this place and he left his wife. He left his fairly. ongoing, aspiring bourgeois life in Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope. And when I met him, he was living in a street, living in a museum, and occasionally in Brooklyn at a friend's, you know, who let him stay in the basement, a married guy who had a brownstone. And I was in the same place, although already I was married. I had kids. Talking about somebody who's like 20, 21. Life for me was very... Exalted, you might say, between trying to survive on all counts. My wife is an incredible spirit artistically and whatnot. I knew I was still going somewhere. For me, it was always like, okay, I'm playing free, but it's still, it's new because it's electronic, but it's not new enough. Like, what am I going to be doing next month? I wouldn't be thinking that way, but I knew I was still evolving. I was too... I was too young artistically to find my niche, and I could never find it commercially because there was no niche that would... accept me anyway. So I had to keep going. If jazz or rock at some point said, well, you know, it could have been too bad in a way. It may have stilted me in the sense that now I would have had a career in one of these phases. But I never did. It was the only way. So I had to keep going and I had to keep for myself. You know, it's an obsessive, just a... Making music has always been, you know, like kind of the only way to live, you know, in many ways. Spiritually, you know, if not economically, that's okay. There was no risk factor ever taken. That was the insanity of my approach since I was a little kid. Not knowing, oh, I'm not taking the risk. I mean, I'm not going to factor it in. It's not going to happen to me. I'm going to just do this and see what comes out. So it's a certain autism for sure, but a positive one. I think artists need or usually are to some extent probably autistic. Autism is good in a certain sense if it's focused. Yeah, so that was the background. And we were, I was on the streets a lot. You know, I had my, my wife had a play. We had a place just getting by. It was okay. I had my place that I had a little tiny studio before I met her. And I was uptown and I was downtown walking around and searching and playing after I played uptown. my own practicing, you might say, whatever, and run into Alan, who's in the same transporting situation in his life, artistically especially. Can you explain what it was like walking around downtown at the time? I mean, much has been made of this era of downtown life, but I know that Alan said that leaving the museum at three in the morning... during rehearsal was like taking your life into your own hands to some extent. Like, was it, what was it like? And now. Waverly and Broadway, there's probably a multimillion-dollar development there, of course. But what was it like at the time? New York was a lot more real. There wasn't this whole gentrification that we saw in the 80s, starting in the 90s especially, hadn't taken place. There was a downgrade of its economic status. apparently, where New York was considered a riskier investment, so its bonds went down to B, or whatever, after the 60s, after the bubble of the 60s in general. But it was an exciting place. I mean, I never felt around Waverly and Broadway that you were taking your life personally. It was a little rougher. This was before cell phones and, of course, Internet, so... The thing with cell phones now is, you know, you walk down the street and the toughest guy could be talking on a cell phone. He's not bothering with you. He doesn't give a shit about you. You know, which makes it a lot freer if you're not talking on a phone. Where, you know, in earlier days and before my days even, you know, gang of guys or a bunch of guys on the street, they're looking for something. They have nothing to do. They're restless. So they see somebody and say, well, man, let's start up with him. So they would kick his ass. Now everybody has a phone, so they're occupied. So it had that sense, but that's always what made New York and to all the filmmakers and the film noir people so exciting. It still does, you know, whatever the parts of it that are left of that. The essence of it is still there. underneath. I mean, when the first time I moved back into the city, because I was one in the city, when I was 18 in my own place, on the Lower East Side was one of the most exciting, happy days of my life, because I knew I was surrounded by the greatest masters of the music at that time, the greatest jazz players, except for a couple who really did really well, who were living uptown on the West Side. We're living down there. Plus the whole art scene and all the abstract expressionists who extended, who came out of that. Some of them weren't discovered that way, but... And all the experimenters, too. Dance was still happening. It was still pioneering, writing. That was just an exciting place to be. But in the 70s, by the time I met Alan, it was starting to simmer down a bit. But it was still a great place. But it was a limbo period. Yeah, so the early 70s, you know, you guys were, the compilation that you referred to, was put out by Max's Kansas City, you know, which was sort of your haunt in the early days in terms of, you know, there's a live album that was recorded there, of course. And it feels to some extent like you guys are kind of paving the way for an extremely fertile period. where clubbing and going out to places like the Mud Club and Studio 57 takes a different form where anything goes. You can play an album. Elvis record, you know, next to like an early electronic thing. And I feel like you guys are sort of setting the stage for that a little bit at this point, or part of like a small crew that's musically setting the stage for. for this kind of free thinking? Well, if we were to an extent, it's only because what we were doing was being done. Once you do what we were doing on stage, then it's like, okay, if you can do that, we can do this. I think there were a lot of bands maybe have said that who came after James. James Chanson went on No Wave. People said, would it hurt us? that way but there was a definite movement going on behind the scenes bands didn't we didn't know most of the bands and they didn't know us but there was this which culminated in like this glam rock scene which then went into punk and all those bands were around locally The Dolls, Eric Emerson, and the Tramps. David Johansson was an early supporter. Yeah, he was definitely an early supporter of us. He's one of those people who just got us right away when others were running out of the Mercer Arts Center, the blue room we were playing. But places like the Mercer Arts Center were kind of like... points, cathartic scenes where all these bands came together and got to know each other because that's the way Mercy was like about. I don't know, five to ten, more than five separate theaters, small theaters, some large like little movie theaters. And they'd have bands in each one simultaneously on many nights. It was a great concept on two floors. So all of a sudden, all these bands started coming out of like, you know, the wings. That was something that needed to be done. I think whether we were there or not, I mean, a lot of bands didn't. know where we were coming from at all, didn't relate to us that way. Especially in the glam rock scene, but some did. But I know Debbie and Chris, they were around. Debbie was part of another group even before I heard her called the Stilettos. You know, these were all kids who were musicians, local musicians, doing stuff with bands, basically had no place to play. And Max's didn't come later. The first Max's was another scene altogether on another ownership, which closed. And you couldn't get in there if you were... We got in for two showcases as it was closing, but out of incredible circumstances, another story, which ended up to... bother you with here. But otherwise it was impossible. You couldn't even walk in. Max's carded people walking in. If they saw me waiting, they wouldn't even let me in. We're two street. And Mercer Art Center was the first one to kind of bring that all together. And then the reopening of Max's. CBGB is becoming a venue. They had been around for years, but nobody was in there. It was like just a drinking joint. At the time, Mercer Arts Center actually collapsed at some point, but New York Dolls played some famous gigs there. Obviously, you identified it along with like a lot of other kids that needed a place to go, needed a place to play, needed a stage as something that brought people together that was crucial. After the record comes out, you develop some fairly high profile fans, you know, tour Europe with Elvis Costello, 23 minutes over, over Brussels live recording where the audience doesn't get it in a profound manner. And, uh, You know, Springsteen obviously has been like an avid supporter. He's still playing Dream Baby Dream. What do you think it is about your music that inspired such rabid fandom on the part of these like superstar musicians? Do you think it was like... you were doing what they wish they could do or what was going on there? I wouldn't say that. And the first ones, recognizably, like from that world, was The Cars, too. Because they had just emerged at that time also. So it became big with their first record. But I couldn't say what it was except as I think to some people like the Cars and Rick and maybe Bruce Springsteen, there's something about it musically because they are astute musicians above all, very astute. And then there's something. Maybe just internal. There's something in the way it comes out, the intensity, coupled with the musical references which are to them. I wouldn't say it's something they wish they did. I think it's something that sometimes they like to... play with, and try. It's really impossible, very difficult to say what that, you know, when we first started early shows, when I heard what we were doing, from my exalted perspective, I heard we were going to be, we could be as big as the Beatles. Because the Beatles, that was our immediate predecessors, was stadium rock, gigantic stadium rock. I had a whole wall of Fender bass amps and guitars. And when I heard, you know, that's what we sounded like on stage to me. And I think to Alan as well. We never spoke about that. We just knew, you know, we're going further with this. But the stadium scene was winding down in many respects, except for a select few. And we ended up being hardly able to get a gig in clubs. That's, you know, it's what they've heard. I don't know. There may be a certain essence of... I think it's hard to verbalize it, especially for me. I don't know for them. I think each one is maybe a little different in why they came to it. The resonance is interesting, though, because in doing research, for this interview. I began to listen through the discography, through some of the releases from the 2000s that I wasn't as familiar with. But one record that I've been a fan of since right after Red Star was the self-titled debut from 1980. And it begins with Mary, which... you know for my money is like one of the most beautiful sort of instrumentals ever created and I see a lot of connections with that tune in particular and early craft work or like German electronic music And I know that, you know, Alan had turned you on to Cannes and stuff like that, but that sort of starts a journey that is actually, like, more musically revolutionary than Suicide, with, like, your solo career. Like, these are truly out-there records that, you know, it's tough to find an immediate predecessor for something like... lay nymphs or stigmata. I mean, can you talk a little bit about how you took it even further out? Because it seems like the theme that we keep getting back to is what you're trying to avoid is complacency, you know, and the fact that you never really found, you know, a niche where you were, you know, in a penthouse doing a few sessions a week and completely accepted by the industry. That's what kept you pushing. to this day, yeah? No, that's what keeps me, that's what pushes me forward now. I can't find complacency artistically. I would never want to, actually, anymore. It's not my nature. understand now looking at what I've done or where I've done it. And in terms of some of those early electronic influences, was Craig's sort of integration of the Jamaican dub techniques on self-titled, was that like pretty revolutionary for you as well? With all due respect to Craig, I had never heard what he did when he came into the studio. I didn't even know Craig was a... a composing musician as well. I had never heard of Craig Leon. I don't think Alan had either. You know, we weren't, Craig was already part of a very astute world in the music business, which we weren't. We were still on the outskirts of it. There's no way, you know, Sire and all the Warners and all those kind of labels. You know, we were... And the few labels that Marty, maybe one or two, had us audition for just passed quickly on Mercury. Ones that he had contacts with from his past. And when Alan mentioned... Very early on, hey, there's other groups doing kind of a similar thing. He didn't play them for me, but he said, you know, there's Cannes. A couple more. The name skipped me right now. I'd have to look them up again. It's been a long time since I tried to think. They were kind of in the world equal almost to stature, to known stature as Cannes at that point, but I don't know if they've done that much since. So I said, "Okay, that's good to know." I think maybe he did play a little bit in front of me because we didn't have, I couldn't go online and play them. I didn't have the records. So I heard him right away, and I said, you know, to myself, I said, well, yeah, but that's great, but it's not, it doesn't influence me because it's not me. You know, I just, I don't hear it that way. I mean, it's great. It's not my way I would do it. A lot of my electronic genesis, how you describe it, is that it came out of the music itself. Suicide, in the development of itself and electronically, how I found myself navigating through what I was discovering and creating whatever that place was to create that sound for me, got other ideas out of suicide. And out of, you know, which came about as a combination of what I had been doing before. I couldn't separate any of it really from the early rock that I was brought up on all the jazz. The first solo album was, I think the main idea that got me day one on it to start it was like, wow, how would that sound as an instrumental? How would suicide sound as an instrumental? We now have this beautiful ship in a bottle, as they used to say, this fragile, beautiful form, suicide, vocal. But wow, I've started to hear the potential, not specifically in notes, of taking out the vocal, and now you have a kind of a track. So that got me into the studio day one when Charles Ball, ironically, opened up the possibility, asked me to do a record with him maybe very soon after that. And then the rest just came again from the musical decisions based on what... I heard and saw myself doing. It's really just hearing what you're doing, seeing it visually too, not necessarily in specific images, and then going, well, this could be here, this could be here, this could be here, this works. Of course, we did that record. It was very little editing that way. We weren't working online or in a sequence. That's always been the process in a way. So I found that my initial idea was to maybe see what happens if I just take Suicide out of the vocal range. Created that record and several others after. Then of course I started bringing in vocals in various ways, various philosophies after too. And then on that record, too, with Baby Oh Baby. At that period of time, Alan has like an Elektra contract, right? Oh, what time? That was, yeah, that was right, yeah, a little after that. That's right. And Alan was... Through Z Records. Yeah. A couple years later. Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah. And so he's sort of part of this downtown... scene and you know you guys are both you've been known for a very long time uh you've been notorious in the downtown scene for well over a decade at this point and alan alan mentioned at the time like getting caught up in some of the trappings of going out and you know i mean you guys look great like a very specific thing and like did you did you also get into the nightlife at that point beyond performing or well more of an extent than i might now but uh not to any great extent uh i don't think because the only clubs I guess when Alan started with Elektra, because Michael Zilker from Z asked him to do his first record with Jukebox Baby, and then apparently someone else we knew who actually knew very well who brought us, signed us for our second suicide album, Howard Thompson. I believe, was working for a lecture at the time. Or it may not have been Howard at that moment. But in any case, they asked Alan to go from that record to an electric record. But now we're talking about the 80s. So by that time, the clubs, Max's was pretty much closed. It was closing and closed probably by, I think, 80, 81. CBGB's was a regularly showcasing band. kind of experience, but that aspect of the scene was kind of not there. So now you had, like you mentioned, the Mud Club, a few other places popping up and closing down. And for me, they weren't necessarily places I wanted to hang out in. I could still go hear an air because I could walk a few blocks and go to CBGB's, but not necessarily hear a band. A lot of nights it was on or off nights too, but you'd see a lot of people you knew. Alan, yeah, Alan started to more so during that period because he was living in a hotel situation, part of that life more, and especially when the electric record came out. Yeah, part of that set. You've seen New York go through various peaks and valleys that you've described, like the boom and bust. cycle and you know you've watched manhattan be transformed by people like our current president into something that must be unrecognizable to some extent like do you still see pockets of the old new york are you inspired by the new form that it's taken no i'm not I'm not turned off by it totally, except for the cost of living in general, which has made, partially what's made new arts very difficult to flower in New York. Although a lot of that is, I think, because of the evolution of those arts themselves at this point. But it's been happening since really the late 70s more intensely. And there's a lot of pockets. Yeah, you walk on the west side. You walk around Hell's Kitchen. You walk around Chelsea, west of Chelsea. 23rd Street and 6th Avenue. Brooklyn, of course. Parts of Brooklyn. And yeah, you see that old New York is still there. Not necessarily in all the residents. They haven't torn it all down yet. And for somebody like me who's lucky enough to have been brought up here, the ghosts of this town are still around. So I get, you know, I can get a really... full sense sometimes being in New York because I know everything in my life that has happened and everything that's happened to me. It's like all the chapters of my life essentially, visually, are in this town, based in this town. So if I go by a certain park, if I go by this or that, I can remember sometimes spontaneously three or four or five incidents of my life. starting from an early teenager or before based on that park, the Washington Square Park, just for me has so many different stories just at different periods of my life, way before suicide and after. And you can imagine how many stories that park has in general, if that place could talk. No, you can find it. It's still here. It's still a great town. It's still got, you know. Great energy in comparison. You can still find more of what you're looking for, essentially, in terms of you need something. Except a UCD. It's hard to find a UCD shop anymore. Used bookstores are, of course, endangered species. But if you're looking for a certain can of paint or a certain material for art or a certain vitamin or this or that, well, vitamin, you can still find it online better. But a lot of times you can just make a call or run right out of your pad and you can get it, which is not the usual thing in most or just about every city, even big cities. Montreal is good for that too. So it's, you know, it's still a great town. I think people who come here from outside tend to blend into the energy of it, you know, because there's no choice. It's the environment. It's the amount of concrete and the height of the concrete vis-a-vis the amount of nature, which is just about none, and the amount of people. You know, it's like you put those factors together. It's a very... kind of, I guess, a mathematical thing. It creates a certain rhythm and a certain headset to a certain amount of comfort and discomfort and stress and a certain amount of intelligence. You take out jazz, again, you take out a lot of the real experimental artists in dance and art and writing that were there. In the 60s, you're going to have less. Same thing in Paris. Paris is like that too now. Where's the, you know, the art scenes of before, but Paris is still there. It may still be to some. a museum, a beautiful museum or an amusement park, but especially for people who are brought up in Paris, they can find, they won't take, they won't tear that down consciously because they know that's a real attraction. So Paris is still there, for the memories anyway, for some, you know. who lived enough in that space. You know, when we've spoken about other groups, with suicide, there's a way to trace what Alan was doing, back to Iggy Pop, who was himself inspired by Jim Morrison, so it's in this lineage of American rock frontmen. With you, it seems like you're more inspired by walking around or your wife or going to the bookstore than, you know, checking out what the latest groups are. Like, you hear it, but it seems like... you know, you're like, oh, that's not me, though. I'm this city. I'm, you know, walking to the store late at night. I mean, would you say that you're more inspired by experiences? Yeah, but also the experience of music. I think that's what the experiences you've had in music, in specific pieces that have moved you. I think when you move by, say, a track or... It could be anything. It could be jazz, classical. When you sat there and say, wow, that is really cool. That's really good. You're hearing it in a more profound way than just hearing it passively. Someone said that a conductor named Celibidache, Sergei Celibidache, great conductor. Someone said Celibidache. Romanian conductor. He's had a lot of recordings. I think he mentioned it. But it becomes an experience internally that then affects what you do viscerally, not necessarily consciously all of them. And all those experiences also, and of course your living experience. But when we're speaking about creating something like music, it's really a lot of what you love and what you've loved in the past and what you still love, that infatuation of hearing a piece. I can hear something now that I've heard 30, 40 times and a certain piece and I'll go, wow, shit, that's fucking beautiful. Like we were talking about Little Richard before. Little Richard. Or WC. Coltrane. It's the stuff that holds up to you. And sometimes when you're working on something, you're going for something that you weren't really conscious of before, and then all of a sudden you hear a piece that you've heard maybe 50 times. And you get an idea because it kind of complements exactly. It tells you something about what you're... doing then. It gives you an idea for what you're doing then. So you've heard it all those times, but you never focused, heard it that way. And now all of a sudden it's like, holy shit, he was, yeah, there's an idea for me on what I'm working on now. And if you're not working on something then, it's sometimes it'll just go by you in that sense. You're not going to necessarily derive an idea from it. Except for the fact that it's beautiful to you and you dig it. So I think primarily for music, it's the musical experiences I've had. And I don't even know if it's primary, but yeah, all the life experience. I could not separate Mari. from what my life was about and how that affected my music, although I was already a musician before I met Mari, how it grew and was affected through that coming together, and my relationships now and before, my life as a kid, as a teenager in the park, you know, with groups, guys, girls. the music coming through all the time out of the streets. The beautiful thing at that time was the music was always, everybody had a little transistor radio, like now they might have an iPad or iPod. And the music was coming right off the corners. So you related to it because they were all like people you knew. You know, a group would be... singing on a corner, a guy would come in and say, hey, that might be cool. How would you like to make a record? They'd cut a record the next day and a two-track, and then the guy who made the record would go out and plug it and pay some DJs and whatnot and start getting it on the radio. And it happened that fast. It was coming right off the grassroots. So it had a genuineness to it that you related to totally, and it was coming out fresh. Every time you put on the radio every day, you had a whole bunch of fresh new songs. Cool, good ones, great ones. Because it was the early part of the genre, so everything was starting from scratch, pretty much. Not totally, but soon. But it came out of jazz before that, in the 40s. Big Joe Turner and all this, he was singing rock and roll. Shake right on roll. Led right into the 50s. We didn't know that then, we just heard it and went, wow. That's our music. I can get the nerve to ask the girl out now, maybe with this on. Ask her to the dance. Well, I'll dream about her anyway because, man, you know. And this was something that, you know, Alan was so good at channeling. Like, he was an unhinged crooner, you know. And, I mean. You know, you guys obviously, Mute did their large reissue campaign. You know, you kind of had this sort of triumphant comeback and, you know, performed the first album at Altamira's parties. And of course, Alan passed away last year. get the feeling that suicide never really ended per se like it well it never did especially up to that point and maybe after i don't know for sure well not the when i heard us as big as the beatles and we're talking about maybe uh 71 or 72 The reality of that development for us, the evolution, would be years and years of never being as big as the Beatles, but a certain something else that was maybe big or as big. but could take 40, 50, 60, 70 years. So it's another kind of a recognition that seemed to become, of course, more and more profound in time. That's probably still happening now because, you know, what we did and even the records I do, a lot of them, like you mentioned, you know, they don't fall on mass ears. But somehow if they don't fall totally through the cracks. If there's something in the music that doesn't have them that way, they get pulled back in. Suicide gets pulled back into a revaluation. And it's the same with a lot of artists of the past. I mean, Van Gogh never sold one painting. It's a perfect example. in his lifetime and who could deny van gogh you know he still revealed looked at like crazy and sells for incredible amounts of money so that was our destiny obviously Not to be, although the Beatles are still remembered today too. They're one of the groups that could have it then and have it after. That was ours. It can't be planned. It can't be conceived. You just do what you do and then see how it plays out. And so it may not be, you know, it doesn't end in that sense probably. For all we know, there should first be a certain... We're bringing back of what was suicide about. Let's write about it. Let's maybe do a documentary. It's all food for the mill, as they say, too. Gist for the mill. Well, thanks for continuing to provide us with Grist for the Mill, Martin. It's been an honor to speak with you. Thank you. Congrats on the new record. Thanks. Looking forward to wherever you decide to take it next. All right, cool. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Me too. Thank you. Ciao. Ciao. Thank you. Bye.
