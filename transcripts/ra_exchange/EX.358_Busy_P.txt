so Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Busy P. The man born Pedro Winter had a front row seat as French dance music became a globally influential force. He was Da Punk's manager when they released Homework and Discovery, the albums which made them into the superstars we know today. Then he founded Edbanger Records, an imprint whose anything goes mashup of disco, metal, hip-hop and rock. pop, electro and much else besides, helped turn a generation on to dance music and greatly influenced the EDM boom in America. But his roots as a DJ stretched back to the 90s and he's lived through numerous cycles of hype and bust. And with Edbanger Records celebrating its 100th release, we had Antoine Carbonneau check in with Winter to hear its full story. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Busy P is up next. ♪ I was just going out a lot. First in raves like early 90s and then discovering more the club scene with Laurent Garnier and the Rex wake up on the Thursday night. And maybe because I'm tall and I got a big... smile and speaking with everybody and maybe because I was spending a lot of time in the record store also at the time like radio FG was really really important for this culture. This is where we were hearing where to go to you know to get the bus to go to this rave or to another one and most of the DJs were going to FG. at the time and this is where I connect for example I met guys from Motorbass at Radio FG and met the Daft Punk boys too you know Paris is a small town you know so it's and when you have a same passion for for culture or for music you can easily meet most of the the people involved So I've been playing those parts for one year and then Daft Punk came to DJ. One day I had lunch with Thomas and he told me that they were working on their first album, Homework, and they will need a guy to help them, like a right hand man. It wasn't about managing. I didn't know how to manage a band. I was 21 years old, didn't know anything about music business. So I was just there to help them to reply to the faxes. At the time, it wasn't even email. So maybe some listeners don't even know what is a fax. Crazy because we were at a really revolutionary time. The internet arrival makes our life way easier. When you started working with Daft Punk, I guess Thomas' father helped you a bit, Daniel Vanguard. a key player in the French music industry. Did you work with him? Did he give you advice? Yeah, it's true that Thomas Fathor was a very good help. I think he is even like a kind of a teacher for me. He was backing up what we were doing. He was giving advice, of course, to his son, but he was also giving advice to the band. to the people who were working on the project. So yeah, he knew about it. And he was involved in the, you know, like the big French disco boom back in the 70s. So he knows about music business more than anyone. And it was a good teacher. Do you remember specific advice he gave you? Specific advice? Yeah, there are plenty. Even though he was giving advices, I think Thomas and Guimane already, by their own character, knew what they wanted to do and most important, what they didn't want to do. And this is the key and kind of not the secret, but the recipe of Daft Punk. Everybody wants to be number one. Everybody wants to sell records. Everybody wants to tour. wants everything Daft Punk you know they knew what they didn't want to do like what like they didn't want to play the you know the celebrity game they didn't want to play too much with the media and this thing and they wanted to really push the music first and see the reaction. And I think when you look at today's results, I think they did a pretty good move. They are the biggest band on the planet and they can jump in a train. go buy some bread and no one will, you know, hassle them or anything, you know. So, and I think they manage, you know, to... give power to the imagery or the image of the record and the music which sometimes can sound a bit bad because sometimes you say oh yeah but let's the music only speak and this is still important today for Justice or for Redbanger in general and I think the Daft Punk boys started it. pretty well like investing you know most of their money into the videos into the live show of course and So yeah, it was a great time. What was the feeling when you started to receive hundreds and hundreds of faxes every day? I didn't think too much. We were young, so it was just a good dynamic and it was an exciting time. At that time, it was the beginning of flying to Tokyo. New York to you know traveling that much now we are a bit more used to it but 20 years ago for a French you know band to get attention from all around the world like that and travel that far and it wasn't something very common so it was just I don't know like exciting and I think we were enjoying it as much as possible by working hard also by proposing stuff all the time and make great project and when you look back at their career now you can salute and realize that They created a piece of art, whether you like or not Daft Punk. They are pretty much a very respected band, like Radiohead. So that's pretty amazing. I feel pretty lucky to have been close and work with them like that. But it's good also, you know, like life is... multiple chapters. I only have a good souvenir, but I'm happy today to have Edbanger as a new project. Just to continue a bit on Daft Punk, when you look at their career nowadays and how they make their choices and everything, everything seems to be in control. But when we hear you talking about the beginnings, it looks like it was a pretty euphoric time. How much thinking was involved into the beginning of Daft Punk? You can enjoy time and see. think I didn't say that everything was crazy and of course everything was like you know like the first they are smart you know so that's a good start and after that of course every decision was you know like we had brainstorm and we were not alone you know we were working with Virgin Records at the time so we had a team we had people to speak with and exchange and write plans you know like it's control you know sometimes people can get scared about this world but control stuff is more like Talking about Daft Punk, it's a very good, you know, they were fully aware of what they were doing, fully aware about their choices. And again, they, you know, like when you look at the result today, it was a pretty good move to know what they wanted to do, etc. Then what was your plan when you started at Bunger? because it was like not the label first it was like the headbanger entertainment yeah the managing company that I like I've been so at the beginning I was working with Daft Punk and then a few bands starting to call me to work with me and I started to work you know like the first artist I worked with after Daft Punk was DJ Medi, then Cosmo Vitali, then Cassius, so a few other artists. And I quickly realized, to be honest, that the way I was working with Daft Punk wasn't a good move for the other artists. You know, like there was only one way to work with a band like that. So I quickly moved to, you know, like... It was like two or three years of managing other bands and the result was not that good, I have to admit. So in 2003, when I started at Benger, it wasn't a plan at all. I think inside of me, I wanted to create my own project. Thomas and Guy Manuel had their own label, Roulet and Cris d'Amour. So maybe, again, I'm not even sure it's that, but maybe inside of me I wanted to create my own label. I understand that I probably wanted to also run my own business. Being part of the Daft Punk adventure was, again, amazing, but it wasn't my project. And when I started to work with them, Daft Punk was already, you know, like famous, not even famous, but they already had like Daft Punk and Soma. Alive, Da Funk and Indosilver Club on Soma. So they released already three EPs and I felt I wanted to create something from scratch and this is what happened with Headbanger. With a Mr. Flash release. Yes, Mr. Flash came to my office, to this office in fact, and he wanted me to be his manager. At the time he was more like a hip-hop producer, he was producing French band TTC. And he was more like kind of the, I used to call him the French LP, you know, from Def Jux. He was like really more like an alternative hip hop producer. But I wasn't interested in managing him. At that time I was working for Daft Punk and also with DJ Medi and it was enough. But he played me Radar Rider and I fell in love with that track. And even today, I played it the other day to Mike D from the Beastie Boys and he was like, wow, he didn't know about that song and he loved it. And there is a DJ Shadow twist in it and I think... and something very cinematographic also in the music. For some reason, at that time, it was all about French touch, you know, filter, the disco house and stuff like that. I decided to launch a label with something that was completely opposite to that. And it's like an instrumental hip-hop beat. And yeah, without any plan, without any goal, without any concept behind it. You know, it was just, okay, let's put out this record. I'm going to see, you know, how it's going to be. And few people know, but the B-side of that... that Mr. Flash record is a track from Philippe Zard from Motorbass, Cassius. And I stole that from his studio and I had this electro beat called Fist and I liked it. So it's a beautiful record when I'm looking at it again. And then the second record was the Justice remix, which was meant for like a remix contest organized by a local radio station in France, right? Exactly. At the time, like it was the first album of Simian, the English band. French radio started a contest to remix Never Be Alone and Justice lost. And I met the Justice boys probably like a month after this contest. In fact, it's Somi, the art director of the label, who introduced me to them. And after the dinner, they invited me to their bedroom and Gaspard played me Never Be Alone. And I loved it immediately. say that I knew that they would become such a successful band and such important in my life but I felt the song was exciting and amazing and fresh and maybe got all those ingredients that people wanted to hear at that time a mix of you know like of course you know, funky music, you know, with this really French touch, funky bass, you know, for example, but also with this kind of indie singer from London. Simeon, those kind of electro beats. So it was a mix of all this and I take no credit for anything. I was there at the right time and they did the magic and maybe my only good work at that time was to push them and take them with me. traveling all around the world and introduce them and it went well like I went it went pretty fast it took few years you know to build you know just this career you know I really insist on them to make a lot of remixes I think it was a good good school you know Never Be Alone was probably their second or third track they did together in the studio so even when I when I had dinner with them at that time they were graphic designer So they were making music for fun. They didn't even know it would become their life. When did you start thinking of Justice as a band and working on the concept and the imagery and everything? 2003 was the release and you know we we get a call from djl from gigolo record maybe a year or two after the release on headbanger so we started to think okay if if this kind of people are interested wants to license it you know for germany and make it pretty big in germany okay so maybe it should be a bit serious and then when they started to make remixes they started to have their own sound They are very quick, they have their own production skills because again they are really smart guys. Were you in the studio when they were building their signature sound? Yeah, because we built their studio in a basement. We took them from their bedroom to a proper studio, to a proper cave which became a studio. But yeah, I think they've learned their... production skill at the same time they were making their records. The studio they had in their bedroom and the studio they have today, there is a big gap. But we started to... In fact, they decided to become a real band pretty quickly. they started to tour and so I will say like after two or three years Justice was definitely their main project rather than thinking of the about doing a graphic design and do you remember the kind of conversation you had back then about the the concept the sound No, no, not especially. All I remember is that we were like Xavier, Gaspar, Somi. Somi has always been the third member of Justice, let's say, and his advice was really important. I think the whole graphic, the whole idea about playing with the heavy metal codes and bringing it together with a more electro thing. was something we can really credit him for that and after that the sound itself it's really their recipe and their magic you know at the time you know I was really calling it like a heavy metal disco and they like you know like the heavy metal imagery they even like heavy metal music itself And I have to admit when they play me Waters of Nazareth for the first time, I was a bit skeptical, let's say. And, you know, like it was a kind of a Giorgio Moroder and Slayer, you know. clashing together so I had to play it again to really understand and from that I think the energy they managed to do on the first album was really the sound people wanted to stage dive in clubs and again it's again a story I know I told you this a bit earlier about bringing people together. But again, you know, what I think what I've done in 1996 in clubs, Justice did it again in 2006 with 2007, sorry, for the first album, Cross. He had like, again, like the pitchfork and the fader and, you know, all the people, you know, who are not supposed to get together sometimes. And it was an interesting time. But again. feel pretty lucky to be there at the right time, you know, at the right place at the right time. Also, a key club was in Paris at that time, the Social Club, which is strongly associated to the story of the label. It's kind of your own base in Paris. Yeah, it's very important. I think for all genres of music, like Trezor in Berlin or Twilo in New York or Madame Jojo's in London or your Ministry of Sound in London or The End in London, depending on your age. always associate a club to a label or to a genre of music and for us at that time it's true that Social Club was really the club that was pushing the French artists and the energy was you know like was fitting you know the sound we were doing so besides Paris you got a really nice reaction for your sound in the US as well Were you expecting that? I don't expect anything. We are just doing things for ourselves. And after that, if we can share it to the world and get good feedback, it just makes life even better. But again, we don't make much plans. So getting the good feedback from the US was great because this is a country we love. This is a country that influences most of us, like Detroit Techno, House from Chicago, or Garage from New York. This is where it's coming from. So even though the early days of French Touch... embrace those styles and spit it their way and create it like in the mid-90s French touch. It's funny to see that 10 years later, 2006 or 2007, what we were doing, which was called the French touch 2.0, like the new kids from Paris, reinvent a new style and this style influenced what later became EDM or whatever. And that's, you know, that's a cycle thing. So that's funny. And that's always, of course, interesting to, you know, to play and meet American artists. We can speak about it for hours about like the, you know, like again, the remix of a remix of a remix. Right now, it's a bit scary what is happening in the electronic market in the US, for example. But we can't complain about that. I'm not a judge to say it's good or bad, but it's true that it's becoming a bit... a bit crazy. What's your take on EDM? I don't have any take on EDM except that some of the success stories are pretty impressive. You know, when you look at Skrillex, for example. I know him personally and I know he has amazing production skills. So you can't take that off from him. After that, seeing him play for one hour is like, you know, like really... there is a crazy energy that you will never see anywhere else and this again you can just credit it for them you you can't for that you can't make fun out of it so but it's it's a it's a it's really like something that belongs to america you know like this there is kind of you know in europe we are not familiar with a spring break or stuff like that So EDM is like really part of the youth culture of America. So it's something that we can't really understand here in Europe. We can experiment it, you know, I'm happy to. to go and feeling it and discovering it. But of course, personally, it doesn't influence me, doesn't touch me, doesn't interest me that much. It's another scene, exactly like the Bear Game or Panorama, Techno. thing is another genre that you know its own genre you know like and in the middle of this there is us there is plenty of other people and uh and and that's cool like that you know like there is a space for uh for everybody except for example when i'm because i'm laughing a little bit talking about a bear game or panorama i have probably more connection with what the dj are playing at panorama than what people are playing at ultra or EDC or all those EDM festivals but this is also something more personal about electronic culture and stuff like that so I managed to speak about Panorama and Bear Game in an EDM discussion and I played Bear Game How was it? That was fun What did you play? Techno You play, you can't really, if you play techno at Bear Game. This is, well, I played techno and the Beastie Boys and the bouncers and the bartender came to say thank you to me. So that was a pretty, I played like the 6, 9, 6 a.m., 9 a.m. slot. And it was in 2009, I think. And it was, what, 9 or 10? I don't know. I have to find out the date. but it was the first time Bergheim tried to invite something from another galaxy and they promised not to do it anymore not because of us but because of their policy but we had a good night it was break both DJ Mehdi and myself and that was pretty funny but I have way better souvenirs in clubs from Tokyo or from other It's interesting, I love the fantasy about this whole Berlin nightlife. But I'm having more fun in Shibuya. And the Berlin nightlife, as you said, influenced a lot the Parisian scene in the last years, which were kind of a reaction to the social club years. How did you perceive this new generation? a new trend uh i don't uh to be honest yeah it's cool it's cool it's great uh amazing that they are copying Berlin, Paris pretending they are Berlin. Paris wanted to go back to 1992 doing raves in the suburbs. Amazing. That's how you say it? No, I'm kind of kidding. What do you want me to say? It's sad. Berlin is Berlin and if you guys want to party like in Berlin, jump in a train, jump in the car. take a bus you know me i took bus to go to mayday when i was a younger and mayday was a big thing at the time so i'm just laughing because you're saying it's like a reaction to to to the social club this is this is a promoter talk you know like this is a the one you i'm sure when you're speaking to the kids they don't care about what social club was or It's just a little fight from a few promoters. which I'm not part of you know like it just make me smile and I think we are stronger by creating our own things and we are good in again mixing people together I think we've been fighting all those years to break boundaries and especially in you know especially talking about electronic music you know where I think we have we are lucky to have open ears you know getting experiments you know listen at the UK dubstep or jungle or you can go far in the experimentation but at the same time still mixing the genre together and now you have really the techno heads on one side Even the gay scene now is completely disconnected to the house scene in Paris, which is terrible because, again, the best parties we had in our life was, you know... the gay crowd mixing with the young French guys and now you have the gay on one side, the techno on the other one, the whatever on the other side, it's the hip-hop going only on the hip-hop side and I'm a bit sad about that, you know, I'm not saying that we should always, you know, play hip-hop, techno, whatever together, I'm of course... up to spend like a techno night or house night but I think it's been divided a lot I don't want to sound like an old man because I'm still here and I have a lot of projects but I think those who are reacting as you said to the social club years I'm waiting for you guys to, I can't wait to read your story. I can't wait to see what you're going to do. And if you want me to be a bit nasty, I didn't read anything yet. No one really impressed me. You don't have any... There's no any producer you've been into for the past year? No French producer? I mean, from the French team, yeah. Help me. You help me. Resident advisor. No, I'm asking you. And me, I'm asking you. You help me because, yeah, I don't... Yeah. You want me to look at the next big French music festival? Look at the lineup. Kerry Chandler, okay, super. Laurent Garnier, yes. I mean, Nina Kravitz, wow. And when I'm saying that, I'm not making fun of those great producers. But it's just, again, if you want to react, if you want to create your own things, you have to give. I give it a lot of energy and it takes time, it takes passion, passions, love and I love to see, I really, I must say that I love to watch Bambounou DJing not only for his music but for the vibe he's throwing but again it's a bit easy to throw Bambounou name he's been the one a bit out of the there are so many stuff to say about But among the recent producers, artists you signed on the headbanger, so what were you interested in about them? Like Borussia, for instance. I signed Borussia because of the... the first about his production skills. I think the sound he has for such a young producer and a young producer working with a really small, equipped studio is impressive, you know, like and I was glad I think to sign him so quickly. I was even more happy when Oiseau, for example, who doesn't like anything, call me and say, man, who is this young producer? You know, the sound is amazing. So coming from Mr. Oiseau, with someone I really love, makes me even more happy for this new signature. And I think he has like a house sound, like something modern. Again, I'm saying that because... When I was mentioning Kerry Chandler, for example, earlier, I'm so happy. And, you know, like when I'm looking at DJ Pierre and Ron Trent becoming number one in the resident advisor top list, I can only be happy, you know, because I've been buying their record, you know, since 1995. So it's amazing that at last. Those guys are back on the map. But I didn't stop to buy Masters at Work records when no one cares. Look at Masters at Work five, six years ago. They were in zero festivals. Now, for the last couple of years, they are back and it's amazing. I love the heritage, I love the culture, I know about our electronic music, but also it's important for young producers and for example for Borussia. to propose something a bit more modern, you know, and in terms of production too, you know. I sang Borussia simply for my love of house music and same for Boston Bun. It was something similar, even though in terms of production, they have two completely different sounds. but their love for house music and the way they are spitting it in 2017 is interesting. And I want Ed Banger to be part of the house scene and I want Ed Banger to be relevant in 2017. So what's the sound of Ed Banger in 2017? The sound of Ed Banger in 2017... going to sound a bit pretentious but maybe what people sometimes are mistaken by calling headbanger sound by thinking about like Mr. Wazo or Justice stuck in 2009 you know distortion and stuff the sound of headbanger is a style itself you know and when you're going to play the head rack 100 compilation I hope you're going to be surprised, I hope you're going to be moved and realize that you can have one sound, you can have one label and being multiple, you know, multiple proposition. You know, the last signature of the label is a band called Dyslexic and no one would imagine this band will sign to Ed Banger. And we are the only one who get excited and get inspired by singing this band. It's a punk rock band with an African singer on the paper. You don't... sang it to Ed Banger and because the energy was good the project was crazy we wanted to be part of this and I think it fits you know it reminds me you know like ESG or Liquid Liquid or the early days of the Beastie Boys this is part of our DNA you know and so of course I sang this band but at the same time I grew up in clubs in love with house music so of course I'm going to sing Borussia and Boston Burn I'm in love with French disco of course we're going to sing Breakboat you know and I've been listening to hip-hop all my life and working with DJ Medif was like just a the best thing that could happen to the label. And when I'm looking at 2006, when we released Lucky Boy, the first ever album we released on Ed Banger from DJ Medi, it pretty tells everything I wanted to do with Ed Banger. You know, again, like mixing genre, proposing something that... kind of no one heard before you know like a hip-hop artist making an electronic music album for the club but not only some of the beats on the record are waiting for people to to rap on it or whatever but and it's this record still makes sense today so I believe, and maybe it's again, maybe it's a bit pretentious to say that, but maybe we are slowly but surely creating a Headbanger sound, you know, like and which will embrace all of this together. And to be a good player also, I can of course understand sometimes some critics, you know, like, oh, you're stuck into a noisy or, you know, banging sound. It's part of the game. We were famous because of that. And thanks to Sebastian, Oiseau and Justice. But if people don't, you know, go deeper and listen to Mr. Flash or to Mickey Moonlight or DJ Feeds, I'm not going to fight. You know, we are making proposition. It's part of the game. For example, talking about Feeds, I think he's one of the best DJs around. And his career, he's taking so much time. He's been DJing for more than 15, 20 years now. And his album was brilliant, but people were expecting some more justice or whatever. And the one who could be... you know, excited by Feeds. They were stuck somewhere else, I don't know, like into the UK scene or whatever, while they could be in love with Feeds. Same for Mickey Moonlight. I think we released a brilliant album from this English producer. Again, I can understand that the Ed Banger fans don't really get the sonority or the trippy vibe of this record, but sometimes you need to take some time to listen to some records. We were, I remember, in 2007, 2008. 2009 label of the year you know accelerator the fader pitchfork all those stuff and of course you can't be like that you know all your life and it's it's a cycle but i must say like for the last four four years since a year there is a bit of a nostalgia which makes me happy like oh People will be like "oh 10 years ago I grew up with Ed Banger and you were my entrance to electronic music" This makes me proud and happy, you know, even though those kids are going now to whatever other genre, more techno or stuff like that, in a way they are coming back home and say "oh okay wow the new Justice album is different than what we we listen to" and "oh you you have this new kid Borussia oh you have this" and the label is 14 years old and it's a long journey and I can't wait you know to to celebrate the 20 years anniversary of Ed Banger but now we are celebrating the 100th And now we are celebrating the 100th release. Are you still searching for new artists? Yeah, I'm always listening to stuff, you know. First, I'm a DJ, so I get my ears open, you know. Sang new artists. At the moment, we have already like 14 artists on the label. So I think it's enough for us, you know, to... keep going and work on a project especially more than half of them are still developing artists so it takes time we've been releasing like Wazow, Breakboat, Justice Cassius, a lot of big albums for us so now we're going to release more upcoming stuff and of course we have a new Sebastian record in the pipe So we're going to be busy for the next year or two. Just is going to go on tour. Yeah, it's going to be exciting. So Ed Bunker is obviously known for his music, the sound, but also for the covers that are made by Somi. How do you collaborate on this part? Somi gets the full control of the visuals. I think I probably refuse two covers only from him and the rest of the time he has total control and total freedom. And I often speak about, you know, the Tony Wilson and Peter Saville relationship for Factory Records or James Lavelle and Futura 2000 for Moax at the time. I think I was influenced by those duo, you know, because I'm more into collective adventure. Again, I'm not taking any personal credit. or the success of Ed Banger for the artist. And I think the relationship I had with Somi, again, fits perfectly what I wanted to show with the label. And it's coming from the street art thing, graffiti. but also he's adding a lot of pop culture. He's a big fan of Tom Vesselman, for example. And he has a very smart mind. And I think from the label, he has the biggest music culture. And I think all this makes his work. a very good point for the label. So I believe and I hope we are proposing good music and good records and great producers and adding it with a strong image and strong concept makes the label exciting and why we are celebrating 14 years in a pretty good way. Because that's important also for people to understand that we are still an independent label and the money we get from the success of Justice or stuff like that, we're putting back the money to invest in smaller projects. like feeds or dyslexic or stuff like that. I'm not a very good businessman, but I think I'm a pretty good family man. And you've done a lot of merchandising as well. Not that much. In fact, not enough to make money out of it, to be honest. Merchandising is also a way to have fun with, you know, again, as you can see in the office, of course, it's a podcast for people. can't get images but uh you know i'm i'm coming from the skateboard culture and from you know was born in the 70s so image object you know are important to us so the way we are doing t-shirts you know with with ed banger is more uh a way to to have fun with with you know and wear our own stuff rather than making a business plan you know like if we wanted to make money with our t-shirt let me tell you we will be better and we should be better in fact now you're making making a thing make me think we should be better at making and make millions Is there like one object that you're pretty proud of it? Oh, yeah. I mean, from the merchandising. You've done a few promo stunts as well. You've been pretty creative in this way. I think I've just seen when I entered the room, you've just done like a headbanger flipper. Oh, the pinball. The pinball, yeah. That's the kind of stuff that you like to do and that is also strongly associated to headbanger. We like, you know, like you know, we just did a pair of headphones with this Danish amazing company, III. We've designed some Nikes. We, you know, like we did some skateboards. I don't want people to think the money behind this, the business side of it. don't care you know like i'm just happy you know nike we didn't get any money out of it you know but it was just amazing to rock your own pair of shoes you know the pinball cost me 2000 euros to make it you know and if we sell it you know we'll make a charity or something out of it but you know we are just making it the concept Somi came up with the concept for the compilation with a pinball and he did a record sleeve like a pinball and the first thing I told him I said man I'm gonna make your pinball for real and We did it with the team. For example, we are doing t-shirts with the pinball design, but we are making 100 t-shirts. So it will cost me more money to make them. So it's just part of the global adventure. Of course, we are a music label, but aside from that, we are living in a modern world. where kids are asking for t-shirts, kids are asking for, you know, they want to own, they want to be part of it, you know, and often, you know, people, this is not me saying that, but a lot of people sometimes, oh, Ed Benger is a way of life. more than a music label, you know. And I kind of like it, you know. It's a general philosophy of sharing and being part of a movement, you know. And you've been saying a few times that you are doing stuff for the kids. Is this the way you sing at Bunger, like a label for youth? Definitely. Of course, I'm speaking to the youth. I'm 42 years old and I'm feeling pretty fresh. It's true that I'm using the word kids, but I think it's a bit pretentious to say, oh, I'm making music for the people. people older than 30, you know, and I don't want to have parties where we see only people of 30 or 40 years old, you know, and ask Laurent Garnier, he will tell you the same, you know, this is the most depressing, you know, to do a party with, you know, 30 or 35 years old people looking at you like, oh, yeah, oh, is this the, you know, like... Is he playing the basic channel 002? This will be the most boring thing. So of course we are making music for the kids to party. And I'm happy also to be in the middle of the kids when I'm singing again Laurent Garnier at Sonar in Barcelona. It was an amazing time. So when you're going to concrete or to, you know, I played the Peacock last year, crowd is young, you know, and I think maybe us as a bit older, as big brother. We have to share our knowledge and our passion with them, but in a positive way. And this is what I'm trying to do when I'm DJing, what I'm trying to do when I'm doing radio shows, when I'm doing playlists or stuff like that. My goal, in fact, as a DJ is to be a guide, but not to teach them or tell them what to listen, seeing what we have done for the last 20 years. maybe you know trusting you know and again I'm really impressed by the work of Laurent Garnier which was like not a teacher I know he will not like it but someone that you trust Giles Peterson people like that you know those guys opened my ears and in a way I know that we opened a few ears too Thank you.
