This is 27 Voice Notes About the Coronavirus, a collage of perspectives on how the crisis is impacting the electronic music community. This is really, really weird. It feels like... It's going to be a while. So when we don't work, we don't get paid. There's not much light at the end of the tunnel. Yeah, I don't really know what else to say. That uncertainty has really scared me. At the moment, I'm more worried about the basic health of people I know as well as millions I don't know. This is a serious existential threat for us. So it's a bit obscure to be in this place. Actually, the situation in town is like you are living in a horror movie, man, for real. And it kind of clicked at that point that we were actually probably going to be worse off than we thought. This will bankrupt us, will bankrupt many of us financially and emotionally. At this point, we have no idea how we're going to make it. We're all gig workers, we're all self-employed. It's just blow after blow in Australia at the moment for everyone, the whole community. Let's look after Ace, the independent promoters, and everyone else that's good in this scene. My name is Aaron Ricks and I'm a safer space monitor at Nowadays. And in conjunction to working at Nowadays, I'm also a freelance movement artist and art model. And with the rise of this coronavirus, like I'm out of work for an indeterminate amount of time. and being that all of my jobs basically just take place in gathered spaces. So for me, it's just become extremely nerve-wracking because I have no idea where any of my money is coming from. And I know a lot of my artist friends are having trouble with that as well too. So it's a really troubling time for us. A lot of artists and club spaces and club goers and a relationship you can kind of tie towards that, which for me feels like family because in a lot of those spaces that I partake in, we all care about each other. We all care for each other. We all celebrate together and we all experience music in the most existential ways. And without that sensibility. human connection or gathering, it just doesn't feel like real life anymore. And so it's a bit obscure to be in this place. But even in the midst of it, I still try to challenge myself and being and remaining hopeful and to like focus my energy on just like continuing to create and not just, you know, stagnate essentially. for me, I know that this will not last forever. And the name of the game at this point now is adaptation. And so we need to focus on that. And then above all of any of that, we need to also just remember love because at the end of the day, what else do we have? Hi, my name is Miao Wang. I'm based in Beijing and I run Ballroom China. Coronavirus exploded in Wuhan in January, and the quarantine started here early February, which is of course a disaster, but it could be even worse. Thank God it came around Chinese New Year, which is the longest holiday we have. Most people spend their time with family, go traveling, so it's the lowest season for clubs. therefore not much bookings of international DJs, and we have enough time to wait and see, then re-plan everything. Of course no one likes shutting down the business for any reason, but imagine if this happened in the hot season, faster spread of the virus, more people get sick, it would definitely be way more chaotic. Now as far as I know, some bars shut the business, most of which are somewhat high-end. In Beijing, we have one half gallery, half life house close, which is a big pity. Most of the underground clubs in Shanghai are back opening now, with of course more careful cleaning and disinfecting practices. Some kind landlords cut rent, also the government cut social insurance costs for employers from February to June. My company, for example, can save about 50% from insurance. and the staff still get their full payment working at home. We are looking at post-May event programming at the moment. Probably we'll focus on local talents and developing content online. I know it's pandemic, it's a disaster for everyone, but together we can survive this and maybe make this autumn the hottest party season. I am Luca, co-founder and artist planner of Basie Club in Napoli, south of Italy. Trying to talk about coronavirus effects on our industry, music industry, it's very important to underline that this critical situation hit us in full, practically broke our legs. As nightlife industry, we were the first one to suffer the effects of coronavirus from the beginning, the first days. being unfortunately considered here in our country as an entertainment sector, as an irrelevant sector. So already some weeks before today, when the diffusion was at the beginning, on the first steps, we were the first to have restrictions and conditions to respect that were impossible for a club. So all together with the other clubs in the city and area, we decided to close. even before the ministerial ordinance, because, you know, the health of people comes before everything. As you can imagine, in terms of business, that's a really big problem for us, not to mention a disaster. Being in south of Italy where summer is very hot and people love to stay outside, our annual work is reduced on six, seven months of planning with the summer break from May to end of September, something like that. So staying closed for a month at least and hoping for a little more, the impact on our business is very, very huge. Talking honestly, I can say that as Basic Club we come from a very positive season till now, but it could not be enough. Because even if we are closed, we have to face the same at fixed cost of structure like rent or utilities, salaries, bills and so on. So we have to tighten our belts and look forward, hoping that government will help us in some way. The underground scene in general was already in a big difficulty for many reasons and I can assure that I heard from many colleagues and other clubs in Italy and they are not sure that they can reopen when everything will be over so it's dramatic. Actually the situation in town is like you are living in a horror movie man, for real. So very few people on the streets in the morning, mostly with masks, nobody after 6 p.m. And in a sunny and friendly city like Napoli, where people used to live outdoors, on the streets, based on human contacts, it's really hard. My name is Kerry O'Brien, also known as Lady MC. I'm an artist and also the founding chief executive of the Young Urban Arts Foundation. Our mission is to empower the lives of young people by strengthening their mental health through music and the arts. The pandemic has impacted the whole youth charity sector. The key to changing lives is the ability to build strong relationships. And this situation will impact the lives of our young people, as not only were there limited access to provision before this, but now there is no access with face-to-face contact. As the founder, one of my biggest threats right now is to be able to sustain through such an uncertain time. All our funders including businesses and the corporate sector are being seriously affected financially Which is going to have a knock-on effect with how we are funded and as an artist like everyone there's no events with no pay So this is gonna hit us all extremely hard. My thoughts are with everyone struggling right now, but I know together we can get through this My name is Rodrigo Valles and I run a label and a series of parties called Discos Movimiento in Mexico City Even though most festivals and events related to our scene have been canceled or postponed due to coronavirus, the government and our president haven't given the proper attention to the subject. And still, there hasn't been any public announcement from the government, including restrictions or regulations at all. The statistics provided by the government are false, and we don't really know the magnitude of the problem. In fact, this past weekend, one of the biggest rock festivals happened and no one really seemed to care. Thousands of people were there and the health of the assistants wasn't really considered at all. Personally, this whole situation has affected the work we have been doing since June of the last year. Our whole upcoming programming is collapsing. Every day we are receiving emails from agents regarding cancellations in the next events. Despite of this, we are finding viable solutions together with the artists, agencies and venue owners. My name is Amelia and I co-run a Sydney-based booking agency and events company called Nectar. Australia is currently in a really critical period of social distancing to help minimise the spread of COVID-19 and this has meant that we've naturally had to cancel all of our upcoming events and tours and all of the artists on our roster have had all of their upcoming gigs cancelled. There's currently a crowdsourced initiative doing the rounds in Australia called I Lost My Gig, which is trying to calculate how much money has been lost in the music industry due to the virus. And as of today, it's calculating around 100 million with still so much more to be accounted for. The Australian music industry is far from lucrative at the best of times. And a lot of people are really wondering how we'll ever recover from this. And at this point, we really do need the government to be stepping in to help save the industry at large. And, you know, when all the bushfires were ravaging Australia... earlier this summer. It was the music community and the arts community at large that kind of were the first to step in and do big fundraiser events and raise as much money as possible. And now, yeah, now we've been really struck down. So it's... It's just blow after blow in Australia at the moment for everyone, the whole community. More specifically, I guess Nectar is a volunteer-run initiative, so not only are we not getting paid for the work we do within the company, we also are going to have to start sinking our own personal funds into keeping the company alive. The four of us who run the agency all work in the music industry in various capacities. And for all of us, that kind of means that we're sitting on a knife edge at the moment. This is a really uncertain time for us. Like it is for everyone the world over. We don't know what the future looks like for us. We can't do any forward planning. We have no income coming in. Our artists have no income coming in. It's a scary time. I guess we're resting on the fact that in some regards we're in a much more privileged position than a lot of people in our wider community and we're using that privilege to offer support to others who may need it more. We're also trying to really remain calm, hopeful, happy. We're supporting each other. We're trying to stay connected despite the chaos. Hey there, this is JF, Yuri and Vinten from Min Club in Hong Kong. We basically, us three, are owners, managers of the space. We are doing talent booking, communication, managing the people, the space, the cleaning, basically everything. As for the situation in Hong Kong, basically what happened is that in 2003, we already have an outbreak of that kind of virus. far more deadlier than that one. We had like 300 dead. Which means that when this outbreak started in early January, people were ready for it. They were ready, they were serious about it, and they basically adopted the right attitude. They had masks, everything. And all this led to a drastic restriction of the propagation of the virus. As of today, we only have less than 50 cases for a city of 7 million people, which is fantastic. And it means that we never had to close bar, restaurant and club. Just had to be really careful. Of course, we had to cancel a lot of gigs. I had to cancel 80% of the gigs of February, 100% of the gigs of March. And I think about 80% of the gig of April's. The difference between now and before is basically, it becomes very, very unpredictable. Before, let's say we had a good turnout for a local artist and a very good one for an international artist. and now we can get a really really really bad one for an international artist and a very good one for local artists and sometimes bad for both We don't know exactly what will happen during the weekend. Sometimes people really want to go out because they don't want to stay home too long and sometimes they just want to stay home. So we are facing this really, really, really imbalance basically. The overall mood in Hong Kong is not that good. A lot of people left. People are worried. In the past few weeks, it was quite okay because... the virus kind of stopped propagating in China and Hong Kong. But now that the virus is propagating in Europe, people are getting a bit more worried again. So we expect them to stay vigilant for at least four to six weeks. And we expect back to kind of normal in May, June and total normal, I think, by the end of the summer. My name is Ahad Adreem and I am a DJ and a producer. I run a record label called More Time Records. I curate parties for Boiler Room and also run my own parties called No ID, focusing on South Asians in London and beyond. So I just came back from a tour of Australia and Asia where three of the dates were actually in China. But obviously whilst I was out there, those ones got cancelled. One in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen. Yeah, I did play in Seoul and I played in Japan, yeah, played in Tokyo as well and Vietnam and Singapore. Taiwan and then yeah the main thing I guess for me to address was that like when I was in Taiwan there was 45 cases there and 45 cases in the UK. I was kind of keeping an eye on both numbers just because people were worried about me. But the UK number, you know, kind of just kept growing, but the Taiwan number just, you know, stayed constant at 45. The main thing that I noticed is that, you know, they've got so many precautions in place, that everyone wears a mask. When you go into clubs, you get a temperature check and, you know, there's hand sanitizer easily available. Even in some clothing stores, there was hand sanitizer that they sprayed on my hands. You know, people generally are just very aware and on it about stuff. And also when I landed at the airport, they checked me, asked me where I'd been in the last couple of weeks and everything. Whereas when I landed in the UK, all I got was just like this one leaflet that said, if you've been to these countries, then you should go straight home. And there was nothing that really enforced it. It was just like, you know, they kind of just, I walked straight through. the airport and no one checked me for nothing. So it's like, and then also, you know, no one wears a mask here. There isn't any hand sanitizer in the shops. The lack of measures in place in the UK is quite concerning. My name is Ananda. I'm a DJ and also a promote code, a queer party that happens every two months in Rio. And to be honest, I'm very concerned about the economic situation here in Brazil. Since we've been living in political crisis the few past years, and now everything tends to get much worse. We have a small but very united scene here in Rio. And so we're discussing... ways to help each other and to get together since we know there won't be any financial support from the government and the situation affects mostly smaller and marginal artists and people that really depend on events and come to survive. Hello, this is Tim Sweeney from the Beats in Space radio show and record label here in New York City. Yeah, the virus has affected us with having to shut down the radio studio. So no one can go in to broadcast from the WNYU studio anymore. We're... Recording from home and then uploading the show to my program director, who then is playing the show remotely on the FM airwaves. So I'm still going with the radio, but it. definitely feels different being at home and you know obviously having the guests on the show everyone has cancelled because no one can come to New York anymore. So it's, yeah, it's a different feeling, but we're making do, which I think, you know, everyone is trying to do. Just kind of put on the best face you can with the situation. You know, with the record label, everyone's working from home. It feels weird promoting records right now. Yeah, it's a weird time, but you have to keep going, which we're trying to do. And positives, the weather is getting nicer here in New York. Leaves are starting to come out. So, you know, that's a positive. But yeah, it is definitely a weird time here in New York, something I've never experienced anything quite like this here. And, you know, I'm hoping we get back to normal soon, but it feels like it's going to be a while. But I hope everyone's doing well. And I hope. yeah everyone stay safe and you know I'm going to keep doing what I can here in New York keep doing the radio and thank you all for still listening and being a part of the show I'm Matt Schultz and I'm the artistic director and founder of Unsound in Krakow Poland. COVID-19 is having such an enormous impact on the world, reshaping it so rapidly that it's very difficult to say how this will affect unsound. At the moment, I'm more worried about the basic health of people I know, as well as millions I don't know. And then there's the financial fallout, how that will affect people. Nobody knows how the world would look in a month, let alone six months. So to try to organise a festival in these circumstances is, of course, very difficult and very stressful. Be that as it may, we're doing our best to remain focused and really try to consider what might need to be reshaped from the theme. to the form of the festival itself. I should say that we're fortunate Unsound is taking place in the autumn and I really feel for all those organisers who've had to cancel last minute. That's the nightmare scenario. It goes without saying that I also feel for the artists who mostly live very precariously. This crisis has underlined just how fragile the music industry itself is in financial terms, existing around face-to-face gatherings and an ease that those of us in more privileged countries have taken for granted for a long time. Hello? My name is Fazia. I am a DJ and producer from London. As most people, I've had all my shows cancelled for this month and I think pretty much next month as well, with kind of uncertainties about the forthcoming months and the rest of the year. And also there was a lot of festivals that I was debuting at this year that I've never played before, which I was really excited to announce, which may not even happen anymore. And I know that's the case for a lot of other... DJs and producers like myself. In terms of my day-to-day life, I have now realised I haven't got this outlet to share my music on radio due to radio stations closing down, and rightly so, which is another way that I exercise my creativity. So that's kind of two means of how I express myself. being taken away from me due to the lack of urgency from our government and until they take this a lot more seriously and approach it in more of a socialist way then We just feel very uncertain about how long this is going to go on for, how long this is going to affect us for. And so that uncertainty has really scared me, especially as a freelancer. I have no surefire income, like a lot of people. My name is Forrest Desik. I run a music booking and management company called Azra. We're based in Detroit. We book tours in North and South America and manage a few artists. A couple Sundays ago, one of my artists, Sarah Devachi, had asked me if I was at all worried about the coronavirus, and I said something like, I'll say not yet. No promoters had even mentioned it at that point. But by Tuesday, within just a few hours, about 75% of the shows booked for the next two months were completely wiped out, and it kept going. I went and ran an errand, and then I came home, and at that point, I sat down and looked at my computer, and I just watched it. The emails looked like they were multiplying, and they were coming in so fast that there was no way I was going to be able to catch up in real time. And cancellation always means lost money, but this is something completely different. Usually it also means doubling or tripling my workload without compensation. sensation, but this was unreal. And a couple artists said that they weren't going to accept the cancellations. And it kind of clicked at that point that we were actually probably going to be worse off than we thought. And there's already been a glut of live shows. the states there are a lot of agents and there are tons of artists and sometimes it feels like more and more work for less of the pie and but it also means doing things in a more creative way which i really enjoy and at this point like i've also felt like my company was turning a corner we'd just built a new database and we had created new routing tools and this year was looking to be the best since i started the company four years ago But now, the fall is completely crazy. And who knows what it's going to look like on the other side. There are probably going to be less venues. Not even just less clubs, but also less institutions. There will probably be less jobs. Maybe my contacts will disappear between now and then. But I'm hopeful. Typically I think things turn out for the best or at least all the parts fall into place in the way that feels right, like they should be. And this is so crazy, I don't know what it'll look like, but I'm also hopeful that it will turn out to be an interesting time. Hello, my name is Caio Taborda. I'm from the Gobtan crew from Sao Paulo, Brazil. This is really, really weird, everything that is happening here. Everything happened really quick. I think until six days ago, no one was quite worried about all this. And during this period, basically every event was cancelled. So many big parties from our scene needed to be cancelled, included ours. We unfortunately, because of the lack of education in our country, We see that most of the people didn't realize how serious it is. So we see a big effort from the scene now trying to inform. Until three, four days ago, many events were still confirmed. You see this wave of information is getting everything, everyone. apart from what is going on. So we see all the events being canceled. All my DJ gigs and from my partners were canceled as well for at least for the next two months. We actually have an amazing scene. The damage, it's going to be huge for sure. But I'm pretty sure that this amazing and creative scene will be able to create something during this. period events are a human necessity so I'm pretty sure that we will be back maybe stronger thanks guys my name is Eileen and I run the council in Singapore the virus outbreak has resulted in multiple show cancellations and we've lost months of hard work that had been spent on planning these shows. While the outbreak here have been contained and kept under control, it's definitely affected the attendance at our events. We've seen a dip in numbers but I think both event organizers and ravers here in Singapore are starting to accept the precautionary measures as part of the new normal. Temperature checks, hand sanitizers and frequent hand washing have all become part of daily life and it's no different in a club or party setting. I think if everyone can get behind the idea of responsible raving, we can all take steps towards getting life back to a certain sense of normal. My name is Justin Carter, and I'm one of the resident DJs and founders of Nowadays in New York City. We decided to close Nowadays on Friday, which has had the obvious effect of putting a lot of people out of work for the foreseeable future. just like it has in so many other spaces and industries. Before this happened, I'd been thinking about running some kind of live stream to keep the Nowadays community connected if we had to close, so I already kind of had a skeleton of the plan in my head. And when it became a reality, I called Francois from the Lot Radio here in New York. where my partner Eamon and I have been DJing for a few years. And I asked him if he had any advice on how we could set up a stream. And it was pretty amazing. He said, you know, my event that I was supposed to have this weekend got canceled. So I've actually got the afternoon free. I've got a mobile setup. Why don't I just bring it down to nowadays and I can show you guys how to set it up. And in fact, instead of showing us how to do it, he just came and he set the whole thing up and stayed there until we were actually up and running that night. And since then, we've been able to stream something every single day since we've been closed. which feels pretty amazing. It's really nice to have a way to stay connected with our community. And it's given us a platform to raise funds for our staff through a Venmo account, which you can look up at. It's now a help in O-W-A-H-E-L-P. And we've also built. a subscription model to give ourselves some kind of income through Patreon. And if you're interested in checking that out, that's at patreon.com slash nowadays NYC. It's been really heartening to see the support that we've received so far. And honestly, it's just been heartening to see the support that we've seen people in the dance community giving to each other. When you know that so many of the people who are reaching out. to others are facing plenty of uncertainty themselves. At this point, we have no idea how we're going to make it. You know, the Patreon thing is going really well, I think, but nowhere near the level it would need to get to to be able to actually cover the cost that we have. We're pursuing a bunch of other angles as well. We're trying to talk to our landlord. about some kind of renovatement, though he has refused to talk to us so far, probably because he's trying to figure out what's going on himself, but it's still a little nerve-wracking. We're also talking to institutions and people about loans and trying to figure out how we can cut as many expenses as possible. It is definitely overwhelming, but I do have hope. And I don't just have hope for nowadays. I have hope that on the other side of this, that the world is going to come out in a better place. Because I think we're just seeing, you know, some of the problems certainly here in the States. with a lack of support for individuals. And I think it's really tough for anybody at this point to ignore that. It's getting thrown pretty hard in everybody's faces. And so my hope is that we'll come out on the other side of this understanding some changes that we need to make, and we'll be able to make those changes. My name is Susie Analog. producer, songwriter, composer, performer, creator of Never Normal Records, and I'm currently in London. I was in the Bolivar tour, and all of my European dates have gotten postponed, or, um, rescheduled. I operate a label. I'm concerned for my artists, the livelihood of my artists, in addition to myself, because they're still establishing themselves. I just toured in Asia in November. And interestingly, it's like I've been seeing my friends, even from China, self-quarantine and do all of these things. for the last three or four months. It's just so weird that our governments had not prepared us for the actual nature of the illness spreading around the world because it was eventual and it was going to happen because no preparations were ever made for it to be otherwise. You know, it has been very compromising for the working class artists of which I am. I encourage people to support, of course, my Patreon. And I made a Patreon community and platform a while ago. Actually, I've had Patreon and I encourage people to join my community there where I'll be sharing exclusives. But now I need more support than ever. And I just noticed in my artist communities, we are trying to keep each other encouraged. We're doing watch parties and things for the quarantine and isolation. But even still, it's hard. I myself am going to be pushing myself to create more and spend more time with concepts that I didn't get a chance to flesh out. in the past that I've been wanting to. So in the coming months, it's like you can expect so much amazing work to come out. But what we're going through right now and the lack of infrastructure for health care and social services in the United States and all of that, it's just really hard to deal with, especially for working class artists, because we don't really have the government that supports us. and allows for any subsidies for our real lifestyle. So it's a tough time, and I really encourage patrons of music and art to put your money where your mouth is or just really support because we need it now more than ever. Hello, my name is Pedro, also known as Maru, and I'm one of the founders of the Mena Collective from Lisbon and co-founder of the label and artist platform Suspension and also a member of the community platform Xeno Entities Network. I'm one of the members. of the team organizing the whole festival and I just returned from Lisbon to Berlin where I'm self quarantined at the moment I live here I was in Lisbon just for a gig and also for the third anniversary of Mina yet we decided to cancel everything immediately last week due to the corona virus outbreak Everything happened really fast and almost overnight we realized that the most responsible thing to do was to cancel the event and to explain to our community the reason why it is so important to take action. to take as much social distance as possible. Well, we need to be physically distant, yet we need to look after each other to be socially supportive, I would say, and establish mechanisms of everyday solidarity to protect the most vulnerable, such as... queer people, POC people, trans people. It is really devastating for our scene. All of my gigs and all of the people from the scene got their gigs cancelled. The projects were all cancelled for the incoming month, maybe the next two months. And I wonder how much... more will be cancelled. I'm afraid that this will bankrupt us, will bankrupt many of us financially and emotionally. Many of our collectives, many of the collectives collaborating with Hull are thinking in which ways can we create mechanisms of support. Many of the collectives that are part of the whole festival are thinking in which ways can we create mechanisms of support given that the governments are failing to support freelance workers and artists. and also the vulnerable communities. I feel that many of us from the queer feminist party scene have been somehow rehearsing. for a catastrophe like this. Of course, no one was ready for this, but many of us have been already practicing tactics of care, harm reduction and awareness. And I really hope that our community takes responsibility. I hope that the world manages to mitigate this pandemic as fast as we can and hopefully in June. We will reunite all together at Hull. And yeah, we must all take responsibility now and celebrate all together in the near future. My name is Sunil Sharpe. I'm from Dublin here in Ireland, which is slowly moving into a lockdown mode of sorts. Like everyone else, my DJ gigs are off indefinitely. I also work one day a week teaching a DJ and music production course. The college is shut and it's close to the end of the year now as well, which is bad timing. But all their exam work can be submitted online. So we'll see how that goes. This is a bad time for our clubs who've all voluntarily shut. And for promoters too, many are relying on upcoming festivals beyond the next wave of... club shows so they're in a tricky position depending how long this goes on for if it moves into the summer. This part of the arts and entertainment sector is very exposed and generally doesn't get much government support or particularly favourable conditions to start with. The hospitality sector here is in a lot of trouble too especially as we rely a lot on tourism and practically everywhere has voluntarily shut now as well. Record shop wise, the two main ones here in Dublin, All City and Spin Dizzy, they've shown indefinitely. And I think using post offices for online orders may be a problem for them soon too, as it is. for any labels from here as well. I mean, our next release on Earwiggle was to come out near the end of this month. I'm kind of having second thoughts about that considering shops and then postal channels being shut as well. Yeah, and although we have to be concerned mostly with what's happening in our own local community and country at this time, looking at... electronic music as an international community, it is a very strong one. And I think this may help create more unity, at least I hope it will. And maybe we can help break the imbalance that was starting to grow. I mean, this is a time to reflect on where all of this has been going and the club and independency and has been fighting for survival against big business. Club music got that name for a reason. So let's look after this, the independent promoters and everyone else that's good in this scene. And yeah, keep safe, everyone, and keep productive. And let's get ready for better times. Hello, my name is Surf. I run a music platform called Half Moon BK. We're located in Brooklyn, New York. I would say the coronavirus has impacted me personally, but it just makes me feel super isolated, just away from everything. I just feel like everything's kind of on a pause right now and makes me just feel super uncertain about how things are going to look for us. within the next months or so. My work has been impacted negatively, definitely, most definitely. One, because we had to stop all radio programming. Our station is shut down. And that station is like my home. When I'm not home, I'm there. And a lot of other people, too. Our radio station, our headquarters, serves as a great... environment for a lot of other people to come and just be free and just like you know be surrounded in music see people that they know from the scene like a great meeting place outside of the nightclub that you can still hear good music and exchange ideas and thoughts would say also that you know we we lost a bunch of uh collaboration projects, gigs as well. We had a workshop planned with MoMA PS1. That was supposed to happen on March 28th, and that got canceled. I was really looking forward to that. That would have been like our first time working with a big art institution such as them. Our monthly party at bossa nova we had a special guest that was flying in from the west coast we had to cancel that and It just left us all feeling like you know just super uncertain about how We're gonna get work After this blows over or, like, when is this ever going to stop? I feel like the whole scene is, like, suffering from that right now. Everyone's just super uncertain. People are kind of panicking. Everyone just doesn't know, like, you know. what's going to be because we depend on these public spaces so much for us to thrive, for us to earn revenue, for us to showcase our ideas and our creativity. So when it's like, there is no public spaces, like now what do we do? Do we stop doing what we're doing? Do we wait? Do we still try to do things super, super underground and illegally potentially get in trouble for having gatherings of more than 50 plus people? Everyone's just super unsure. But for the most part, I feel people are being supportive amongst each other and people are spreading a lot of love. giving funds where they can and I'm just glad that I am a part of such of a supportive community that even though in times like this like we're still finding ways that we can like be there for each other and etc. Hey so my name is Tash Elsie I'm a DJ, radio, broadcaster, presenter in the UK. and at the moment I am out in Goa, India. I had a few tour dates planned with Meena, who's a fellow DJ from the UK. So we were meant to play in Mumbai and in Bangalore and Manindeli and we've just had like constant cancellations. And a friend of ours, Kampiri, who's another DJ, was meant to have an India tour. We were meant to cover a few of her dates and they've all just consecutively been cancelled now too. So at the moment we are, because of the virus obviously, and at the moment we are in Goa at a yoga retreat waiting to kind of just, every day just is like a new cancellation of something or the other. So we kind of still don't really know what we're doing at the moment. As it stands, we have no gigs. We've gone from having... covering other people's gigs to having no gigs whatsoever um so yeah the virus is we're feeling the effects of the virus over here too probably not to the same extent that people are in London as of yet um so yeah it's making everything like a bit tentative and quite tricky because you have to just take each day as it comes and kind of expect a new cancellation every point and at this point we're just kind of focused on at least getting to see a bit of another city and then probably heading home a bit early because we're just paying our pocket at the moment so we've collectively lost about two grand from the cancelled gigs which is yeah a huge knock a huge loss so it's all just a little bit of shit at the moment Yeah, I guess we're in the position like everyone else is where we kind of don't know what to expect next and it's all just kind of hanging by a thread a little bit. So yeah, fuck Corona. Hi, my name is Gabriel and I run this label called 40% of Foda Bahama Ladies here in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Like everyone, I got all my gigs cancelled. And for us Brazilians, we weren't really taking too seriously the whole coronavirus, especially because we were having the carnival in February. So I actually saw a lot of people making jokes about that. We weren't really believing that it would reach us. So to see this joke became a national... Crisis, drama, it actually hurts more, I think, you know, because the joke starts to be on you. I think the government was, like, trying to push things a little bit. So, I mean, everyone that I know on my social circles got, it's without a job, it's not something to do because... We pretty much counted on the events and the nights, blah, blah, blah. But I think in the last three days, people are taking action. I hope that things can get resolved in the next weeks. To be pretty optimistic, I think it would take a month or more. So we'll see it. Hi there, my name is Kohal. I'm the head of production here at Rinse FM in London. Yeah, when we first started hearing about the coronavirus outbreak, we set up some hand sanitizers in the studio and encouraged people to be a lot more careful. And we were making jokes actually, like, you know, having to, instead of like shake hands, we'd have to just like touch elbows. But yeah, obviously, as it's gotten more serious, we've had to cancel all live shows at the studio and all pre-recorded sessions at the studio as well. So all DJs are having to now deliver shows remotely, which is obviously a shame on any DJs out there who don't have a setup. Some of them already do have a home setup, so this hasn't been a problem for them. Some are having to get creative and... you know, finally get to grips with their home set up and learn how to, you know, record at home. But yeah, it's actually been surprisingly easy for us to still run the radio. You know, the technology for remote desktop control is amazing these days. So the whole production team are actually running the ship from home or wherever they may be. They're not actually in the studio. And then the next challenge we faced is, you know, we're having to now sift through our archive and really it's an opportunity for us to tidy our archive and see what content. have there, you know, dig out some maybe undiscovered gems and give those to our audience as well because obviously we know our audience is going to be at home now working from home or self-isolating so, you know, we have a chance to reach more of our audience now potentially. Hi there, my name is Luca and I work in LAF Madrid as a team manager and promoter of Grow Club. We have stopped all the venue activity on our club itself one week ago. We are cancelling all the events from now until May and looking for an alternative for all the events that if this situation is extended in time. we will have to cancel DIMS 2. In the worst case, we will have to suspend all season and start over in September. You know. Anyway, our work policy is have all payments done before the events, so all artists who work with us are covered in that sense. This situation has been an economic blow for us and our team, our sound technicians, visual jockeys, security team, and... and other partners who work with us have been fired until this situation is over. Meanwhile, I am trying to keep the essence of our club alive and keeping touch with my team and clubbers who are part of it every night. As long as we can do events, we have decided to... create a SoundCloud where the artists who collaborate with us still can connect with our crowd. International artists like Tencel, BSK, Pearl, Roldan, or Reco are going to collaborate for free too. In hard times, people get the best of them. Hi there, this is Andrew Hogg. AKA Love Fingers from Los Angeles, California. I run a record label called ESP Institute, which has been sort of indefinitely put on pause at the moment. We had about four or five releases that are in production that are no longer in production. Some of them because our pressing plant's not working at the moment. and a few because we have some artists that don't feel it's the right time to release music. For people in the U.S., this is something super important. Myself and my wife Heidi, we've put together a petition against the White House for the Families First Act. that was announced by Pelosi a few days ago, but it's regarding emergency unemployment and emergency paid leave for workers in the U.S. There's a loophole, and it sort of leaves out all freelancers in a way. It doesn't leave them out completely, but it... It only gives a tax break at the end of the year, which is not really going to help anybody in the interim. And on top of that, it only is eligible for people that are either in quarantine, diagnosed, or, you know, under order from doctors to stay home, which doesn't really help anyone who's laterally affected by the virus. You know, people that had gigs that are cancelled or... promoters that had to cancel any of those things, you shouldn't have to be specifically diagnosed as sick. affected. So it's, you know, everybody's feeling the effects of this. So we petitioned the White House. And we need a lot more signatures before we get a response from the White House. We have to get 100,000. We only are at, you know, 4000 or so, but we've only been doing it for a day and a half. So that's not so bad. But if If you can take a second to log on and give a signature, it takes like literally 10 seconds. I've made a URL that redirects to it. It's ESP.institute. That's it. No .com, just ESP.institute. Goes directly to petition. And that's not just for musicians or people in the music industry. That's for all people that are... self-employed or small contract workers or gig workers, anyone who doesn't have the luxury of unemployment benefits or sick leave. My name is Aaron Clark and I run the Hot Mass Club with a group of others here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Coronavirus has forced us to close, canceled all of our residence gigs at home and abroad, and pushed us all to video calls. You know, we're not really sure what to do right now. No one knows how long this is going to drag on, or if we'll even have a physical space to go back to when we come out the other side of it. We may try to do some renovations that we've put off for a while in the meantime to employ people, you know, building a new DJ booth, installing new lighting. But I think, you know, I'm not even sure if it's worth it yet because there's not much light at the end of the tunnel. Yeah, I don't really know what else to say. Thank you. you
