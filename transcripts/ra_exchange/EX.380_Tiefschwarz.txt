Bye. Bye. 🎵 🎵 Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor of Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Tiefschwarz. In the back half of this week's episode, Ali and Basti Schwarz bring up the notion of the DJ Highway. They've been traveling on it largely uninterrupted for over two decades now. But the experience has taught them that the second you take an exit, there's always more traffic waiting to take your place. So as musical trends came and went over the years, they've adapted to new conditions. They morph from garage-tinged deep house to silky techie minimal and help define the sound known as electro house along the way. But their roots in dance music actually stretch back to the glory days of Germany's club scene. In fact, they ran two hot clubs in Stuttgart for most of the 90s. In conversation with Matt Unicombe, the brothers look back on how the rave scene changed during their rise to fame and how they're navigating the new demands it places on DJs in the present day. ♪ ♪ This might seem like an obvious question, but doing something for 20 years, hanging out together so much, music all day, every day. Do you have ups and downs where you're sick of him or her? Because 20 years is a long time to do something. No matter how fun it is, of course you're obsessed with music and it's your life. I don't know. How does it feel to be doing something every weekend, every day for that long? The answer is obvious. It is a roller coaster. And in the best family, it would be strange if there wouldn't be any ups and downs. And we have our issues like anybody else. And of course, we have times where we get along better and then times where we say, oh, you know what? I stay on my side and you stay on your side. It's part of the deal. We are not living together. That's good. Because sometimes, especially in the early years, people really booked us in one hotel room. It was like, do you really need two hotel rooms? Well, it would be actually quite nice. It was around about 20. 20 or 22. But that's exactly people think we're twins. Or gay. Yeah, exactly. So there's my life, there's his life. And it's good that we have time apart. But we have a dream and we are strong personalities. And it's a good part of it. Well, we would not work together if it wouldn't work. How is the relationship? Is one more strict and one's the party guy? Or, I don't know, how's it working? Over the years, we worked on our discipline. So, and the weekend is weekend, you never know what's going on on the weekend, during the weekend. But during the week, we are really focused and we try to keep our mind clear. So like this. But we are both party guys. Especially in the beginning. When we started, we were still running our second club at that time. In the first 18 years. Yeah. And at that time. we were like, it was a nonstop party. There was part of the whole deal and that was also showing your passion. But it was a different time also. It's an interesting point because with music these days, a lot of people don't start to become really known until they're in their 30s or younger. But basically, there aren't so many people getting big at 21 years old. Which means that when you find out about a DJ, you don't realize they might be getting famous now, but they've been doing something else. They've been doing their thing for like 10 years beforehand. And I guess that's what it's like with you guys. You're celebrating 20 years of the duo now, but there's this whole other history beforehand. Well, but the history beforehand was also DJing. It was just not as a duo. I was in the 1990, Basti was on a drumming school in Hamburg and I started with a friend, the first club called On You. And after that, till the end of the 90s, the second club called Red Dog. And that's... where Basti pitched in and that's where our career basically started. We invited people, we created a scene, you know, that was all about... deep house and early Chicago, Detroit, New York style type of house and that's where we got into the game as DJs and also started to produce and that was before we actually founded Tiefschwarz. So literally we're playing since like 27 years now so it's getting closer to 30 years actually but not as a duo. But involved into music since I can think. Early end of the 80s. I got my first drum kit when I was seven. I would like to get the best famous rock drummer in the world. You wanted to become. Yeah, I wanted to become. And then I became a DJ. I know. And the producer. Which is close to drumming, actually. Yeah, we are in the strongest phase in our career at the moment. That's what I feel. Because we are really clear-minded and we know exactly what we want to do now. And production-wise, we are really on a high level now. And we are totally free-minded. And that's really good. Like, have you always felt confident or something changed recently? Well, it gets more clear now. We were always like, that's part of the Tiefschwarz phenomenon that we always redevelop and develop our music. we don't want to like we don't like to be pushed in in drawers or you know like or in corners and because we get bored by our own music pretty easily so we try to go left and right up and down but we are more clear about the actual process and like we did our fourth album two years ago and now we changed our little philosophy again and the older we get the more we work the more clear We are in our heads about the music. So how does it work making music together? You meet up during the week. Do you have to have a schedule like when you're going to meet or does it just happen naturally? Like do you find yourself... We have a schedule. So you kind of make sure to do a certain amount of work each week. Yeah, it's the easiest way. Yeah. Otherwise you wouldn't end up doing it or... It's good to have a schedule just to, you know, to have a kind of, it's like a deadline, you know, because there's always distractions or private things. So it's good to have a deadline. And so how does it work in the studio? Is one person doing the melodies, someone else is doing the drums, or is it really mixed? Rusty is the machine guy, and I'm more involved in the co-production. He's the conductor. But Rusty really digs deep into the technical aspect, and I'm more from the outside. creating together like melodies, arrangement, questions and also finding the niche in which direction and together we have a good language in the studio. Sometimes surprising but it really works well that I'll, you know, there's this I don't know the English word, when you have two circles and you shift them top of each other there's this room in the middle yeah that room where the two circles connect is pretty wide where we have where we agree on and that's helpful yeah and thank god we found the way back to the drum machines analog style and analog stuff because it's so good and all the machines running and and you record and it's much more fun It's more alive. It's more alive. That sounds completely different to digital, of course. But we have so much fun with all these machines and recording and not looking all the time in front of the screen. So I guess it's a bit more like how you started making music. We started with all this archive sampler stuff and all this analog stuff. And then I think it... Around 2008 or 2009, we switched to digital stuff. And everybody said, hey, digital is so great, so easy and so simple. And yeah, no analog stuff more. MIDI stuff, blah, blah, blah. And now we returned to the analog. Or combine it. Yeah. I think it's always smart to use the best out of all the worlds, you know. Why exclude something if it's helpful? And it's at the end, the result counts and it's not so much about the way. But it's definitely very interesting. thing to involve these analog machines. Yeah, the analog energy is totally different. And this is real. And creates cool mistakes. Yeah, of course. Things you would not program like that. And that's good too. allow that and then include it in the production process. It's much more creative and you're not sitting in front of the monitor what I said all the time because sometimes this is really that sucks totally when you're sitting in front of the computer all the time looking in front of the screen. that's much more natural and more creative not to look at the screen so record and cut record and cut stuff like this it's also a question of personality some people like to be like very detailed and other people like more like the livey aspect and as i said before to combine these two qualities most of the time leads to a good result. If you wanted to start a club in the 90s, was it a lot easier to do that than it is now? Was there less regulation? At that time, I would not say it was easier, but it was not as common. Also, it was not in Berlin. It was back in our hometown in Stuttgart. And it was a total adventure. We were young. I was an art student. And the craziest part of this whole thing was that our father or our parents, I asked my father for help. And he said, OK, that was possible at that time. I talked to my bank. So I'm going to kind of back you up for a certain amount. It was not that much money, but he did it. And then him and his wife, our mother, they went on a tour to India with their backpacks for three months and said, have fun. We come and celebrate with you guys. So that much of a trust we had from our parents. That was fantastic. And then we just started and we were our own best guests. So it was a nonstop party. And the business aspect. With our father. We also, yeah, of course. And the business aspect was there, but we were not focused on the business. We just wanted to show our passion and invite our friends. Basically, it was a big friends project in the beginning. And it was from jazz to reggae, from hip-hop to techno. We couldn't even mix in the beginning. It was only about quality music. And then slowly, with the club and evolving all aspects of it, like being more professional, seeing the business side, seeing, oh shit, we made a loss again. blah, blah, blah. All these points got more relevant and found the peak in the second club three years later. And then the offbeat came around. So, you know, first club was all over the map and second club was only pure house and techno. Totally addicted into house and techno since until now. So, yeah, but it was a very good experience because now we know like Both sides of the story. As a DJ, you pack your bag, whatever, it's in it. And your responsibility ends with the end of your set. With a club, you have to keep the quality up like day to day. I'm actually happy that this time is over. I can imagine it was a lot of... It would be a lot of stress. Even though it's a fun project when there's money on the line and... But it is... You have to have a totally different mindset. You cannot... It's better not to be a DJ when you run a club. Or you have like several partners and you're very precise with like, this is your part, this is your part and delegate it professionally. If not, it's difficult. So were there other clubs in Stuttgart at the time? It was crazy because Stuttgart was never really on the map of like, it's not one of the big cities, but the musical scene at that time was very, very vibrant and interesting. We got voted as number one club in Germany, like underground club from Spex magazine at that time, which was like... This little hole in... What was the sentence? This little hole in the middle of Germany is DJ heaven. Or this little hole... This little hole in the middle of Germany is DJ Heaven. It was the editor-in-chief of DJ Maxx set that was in the middle of the 90s once. But it was really special. It was very undergroundy and very unique and unexpected. And that made it so... so fresh. Are there any clubs that you remind you of those days? I would say it had like this kind of Studio 54 touch because it was only about let loose, let go, no rules. We closed, we sometimes even locked the door. got all naked, wrapped in toilet paper for three days. You know, like it was very, it was like a performance platform. Really? I can't remember. But I do. But it was really open. So it was all word to mouth, flyers, posters, and, you know, and week after week after week. And it was a small, very, like it was a core of people. and very expressive and art related and it was just like a big freedom platform i guess because in those days what i think like house and techno was a much more obscure thing so it attracted more weird people now it's so popular so it attracts like all you know yeah exactly lots of i don't know what the right word is the ratio between mainstream people and more freaky weirdos yeah There's way more mainstream people. But maybe in the old days when it was this new thing. Totally. You get more of these crazy characters. Totally. It was exactly like that. the crazy characters of like downtown Stuttgart were there. And we were like kind of this peak of a new trend and that we felt that and it was so much fun. Now like underground is overground and vice versa and our music is pop music. It's not commercial necessarily, but it's pop music. And that was not at that time. Yeah, so it was a very... Definitely not. Yeah, and that was the big freedom. It was hard also because people, you had to educate them, but they were so open and so it was a good development. When did things start getting professional for you as DJs and producers? Was it a steady rise or I don't know? Yeah, it was a steady rise, but it became more professional around 95, 96, where we started the production side with some producer. And I remember our first official remix production was Ultranate 3. and this was a big run for us. Mustard Work. You're free from Ultranate? No, that was not Mustard Work. We did two remixes for Mustard Work but Ultranate was not Mustard Work. Anyway, and then it starts. And then we start our DJing outside of Germany. or Stuttgart more to Hamburg or Munich and and first the first official gig in Hamburg we drove by car with the old Audi from a friend of ours full of records full of records for two hours for a thousand records five thousand records in a little car we drove to Hamburg we were so excited And yeah, it was big fun. Totally. Yeah, so like mid-90s, we started the production side, but the actual professional touch was more like the end of the 90s. It was in the process of our first album, which got signed by Classic and Francois Kavokian picked one track for Wave Records in New York. So that was the kind of... actual real switch. There was a time where we spent more time in London than in Stuttgart. And we always thought like, oh, let's move to London. And there was a very interesting period of our career. And with that... So we kind of re-imported ourselves from England because we had our kind of local standing in Germany. But the international breakthrough happened through London. Through that, also the recognition in Germany blew up a lot. And then at the same period, we moved to Berlin. And that was kind of the real beginning of 2000. Best move ever. Best move ever. Move to Berlin. Berlin is the best city in the world. For you. No. Ask other people. No. No. Yeah, well. Really big Berlin fans, yeah. So when did you move here? 2001. Okay. So was it common? Was it, I don't know, to move to Berlin around that time? It was like when the Mandy guys also moved, I think. Kind of at the same time, yeah. To move to Berlin, was it like a scary, you're going to a weird place? Not at all. We felt at home. from the very first second. We were here a lot before. And actually, we were ready in our heads to move on to either London or Berlin because we were traveling already a lot. And we waited for this one symbolic moment and our record company at that time. moved to Berlin and said, okay, that's the moment. So let's just follow them. And we arrived here and felt like we are here since ever. Seems like that around 2000, seems like that's when a lot of Germans moved from other cities to Berlin. Frankfurt crew moved around there. You guys. Then they get physical people. Of course, there are much more. There was the biggest, like, it was like the two big waves. One was in the early 90s, right after the war came down, a lot of creative people from all over Germany moved. That was the first big wave. And the second big wave was like 10 years later. And five years later, all the international guys came. Yeah. Oh, the English people, Americans. And then it was, and it never stopped. Nobody talked German anymore, especially in Mitte or somewhere else. Spanish, Italian, English, English, English. Hello? Why did this move happen, this wave 10 years after the wall? What was happening? Did it start getting more clubs or? Well, the club scene definitely evolved and grew a lot. But it was more of a coincidence, I would say. But maybe also because the scene shifted. Like there was this focus in Frankfurt, like for a long time around Robert Johnson and stuff. And then Hamburg a little bit. But Berlin kind of blew up internationally around 2000 for the first time. And I think that attracted a lot of people. Yeah, it's hard to imagine for me what it was like around that time. So what would you do if you're a young DJ in Berlin? What does, in around 2001, what does your week look like? Wasted. It was such a crazy time, to be honest. It was a big party. Yeah, it was a big party. You know, it still is. But now all this professionalism kicks in, you know, like digital world is definitely something very important. And it helps kind of to have this kind of basic democratic. you know, like it's the same chances for everybody, whether you sit in Siberia or in Africa or wherever, you just need a decent internet connection. But at that time, it was just really like you have to develop something by yourself and not just click and see what happens and get your role model through the internet. That's the big difference. And yeah, but nowadays you see also what happened. We need... around 10 years to be at our peak now with the right management and the right decisions you need maybe 10 minutes to be honest to Instagram yeah but that's a huge difference bullshit on YouTube and you're a big star exactly and sometimes I'm not so sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing so it's like a very ambivalent ambivalent situation So how is it to be an artist in this changing time? Like you've been there for the analog old school underground days. Now you're in this social media age like you've been talking about. Have you really had to try and adapt to fit in? In the beginning it was really hard for us to be honest. We ignored it. Totally. totally fuck that until now actually I mean we addicted to this social media thing we're not addicted no but we need it we need it but I'm not a big Facebook fan and Instagram it was really it's like You know, these days, kids grew up like, it's like with the mother milk, you know, it's just in their system. For us, it's not in our system. So we really had to, you know, we had to... I really miss my fax machine and my phone. Also, because you're older, you don't adapt to new, completely new things that easily when you're a teenager or, you know, like, just like. My daughter grabs my phone. She's just one year old and she just knows what to do, basically. I mean, remember our father? He became a computer into his office, right? And he had no idea how to handle that. No fucking idea. It's the same. What's that? Trash box. And so did people have to tell you to start? Yeah, well, yeah. Like, did it come down to agents saying like, hey, guys, you need to be on Facebook. You need to take photos. Basically, people dragged us. Like, if you really want to move on and don't be like, you're not Ricardo. He's the anti-social media guy, but because of his standing, he's able to do it. But if you're not in this position, you lose if you don't play at least a little bit by the rules. Either you have such a strong personality or you're such a relevant character in the scene that you can use it as a tool or... you have to play the social media card. So that's why we have to decide what we're going to do. Well, we're not as strong as Ricardo. If we are social media hookers or if we are strong personalities, give a shit on it. I guess the truth is in the middle. I like the way where people just... post their gigs, maybe a nice photo, and that's it. Not going on this huge like, oh my God, what an amazing gig. And then on top, like the meal of last night. Yeah, exactly. Packing my records for the gig. For sure, we are very understatement with our posts. It's a joke in behind. I hate it. This kind of... blah blah blah you know like it's it's we'd rather keep it you know not so pretentious just like low-key You need to use it like it's... Loki, my hate word. Loki. Loki. Loki is the name of the wife of our ex-chancellor. Loki, but not Loki. Loki Schmidt. Loki Schmidt, exactly. Yeah, because that's the interesting thing for me is like you're this generation that was there for the birth of this thing in Germany. Right now, it's so different to what it used to be. You've been making a living off this thing for so long. You've just seen the change so drastically. It is sometimes really just like, what's going on? Because it's got so fast also. But do you find yourself being negative about it? Like when you're scrolling Facebook and you see what you think is a cheesy Facebook post. Do you get annoyed or are you just like, oh, whatever? I think the good thing with age is that you also get a bit wiser and a bit easier with things. I find it very disturbing sometimes. And I'm also personally not a big fan. I see the benefit. The good thing of it that you can connect with your fans or with your platform, with your whatever, for the connection. But it's kind of a bit perverted now. And everything is about, there's nothing else anymore. Take the phones away of people. They are going to die. Basically, you see situations where people are sitting on a table and they talk through chats. They're sending SMS to each other. How's the meal? Do you enjoy? It's crazy. You see, we all know that. We all saw that. It's insane. But that's reality. You know, people forget how to interact in real life. Since six months, I have emails on my iPhone. Because only of one reason, I have my boarding pass now already. That's the only reason. Otherwise, I wouldn't do it. Because checking emails is the second hate word in my life after Loki. Checking emails, check, check, check, check, check. It's not necessary, to be honest. It's necessary, but... Not every second. It's like going on news. See the news blog or what's going on on Facebook or what's going on. Every app has like an alarm function. And that's the big problem is you need a very strong personal filter for your life. to disconnect from unimportant information because you get so overwhelmed and it really takes away a lot of time, energy. It stresses out your nerve system. It's unhealthy. And we really have to learn to disconnect again, at least for... some percentage. Since January this year, my girlfriend and me, we have a property outside of Berlin with a little wooden hut. And sometimes we're there for two or three days without internet connection, without phone, just in the green. And this is amazing. Working in the garden. talking to each other, doing normal stuff. Human stuff. Human stuff, yeah. And this is unbelievable. It's a treasure. Have you guys had any other jobs that weren't to do with... music well i'm i'm also like an artist i started art before i went into music and i'm still doing it or like again more now and also involved into graphic design and so it was always a kind of shifting between art and music do you ever wonder like what it would have been like to have like a normal non-music life well i would love it I would love to, really. Can you give me one? Yeah, but I have no idea. Farmer, gardener. Gardener, yeah, but there's no rule doing techno until you die, you know, or this party life or chatting around the world or something like this. I'm thinking about this situation, maybe doing something totally different, yeah. going on to countryside or doing a world trip for a year or cook or I have no idea but I mean music is my life and I think I'm producing music until I'm deaf But not in this constantly way. But I think there's much more ways around techno and nightlife, which is good for your brain. Well, I mean, it's the same with anything you do for a long period of time. you need to step out of something. It's always like what you don't have, you miss the most. And it's a natural thing. It's not even that you're finished with something. I think it's a system inside of you as a human being that sometimes protects you from being sucked into something too deeply. And you need to step out. And I think what he does with this garden is super healthy. you need to step out to keep the balance and that you're not, you know, like, or we should open up a club. Dig deeper. No, but that's the only thing we both won't. For Phil, it's like a corporate life, you know, like having corporate jobs. Like, you know, whether it's me doing art or he's working in the woods or like playing drums or whatever, cooking, whatever. It's always some kind of like doing it with your hands or kind of a creative thing. And that's what we did when we left school ever since. So we never worked in a corporate job. We never get a proper job because nobody wants old raver DJs. Half blind, half deaf. I can't hear you. Sorry. Luckily, that was a joke. Yes. Our hearing is actually quite good. Our health is really good because we are looking really about our health. Obviously, not all gigs are good. Obviously, you have ups and downs. What makes you still think these days, this is why I do music? Is it after a gig you're feeling really good, like you got some positive feedback? Is it... While you're making music in your studio and you're just really happy doing it, what are the things that remind you, like, wow, I really love what I'm doing. I've been doing this thing for so long, but I still love it. Flying around the world, I love it. To be in a club, I love it. Loud music, I love it. People, I love it. Producing music, it's perfect. But sometimes you have shitty days. Yeah, of course. I think it's, as you said, it's always what you have at the moment. You know, like when you're in the studio, you miss DJing. When you're DJing, you miss the studio. And both worlds create this kind of euphoric moments. Right now, we're collecting new material for next year. And it's going to be... proper club related stuff and we are super excited and happy because it as he mentioned earlier because of this live aspect of analog gear it just goes with the flow and it feels really light and easy and that's a very happy moment for us right now in the studio and dj wise i find it really fulfilling when it's out of the ordinary. I had to cross the border between Turkey and Georgia. because of a missed connection, not super important. So I entered Georgia through a border which felt like I'm in a refugee track from Syria. It was actually pretty brutal. But for nothing in the world, I would want to miss this experience. was good because when you play for people who are not having the chance to go to 12 different clubs in one street like in Berlin, that's the good gigs. That's the interesting moments. And sometimes you're flying to places you never imagined to go there. You know, like Novosibirsk somewhere in Siberia. No idea. I never would think about to go there to visit. Novosibirsk but you're playing in the middle of the hills and it's really wow I think that's the real treasure or the real reward of our job and we're really thankful about it that we can live this life. To make people happy, to make them dance, to forget their day-to-day bullshit, first of all. Second of all, you see corners of the planet you would never imagine. And third, you know, it's like the social aspect because you always see the world through the perspective of the promoter who shows you his restaurant, his favorite gallery. You know, it's always kind of, I came up with the word of inner circle tourism, you know, because it's not like you open. the internet or TripAdvisor or a book, you know, and you get the introduction through a very subject perspective. And that's amazing. And you know so many cities. Sometimes I'm sitting in front of the TV. watching a movie and see a street and say oh that's Miami you know yeah yeah well you become like a really experienced traveler now yeah all these years and you know so many people around the globe and this is this is really that's a gift yeah it's a real gift and we're really like thankful for that thank you Ali thank you Basti So what kind of relationship do you have with your early tracks? Do you ever go back and revisit them? Oh, we had to because of our 20th anniversary. And, you know, the big numbers sometimes give you no other chance. And then we're like, what? wow we just did a like a really extremely long mix for a phase magazine that they presented our our anniversary and it was really long but the half of the tracks yeah and then we realized how much material is there and and we're sitting there digging into our like and we're like wow that's us wow and also like this you know because it's like this crazy journey into sound And that was a real experience, you know, like, because you forget, you don't have every track present in front of you. And it was a great experience to really dig and find out about even like hidden tracks or tracks they not really have been released and dub versions and edits. It's quite a lot and it's fulfilling. So how is it different signing records to labels now compared to the 90s? Like in the old day? Horrible. It's quite horrible because you have to be really lucky to receive an answer. From old friends. It's crazy because everybody is in his own... little bubble everything got really protective you know like it's it's the concurrent you know like this this fight because it's so much so much out there you have to be very you have to um protect yourself that you first of all don't lose your focus and it's a shield And more and more people to stay relevant, they have their friends, like their little group of friends and talents, and they protect it. And whether they dig something and invite you, but if you knock on their door, you don't even get an answer because they are so like, oh, that's our thing. We have to be sure that... But on the other side, hey, Ali, how are you doing? nice to meet you how's the daughter how's life but it's I want to send you music ah see you later send it to me but no reply it's not it's not something it's not personal but it's you we see that more and more that people are really protect their little bubble because there's so much out there there and you you kind of lose it if you don't do it i mean of course there is also like um like a kind of a behavior you know but the most most of the people are not doing risk You know, they're really sitting in their cupboard and, oh, no risk, no fun. No risk, yeah. But we say no risk, no fun. And I think at that time now, risk is really important. With the help of the Internet, everything is available all the time. So a lot of people, you know, follow the trends. start to adapt it quite easily because the tools are there everything is easier to achieve using music yeah so there's a lot of well-produced music out there but there is no that's what basti wouldn't say there's no edge to it no no you know it's and that's it's more difficult to find your own handwriting i don't want to name name anybody's in specific specifically but it's it's really like there's this key people everybody follows which which is totally it's fair enough and they deserve their success but to to be different and sound different that's the hard thing these days not to be number three four five and six you know because you we receive tons of demos Well produced, but all sounds the same. Boring. Same bass line, same bass drum. Same, same, same. So what do you think it is? I also think about this a lot. These people are obviously creative people. Otherwise, they wouldn't want to make music. Why don't they go the next step and think, hmm, this guy made this track. I'm going to try and make something different. It's the same thing with DJing. Once some style becomes cool, all of a sudden there are 100 DJs playing this sound. What is it about human nature? First of all, it's the zeitgeist. Zeitgeist, yeah. No, it's because it became such a huge business. DJ now is like, it's the new rock star thing, you know? And if you do it right, you have the chance. To be on stage in front of people, you know, get an image, which is good for your ego or for a lot of people. They need that or want that. And it's really well paid for the amount of invest you have to make. So if you do like a top 10 list, what you have to follow to become a... successful DJ you know it's get the right manager get be a social media expert bum bum bum and the music is maybe number five four or five you know and and then it gets interesting Or you are, says Troxler, Dixon or Daniel Avery or something like one of these really standout personalities who dig since 20 years. And, you know, that's something else. But that's one out of a thousand. And that's the other side of the story. But that's not what these people are aiming for. It's a very trendy zeitgeist job. And if you do several steps right, you receive a certain amount of success. The rest is talent and luck. But it's different than when we started because you had to buy records. You have to learn how to mix. You have to hold the beat and then you have to find the records. And I was in Chicago at Gramophone, end of the 80s, beginning of the 90s. And I was shipping home like 200 records. And, you know, we really that you had to go. treasure hunting yeah i mean that's sorry to to finish that there's this vinyl only trend also that's a good thing to balance the other craziness but also that's became trendy because the other thing became too strong yeah and sometimes when i'm playing i put something about on on the on the bpm Like what thinks that, okay, we can work together, but not in the 123 BPM ghetto. You know what I mean? And back in the days where we played records, sometimes you have no idea how fast you are or how slow. And this feeling is not there anymore. Well, at the end of the day, it's about music and how you present it. Yeah, but it's boring. No, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the music you play. If you play interesting music, it's never boring. Yeah, but in these days, it's not more than 122 BPM. And if you're playing 124, you're out of the game. But then look at Nina Kravitz, who plays 130. Yeah, but Nina Kravitz plays between 120 and 140. That's cool because she takes a risk. That's amazing because Nina Kravitz forever. So have tempos, how fast were you playing in the 90s, I guess? Like up around... 1.38 sometimes? Okay, like proper house, quick tempo. Or 1.18? No, there was also no rule. It wasn't as fixed? It was not as fixed, yeah. But there were times where it was definitely a bit faster and there were times it was definitely a bit slower. But now it's kind of, yeah, but in general it was like a wave. yeah for long like most of the time when we did our clubs it was around 124 but move to cities like move to frankfurt with omen it was 130 you know it but there was more techno related interaction to to between the dj and the people is back in the days were more intense instead of now because because everybody's is looking uh mixing right, which button I have to press now and the interaction to the public is not really intense. Not to everybody but... I feel that. Yeah, there's not as much reading the crowd. I guess the stages are also so huge now. I mean, I was playing in Italy last year and my set time was around two o'clock and the DJ before me was kind of a tech house guy, 20 years old. I entered the DJ booth and said, hello, it's five to two. You started two. I said, no, I want to have a drink. I started 2.30. Oh, I have no record anymore. And this is really not really cool. I started three. Yeah, if anyone's DJing before you, they have to bring extra records. Because you'll be at the bar. Just put that on the rider. Yeah, exactly. Unlike the tech rider. I might be late. I wanted to ask how did these records get signed to Classic? We were friends with Luke Solomon and Derek Carter because they also played in our club. One party, another party, one after hour, another after hour. At one point they said, hey, can we send you some music? And then we were already DJing quite a lot in London and somehow the connection to classic. got stronger and closer and at one point they we presented them our album and said we want it a natural way naturally yeah yeah nice It's true what you say. You have had a lot of different... You've touched on a lot of different styles over the years. There's this really deep-ass stuff and there's more techno, like freaky sounds. Do you just go in to make music and just see what happens? Or are you kind of thinking... Both. Both. What you should do. I think these days we're more analytic. But we love accidents. This is really important when you're sitting in the studio. Not like sitting in a cupboard or in a little box. Accidents are really important and that makes it more human. I mean now with all the experience over all these years and four full albums and several I don't know how many remixes and EPs and stuff We're a bit more experienced and we know what we don't want. That's important to start with, you know. And then we leave it up to the flow. Right now we know we want to focus on club stuff. Before we did this, the last album was again a turn. out of the ordinary because we created kind of a very interesting crossover between electronic and pop with us with khan as our singer and it was a super interesting uh process and and and we were super happy with the result but at the end of the day we left the dj highway for a little bit And that's also a risk because there's so much... traffic out there once you leave your your your your lane you know you lose you lose people start immediately replace you you know it's really you have to be very very aware of of the moves you make these days but at the end it was really good to leave the techno highway because you recognize i there's something else first of all And it's necessary to go some, to do mistakes. It was not a mistake. No, it wasn't. An experiment. Experiment, yeah. But that's what I said before, no risk, no fun. And so that's why we're here again. And when you listen to the record, actually, you say, wow, great. As long as we're going to work as a duo, we will work like that. The stuff we do right now is a totally different approach, but at the end of the day, we will come to the same conclusion. It's good that we are flexible and don't stick in one corner. Thank you. Thank you. you Thank you. you
