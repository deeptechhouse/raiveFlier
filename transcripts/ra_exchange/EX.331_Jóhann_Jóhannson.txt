*Loud Noise* you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Mark Smith, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Johan Johansen. The Icelandic composer has released albums on crossover labels like 4ID and even cracked into the Deutsche Grammophon catalogue with his latest album Morphée. However, his collaborations with Canadian director Denise Villeneuve have established Johansson as one of the most in-demand composers of film music. He's even been tasked with scoring the forthcoming sequel to Blade Runner, which I discussed with him in his Berlin studio last month. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Johan Johansson is up next. *Dramatic music* If some people were just only aware of the music you've made in, say, the past decade or something, they'd be a little bit surprised, perhaps, at the music you were making earliest in your career, which was band-oriented, guitar-oriented music. You've become very adept at string arrangements and digital manipulation of audio. There's a huge gap in time here, but I'm just wondering how you built up this skill set coming from a background which is guitar and songwriting oriented. It's just another set of tools. I'm always looking for new tools to make music with, make sound with, and I've always been doing that. I guess I started seriously. making music when I was 16, 17, something like that, you know, with four-track recorder and guitars mostly, you know. And, you know, building up these sort of layers, you know, these sort of wall of sounds of guitar noise and little by little you accumulate competency, you know, in various fields. And I didn't go to conservatory. I went to university and, you know, to study humanities. But I was always making music. It wasn't necessarily a goal of mine to become a professional musician. There were other things I was considering, but I always had a very strong passion for creating music. you know, spent most of my free time doing that. So it kind of evolved into that. And I was given the opportunity to work with a theater ensemble in Iceland. And I became like a resident composer for almost... When was this, sorry? Mid-90s, maybe. Yeah, and I used that opportunity for many experiments, you know. I was working with people who gave me a lot of freedom to do... kind of what I wanted. And one of those things was, you know, working with classically trained musicians. And before that, I'd been mostly more involved in the kind of indie world, you know. And then there are certainly classically trained... musicians in that world as well. So it was just a slow sort of process of, you know, kind of teaching myself methods and, you know, learning by doing and accumulating knowledge by reading books on orchestration, by reading books on counter. point harmony and but I didn't really see that as any different than you know becoming more proficient at using Pro Tools or for me it's just another set of tools to use to create music. It's all part of the same project you know. Yeah yeah yeah I wanted to use these colors I have a strong affinity for. for strings, for example. And certainly in my early work, I wrote a lot for strings. And I'm doing less so now. And yeah, I think it was a part of a process of developing as an artist. Choosing not to go the academic route in music forced me to acquire this information myself through books and through consulting with other composers. and through trial and error. And in this way, I kind of slowly develop a method and a language. Those first steps when you're teaching yourself, is it a case of you would write something on a piano and notate it and then... bring it to an orchestra or it's a big leap of faith you know having just notes on a stave and having an idea in your head and then taking it to this well i had considerable experience playing with various musicians i studied piano to the age of 18 and i played and played in in wind bands and things like like that and i i studied trombone as well i knew how to write notation and to communicate my ideas to the players and that's not really the tricky part. I guess the tricky part is developing a voice of your own, you know, and that took a while. I think I was, you know, a late bloomer in that sense, you know, because my first solo album, "Angleborn," comes out in 2001 and I was already 30, you know, by that time. I had, of course, been involved in records released before that time, but this is what I consider my first release as a solo artist. And in many ways, it was a kind of an unconventional upbringing as a musician and as a composer, but a very eclectic one. But would you say in hindsight that's prepared you for the challenges that you face today in a way that, say, someone who just went through the academy wouldn't have? I don't have the comparison, so I wouldn't say. But I certainly feel that a little bit in people who go to film scoring programs. I don't want to disparage any kind of education. The important skills in being an artist are first and foremost discipline, you know, and being able to express your ideas in some form and being able to find the ways to express these ideas. And in a way, you can learn that in an architecture program, you know, and you can... You can learn that in almost any humanities or even science department of science. of any academic institution, you know. So I don't think, you know, for an artist, the type of education you get is important. I think it's important to learn to know how to work and how to communicate your ideas. And the rest is tools that you can learn how to use by yourself. And I wouldn't necessarily recommend... you know, my trajectory to anyone and any mentoring, whether you're in a composition program, you know, with a certain composer and as a main kind of counselor who gives you guidance, you know, you're always going to be learning his or her methods, basically. That may be very, very useful and that may give you a certain set of skills, but then there's the process of finding your own. methods you know and finding your own voice and that's that's the difficult part there was an interesting line you said before learning the tools is the relatively simple part but knowing how to work is the important aspect and it's sort of to do with you were talking about discipline in some way are you able to elaborate on the process by which you came to know how to work, so to speak? It's difficult to formulate. I don't have a formula, you know, I don't have a method that is put into a soundbite, you know. But I've developed over the years, you know, certain ways of working and certain ways of creating ideas, you know, which is really the hardest part of writing music. It's that initial spark, you know, that initial idea, you know. Some people write music very easily. They can sit down at a piano and they can compose a song in five minutes. But it will not necessarily be a very original song. Starting a project is the hardest part, really, because you have to find those initial ideas and you have to somehow conjure them from your subconscious or wherever. And that takes time for me, at least. It takes days and days of intense work, basically. It also takes a certain kind of mindset. It takes a mindset where you have to turn off your critical faculties and you have to turn off your... You almost have to reach a receptive state, you know. I think of it as using... a certain part of the brain and accessing that part of the brain. Sometimes it takes time and sometimes you can't force it. I mean, sometimes ideas come just like that, you know, and they just appear, you know, and they can appear in a conversation. It's also a skill to spot ideas, you know, to identify them, you know. yes, this is something. This is something that can be applied to this, you know. And that's something you get better at, I think, over time. And to identify material which is not necessarily there, but can be developed, you know, into something strong. This is something that works for me. It's probably very different to how many other composers work. And this is certainly not the only way. And it might be something very, very simple. It might be something... And very often I just sit and improvise for hours and hours and hours and feel like I've accomplished nothing. And then I listen back to it maybe a couple of weeks later and identify one bar where there's suddenly something. Hey, this is something. This could be developed into something. It's also about not trusting your initial instincts. Sometimes first impressions are not correct. And also the other way around. First impressions can deceive as well. It seems like there can be various things that set off this perception of being like, this is an idea worth following. You mentioned improvising, so it could be like a melodic... figure but then it might also be a piece of literature or something like that where what are the non-musical sources that have sometimes set you off on a project everything is is kind of work for me you know like rereading a book going to the cinema you know i carry notebooks with me that i that i fill in with with maybe not ideas but you know you know, and sometimes looking back through those, you know, will spark something, you know, and that might be an impression I got from a film. you know, from a piece of art or a painting or a conversation. And that might inspire a mood, you know, a kind of not necessarily musical notes, you know, but a kind of atmosphere, a feeling really, you know, because I think my main goal... as a composer is to communicate, you know, and one of the things that identifies a good idea is that it makes you feel something, you know. and that it affects you either emotionally or viscerally in some strong sense. If the idea affects me in that sense, it's not unlikely that it will affect someone else as well. That's kind of one of the... you know, I use also. And these things can be quite intangible and still something that feels very real to me, you know, and it's a mood that I want to create, but I don't know how, you know. And then there's the process of finding out how to create that mood, you know. And mood is maybe a wrong word. It's more like feeling. And emotion, which is also not a very precise word. My main goal is to try to affect the listener in some way, emotionally, viscerally, or intellectually, and hopefully all three. Is there something specific about strings, whether in small scale ensemble or a large scale ensemble? What is it about those instruments triggering you to help you get close to this feeling or intangible sensation that you're looking for? I wouldn't emphasize strings too much. They were a big part of my sound. you know, on my early solo albums and on some of my scores, you know. But I'm using them very differently on Arrival, for example. And something like IBM is, IBM 1401, a user's manual, which was my third solo album, is a very string-dominated album. It was certainly written at a time where I was very interested in that sound and I was interested in, or what I was mainly interested in actually, is the clash. So what I was not necessarily interested in is the sound of strings in particular, but the sound of strings contrasted with something dramatically different. texture and tone and in feel and that particular album is written around music that was made on a computer from the 1960s and recorded on a reel-to-reel tape recorder in 1971 and it's these very lo-fi mechanical recordings of the computer in at work and also my father worked for ibm and he he learned this method of of programming melodies on on this on this early computer and which was not not one of the features To put it mildly, this was done by basically using the electromagnetic sort of emissions of the core memory of the computer. These emissions you could pick up with a shortwave radio. There were kind of algorithms or ways of programming these emissions, which was basically like a constant tone, to program modulations of pitch in that tone. So you could actually create a melody with this kind of hum of the computer's memory. This was... something my father and his colleagues did in their downtime, you know, at work. He worked for IBM. When they took the computer out of commission in 1971, they made a recording of these sounds and both of the melodies and of the computer in action. And when he told me about this, you know, it immediately was one of those moments when an idea is sparked. It was basically fully formed. You know, when he told me about this, you know, I just knew what I was going to do with it. we went and we looked for those real-to-real tapes. and I went through them and I identified a part of the recordings that I created a loop out of and this sort of five-note loop and then wrote a string orchestra arrangement around it. So the computer, this computer from the 1960s kind of becomes an instrument, kind of like a soloist in this string orchestra. It's this kind of contrast and this kind of, you know, clash or commingling of very distinct and very, very different sounds and textures that I'm interested in. The coldness and the cold mechanical emotionless, but still kind of emotionally resonant sound of the computer, because it has all these nostalgic resonances. and associations. And so the contrast of that sound with the warm and rich emotional sound of the string orchestra, this contrast is really what was interesting to me. And it also appears on Engleborn, my first album. Well, there are several examples of... use electronics and strings there together. But I guess the one with the most striking contrast is a track called Oti et Amo, which is a piece that features a string quartet and a computer program to sing a melody with a text from Catullus, an old Latin poem. 2000 years ago. You know, these contrasting and kind of confounding almost elements that shouldn't really work together, you know. The challenge for me was to make them work together and make them, that's what I found interesting, you know. It was this clash of opposites and how to make that work and how to make that into something that affects you. and affects the listener emotionally is something that I was very interested in. And I still am. And I'm still, like on Orfe, I'm using a similar technique. I was going to ask if you feel like you generally need these, not pre-existing frameworks, but an idea which at least provides some sort of parameters or something. For me, it's a way of providing a framework. Yeah, certainly. But, you know, that's... I think every artist does that, you know. I don't think you can put... just tracks randomly together on an album. For me, there has to be a kind of a thread, almost a narrative, you know. And certainly Portlandia, there's kind of almost approaches a narrative, you know. It's a very oblique one, but it... can be regarded as one. And Orpheus is not really a narrative, but it uses that myth, a myth that has been used many, many times and is very familiar and uses certain... elements from certain interpretations of that myth to create a context and to create a kind of... in a way that idea, sort of the idea of associating it with Orpheus came through the process of writing that album because it was a very long process and a lot of the main ideas on that album are from... written in 2009 so it was like a six six year process of kind of slowly working on on the album bit by bit recording a string quartet one year, some pipe organ the next year. It happened at a time when things were getting just more busy for me in the film music world. And I had also other projects like the Miner's Hymns came along and that was a project that took a lot of time. So it was material that was always, for me, belonged together as a thing. And in a way, it sort of became like a diary as well. Because when you work on something over that period of time, I think it reflects the changes. that you go through and the changes in your life, the changes in your circumstances. And the Orpheus myth is basically about thresholds. It's about borders and thresholds and crossing borders, crossing thresholds, and about transgression in a way and the role of those things. in the artistic process or the process of creation. I mean, it's a myth about many things and it can be interpreted in many ways, but for me, this is how it resonates. It comes back, in a way, to this very difficult process of starting a project, you know, because you have to... cross the threshold and you have to you know go deep you know you have to go deep and and you have to bring something back from that place and hopefully it is a thing of beauty you know I certainly don't sort of personify myself with the character in the myth but for me it reflects a certain aspect of the creative process. There are so many other things, so many other resonances that I found interesting and that I found that could be made to fit in a very interesting way into this project. For example, I re-watched, you know, it's a film I watch regularly, which is Jean Cocteau's Orphée. And there are scenes in that film where Jean Marais playing the titular character of Orphée is in his car listening to radio broadcasts, shortwave radio broadcasts of very cryptic, strange and monotone recitations of words, letters, seemingly meaningless, you know, almost random, sounding like some kind of strange abstract poetry. And this idea was inspired by the transmissions of the BBC during the war, where they transmitted codes by shortwave radio. over to agents and to the resistance members in occupied Europe. And this method of communicating when Europe was then divided into two halves by the Iron Curtain and this became a method, a very oft-used method of communicating. These broadcasts of the BBC were... precursors of the so-called number stations, which a lot of people might be, or some people might be familiar with, which are broadcasts that were very prevalent during the Cold War. They're usually broadcasts of voices, very often female voices, reciting numbers, letters, these sort of long series of numbers and letters in a very monotone. voice and in many languages in English and German and Russian, Chinese. It's assumed that this is, you know, originates from various intelligence agencies and that they are codes meant for agents on the other side of the then divided Europe. And I felt that this was somehow connected. In Cocteau's film, there are messages from the underworld. These codes, cryptic... recitations of numbers and letters, again, meant to be communications across a threshold, a border, you know, which doesn't exist anymore. I was going to ask about whether there's any other particular sound sources which might not come. from like an instrument which has triggered this sort of associative resonance with you in recent years? Incorporating sounds that have their own set of references, you know, it's a very strong element, you know, and if you take those voices away from, you know, if you mute those voices, the piece becomes very, very different. And it's almost like writing a vocal line. melodies, you know, partly because it's a human element and we of course react strongly to human elements rather than, you know, a synthesized line or something, you know. It's one of the sources I use, you know, and one of the sources I'm very interested in. At what point was the opportunity presented to you to start writing music for specific non-musical contexts, you know, other mediums and things like this? The trajectory was kind of through theatre, really, because I spent a lot of time in Iceland and later more internationally. you know, writing music for theater, and I still do occasionally, and contemporary dance as well. I was involved with a choreographer. We created together pieces that traveled quite extensively. And my first album, Engelborn, is based on music that's written for the theater. It was re-recorded and it was rearranged and made into its own thing. It has these origins as a theatre score. And my next album, Virilov Fosetar, was a much more conceptual piece. It's an hour-long piece for a 12-piece brass ensemble and drone instruments, percussion, and then IBM-4201, which is again a conceptual piece. more melodic, more sort of accessible in a way. I just slowly started to get inquiries from filmmakers, you know, and, you know, who either wanted to license a piece from one of these records or they wanted... to collaborate with me. So yeah, I started by, you know, I did a couple of films in Iceland and I moved to Denmark, to Copenhagen, where they have a great film scene. Of course, they have their giants like Lars von Trier, but there's also a thriving documentary scene. You know, they make some of the most interesting work in documentary. There I started to work more in film. originally mostly on documentaries. Did it immediately call for a different way of working or was the overlap between what you were doing anyway and the music that ended up coming for picture, were they quite close together or did the new medium demand a different type of work? There's no real difference between the actual... process of writing music is the same, whether you're making a film score or you're doing your own thing. The process is always the same. Rather, I should say, the challenges are always the same. But the circumstances, the physical and practical circumstances are very different. Because with a film, you already have a framework. And a film is a collaborative art form. as is theater as well. And so you're working with, you're part of a team that's creating this work. So you're not the only voice in the... in the process and because people approach me through my solo work I've been able to kind of develop my sound through these two different kind of trajectories in a way concurrently and there's a lot of symbiosis they kind of feed on each other in a way like methods that I developed for a film for example very well be used on a solo album as well and vice versa you know some like some of the ideas in Arrival not the actual musical ideas but the methods were originally developed on a solo project of mine and there's a you know constant dialogue and for me it's all part of the same body of work and I haven't made a real solo album in like six years, you know, and so I felt it needed kind of emphasis, you know, I needed to, in a way, remind people that this is something I do and that this is something that I want to do, you know, and, you know, that I'm a composer, first and foremost, and film composing is one part of what I do. There are many projects in the pipeline that will further expand that. So I don't want to limit myself to one. And I think I've been extremely lucky in terms of, you know, finding, you know, very good collaborators in the film world that have kind of allowed me to experiment and to develop. artistically, you know. Do you think that's unusual? Do you think that, you know, most people writing for picture tend to have fairly narrow constraints imposed on them most of the time? Unfortunately, I think yes. And a lot of that is due to the use of temp music and to the nature of filmmaking and due to the fact that music is too often thought of as something that can be done very quickly as the last kind of phase of the filmmaking process, of the television process. I think that shows. And I think that this is why a lot of film music sounds the same. And because... the film is cut to temp music and people get used to that music, the director, the producers, and then when the composer comes and brings his ideas to the table, it's too late. And the way that Denis and I work, which is to not use temp music, and we've managed to avoid that for the most part. We haven't been 100% successful in that, but that is the goal. So he edits without music, and so there's no music put on the film until I send him something. And then there's a dialogue, obviously, because filmmaking is a dialogue, filmmaking is a collaboration. and to compose for film you have to be able to collaborate and I've been very lucky in having very very talented collaborators who are who have who kind of share certain sensibilities of mine, you know. So, you know, there are very rarely, you know, any clashes, you know, or any kind of differences. Of course, there are, you know, difficult moments, you know, and there are scenes that take longer, you know, to... to score than others and it's a long process and that's why I give myself time and that's why I don't for example do more films per year I get a lot of offers for scoring films and a lot of very tempting offers from very talented and high profile directors and some very, very interesting projects that I have to say no to because my process would be impossible to apply to the kind of schedule that many filmmakers kind of put in front of the composer. This is something that people are starting to think more about now. And I hope that the attention that our process has been and the attention that the music I've written for Arrival. and Sicario and Prisoners. I hope that that will, you know, kind of raise people's consciousness, you know, in the film world, you know, of the importance of music and the importance of giving time to the creation of music. Because it is very easy to write a score for a film in three days. You could conceivably do it in one day, you know. with the tools available to you. It would be completely off the shelf and generic because of the way music technology has evolved. It's easy to do things quickly and to make this process of scoring a fast one. But good things are never easy to create quickly, I think. I mean, they can be created quickly if you're lucky and if the inspiration strikes, you know. There are certainly scores that, for example, Chinatown, you know, by Jerry Goldsmith was written in three weeks or something like that, two weeks. For me personally, I think music should and the composer should be a part of the team. from the beginning. But this also requires the director to have a very clear vision for what he or she wants, and the producers as well. And this is very hard in filmmaking. It's very hard to, you know, there are not many directors that have both the vision and also the clout to be able to sort of accomplish this vision. So, because I read that an early excerpt of the Arrival score was played on set during shooting. Certainly not the first example. I mean, there are directors that... that work that way and I guess the most famous example is Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone during I think it was Once Upon a Time in the West I think or even some of the other spaghetti westerns where the score was written before filming and the complete score And Leone played the music while the actual scene was being shot. And because in Italian film at that time, all other sound was done in post, including dialogue. There's no location dialogue in those films. And I'm certainly not comparing myself to Ennio Morricone. I want to make that absolutely clear. This is a beautiful process, you know. And yeah, what we did on arrival, you know, having a crucial piece of score. quite a number of pieces composed during the shooting and influencing both the director and the cinematographer. For example, the shot where the main characters sort of slowly approach this valley where they first... discover or have the first glimpse of the spacecraft. Denny was listening and Roger Deakins, the cinematographer, they were listening to that music while they were filming. Because is it normally the other way around that the film composer would be watching the shots on the screen and timing their composition to, you know? This is a testament to Danny's qualities as a director. because he knew that this would be a very central and very important scene, you know, and it needed a very distinct piece of music to accentuate it, you know. And this piece I wrote happened to fit that. I had no idea he was going to use it in that scene. I only had the script. You can only imagine so much from a script. The feel of the music and the rhythm of it and the tempo of it had an influence on the way it was shot. I think filmmakers do that often. I mean, Tarantino plays music on set all the time. And a lot of directors play music. Lars von Trier played Wagner on the set of his first film. And this is certainly not uncommon. But for a composer, this is a really ideal situation in a way, and a way of working that is very conducive to creating work that has character and individuality. a certain boldness, you know, and, you know, because you allow yourself to just go to any extreme that you, that you feel is necessary, you know, of course, within the bounds of the script, you know, you, you have to, you have to have a certain sense for what the film might turn out to be, you know. Knowing Denny's style and knowing his sense of rhythm, the way he paces his films, you know, helps me a lot in that when I'm writing so far ahead of seeing any actual images, you know, so I have an idea of the pace, you know. and an idea of the mood. And we have very similar tastes, and we have very similar sensibilities in that sense. So it suits what I do very well. And I think that's a part of why it works. What cues are you generally looking for when you've been given something like a script? brief by a director you know what are you using to direct where you take a composition when you've got no picture it really depends and um we're with denny we we for arrival certainly we we didn't speak very much before um filming we talked about the story you know and and actually We talked about it a long time ago because Arrival, we talked about Arrival, you know, already after Prisoners. I knew the themes and we discussed the themes, you know, and the importance of language, the importance of communication, the importance of, you know, these main kind of, and the emotional aspect of it also, this very personal. kind of story of the relationship between the mother and daughter. And so we discussed those things, but we don't really talk about musical, pre-musical aspects. I mean, that happens later during the editing process. Then, you know, we can sort of pinpoint things more. And, you know, then he will point at an aspect of a certain cue and say, you know, can you emphasize this? Can you bring in more of this? And Joe Walker also, the editor, is very musical and he has a very good sense for music. So it's a great team. It's a great collaboration. How about with a film which has a pre-existing legendary soundtrack like Blade Runner? What was your reaction to being given that sort of brief? Because the legacy of that soundtrack is not to be sniffed at. No, absolutely not. It's a film that for a lot of people has tremendous importance for a lot of film fans and a lot of scientists. science fiction fans, but a lot of cinephiles in general, because it's a masterpiece. Or rather, it sort of became a masterpiece through this process that Ridley Scott went of slowly improving it over time and making his sort of own director's cuts, you know. And I'm old enough to have seen it in its original form in the cinema, you know, when it was released. and it had suddenly a big impression on me. It's a very important film for me and has been a point of reference for me forever, you know, in terms of visuals, in terms of mood and atmosphere. And Vangelis is a composer I admire tremendously. And I've, you know, listened to his records for a long time, you know, since I was very young. I think everyone is aware of the legacy of that film. And I'm certainly very aware of the legacy of that score. And it is a challenge. And it is, you know, you almost feel like it's a responsibility. You know, you almost feel like you're... I've been given a task that must not be... I like challenges. I relish in challenges. I don't like to repeat myself. I don't like to do something that comes easily to me. This is not going to be easy. Obviously, I can't say very much about what's happening, but we have started writing and we are in this process of... finding a sound and I can't really say anymore except that this is not a remake this is a sequel this is the world of Blade Runner and the world of Blade Runner is a very big world it's a world that I think you can explore for a long time the challenge is to create something that exists in the world of Blade Runner but also has its own character and its own identity. Yeah, it's the world of Blade Runner, but it's Blade Runner 30 years later. And a lot can happen in 30 years. Are you also creating your own ambient beds and sound effects and stuff like that in your work? Or is it purely just the music? I mean, music and sound are too often... separated as as as as being completely distinct things you know and they are not you know they are they are part of the same and especially in toward and in today's filmmaking you know and uh and people sometimes talk disparagingly about like sound design scores you know scores that are that are non-melodic and and are based on you know sound design and and And I think that's a very narrow view of what film music can be. For me, you know, writing the instrumental parts is only a fraction of the whole process. And creating sounds, creating sounds that have an impact and that are new, especially on a film like Arrival, gives you the opportunity to do that. You know, you can't maybe do that so much. on a film that's set in Berlin in the 1930s, you know. It's certainly a film, you know, that has this otherworldly, you know, element and this element of the uncanny and the strange, you know. Certainly offers more opportunities for that. And all of my career, I've always been very interested in sound design. in creating sounds and in creating processing sounds and finding new ways of doing that. And I've mostly done that with acoustic recordings, original things. So what I usually do, bring in an instrumentalist, a player, and record. some ideas, you know, maybe some melodic ideas, maybe pure, you know, sound. We produce maybe, you know, hours and hours of sound and then it's edited down and... I identify something that has certain harmonics or certain sort of sonic qualities that can spark something, you know. And then I process that. And through the years, I have a certain sense of what can work and where a certain sound can take me, you know. But there's always a lot of serendipity as well. There's always a lot of, you know, happy. accidents and that's what you have to be, goes back to what we were talking about earlier you have to be open you have to be able to spot those tiny things that maybe spark something much greater you ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Thank you.
