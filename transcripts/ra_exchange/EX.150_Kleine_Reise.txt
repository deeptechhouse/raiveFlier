Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Will Lynch, and I'm the Associate editor of Resident Advisor. You can learn a lot about Berlin's club scene from the story of Kleiner Reise, a record label and former venue run by three friends from Ireland, Dara O'Neill, Peter Power, and Patrick Reddy. Without really knowing what they were doing, the trio set up a bar with no liquor license in the basement of a hostel. Two years later, it was a staple of Berlin's club scene, with international bookings and a tight family of regulars. They had to stop throwing parties in 2011 thanks to one irritated neighbor, but they bounced back almost immediately with a new spot across town, Loftus Hall, which quickly became another local favorite. Now they're getting ready to move again, though to where exactly they're not quite sure. In any case, their goal remains the same, to create cozy, inclusive events like the house parties in Dublin. Little utopias, as Power puts it. you So, you guys are looking for a new club right now? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, right now we're starting a monthly series. Party series. What's that all about? It's the bridge between Loftus and the new Clan Ariser. I guess the new Clan Ariser is three to six months away, so in that time we're going to do a monthly party in unknown and unused locations around Berlin. The first one will be the next Clan Ariser Records release. Then yeah, we want to make it make it each one really unique. So this talk of like hot tubs and Craning a hot tub onto it roof and stuff like that. So yeah, it's just, yeah, that's the plan. So when you're looking around for new and unused locations, how does that work? Like, how do you get leads on a new spot? Yeah, I mean, we've been looking for actually for like about eight months already. And we worked with property developers and just talking to people. It's really hard, really hard to find something that's going to be really special and fresh. Yeah, it's just really hard. I think there's a lot of people looking for stuff too. But I mean, we've found stuff already. But after what we've been through already, we really want to find the absolute ideal. So we found stuff that have potential neighbor problems that are amazing, but that we just don't want to go through that again. You know, any neighbor issues. Pretty tough. What's like the ideal spot in terms of, you know, atmosphere? What do you look for? forward that if you found it you would say it's got to be this place I think something that hasn't been used as a club previously ideally and has no neighbors has water is central centrally located. I think the main thing we found from looking is that if you walk into a place, you know just from the, you know, a feeling of being there. If it's going to be good to have a party in or not, you know, just from walking in, you're going to know. I don't think that's too big either. Yeah. We found like... Because Cloud Analyzer was maybe 200 capacity. And then we moved to like the office, which was 400, which is like double. And then we realized the bigger it is, the more kind of business pressure there is to kind of like fill it up every month, every night. But like it's smaller than anything, like grow more organically. you can have like 50 people and still have an amazing party and then as long as the atmosphere is good that's all that matters. But anyway, if you start off big and then try to fill it up, you just get too lost in the whole numbers game. Yeah, you can lose sight of the important stuff. It seems like you guys like cosy places. Not just in terms of size, but overall. Yeah, for sure. Why do you think that is? Or why does that appeal to you? Well, that's the whole kind of house party vibe, I guess. Kind of in Dublin. Like we first started throwing parties in a... It was actually a house our friends moved into. in college. I was in the middle of an industrial area and because in an industrial area there was no neighbours around so they could like... How many times have we said neighbours now already? Play music all through the weekend and then it was just like just friends having like gathering around every weekend after the club just going there and we just really enjoyed that like house party vibe. it out like? We're kind of forced into that because in Dublin the club slows at 2am, maybe 3 at the latest so there's a huge culture of house parties and when we moved to Berlin it's pretty much the opposite of that there are not that many house parties going on, when there is one it's really special so that's why Our idea for Slanted Riser was to fill that void and make it kind of like a house party with different rooms. And so you can wander into different rooms, different atmospheres, like wandering to the kitchen or into the dance floor, which is the sitting room, you know. Why did you guys originally move here from Dublin? I was DJing and producing music at the time and Dublin's quite small. I lived there for seven years or something. So yeah, I just moved here for a change. It was only going to be one year, but then bought furniture and got stuck. I don't know. Why did you move here, Peter? I just finished college and this was like my first trip on my Around the World tour. Yeah, me too. And I came here because I was here just for a visit and ended up falling into, just as I was about to leave, ended up falling into Clone Ariser. We never intended it or anything, it just kind of happened. Yeah, I mean, how exactly did that happen? To me, it seems interesting that you guys, as expats, sort of got involved in the scene in such a significant way. Yeah, I guess Ireland is a very particular culture of how we party and... I definitely felt like I was fading into the Berlin style of partying, like trying to fit into it. Actually, we started before we opened Kleiner Reise, myself and Mano and my cousin Elian put on some parties. And then Kleiner Reise, I used to walk through Spreevalplatz, and it was a derelict hotel there and I used to go past the little door that was like into Klein Reise and look in through the crack and think that would be a great place for a club. I even showed it to my parents even like a year before we got the opportunity to open it. We were passing and I brought my parents over and I was like look in there. Wouldn't that make a great club? They didn't really get it. Yeah, and then I did a website for the landlords of that space and they gave me a tour of the building and then it was a complete rubbish tip, like waist-high rubbish in there. And I just asked, yeah, if you guys renovated it, I'd rent it. Yeah, so we fell into it. They kind of... I saw the space, I was amazed that I'd been in it. I was in it now that I'd seen it before. And then we came to an agreement and it just happened. Even when we got into it, we said the opportunity was there. do it whatever happens let's just throw ourselves into it you know so it was actually really a rapid change from what we were doing before to doing it it was just like an opportunity that just came up yeah I guess it seems to me like do you feel like it's surprisingly easy to get involved in stuff like that as a foreigner in Berlin yeah yeah opportunity was yeah post boundaries until you get told off and then like The authorities are quite good. You just do as much as you can and if you piss anyone off, then they slap you on the wrist and you go, okay, and then they take a step back and then get your certain licenses or whatever. Yeah, in Ireland it's all sewn up. And also with insurance, it's personal insurance here. The amount of investment it would take to start something and the red tape around health and safety, it's just not possible. I would never have tried to open a club in Dublin or in Ireland. Yes, because the opportunity here is so much freer, so much easier. Even the police would come in. We started off with a cafe license with no alcohol or larpeness. And the police would come in and be like, what are you doing, guys? We know, we don't have to see your license. We know you're not allowed to sell alcohol. And we'd just go, oh, I'm sorry, we didn't know. We can't read the license. And they'd say, okay, we're coming back in a month. We get it sorted. And then we'd have to do that part. And then they'd come in and they'd say, you know, you need more fire extinguishers. You need a phone so you can ring the fire brigade or whatever. Give us a month. We'd do it. So it was actually that learning process even for us, but they gave us the leeway. to do it at the start and then we had one neighbor and they came down real hard then at the end so that's that they they let it birth really easy and then they killed it in the end anyway but I guess in another city you would have gotten fined at each at least yeah I mean we did get fined eventually but I mean like for the no not serving liquor without a license they could have shut you down yeah they locked the door in another city for sure they just locked the door but yeah so it's kind of in a weird way, the city kind of fostered this learning experience for you as, as, you know, running a club. And then just snatched everything away. Also the area was getting more, I don't know, because Freeville Place, the neighbours were getting more concerned about the, like, it becoming a party hub. And I just think that, which would have been great. It was perfect for that. Yeah. I think. It was really one neighborhood, just one in the building, like a five-story building. There was one guy out of, I don't know how many, 20, I don't know how many people in total, but just one guy. And that seems like kind of a common thing in Berlin, actually, that... in so many ways it's extraordinarily easy for clubs but then one thing that can get you is just neighbors complaining like you know it's like they have a similar thing around club division air and everything the whole club is kind of being strangled by a few complaining neighbors yeah but the city doesn't really have a problem with them um with the neighbors or with the television i mean um neighbors around club division air complain about the club and um you know get the cops to go down there and make sure it's what not above a certain decibel and stuff like that and are they new neighbors coming in or because that was the other we had new neighbors who moved in and and they were like uh yeah come on you turn it down just turn it down i was like we just moved in above like mark's cafe there's a 24-hour falafel place and a club, and you moved into the first floor above them. We've been here a year. You know where you're moving in. I really do care about neighbours, for sure. I'm someone's neighbour, too. You need peace and quiet, but I think there has to be give and take. If you move into, someone's just established a business and they're a year in and then you move in above them and you complain that you're above a club. I don't know. Yeah, I wanted to talk about the party you guys had on May 1st at Sprayball Plots, which I thought it was kind of a good example of sort of what's possible in Berlin. You basically just threw a huge party, like a street party, right out front of the club. Did you have any special license for that or was that cleared with anyone? How do you prepare for something like that? We got fined for that. That was our first fine. Did we get away with that one? Initially we had a speaker set up on the ground just outside the door. And every year the police designate a specific area of the route where the skirmish is going to take place between the demonstrators and the police. And it's happened that that year, the first year, it'll be through the party. that they designated on Sprevo Platz. So the police came in and was like, no, no, you can't have a party here. Get her off the street. This is where we're having our skirmish. So then we finally managed to come to a solution that we just put a speaker through the windows of the first floor, just above the club, and then just played from there. And then, yeah, just like by like four o'clock, there was like 2,000 people just spread out throughout people plots. And the demonstrators coming through. Like they split in the middle to let the demonstrators come through. And all the parties are cheering them on. And then like all of a sudden, there's just like the crowd just disperses. And then there's like Molotov cocktails and like smoke. Yeah, smoke. Like classic smoke. If you go on YouTube, there's videos of police kicking demonstrators in the head and all the girls who were raving just clinging to the sides of the walls, knocking on doors trying to get in. And then eventually, it started after about 20 minutes. to start to keep... We could soundtrack that as well. We soundtracked the chaos that we played there. What was it? Timmy Thomas? Yeah, yeah. What can we do together? Like blared it out while the police and the administrators were fighting. It was more as we were settling down. We stopped the music to not antagonise anything and just as we were starting to settle down we went up and blared it out like tell me why, tell me why, tell me why. can't we live together? And then all, like all the ravers like slowly started coming. And then like, and then within like 15 minutes it was like full on rave again. That was like, one of my favorite moments in, in like, in the whole like, Clonerizer experience. Yeah, you guys, another thing that's interesting to me is how you guys moved to Loftus Hall really, really quickly. I mean, again, it's sort of weird that that's even possible, that you found a new space so fast. I mean, how exactly did that whole thing go down? Well, we were having all the neighbor problems, and we... I think we'd been open, it was coming up on two years, in Llanowar, and then we really needed a break. So we closed for a month and we went back to Ireland and we all just split up. It was like end of June, all of July. And then when we came back and opened up, it was just chaos. I think the neighbors thought that we'd shot for good and they'd won. So we opened up. They were just not having it. It was, yeah, it was just, we knew that it was done then. So, but we knew this was probably coming. So we were talking to people and we had. friends looking and we were looking and then the guys, the landlords of Clarnoisa saw how good it was and they had a friend who found a place but they weren't really that into it actually and then we went to have a look at it And they're looking in the window, they're like, oh, look at those doilies and, you know, look at the interior of this place. I was like, no, that's what's so good about it. Let's definitely take it. Yeah, there was talk of, like, renovating and all. Like, no, no, no, no, just leave it as it is. What was the place, actually? Like, what was it? It was a sports club, and, like, they did wedding receptions there. And it was a canteen for the Ballywolf offices. So, like, they had breakfast and lunch and dinner. It was run by an old couple, and then the husband died, like, some years ago. So it's the backstage is now just like sleeping there and like had her TV and doing these like I think she was too tired to do it by herself or like maybe just scared to do it by herself people breaking in and stuff as well so she was over 80 so she had to give it up all the little trinkets like when we got inherited all the little trinkets with the place and yeah but that wedding reception vibe appealed to you definitely yeah yeah it's just it's just like a time machine basically like the things they bury in the ground like a time capsule time capsule yeah to just put in like a good, a new modern sound system and keep it as it was, you know, it's pretty, yeah, I was pretty excited about doing that. How did you, um, let people know that you moved to a new spot? Like what was the publicity effort, you know, for that transition? Well, like we, we still had all the parties booked for Clan Arisa for like, for like the next month in advance, I'd say. And then like, we just, We had to do them, so we just brought it to Loftus Hall, didn't advertise it, just advertised it as the address, as kind of a trial, because we had no time to prepare for anything, so we were just winging it for a month, and then I guess after about a month and a half, we decided to officially open with an opening party. And a name and a logo that had a name. That's what we were waiting for, just like thinking of a name. How did you come up with that pricing scheme? Like for a while it was... I guess it both, but I guess the thing that sticks out in my mind is how at Loftus Hall it was free for a while before midnight. and then if you were putting on a night there it couldn't be more than a certain amount. It started filling up before midnight then and that's when we started having trouble with promoters. not being able to fit anyone in so they can't pay for their DJs but I think it was the same thing going back to the house parties in Ireland as we said at Clan Risa we didn't want any kind of status mattering on the door or even particularly how people are dressed And that was, it was like, yeah, we wanted to see how that would work. And actually, I think we proved that it works just fine, you know, just letting whoever wants to come in. come in if they if they fuck up inside then you know they have to go out again but uh yeah i think again it's a very inclusive not exclusive sort of family uh vibe which is i think it's the only way you can really have fun and have a really good party if you're not just happy to be in there because you know you got in and whatever you're just happy to be in there. I mean, yeah, I think that's really important for a good party. Yeah, I mean, it's obviously a double-edged sword, but if you create the right setting and, you know, your feelers are in the right direction, then you attract the right people. You don't have to have this strict door policy or anything if you're promoting right. If you're promoting it in a natural way that you're telling friends and telling friends to tell friends, then it shouldn't be a problem. I think even things like no photographs or no... We never said to have no photographs, but we don't... I don't like it when there is photographs. Yeah. But the fact that you're telling them not to do it, it's kind of... I don't know, you're like... You don't want to incite rebellion in other people. They should not want to do it on their own accord. Just by example of what's going around. So did you guys hang out at the... You would hang out at the club most nights? It started to... I mean, yeah, Klein Reiser was just, you know, we were wet behind the ears and we were just so into being there all the time. It was just amazing. And I guess we loved this came with a bit more pressure. And we just, yeah, we didn't like, the longest break we got was that one month in the summer when we hit the closed line rise afterwards. But, you know, we just needed, we weren't even able to get away singularly for like three months or something just to like really take a load off. It's just like wore us down, didn't it? Yeah. Doesn't it? I mean, I don't know. I think it's probably... and that's a normal thing for anyone involved in a club I think the creative aspect kind of gets put in the background after a while and it becomes it becomes like as soon as it becomes a numbers game it stops being enjoyable and then as soon as it happened it's just kind of We knew we needed to take, we lost the love, not the love, but we needed to take it. We needed to find a new experience and find a change and try to transform into something new. It's something we have 100% control over to ourselves, you know. It was pretty, yeah, really important for me anyway. Do you think other people that run clubs have such an intimate relationship with it? I mean, I feel like a lot of people would be happy to have their club just humming away, you know, even if it's a numbers game or even if they don't have that much fun there anymore. There are people coming and you have parties going on. I think for us, life's too short to just rest on our laurels. seeking new things and new ways to express ourselves and learn about music it's meant to all be about creating the atmosphere for the best possible party so We're all trying to create our own little utopias. If the foundations aren't solid, then it'll never arrive to anything. So you've got to keep recycling the foundations until each new foundation is slightly stronger and slightly more all-encompassing. Yeah, I guess that payoff that you're kind of hinting at... when you were saying the final period of Kleiner Reisland, every night there was just, you know, off the charts. What, like if you took one of those nights, what makes it so good or what's going on that, you know? that nails it for you? It was just so free. I think the staff felt free there to enjoy themselves. Everybody felt just free to enjoy themselves because of the door policy, because of the atmosphere that was there, that people weren't... weren't worried about letting go like I know that there's some issues promoters and DJs have in Berlin that if the audience are like screaming or shouting along or cheering along that there's it's a big problem why what do you mean no I just noticed that there was one we were we were I guess there's something else we were we were at a club and one of the Brokeback DJs was playing at this club and we were singing David Guetta along to the track. You guys were singing David Guetta. It was when that tune was really big, which I'm not doing. and love takes over yeah yeah we were just like we're just enjoying ourselves I honestly didn't even know that they could hear us but we were the only people in the dance floor as well dancing yeah yeah only people dancing I guess maybe they were just pissed off in general but yeah they stopped the record and said like shut the fuck up and we're like we're the only people here what happens if we shut up but yeah and promoters and DJs at first say oh god would that person shut the fuck up like Jesus they're like hootering and hollering over there but in Ireland it's like anything goes like in a club house party anything goes in a good way and a bad way but uh yeah so we had that we had that atmosphere that anything goes and the people are the music i mean everyone in the crowd has as much responsibility to create the music as the part as a dj does it's an exchange between the two and people forget that like all the you know the oohing and the aahs and all that it's just it creates part of the sonic atmosphere So we know when, like when people like Moody Man put like crowd noises into their tracks, it's because those people are like the atmosphere of the music. They're like the... Yeah, the atmosphere. If the atmosphere of the people isn't enjoying themselves and happy and able to express themselves and the DJ's out of sync with this, then it's... It's just a bad party. It's just a bad party. Yeah, people should be able to feel free to add to the sonic texture of the atmosphere. Sometimes when I... I felt my role was like the cheermeister sometimes in Final Rising. To cheer myself. To cheer myself. If I came in and I noticed that the mood was a little bit subdued, any moment that there's a little bit of a lift, I'd go... We're a cute mom! Or, yeah, or Yomon. But yeah, earlier on you were saying that basically what needed to happen next was like some sort of broadening of your, you know, perspective or something, you know, that you were actually to a corner or something like that. We need this. space anyway just a little bit of space to like let that happen yeah yeah um i guess i mean could you say like do you have any idea sort of um what that means for the next thing or you know like What's going to be different about the next spot? Who knows, though? It's like, it still hasn't happened yet, so we're just old to, it's old ahead of us. We're just happy to have the opportunity and the possibility to explore the possibilities, basically. Yeah. We're also four years older, so it'll obviously be... because we still want to be there and still want to be into it so it's going to be slightly different but we also want to go back to the roots of Clanneryza which was all based in friendships and family kind of environment and anything goes Yeah, and as well, I think it really depends on the space. The space we find, you kind of have to work with it, and that's where we're at right now, is finding that space. So, yeah, we have loads of ideas and how to really make something fresh. we really have to find the space before we can really like apply all those ideas so at the moment we're just going to like do different locations for each release party that we do for the label for ClientRiser Records so that'll be just a good way of like sussing out what's out there and what's possible and what and just yeah enjoying having parties in different places for a while. Yeah. So I guess at this point you guys take it for granted that like, um, just like, this is what you do. For sure. No, this is definitely not like clubs putting, putting on parties. Definitely what I want to do. Like no way, but I want to do it right now. So that's, that's what like I, I, I want to. I want this story to continue right now, that's for sure.
