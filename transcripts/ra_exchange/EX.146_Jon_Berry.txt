Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. In his role as label manager, John Berry is one of the central figures of Compact, the celebrated cologne outfit that has recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. Although originally from Vancouver, his roots in electronic music are tied to New York, which is where he made the transition from punk rocker to raver. Berry fell in with the Brooklyn scene that centred on labels like Lenny D's Industrial Strength, with whom he scored his first job in the industry as an unpaid intern. After some time spent working in PR, he wound up at the Four Sink and Mill Plateau stable and through the latter met Compact's Wolfgang Voigt, who was releasing his music as gas through the label. Fast forward a few years and Berry made a move over to Cologne and was welcomed into the Compact family, who he's now been working for for the last six years. On the occasion of Compact's ongoing 20th birthday celebration, we took the opportunity to chat with Barry about the inner workings of one of dance music's most famous institutions. I guess, should I just start from the beginning? Yeah, of course. I moved to New York in 1994. Well, I didn't move. I kind of went out there to visit a friend from Vancouver. I was coming out from Vancouver and kind of arrived into the city and was, remember, we were driving over the Brooklyn Bridge and honestly, I burst into tears. I just, I just, I felt like I was home for something, something really clicked in me about New York. and that whole realization anything's possible and all that. We went to see another friend that I knew from Vancouver at this cafe. She got me a job immediately. She was like, look, if you want to stay here, you can. And I was like, you know what, screw it. I'm not taking that return ticket home. And started working at this place, Sidewalk Cafe on Avenue A. And at that point, I really wasn't listening to any dance music. or electronic music whatsoever. I was a punk kid. I was super happy to be in New York because at that time there was a lot of really cool hardcore bands coming up at the time. It just felt good. And the cafe that I was working at, a lot of the bands would come into in the nights. I was working the graveyard shift. Shortly after that, I met this girl, and she introduced me to a friend who was working at Earache Records. which is a grindcore label, you know, which was doing like napalm death. And so I got brought in and they gave me a position as an intern, like an unpaid position. And I proceeded to work there for the next, God, I worked there for about a year for free. I was going in every day and then working nights at this cafe. So I was basically sleeping for like three hours at a time. I had no life, but I was super into it. And I just was. fascinated with how records you know how the machine came and i really felt that this was my calling you know it was the um first thing so at earache they um licensed this compilation And at the time in Brooklyn, there was this pretty large hardcore techno scene happening. And one of the main guys behind it was Lenny D, who started out, I guess, historically. He is kind of one of the techno founders of the New York scene. He released some of the first American techno music, even, in the early 90s. And at that time, I really didn't have any idea about that or any of the history. But I was like, this compilation I was really fascinated by. It was like anywhere from 140 to 220 BPM, you know, just intense music. And Eric was kind of going at it like, this is the new grind chord. This is the new metal. And I started researching it. And I was just like, wait a minute. There's this. monstrous scene existing in the U.S., this huge scene, and it's this rave scene, and there's all these parties that are happening in Brooklyn, you know, at the time they were called storm raves. Frankie Bones was deeply involved with at the time. And there was just the digital domain crew from New Jersey was doing these amazing parties. And I just started really feeding into it. And I sat, you know, they brought me into some of the meetings because I was so into it. And slowly I started realizing we came up with different campaigns to approach it. the CD came out and this was called Industrial F*cking Strength and uh It just, you know, it sold like an amazing amount of copies in the first month. It was like over 50,000 copies. It was massive. And it really signified a change, I think, in bringing the general public awareness to that whole community. Because I needed a job and I was getting really sick and tired of working all night and working all day at this label, I was really desperate to get a job. caught notice of the work that I was putting into that and decided to give me a job. So I ended up going to work out in Bay Ridge, near where Saturday Night Live was being filmed, working out of this basement. And I was kind of... thrown in there with really you know at that time I'd been calling record stores you know checking in to make sure they had the new anal cunt record and the new napalm death well that's basically and I was packing envelopes and I got thrown in there as a product manager which is basically in charge of all the manufacturing of the records and Yeah, for the next three years. Well, actually, within the first month, the label manager, she walked out, left Lenny on his own. And Lenny at that time was DJing all the time. And I was kind of thrown into dealing with his bookings and also basically label managing this company with really no experience whatsoever. And with Lenny going out and DJing on the weekends and then basically coming in during the week and working on the label. There was a few other people that I'd worked with, fortunately, that I worked with, which really helped allow me to gain some of the experience. But I was really thrown into the lion's den and didn't have any experience. But through that, I got very much exposed. to the whole scene. So what you ended up doing was something that resembled label management? In a sense, yeah. Like I was technically called that, you know, I definitely didn't know really what I was doing at the time, but I had a lot of passion and enthusiasm. And I think Lenny really saw into that. And he really believed that I had. the chance and we really worked together very well. It was a great experience and I was also very much interested in what was going on in the community. The first thing that really gravitated, it still stays with me is I think it's from my punk rock backgrounds or just growing up as someone who really related to the DIY movements and community building and helping put on shows as a kid. I just really related to the way the whole hardcore scene was really moving at the time. Yes, it was rave, those big pants and lollipops and all that. But at the same time, there was this genuine, you know, realness behind everything that was going on then. I imagine things were pretty chaotic around that time in terms of the industry. And I guess in New York, it would have been almost a fledgling industry. It was. Yeah, like there was a lot. We were doing really well because in Europe, the whole Dutch Gabber scene was massive. Thunderdome was bringing in, we're selling like millions of CDs. It was a big franchise. We did a lot of licensing with ID&T, this company at the time then. It really generated an income that helped support. and build this community. There was a decent amount of money coming in at the time. I think it's always been a struggle since I've been in this scene. But the parties that were happening at the same time, especially in Brooklyn, were really, you know, this is like 96, 97. You know, they were really going off. Like it was, there was something really special happening. And what was the... of that and that time and that scene it it kind of i think like i worked until 99 for lenny um what i felt is that the the rave scenes it was growing at a massive rate you know uh guys like pascal from insomnia who's now um doing um uh electric days yeah he was he was a huge We worked very closely with Pascal on the West Coast with a lot of their parties. The scenes were very different. There was also this growing concern and impact of... drugs in the parties and ketamine and especially around 98 really started taking a huge it had a huge impact on the overall parties themselves the vibe of the parties the kids would just be you know sitting on the floor in the corners just in a daze that you really the whole vibe of what was going on in these events was really decaying but um it was obviously a very underground movement it still remains like lenny still industrial strength still lives he's still djing all the time you know there's a there is this undercurrent scene of you know hardcore parties that's still happening uh but uh I think the unfortunate circumstances of industrial strength is that the costs of running the label, the priorities of what was going on with the label and the issues surrounding the overhead and everything, and probably just bad business management, I guess, unfortunately caused it to close down in '99. And what was the next move for you? I guess for me, the next, yeah, like I was unemployed in New York, a bit concerned about what I was going to do. And I didn't want to get out of music. I heard that there was this company called Kyperinia that was looking for a publicist. And they were also looking for a retail sales manager. I was like, well, I've never done publicity. Like Lenny at that time, we never did any promo whatsoever. against it. Was that true of many others in the scene at the time? It was quite common. You know what I mean? Like we'd send out records, but there was a lot more vinyl. Like this was the days when vinyl was the mail outs. You know what I mean? There was no, we'd sometimes burn CDs, but it was vinyl was the mainstay. Actually, I could tell you a little funny story about that. My ignorance back then. When I was at Industrial Strength, I guess it was the first or second year that I worked there, Lenny would be out of the office, and of course I'm taking calls all the time, and there was this guy, Richard, who would always call. And he's like, look, I've been taken off the promo list, and I'd love to get the new records, blah, blah, blah. And I was like, well, we're not doing any promos, sorry, blah, blah, blah. We You know, at the time, at that point, I really only knew the industrial strength characters. He would call and he's like, hey, it's Richard again. Is Lenny there? And I was like, no, he's not around, man. I'm sorry, we can't put you on the list. He's like, can you please tell him that Richard James is calling? So, of course, Lenny comes in and I'm like, hey, there's this guy Richard James calling up all the time. And he's just like, yeah, well, what's up? And he'll, well, he wants promos. Well, send them to the guy. And I was like, well, you told me not. He's like, it's Richard James. And I was like, who the hell is Richard James? He's like, it's Apex Twin. And I'm like, who the hell is Apex Twin? And he's just like, oh my God. And he's like, you're coming to my mom Lenny takes me out to his mom's house in deep, deep Brooklyn. And mom's Italian Brooklyn family. She's cooking marinara. And at that time, I was like bone thin. She's like, oh, Lenny, look at this guy. He's got nothing in his bones, nothing but bones. And he's like, can I eat? And Lenny's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, mom. And he takes me downstairs into the basement. Their basement had basically just been converted into Lenny's record collection. And I'm assuming it still remains. He'd never gotten rid of any record that he'd been given or he bought. And he'd been DJing since the 80s, you know. And so this basement was just wracked with different music. And we sat down there and he pulled out, you know, he pulled out. Well, he was like, first of all, I got to tell you, the first industrial strength was Mescalinum United. One of the breakthrough tracks, we have arrived, which was a huge deal because it was licensed and turned through R&S and Richard James Apex did a remix. So he played me that. He started playing me selected Ambient Works. And then he... threw me into the whole back Warp catalog and just then showed me the techno movement and just went through historically record by record and patiently told me different stories because he knew all these people personally. And just it was really life changing for me. And it just made me it made me a convert overnight. And by extension was compact on your radar at that point. Not at all. No. Wolfgang was because we did. I think it was because of that I kind of compact was closer to the end. I mean, closer to the end of my time at Kuiper Enab, but there was this compilation called Microscopic Sound that was curated by Taylor Dupree. And it was. It featured Wolfgang, it had Thomas Brinkman, and it had also the, it had Ryoshi Akita, Carson Nicolet, and this stuff was just like, to be honest, it couldn't have been more minimal sounding. It was just like, you know, it was very left field. It was very, very difficult for me to promote. Barely anyone would even, you know, pay attention to it. fell in love with the aesthetic of it and the sounds that were coming from it and it really had it was something very different and new and that's something that really gravitated towards me because i'd never heard anything like it yeah i was going to say because ostensibly that's quite a move away from the um the scene and the situation you were describing to me Absolutely, it couldn't have been any more opposite. And I think that's what also was fascinating to me because my head had been filled with, you know, distorted kick drums for a few years, which I still love to this day. But at the same time, there comes a point where you reach a limit, you know. So you'd mentioned to me earlier how you'd first had contact with Wolfgang. How do you go from... that phone conversation to be under his employment. Yeah, like at the time I was working at Kiperini, you know, Akim Zipanski, who runs Four Sink and Mill Plateau, approached me about finding a publicist who could work on the music. And that microscopic sound compilation that Taylor had put together. contained a lot of artists or music that was from the Mill Plateau label. So I was really, at that time, very intrigued. So I sat down with Yara and I said, like, look, is there any way that I could do this on the side? And she was very supportive. And she was like, yeah, as long as it doesn't interfere with your day-to-day here, why not? It was a good move because I ended up having to, you know, leave. It ended up becoming my full-time job working for Mill Plateau. But yeah, Akim sent me a box of promos. And I remember getting it. And it was like, Gas Pop and S&D debut album makesend. So I went out enthusiastically, sent the promos out and contacting all these magazines that really didn't want to hear anything about it. People were really, really charmed and really impressed with the Gas Pop album. It seemed it was honestly one of the first times I'd gotten proper feedback and interest. So I was quite excited about it. And I call up Akim and I'm like, look, I've got all these interview requests. You know, it's amazing. um when can wolfgang do these and uh he's like well you should ask wolfgang yourself and i was like okay um he sends me his number i get on the phone with wolfgang i mean i call this number and i hear like hello compact and i'm like hi is wolfgang there and he's like yes this is wolfgang and i was like oh hi well gang this is John Barry I'm working now with Four Sync Noplatia doing their publicity and he's like okay and I was like hey I've got all these interviews for you and he's just like what and he's like I will not be doing any press whatsoever I'm very sorry that you've wasted your time here but I would prefer that there's no press at all and so I hastily was very apologetic and said to him I was like well I'm very sorry and And he's like, no, no, I don't see this being any problem. He's very polite to me and gracious on the phone. get off the phone with him. And I was just very dumbstruck, first of all, because this was the first time I've ever really dealt with someone who really didn't want to have any press. And at the same time, I got very intrigued and fascinated as to why. And that made me go in further into learning about what his history was. And then I realized, at that time, I had no idea one of his aliases was Mike Inc. And I'd actually known a fair amount of that music because it was very abrasive and hard acid. And I'd associated a lot of that through some of the tracks that Lenny had been playing. there. So when I started linking everything, I was like, wow, he in a way comes similar. We're all kind of, I'm coming from the same lineage in a way of interest in that. And, uh, I sent over to him some of the reviews I remember and, uh, that came in and, uh, He called me, I think, again. And over the course of the years to come, we stayed in occasional contact. Also, on the Mill Plateau label, we released an album by Sturm, which is Walt Reinhardt Voigt. And one of his aliases is this very dark, brooding, atmospheric techno. It came out through the Mill Plateau label. So I got to know his brother as well. He was quite okay with the press and everything, and we got speaking to each other and got to know each other during that campaign. But yeah, that's kind of, that's how I started. That's how I met them at least. And how does Compaq come into this? When did you kind of come under their employment? How did I come to their employment? Well, I ended up moving from New York up to Montreal in 2001, just before actually everything went down, you know, on 9-11. And I was still working for Four Sync and Mill Plateau. And, you know, through that period, things in 2000, I guess it was 2003. Yeah, it was September, I guess, 2003. I got involved. I heard that there was interest from Martin, who's still Michael Myers' booking agent, saying that, hey, the guys are really interested. come over and play. So I helped put together a show in Montreal, a show in Detroit for the guys and from Reinhardt and Michael. Yeah, I remember, like, I'd never really heard a lot about Michael. Because of the Four Sync history, I'd actually kind of, Akim had kind of desisted me from speaking with Michael. And he, yeah, I just never really, he'd never really come into my radar, weirdly enough. So I was kind of meeting him blind and I'd spoken with Reinhardt obviously. So when they got into Montreal... you know, I met the guys and we just, uh, yeah, I don't know. It was like, we were all friends, you know, it was, uh, it was just, uh, it was a really cool experience, um, to meet them and, you know, yeah. And at that point, um, we went down to Detroit, actually deadbeat was on board as well for that show and, uh, had a crazy time. I remember like, you know, Seth Troxler was like, kid him and Ryan were like kids in the crowd you know jumping around and it was just it was just a very important moment and I I got really at that point exposed to you know watching Michael DJ and he was very, for me, it was one of the more impressive moments for me watching and experiencing a DJ because I got exposed to that sound of compact properly. And I'd heard little bits and pieces, but to hear it in a set put together just really blew my mind. And it, yeah, it was a big moment for me. When did you make the move to Europe? Oh God, I made the move to Europe in 2007, I think it was. Yeah. So you'd already been, you'd continue to work with them up until that point? Yeah, well, what happened was, it's like with Compact, around that time, Mill Plateau and 4Sync closed down. Once again, I was out of a job and I was wondering what I was doing. At the time, I was doing some publicity. I was doing PR for Kid 606 on the side. And he at the time was doing really, he was doing very well at the time. And I really, really loved working with Miguel. And we'd had a really good role with the PR. And he didn't want to see that end. And he had Tiger Beat 6. And he was just like, look, I need someone to take care of the publicity. I'd befriended T. Romshmira and T. Romshmira, Marco was like, look, he came through Montreal around the same time and he's just like, dude, I'll give you a little bit of money if you want to do publicity for Shit Catapult. And I was like, huh? And then Miguel spoke with, I'd done PR for this, his album on Ipecac, which is Mike Patton's label. And he was like, look, let me have a word with those guys and see if they've got projects for you. And they were working on some stuff. So that really allowed me to launch my own PR firm. So I started this company, Regenerative Industries. 2003, 2004. And then within a year, I'd done a couple more tours with Wolfgang and Reinhardt. And yeah, they were kind of like, look, I was like, look, I'd really love to do publicity. There's a demand here. And at that time, there was a mail-out service that Forced Exposure were doing, and there was a guy, David Day, there. Really, really enthusiastic. And he was a big part of bringing a lot of German and European electronic music to the press as well. And yeah, so at that point, remember, again, Wolfgang calls me and he's like, look, I think we're ready now to do publicity. We're going to bring you in and we'd like to have you as, you know, and so I had them as a client. What was the pitch you were making to publications? What was the angle that you were projecting of what these guys were about, would you say? I really wanted to bring out the humanity. behind what they were doing. The passion, the thing that really resonated and still resonates with me about Compact is that it's a family business. It's friends who made music that wanted an outlet to be able to release their music and they wanted to do it themselves. There'd been a real, there was a distributor called IFA, IFA out of Hamburg, that really had monopolized and controlled worldwide the distribution for many of the core labels worldwide from dance music. And when they went bankrupt. Force Inc. really was one of those labels that really took a heavy beating. It almost put, it bankrupted a number of labels and it really, it was very much the beginning of, you know, what would soon become, you know, a period of tougher times for a lot of, you know, electronic music labels out there. I think Compact, I was really, really enthused with the fact that Compact had set up on their own this self-distributed, you know, record store and imprint and just the aesthetic of how they were doing it and how they weren't, you know, there was no rules, really. They were able to, and the way that they were developing it and letting it grow was happening very organically. Nothing seemed like it was marketed or preconceived. They just let things happen, which was something I found fascinating. And it was becoming very successful. It had become very successful, I should say. I think one of the more interesting things that came out of the recent oral history we did was Wolfgang talking about this idea he had of compact being this almost factory-style cultural commune, if you like. Do you feel like that idea developed in the way they envisaged? Did that come to pass? Yes, I think, you know, like we are that creative infrastructure that, you know, I think that we have all the different facets to not only create art, but as music or, you know, even visual art for that matter with Wolfgang's interests in visual art today. You know, the bottom line is, is that. I feel that Compax very much succeeded in creating his world dream of really applying techno and electronic music and creating a support system and a mechanism to be able to really deliver that to the world. I mean, is it something that's kind of palpable, do you think? Like when you first started working with them, was it very clear what their mission was? I think, yeah. Like to me, I think their mission was just, you know, I think they brought me in not because they wanted. to become famous in America. They were probably just getting more tired of the persistent calls and requests that were being fielded their way into Cologne and wanted to have someone that they trusted able to tell the story. I guess back to what you were originally asking, a lot of my pitches directly were really surrounding the fact. I took a liking in a way to the, there was a soul, there still is, the soul Washington, D.C. punk label, Discord, which was kind of this infrastructure set up by Ian McKay from Minor Threat. And over the years, that... they were able to really develop a label and get their music out there and, you know, support their artists internally in that, within that DC community. I saw that kind of family values application being applied there. And that's something that really grounded me, but I saw something a lot, a lot more, you know, the value of, you know, the DIY aesthetic and the fact that more and more labels were coming into the distribution structure. You know, at the time that I started getting involved, I think that they had around 40 labels already that they were distributing worldwide. And we, you know, and to this day, you know, we continue that. I think having, and then... obviously with the booking agency and the development of the record label and the events that the Compact continues to do, those all really tie into the creation of a greater whole as an infrastructure. And on a personal level, how did your role develop? I guess, like, I hit a wall doing PR. I just, I felt that this was around 2005. I was representing a chunk of European techno and house music. that was coming over. I felt, though, that I was, you know, there was a small group of writers and journalists and editors that were really out there supporting the music at that time, and it was very limited. But I always felt like I was kind of preaching to the converted. And, you know, the exploration of... really pushing forward and a lot of the other publications that we really wanted to get into would invariably have very little interest because of space or because of you know just a lack of interest or understanding of the music at that time. So I kind of reached a wall. And I remember at that point, I was really considering getting out of the music industry as a whole. And I remember Michael came over to do a tour and I was traveling with him and I told him this. And I was like, look, dude, like, I don't think I can do this any longer. And he's like, well, you can't leave, you know? And I was like, yeah, I think about it though. Maybe this is my time. you know and he's like well look don't don't don't consider that you know and then I remember he was like, why don't you come over to Cologne and meet everyone and everything? And Wolfgang gave me a call. So I came over and it was during Seal Pop. I think it was the first Seal Pop in Cologne. And there was this big compact party and I got to meet everyone. And I hung out with Wolfgang and we just... I just really got to experience what that family was. And I was just like, wow, I was really enthused about it. And they didn't say anything to me at all or anything. They were just hanging out with me. But I had a feeling that potentially, you know, they were looking at maybe bringing me in. So I came back and I said, I said, I was on the phone with Michael about some stuff regarding. you know the promo and i said like look dude like i'm really serious about this i think i've got to stop doing my company here and then about 15 minutes later i get a call from wolfgang And he's like, look, you know, we're really happy with what you've done. And if you want to change, there's definitely some things that we could see you working on here in Cologne. Namely, we need someone to really go and develop our CD distribution department. And so I was like, oh, Cologne, okay. And I was like, well, what the hell? You know, there's nothing else here. So in a way, I felt like I was really. It was an opportunity. And obviously just being, having experience seeing how these people worked. And I was just thoroughly, I just thought it was magic. And I was just, you know, I jumped on the opportunity. So I moved to Cologne back in 2007, in early 2007. And yeah, and went in and... It was my job, kind of my task was to look at, go through the CD distribution department and, yeah, basically rebuilt the structure there in that and tried to enhance and obviously develop it, which, you know, I did for the next two years. I assume your role's changed quite a bit since then. Yes. The fact that I'd kind of jumped around in doing different jobs over the years, there were a lot of things that I was able to really come in and help with. So, you know, my job at Compact, even today, really isn't a specific task at hand. It really surrounds... dealing with developing or dealing with certain issues even that come up in any of the departments of the company, you know, whereas there are, you know, at Compaq, there are people that have specific roles and tasks. What happened was I was still in the CD distribution department, and, you know, we just decided. I guess this was a few years ago. I was just like, look, you know, I'd love to get more involved with the label. For all the years, everyone at the company had always really dedicated themselves to the distribution department. It was a big focus was supporting the family. In a weird way, Compact is a label. had always really run, in a sense, as a secondary part of that machinery. It was always, obviously, the music that came out was a priority, but we'd never really had a lot of time or effort to really go in as a proper label, into the label. Michael and me made decisions and I've since really focused myself on the task of the compact label at hand. And much of the company's really evolved, you know, towards we have more people now, obviously, that concentrate their efforts on the development of the record label today. Okay. So is that inclusive of things like A&R? Yeah. Today, like Michael Wolfgang. you know, the owners all play a key role in what's being released on the label. I'm definitely involved in that process. And I've had the privilege to be able to bring projects to the table. And a lot of my role at the company is dealing with, we have a huge roster. So it's dealing with on a day-to-day basis with many of the artists. and and you know obviously ensuring that we're you know setting up our releases you know through appropriate marketing and promotional efforts you know and then and then obviously working together with our distribution and uh our booking agency to make the most of hopefully selling and, you know, getting gigs for these artists. What is a typical way in which Compact is kind of sourcing new artists? It can be anything from a CD that's sent to the office, an email with a download, you know, one of us on, you know, discovering something. on SoundCloud, there's really no, there is no definitive method of how we find or get an artist, you know. - But you mentioned SoundCloud there, so you're still focusing things outwards also, it's not like you've received so many demos that you basically wouldn't need to look yourselves. Yeah, like, you know, I think there aren't as many occasions today where we're actually going out and looking for talent. We actually have a really full house right now. You know, we've got a great family right now. And I think overgrowing that family will inevitably, you know, not benefit anyone in the long run. kind of the last year has I mean this year has been really based on concentrating not only on our anniversary but also on you know on the artists that we have at hand in our family right now and you're also involved in artist management yes and who do you look after? I'm a manager matthias aguayo the field um michael meyer and uh then i'm also doing production management for you and pearson i mean how strategic do you have to be about those type of things It is. There is a lot of strategy that goes into it. I think today, especially in dance music, in any music for that matter, it's very difficult to stay on the radar of what the public dictates as being interesting to their ears. I don't necessarily think that marketing is everything, but on the other side, you know, it's, it's, there is an unfortunate predicament that that is playing an important role in the process and development of an artist. You know, music today isn't everything that unfortunately for, for how people can, you know, not experience how, how they can explore and. find music you know discover music when you kind of mentioned there the um shifting tides of like public opinion and one of the interesting things that came out of the oral history pieces and you said that signing the field in Gibberato around 2007 was almost like a watershed moment yeah it was right as I came in and uh it was an it was an interesting period I I wasn't so aware I will say that there were some really amazing records that were released on the label before then um But it was a very interesting, pivotal moment because I think there was a lot of North American, there was a lot of attention being put on Compact at the time and being involved a lot in the media. You know, like we had a lot of bigger magazines. Interviews were being done. You know, the owners were talking. And there was a bit of a what comes next moment. And yeah, you know. two very different artists, you know, like The Field. He came up with these three singles prior, or two singles prior to the release of his album. And for me, I was, I just really gravitated to what he was doing. And I found something, I've been always very fascinated, I guess, coming from more, you know, coming from a punk rock background, I was always kind of, I had a hard time really comprehending why the scenes were so separated. Why there was, it was like kids are either into electronic music or they're into indie music or they're into punk music. Everything was so genre specific and even house and techno, everything. I was just like, where's that gray area? Why am I living in this gray area? Why do I go to a record shop and buy all this music? And then there were more and more people coming out of the woodwork and saying, you know, it was almost like coming out of the closet. Yeah, I listen to techno. It's not a dirty word. And I think what the field really did with his album was really conjoined so many different elements. And it just had such a wonderful effect on the public. It was amazing to be a part of that moment to see, you know, how a breakdown per se, you know, at one point a real breakdown of how people really perceived dance music, you know. Yeah, I mean, to put things, I guess, in very, very simple terms, do you think that kind of signaled a focus towards the album format for you as a label? Yes, I think there was. We were moving more and more towards that. There was a demand for more albums. I think the label was definitely focused on albums because it's an important release point for an artist. It constitutes so many different variables apart from just releasing an album so someone can tour. It really is an artistic. expression and and it often differs from a single um i find that's the beauty of uh electronic music per se is the expressionism of like of emotion you know and an album i find is you know definitely a defining moment for an artist you know um and how people relate to it It's unfortunate that in some ways today, you know, albums get broken apart and that has become much more of a focus, particularly in modern, you know, house and techno today. Would you say that it's kind of gone hand in hand with a sort of more quote unquote indie focus? I mean, you kind of also mentioned the piece that you've been signing more bands. in recent years that was actually you know that was that was then in a way um you know like compact I really feel like Michael and the owner's focus of interest don't really relate on waves of movements of following trend or what it dictates. It's really been very much about what interests them, what they're finding interesting. And obviously, how those links break into the trends that are out there today, they come and go. you know, how steadfast that compact remains in terms of, it's not selfishness. It's just more of, we do what we do. And I think. you know, that the music that comes out in the certain periods may, they may not, they may not necessarily dictate trend, but at the same time, they're definitely appreciable for their time. And I think that what's really characterized with a lot of the catalog is that there's a timelessness to that music. And I think that's something that will, you know. at least coming at the label as a fan. And also, you know, I should say as a worker, that's something that I deeply appreciate because there's so much music out there today that is temporary, that's flash in the pan, that, you know, maybe people will come back to in 10 years, but there really isn't that kind of... longevity to it and speaking of longevity and you've definitely mentioned it you've just as a label of turn 20 can you tell us a bit about how you've been my this year? Yes, well the first one was just happened last month there was a in Geneva Compact set up a pop-up store and then there was a big event surrounding it. The goal this year is to set up events in different cities around the world and bring that record store you know bring the Compact record store which is really the fundamental you know, foundation of what the business is and really bring that to different cities and, you know, show people that. You know, there are also a number of releases that have come out. We just, for Record Store Day, we just reissued the first compact record from Jurgen Papa, Triumph. and remastered it sounds wonderful now and and then Wolfgang did a Mike Inc is dead remix he's kind of coining he's revived Mike Inc in the different guys but yeah which is always interesting do you have like a personal theory on why the label has been as successful as it has been I think that we just got a great group of musicians to work with. I really feel honored to work with the people that I do. They're wonderful human beings. Each of the owners are very individual, but they all characterize a different element that makes up a greater whole. And the value of an artist, I think, many of the artists that remain and are, have been with Compact for so many years, the pride and the feeling of family that they often reciprocate to me is, you know, it's very moving and it's something that I, you know, I see obviously many different record labels out there, but I think given the you know, like someone like Matias Aguayo, he's really been, he's been working with the label for, you know, over a decade, you know, and that's, gone through so many different phases and and to see him still you know we now work with him on his komame imprint and we've really you know we have these abilities to really allow people to move into their you know and to grow and to develop and i think that i think that openness of uh as a you know predominantly known label as being minimal techno which god knows why we are known as that but it's uh to be to be called that i find i find that very fascinating and interesting and wonderful So as you go into a third decade of operation, what comes next? And has that been a topic of conversation for you guys? Well, Michael said it best. The best is yet to come. And that's the true path of Compact. And the thing that I really enjoy about working for the company is that there is never a finite... decision made on any path that we take. You know, there is this open, you know, the book's never closed. And, you know, I just hope that we're able to continue releasing great music and, you know, getting it out to people and developing it. in a way that obviously the artists want to be perceived by and continue spreading the message.
