♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor and resident advisor. Dinky has a new album coming out in the summer and given its context, it should prove to be one of the more ambitious records released this year. For the last three years, Dinky has shifted focus away from producing house music and instead turned her attention to singing and songwriting. In many respects, this has meant starting again from scratch. Alongside her husband and co-producer Matthew Styles, the pair had to learn a fresh set of skills required for a more pop-focused approach. It's an impressive challenge to undertake when you consider that Dinky has been engaged with electronic music since the early 90s. Back in her home country of Chile, she got to know artists like Ricardo Villalobos, Luciano and Danny Jack, who were then setting up roots in Germany and absorbing the country's techno scene. Like many Chilean producers, Dinky eventually wound up in Berlin, and it was there that we met up earlier this month to discuss her two decades in dance music. Feel free to survive Now you fall in anger Now you will stop So you have a new album about to come out. Yes, finally. In June, it's on Vision Quest. I wonder if you could start by telling us what you set out to do with this record that was perhaps different to what had come before. I always wanted to songwrite before I was doing tracks and things like that. And I did find it a little bit hard just to go on and songwrite. And I think with this album I wanted to take my music to a different level. and use my voice, sing and songwrite and play instruments, but at the same time don't lose my electronic music roots or my dance roots as well. So that was the change I wanted to do. It's not really a huge change because I still have my sound, but the big change is the performing aspect, which I am singing and I'm playing lots of... things and guitar and in an unconventional way and keys as well and also the songwriting aspect which somehow I had to study it a little bit and kind of know the rules to break them. I don't have so many rules of songwriting in my album. They're not very cliche or not very traditional, but I wanted to know the rules and then see if I should use them or not. That's it. I feel like as we spoke in 2009 for a Machine Love feature and you just released an album. at that time and you were saying that you were very pleased with the album but you'd maybe necessarily not gone further enough in this direction that maybe you wanted to take this thing further. Exactly. Has this been something that's or a direction you've been looking to take for a long time in that case? Yes, yes definitely for a long time but I didn't feel ready and I didn't feel experienced enough as a performer because if I was going to perform the album as a singer, I thought, well, I have to perform in front of people and everything. And I wasn't really ready for it. I needed a little bit of experience. I'm kind of a shy person in life, so I just didn't trust myself I could do it in a way until I went out there and did it in front of people. And I felt fine, you know. I wasn't so sure if it was going to be okay. And I had to kind of be sure about myself first and share it with other people and stuff. But there were a lot of things, not only the performance aspect, but also the... the technical abilities of like songwriting and playing guitar and things like that so in the in the first instance how does a house music producer or someone with a house music background sit down to write a pop record like what was the starting point for you um The starting point, to be honest, it's very important to listen to our music, to listen to a lot of records. I mean, I listen to a lot of jazz because I don't like so much the word pop. It's kind of sometimes misunderstood. People say, ah, it's pop, it's bad. No, pop is popular, but with vocals. I did listen to a lot of jazz and a lot of soul and blues and things like that. from pop or alternative pop. And I copied at the beginning, just made covers and just sung things and understood how things worked and how the songs were structured and how the melody lines were done. I think that was the starting point, basically, just... just listening and making covers of records. Like as I did with the other album, which was a Massy Starr cover, that's exactly how I started to understand that kind of... structure. Do you feel like you've almost had to slowly change your mentality in the way you think about yourself as a producer or a musician? A little bit but I still wanted to be honest as an artist and don't you know like be myself but I had to I had to be a bit of an actress in every song because I also didn't want to sound the same on every song. A lot of singers in the album, they sound the same, like exactly, and the voice is very particular, but I wanted to be a little bit different as an interpreter in every song, so I had to be an actress a little bit in every song. For example, one song is a little bit moody and the other one is more sassy. For that, you need to interpret. So you need to... you need to change a little bit your personality or the personality you're showing to the people. But at the same time, be honest. That's good. That's actually something I noticed in the record. The mood of your voice was definitely changing and fluctuating throughout the record. Were there things you could do with the production also that would go towards this? With the production, I mean, Matthew helped me a lot. You know, we never recorded vocals in a professional way before. I did lots of vocals before, but in a very loose way and without technique and things like that. But this time it had to be more professional. We wanted to achieve a clear sound and a natural sound and expensive sound, how people can call it. So we experimented a lot and sometimes we recorded 10 times the vocals. Because we messed up with recordings or I didn't have a strong voice and a year later I had a stronger voice and things like that. So it was the length of what took me to do the album or what took us to do the album had a lot to do with we were inexperienced. We didn't have so much experience and we needed to learn. It was a learning process. And how is the process broken down? between the two of you like what is matthew's role well basically um i wrote the songs with like very basic elements at the beginning and um i would go to matthew and show it to him and he would tell me what he thinks and what could be improved or what didn't work And then I'll go back, kind of rearrange things as he said, or if I thought he was right, and produce the song roughly. And then we will go back to it and produce it again, let's say, like that. Sometimes I would change absolutely everything, just keep the vocal. And some songs were written on guitar. I put the bass and then Matthew helped me with some modular sounds and things like that. And I did record half of the vocals myself, but half of the vocals we went and re-recorded in a very special way with a big microphone. Matthew was in the control room and I was singing in the other room. And that was a great experience for me because I didn't have to go run around and adjust levels and he was just... be talking to me on the headphones and saying how to improve my performance can you tell us how you're planning to perform the album what's the what's the live setup going to look like sure I'm gonna do it with Matthew because it's a lot to do by myself and It will be really nice to do it with him. He knows the material very well. So he's going to do electronics, drums and mixing live at the same time, everything, and looping and effects. and I'm going to do my singing, of course, guitar, but in an unconventional way. When I say guitar, some people think it's going to be like rock. No, not at all. It has lots of pedals and effects and it becomes a bit like a synth, the guitar, in a way, like an instrument, a different instrument. And some keys I'm going to do as well. Ideally we wanted to do it exactly like the album but since the album is not so clubby and we are very involved with the clubs and a lot of clubs need us to make a little bit more of a dance version of it. So we're going to do two versions, one totally concert. that could be performed as a concert and the other one that could be a bit more dance too and more beat oriented. Were you ever apprehensive of taking on the project together? Because you've been married about a year now, haven't you? Yeah. This one is a kind of newly married couple, maybe you were nervous about working together in such close quarters. Yeah, it was hard. beginning was fine and then when we started getting offers from labels and trying to make decisions we had some discussions we don't fight we're not a couple that we fight so we had some discussions and it got a little bit stressy at one point and then I would go back and I said okay let me work alone on this and then we would reunite again and do it again together but at the same time it was a good experience for us. and it made us stronger. But of course there were conflicts. There were tears. There were a little bit of fights and we're not used to that. And it made us really strong as a couple. Yeah, I mean, it must be hard to detach yourself from the project. Did it ever come to the point where like, okay, we need to stop talking about this now? No, but it came to the point that maybe I said, maybe I should do it by myself. And then I realized I was totally wrong. But no, we're fine. We realize this. We realize that we have to separate things sometimes. What's your personal... journey being like moving towards becoming a performer really and feeling comfortable with your with the sound of your own voice and getting used to the idea of being in front of people in this way yeah yeah this was a big question for me because it was sort of an accident when I started using my voice and a lot of People started telling me I should do it more and then I went to lessons and my teachers were like, yeah, you're good and you should do it, you should do this. I remember once a teacher told me, you should do this for a living. She just said that. She was a professional singer and I was, okay, you know, I didn't know if I could do it. I wasn't sure. I know it's really hard and it's really hard to be in front of people and sing. It's really And what I did, I said, I was nervous at the beginning because I knew I had to do it just like from nothing to be a performer. So I had the idea to start singing while I was DJing to see. So you hadn't done anything until recently? No, I started to sing in October. Okay. Like in front of people. Of course, I did some singing with workshops and people that are on the same boat as me singing in front of 10 people to criticize each other on my lessons, things like this. But no, I didn't do any shows before. So I started singing while I was DJing and this was a very big help, I think. It really relaxed me and I was like, okay, I'm going to be okay. Because it's really hard to sing while you're DJing. It's even harder to sing while you're DJing than while you're just doing your own song, performing your own song, because it's so loud. Your vocals don't come through the monitors. So you have to have a really good ear to catch the pitch right if the vocals come from the big speakers. Are you sampling your voice as well? Are you using sample manipulation? I'm doing a little bit of looping, but not so much. just the harmonies and things like that and improv a lot of improvisation um how difficult has it been switching between these two quite different modes i mean if you've been um training and singing and studying jazz and such like during the week has it been difficult to switch into nightclub mode come come the weekend well i it's No, it's not so difficult. I mean, I've been doing this night thing since I'm so young that it's very normal for me. It's two different words, but at the same time it's music, so it's not difficult, no. I'd read that you were maybe in a bit of a strained place with DJing a few years back and you were maybe considering placing it to a back seat or stopping to concentrate on... I always have those things. I think everyone I talk to, my colleagues, have the same problems. We always have crises and I always say, oh, maybe I should quit. I'm really tired. DJing is fun. DJing is really fun. But it takes a toll on your health. and flying and sleeping, things like that. At a certain age, it can get a little bit tiring. Are you someone who travels well? I don't like traveling alone. I can deal traveling with other people and it's just too lonely. It's a cliche, you know, but it's... You get bored. You get bored. You're in the hotel. What am I going to do? There's not always, not everything works out. And I always think like also people in the club, they're there to have a good time and you have to give them a good time. And sometimes you're like tired and you have problems of personal lives or whatever. And it's hard. You know, it's hard to like... put on the happy mask and give them the hats and or like waking up really at 2 a.m and going to the club sometimes you're really tired But it's the best job you can get almost. No complaints. This is definitely an acting aspect of it. Yeah. You'd also said that perhaps as the years have gone on with your DJing, you've become less of a party person. Do you almost need to... detach yourself sometimes from what's going on around you yeah that's that's a difficult aspect because you can't really get so involved if you're not partying as everyone else but if you're honest and you're just giving the love of your music and djing and giving people what they want and what you want It's fine. It's fine. I mean, I have a drink or two. Sometimes I get a little bit drunk. Sometimes I don't drink. There's no rules. You can't do it without it. You can do it. But I choose to be a bit more pure when I perform. So one of your main gigs has been Panorama Bar, which has been since 2004, was it? You became resident? Yeah. I wanted to ask, are there kind of characteristics of your DJing or perhaps your personality that have kind of made this a good fit for the club? I think so, I mean, I'm not like an Osgood per se, totally person, I mean, I've done records for them, but I'm not in the roster, or like not super identified with the Osgood sound, but they have me sort of like as a resident guest, as a family, because I think... Maybe because I have my own sound, I guess. I don't follow so many things. I don't belong to any group. I guess maybe they like that. I haven't asked. But they keep me there and they're very nice. And I'm an easygoing person. If they want me to play at 12, I play at 12. If they want me to close, I close. If they want me to play for six hours, I do it. It's a pleasure for me because everyone is very nice. affair and uh yeah it's like a family so yeah i was interested in um how it's been uh to be a part of that group in something that i guess is going to be seen as um almost defining of this era is this something that you would kind of talk about with people at the club or other residents is there like a a sense of what's going on and being a part of something that's felt very, very important. I thought about that, but I don't know. We never really talk about that. We're living too much in the present to realize what's going to happen in the future, I think. But one day it really crossed my mind. I was thinking about Paradise Garage and how we were talking. with Matthew, I think, and how important is now the name and the history. And I said, well, maybe Panorama Bar will be a little bit like that too, but in a more modern way, in different music, because it's so strong in terms of the door and the music and what's happening inside. The difference is that there's never going to be a video of it inside or a film maybe. But it could happen, yeah. It's very important, I think. It's a very important institutional club. Because one of your, I guess it was one of your first trips to Europe, you'd visited what would have been classed as the old Berlin institutions and Tresor and IVEC. Yeah. How did they compare to what was going on? It was great. It was amazing. I mean, I was 19, so I was really young, but I was showed. this world by my sister and she knew everyone and we went to the Eberg and everything. It was the same. It was the same. It was like very crazy and very free. It looked like... It looked like Berghain now, but maybe a little bit... Yeah, the music was a little bit different, but it was the same. I mean, how did you process that culturally as a 19-year-old? I mean, I'm guessing you hadn't seen anything like that before. First, I never went to Europe. I was like coming direct from Chile, like sort of like a little bit of a countryside girl. But I mean, I'm from a capital, but still Chile is very far and very much behind in Europe at that time. So it was crazy for me. It was like, wow, I didn't want to get out of the club. I think we stayed 24 hours inside with my other sister. I loved it. I loved it. That was... The day I decided I wanted to DJ as well. I mean, I was already collecting records and I knew how to mix, but I wanted to do it. It inspired me for sure. Yeah, I mean, were you already warmed up to the kind of idea of club culture? Did you have a sort of view in your mind's eye of what the scene looked like? A little bit because of Ricardo and Dandy Jack. and everyone was coming to Chile every summer before that, like a year before that, I think, or two. And they were doing the party. But they were doing it in a different environment, which was the Chilean environment. But yeah, I did have a taste before that. But I never saw a club like Iver or a trestle. I mean, Iver was very, very impressive, I have to say. What was the Chilean environment that you're talking about? what did the scene look like? Small clubs or maybe mid-sized clubs but not like more conservative. No transvestites, there were no trannies or no like people dressed differently or like gay people. There were gay people but they were not publicly shown. They were like my friends, you know, like but it was not so crazy, not so like. Pinterest maybe. So it was just more conservative, let's say. So the group of Chilean artists you mentioned at the time, they were based in the country? No, they weren't actually. They were coming just in the summer, winters here. Let's say January here is summer in Chile, so they were just coming. And they were organizing parties and raves and events and things like that. And yeah, that's how I got to meet them, actually. And was there ever a sense that maybe what was going on in Europe could be achieved in a similar way in Chile? There was, but it sort of stopped. It was weird. It was really strong at one point, but because no one stayed there. In Chile, it's a bit sad because there's good artists, but they all feel like they have to leave the country to make it out. To be able to leave from your art, it's hard in Chile. Unless you're a folk or a pop artist, which is also pretty hard because you have to be the only one. So people don't stay there. So the artists or the organizers, they just leave. Which is what you did yourself, I guess. Exactly. Because you were involved in dancing and you were a dancer for a long time. Yes. Was that something that started in childhood? Yes, exactly, in Chile. Yeah, I wanted to go to this special school that I really liked because I was studying the Graham technique, which is modern, I mean semi-modern, started in the 60s, dance, and I wanted to go to New York to Martha Graham School because in Chile I was never going to be able to study that technique or to see what was going on in the real dance world. It's very hard to be a dancer in Chile. My sister is still a dancer. And it's pretty tough for her and for her company to survive. What were your aspirations as a dancer? Did you have a goal or a dream, if you like? The thing is that since I started so young, it was maybe a little bit too young to be more realistic about what I wanted. So I continued until I was 25 or something. But I wanted to be a choreographer. I wanted to, my idea was like to make really modern choreography, a bit visual, like almost like theater. That was my dream, but it kind of faded away when I, I mean, I discovered music before, but I had to choose and I thought music was stronger for me than dance. Which is something that kind of manifests itself very strongly when you got to New York, I guess. Yeah. It's just when you started to DJ in a more serious way. Well, the thing is that, I don't know, I think my passion for music grew much stronger than dance in a way. And I saw also the practical side of dancing. It's really, really a tough career, but it's also very short, you know, because of the physical. I mean, I cannot tell you how many injuries I have still. So like at 25, 24, you're already pretty in pain. Everyone. I don't know any dancer that doesn't have problems. So I also started to think about that. But also I wanted to make music and going out at night, it didn't really fit at all with the training of my dance. Going out, DJing and stuff. In dance you have to be... There's crazy dancers that make drugs and like... drink and stuff but if you want to achieve something you have to be trained six hours a day in the morning and go to sleep early and stuff like that so it doesn't really it's like the opposite you know so and did DJing kind of fill the the gap if you like your kind of need for expression and performance and being in the spotlight I wanted to be in the spotlight. As I said, I almost kind of shy and I was kind of glad that DJing, it wasn't so much of being in the spotlight at that time. Now it's a different thing because you can be really, you can take a step back as a DJ. You don't have to be so much in the spotlight. Now it's changed, you know, like DJing is so important in these times. But at that time, DJ was someone who was making people dance and sometimes... it was in a covered booth you didn't even see the DJ sometimes in the 90s I don't know but it was it was yeah you're right it took over the expression I wanted to express myself as a DJ but as a musician too I started making music at the same time and that was very strong for me always it's been very like DJing came it's like sort of secondary to that the aspects of composing. And it would have been New York when you started taking producing more seriously. Yes. Well, I started when I arrived, basically. I bought a machine with my savings. I was an MPC and I started learning how to use with help, of course. I went to a professional studio. I have a very good friend of mine. He's a pop star in Chile. And he was the one who took me to a professional studio and we make a song together. Sort of, he wanted to show me and he thought I had something to say. And that's the first time I saw a professional studio. I mean, I'm talking a really big studio with like the Grammys on the wall. And I was like, wow, this is great. I fell in love with that kind of world, with like recording in studios and bands and making music on big desks. But at that time it was hard to get in the equipment. So I had just one machine and I did everything with that. What were you trying to say at that time as a producer or an artist? I was... Quite avant-garde, actually. I just wanted to express myself. I didn't have any plans. With the little equipment I had, I had to say something quite deep and melancholic, probably it was. But I couldn't really do much because of the limitations I had. So it was interesting. I think limitations are really good somehow. Because I did an album when I was only 22 with this machine and it came out and everything. Because you were quite quickly signed to a label, weren't you? Yeah, like in six months or something. And you'd produce an album not long after. Have you kind of always felt about yourself as being an album artist? Yeah, I love albums. I think it's my preferred also way of listening to things. I think they can tell a story. They can remind you of years and times and persons. It's a bit sad that it's kind of dying, the format, you know? Like people can choose to buy things here and there. It's okay. we have to evolve but I really like the format and when it's well achieved it's so well achieved I mean can you look back on your own albums as kind of signposts for what was going on in your life at the time I mean do you have very specific memories associated with all of them? I don't listen to them. Really? No. I don't know why. I don't listen to them at all. It's hard to listen to them because it does remind you of bad things and good things. And yeah, I prefer not to listen to them. I don't know why. Maybe I should. As soon as they're released. Is that the cutoff point for you? Yeah. When the record comes out? Yeah. With this one, it's different. With this one, it makes me want to listen to it sometimes again. And of course, I have to perform it, so I have to listen to it a lot. But with the singing, it's more like communication. But the other ones are very instrumental. And I also started being very critical about them. Like, oh, it sounds terrible, or it's so much bass, or so low-fi, or I should have done this. I start being a little bit critical with them if I listen to it. I kind of get out of my critical side. I'm quite critical with myself. And I think this album, I worked so hard on it and I don't think I could have made it better in a way. It came to a point that I was like, that's it. So I could listen to it because I'm more proud of it, maybe. Yeah, I understand. I just wanted to dwell on the New York period for a moment. Is everything that I had done, well, the several biographies of yours that I'd read had kind of made it quite evident that... if you found it difficult at the time with DJing. I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about your experiences and why it was so tough to be involved in dance music in the city at that time. But there was not too many opportunities for a young girl also. I mean, it was rare to be a female as well, which is a plus in a way because people are like, people get interested if there's a female. There were not many. It wasn't hard because I was a female, definitely not. It was just because there was no venues and there were no... In a scene where there's no venue, there's like a few venues and it's already taken by bigger DJs to make a spot for a new one. It's very tough because they're going to protect their territory. We are humans, you know, we protect our territories. So it was hard to get in the scene. As a DJ, of course, I went out, there were my friends, a lot of people, but to give you that space to perform, it was hard. So we were performing in bars and little spots like that. So I was performing a lot, but in little, little places. So it was tough to really expose yourself to a bigger audience on a nice sound system. And you put on a party with Magda around that time, is that? Yeah, that was a little late. That was like 2001 or something. No, 2000 maybe, yeah. It was a little bit later after I was there for a while already. Yeah, this was really cool, actually. This was working. Yeah, that's the thing. You had to put on your own party to make it work. And in New York, it's not so easy because of the space. It's expensive. Neighbors, everything is cramped. What was the sound you guys were interested in at the time? I think... well at the time I was like I think I did acid in my fridge so that was kind of the sound like it was like Michael Mayer like speaker that song or like I remember that song there was a little bit of electro going on a lot of used to skunk hair things like that yeah like in between electro and minimal And also metro area. Yeah, lots of German influence. Lots of German, lots of compacts, yeah. And you were eventually forced to leave the US, that's right. It was due to visa complications post 9-11. Exactly, yeah. But it was sort of like a mess up for my lawyer too. I don't have any bad... feelings like, oh, they kicked me out. A lot of people made it see that they kicked me out, like the press, because like there was something on the Village Voice that was really exaggerated and it was not true. I had to leave because my visa wasn't renewed, basically, because of a mess up of my lawyer. But it was, if I didn't leave, if I stayed. I was going to be deported. So I decided to leave. But it wasn't like, oh, you have to leave now, you're deported. In a plane with like handcuffs, no. It wasn't so hard. And it was good. It was good for me. It was hard to leave very fast, but it was the best thing. Did Berlin feel like the natural next choice or step for you? Yeah, because my friends were there, basically. I had lots of friends. I didn't want to go to a country I didn't know anyone. And I thought Berlin was exciting since the last time I was there. I already had tour there briefly. My first tour was there and I knew people and I found it really fascinating. Yeah, I mean, it must have been in line with kind of music interests or the music that you were pursuing. Exactly, yeah. And I had work offers, agency-wise. And at that time, Berlin wasn't the hype thing. But it happened really fast when the city became so popular, really fast. So it was sort of exciting. I mean what were your experiences like in the in the middle of what you'd say would be the minimal hype storm I don't mean do you look back on this on this as time as kind of maybe a high point for Berlin was it yeah like 2003 and I don't know. I was so involved with everyone and so in the middle that... And it was so crazy times as well. So many parties, so many DJs. It was great. It was really, really positive. A lot of people look back and say, oh, it's not like... But it's never going to be like that, of course. It was really, really nice. I mean, what's your view on it? Have you seen pretty substantial changes since you've been here? Yeah, well, gentrification, definitely. Definitely. doesn't bother me it doesn't really maybe it doesn't bother me because i'm not a berliner i'm i'm a foreign too so for me it's okay but gentrification and um it just everything becomes more popular and more big and like property goes up and clubs become more famous and before we were more free, let's say, to do everything we wanted to do and to make illegal parties here and there and were crazy illegal parties in like a strange building. Now I haven't seen that, but maybe I'm not in touch with that either. I'm not sure if it happens. But it's like, it reminds me a little bit more of New York now, but in a much more free way. What do you mean specifically? In terms of like there's a lot of like artists from like New York at one point it's like every artist would come to New York and like musicians as well. I mean it was I'm talking about the 90s and 2000 and everything changed but Like everyone wants to come to Berlin because it's sort of like the place to be for artists, for music, for design, for painting and stuff. And do you think you're, personally speaking, your outlook on things and your kind of approach to music and composition has changed a great deal since you've been in the city? Yeah, I think... The fact that to be also involved with other people, like, in the same studios and, like, learn from them as well, how they work and what they do and what they buy and what they like has changed in my... Before in New York, I was a bit isolated. I didn't have so many friends that had studios or... we were all kind of poor and young and now it's important for us to see how other people work and to collaborate with them yeah because you've been in the same building as um several other producers over the last well kind of recent past i guess exactly as those types of communities been very important in your development as a musician and producer Yeah, I mean, we're in a building with Tobias, Max Loderbauer, Matthew Johnson, and a very important person for us, which was Ingo and Paul Lemp, which own an indie studio, which they have recorded bands, and like Jamie Liddell, and they taught us a lot. They've been quite important for us in terms of... how we recorded the album and everything. But also Tobias, and we're all from studio to studio. We lend things to each other. sometimes you know they they record me they they help me to set up my level things like that that's really important it's incredible I think I guess someone like Tobias has experience in the in the fields of music that you've been moving towards definitely he's been also very important as well because he gives us advice, like, I mean, vocals are really hard to... to treat and to make right, to record right. So he's been really helpful with that as well, to give us advice. And what he hears, we don't hear. He has really golden ears. It's true. Can you see yourself pushing further into this singer-songwriter direction? Yeah, that's what I want. I mean, that's... that would be really nice but I also I'm also a realistic person if it doesn't work I'm also not I'm not gonna be upset or I'm just gonna give it a try and see what happens and I would like to write for other people as well not only for myself I think songs are so cool, you know, like to make a good song. When it's a good song, it's such a cool thing, it's such a task, and it touches so many people in different ways, it has different meanings for different people. So it's a nice, I think it's a nice profession to be a songwriter. I mean, you must be feeling maybe a different kind of nervousness before this album comes out, because I guess it has been quite a stylistic leap for you. Maybe, you know, a feeling of exposed, being exposed somehow. I mean, you're putting yourself out there more than ever before. Yeah, I'm... So, I mean, I'm nervous, of course, as normal nervous, but I think I chose to be quite honest with it. And there's nothing to be ashamed. And I think this is very essential. So, you know, I'm not going to be like, oh my God, no, I'm really, really, really proud of it. because also I did it with my husband and we did it really honest. It's a really honest album. It has humor as well and everything, but it's a really honest project. So I don't feel like that so much. I think I'm just being an artist so if people say, of course people are going to say bad things, they're going to say good things, they're going to say horrible things, but I'm so used to it that it doesn't matter anymore. You have to have quite hard skin to be an artist because people are always going to slag you, especially now with the internet. So it's better not to read anything. Come on.
