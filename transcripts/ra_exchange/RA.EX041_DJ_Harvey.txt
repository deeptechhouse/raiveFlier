Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Johnny Coleman, and I'm a writer based in Los Angeles. DJ Harvey Bassett, a legend living in Venice Beach, has been caning it internationally since being released from his decade-long house arrest in the States, meanwhile wrapping up a rare LP of original tunes as Locus Solus. His life and music are debated and chronicled in depth on message boards. yet the man himself stays away from the internet as much as possible. Though he is commonly associated with disco, Bassett leads us down a path of many music cultures he has danced amongst along the way, from punk, hip-hop, breaks, reggae, garage, house, techno, balleric, Disco, left field edits, sleaze rock, and now back to his own bizarrely catchy curios. Through an often blurry but honest recounting, DJ Harvey reveals a life surrounded by colorful characters as he discusses the power of messy mixing and mistakes, not knocking anything until you've tried it, and what it takes to get Harvey to say yes. Love, love, love. Born in the early 60s in London. Grew up in and around Cambridge through the 70s, my formative years, kind of 9 to 19. Cambridge was a great place to grow up at that time, very sort of liberal town with lots and lots of young, clever people running around. and a kind of a legacy still hanging over from the 60s from like, you know, Pink Floyd and the Pink Fairies and acid culture and stuff like that. And squat cultures and, you know, lots of artistic and musical people. So it was a nice atmosphere to, you know, beautiful English countryside and architecture besides. This was a nice place to grow up. I think in many respects I had a perfect childhood. My mum and dad are still together after like 60 years of marriage. I have a brother and a sister, a younger brother and a younger sister, and a foster brother. And we were well loved and supported, you know. I can't say I was abused or beaten or I've got any excuses for being a mess. It's all my own fault. Loved and supported in our passions and my passion was music and really my first kind of influences was whatever was on the television or the radio at the time and my mum's record collection particularly. My dad only had two records, the best of the Beach Boys and the best of Helen Reddy. two super compilations. Do you still have those? I think they're in my... I don't know if they ever made it into my collection. Oh, he had a best of... Maybe he had a best of the Safaris, but I do have that. too. I stole that one. But yeah, my mom was, you know, was a rock and roller in the 50s and then kind of moved into sort of a jazzer in the late 50s, early 60s and then started having kids and wasn't sort of out on the scene very much. But she had a great record collection of original rock and roll stuff, you know, like whether it was a classic rock and roll, Johnny Cash. Elvis, who's the killer, Jerry Lewis. Jerry Lee Lewis. Maybe a Jerry Lewis record too as well actually. He was pretty cool. You know, stuff on some records and some even, she wasn't like a, she was a trad jazzer, you know, sort of like Ackerbilk and Benny Goodman and stuff like that. And then I suppose a bit later, you know, things like... Beatles albums and Carpenters albums sort of started coming to the house. And then my sort of switch into sort of music that maybe my mum and dad didn't like was music that my babysitter's boyfriends liked. You know, so maybe the babysitter would come round and bring the boyfriend round for a make-out session and he'd have a Batman Turner overdrive cartridge in his Ford Corsair and we'd go for a ride down to the corner shop to get some pop and listen to this music and it was mind-blowing. And I actually remember a babysitter putting on a Jimi Hendrix record. I don't remember which one. And I'm like, oh, what's this? And she said, oh, this will be a bit too heavy for you. And I wondered what heavy was. But it was so sonic and spectacular. I was like, wow, this is just the most amazing stuff ever. And, you know, I think sort of some of the first music was sort of English classic rock that I really sort of decided myself, you know, that I like Deep Purple, Cream, Led Zeppelin a bit, Black Sabbath a little bit, but definitely the... you know, Jimi Hendrix, sort of very classical, sort of well-known sort of rock at the time. And then, I suppose, a move into punk rock, which was a real way of sort of telling your parents you didn't love them anymore, you know. rebelling against something I had nothing to rebel against, you know, or my life was too safe. It's like, I don't want to have a perfect future. I want to, you know... Like I don't know have a little more more risk in my life so I die my hair green and get chased down the road by skinheads. Right. I think you said something once about um about how it was actually like pretty in fashion to have a young drummer. Yeah. I mean it's something like let's get a really young guy. Yeah I suppose around that time you know like sort of 75, 76 whatever you know very young obviously but you know, starting to play drums in little school bands and stuff like that. and then later on getting into bands where the members of the band, you know, I might be 11 or 12 and they'd be like 17, 18, which is actually a huge age difference at that time. But there was a band called Eater, I believe, that had a baby drummer who was like 11 years old or something. It was kind of hip to have a baby drummer. You know, like sometimes it's hip to have a girl drummer or something. I'm a baby drummer, so I kind of jumped on that one and I was good for my age. And, yeah, I had a wonderful time, like, making more money than my teachers at school, you know, at the weekends, playing in bands and getting looked after by the big boys' girlfriends and, you know, getting a little Dutch courage. Like, you know, I was obviously not allowed to drink in the pub, so they'd buy me an orange juice and tip a vodka in there and stuff, and so I courage behind the kit and had some wonderful times sort of doing that playing some really odd gigs and on sort of army barracks and parent teacher associations and young farmers parties and stuff some really odd odd stuff alongside people like like what's his name Billy J. Kramer and odd sort of backing up sort of one hit wonders from the 60s pretty fun stuff even going back a little bit too were you listening to like raw edgy stuff or even like sleazy records with the mixture of like the classical rock I don't think I was really sort of I don't know I don't know how much I was choosing the records or the music I was listening to rather than just sort of coming to me it's like I Yeah, you know, it would just be the stuff on the radio, all the stuff, you know, you couldn't determine necessarily what would be listened, played at the school disco, for instance. And in those days, the school disco would play three Northern Soul records, three Status Quo records with a Hawkwind rap track at the end, three sort of Commodores records, you know, and all the different factions would dance and then go outside and fight in the car park. Right, right. But they segregated, so it's three of yours, three of yours, three of yours. Yeah, the DJs would play different sort of little mini sets within the sets. And they're a very young crowd. It's like from 10 to 15, 16 maybe, school-leaving age in England. And I danced to a lot of it. You know, I was always, yeah, I would just be into everything. You know, the way the Northern Soul guys would spin and flip and then the rockers would do these similar kind of almost like Northern moves. And, you know, I'd enjoy to headbang to Hawkwind and I'd enjoy to try and dance like Michael Jackson to the Commodores. And, you know, and I had blue hair and tight pants, which I've been kicked out of school for wearing. Imagine that, being kicked out of school for when the actual school uniform was like 36 inch bottomed multi-pleated soul bags. Unbelievable. So, I mean, obviously the UK has like a big, you know, rich history of radio and I'm just curious as to what would have been on, was there a lot of pirate radio or was there, was there, was there, the BBC stuff really strong? Like, was it really influential? I'm not sure when BBC One was first introduced, but it was introduced as a result of pirate radio basically just taking all the young audience away and playing the modern music. There's actually a movie called something like Rock and Roll Radio on a Boat or something. Oh, pirate radio? Yeah. The fictional version of the real story of the film. Yeah. Yeah, the story of Radio Caroline. But there were also, I mean, I used to listen to Radio Luxembourg, Radio London and Radio Invicta as well as Radio Caroline. And the opening sequence to that movie was like documentary to my life, being sent to bed by my mum and dad. Up you go, like tucking into bed and getting out your little transistor radio that's about, you know. five inches square and going under the covers and you tune into Radio Luxembourg and listen to Emperor Roscoe playing the wild funk and rock records and stuff and Luxembourg would always fade in and out so you'd be talking about... and you'd miss the half the track and we'd die for it to come back come back and then it would fade back in you know and you dreaded that it would fade halfway through your favorite record right and um yeah so listen to a lot of pirate radio under the covers and um you know things i think radio one would be the kind of thing that would maybe just sort of on it on in the house or in the car And then it would be Top of the Pops. You know, I watched, I think I watched every single edition of Top of the Pops between 1969 and 1979. Religiously, like it would be, there was a program called Tomorrow's World, which came on and it showed all, I remember they'd show things like, there's this amazing new thing, it's called a graphic equalizer. Now you won't be able to hear this on your television at home. But we're going to reconfigure, we're going to take the scratches out of this record and we're going to bring the tone up. And I remember them doing things like hitting a CD with a hammer and stuff like that. And all the fun futuristic stuff. And then Top of the Pops would come on and it would be... a sort of a rundown of the top 40 with some of the stuff coming into the top 40 and then a rundown of the top 10 with usually a couple out of the top five and then the number one. and that was church for me on Thursday nights, man. I was actually gutted when they stopped Top of the Pops because it's something I'd dreamt of my entire life, was to actually appear on Top of the Pops. My mum would die happy if I appeared on Top of the Pops. Everything's been relaunched, who knows? Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah. I mean, I think, I mean, they show the old ones over. They probably have got some version of Top of the Ringtones or something, you know. That happens these days. Top of the MIDI sequences. Yeah. Well, that's cool. So at what point was, because I mean, I only learned about John Peel maybe in the last five years, just, you know, not having grown up there, but what was his kind of influence on you? So, again, John Peel was huge. It wasn't like I tuned in religiously to John Peel. He just seemed like he was always there. And whenever you happened to catch his show, it was always way out there, always brand, brand new, cutting-edge, amazing music. And he first came to my mind when he was supporting the punk rock movement in the mid-70s. And then went on sort of, you know, championing new independent music the whole time. And I think early on he was the one radio DJ on Radio 1 that didn't have a playlist. He could actually choose the records that he played himself. Because of the payola days? No, I think basically there would be a panel at Radio 1 that actually chose the records that were played. I imagine payola probably did have some, even though it was the British radio, stiff upper lip and all of that. I'm sure that there was wheeling and dealing going on to get records exposed and played but Peely yeah he most definitely determined his own show and just played the most amazing stuff ever some really disturbing independent you know music and is there anyone like that that do you think of that in another era that was like him? Another era? I don't really know. Maybe someone like Dr. Demento or someone like that. But Dr. Demento was more demented, whereas I think John was very serious. It didn't play stuff for the sake of it being weird. I think it was more for the sake of it being modern. And if that happened to be weird, then okay. And I was honored to, a few years later, to be supported by John Peel. A couple of bands I was in, he was playing our record, and I thought I'd arrived, played on Radio 1 by John Peel, great. Until one day I went to take a leak in my buddy's bathroom and there was the 998 singles of the thousand we hadn't sold. you know because we didn't know how to run a record label you know my buddy started this little independent label called Leisure Sounds and we had a couple of singles came out so he had no idea how to actually you know it's like hey let's go make some records no idea how to actually distribute them sell them or market them or whatever is that similar to did Black Cock sort of start out like that as just being like we're making these things we're less concerned about yeah I mean promoting the hell out of them Oh yeah, there was no marketing whatsoever for Blackhawk Records. It was just literally a fun project that we could indulge ourselves in the disco realm. There was no sort of design behind sort of re-unearthing the art of the edit or whatever. It was just something that we wanted to do seemed a natural progression. We'd heard, you know, there was obviously edits around by... My favourite was always Paul Simpson and Francoise Kay and Larry Levan. 90% of records are edited in some form. It was obviously a very important process, so we wanted to indulge in that and have some fun with that. But you weren't as concerned, in a similar sort of punk way, you were less concerned about the business aspect of it, right? Oh yeah, there was no... We didn't give two shits about the business, really, as long as we could... We had what we called business lunches. So it was like, oh, look, we got a check for 300 bucks. let's go eat it you know or drink it or something you know it's not like alright you know we're both going to have Lamborghinis by the end of the year or the master plan for sort of you know running a sort of major organised bootlegging crime syndicate you know which has happened off my arse by the way but that's another story we can get into that later But, yeah, so, I mean, it was really just a fun project. I mean, the whole thing, Black Cock, it's tongue-in-cheek, it's finger-up arse, you know, who knows what it is. It's a fun thing, and it was, you know, existed in the disco grey area where lots of sort of slightly unlicensed loops, samples, you know, things were allowed to develop in this grey area, you know, that may or may not relaunch people's or somehow it's allowed to exist. I think again, as long as you don't make any money, they won't come for the money. Like I've said before, if someone comes for all the money made on Black Cocker, can say, "Look mate, you owe me 25 bucks." You know, we lost a fortune. In fact, I know for a fact that a couple of the distributors, once we had actually dealt, you know, handed stuff off to distributors, went bust with every penny we could have potentially ever made. So, hang me now. And we can get into some of that too later. Let's go back a little bit and get us from getting records played on the radio all of, what, 15 years old maybe at the latest? And then from, obviously, ethos-wise, they aren't too far apart from being... Can you tell us about the first hip-hop record you heard or the first one that really blew your mind? And how that kind of... I don't know if it was... It was probably either Buffalo Gals or Electric Boogie Breakdance. I think Buffalo Gals was the first time, and the video to that was the first time I'd seen anybody spin on their head. which blew my mind. Utterly, totally and completely. I just, wow. And then the track Electric Boogie Breakdowns and his West Street Mob. It sounded like a dish soap commercial going round and round with guys chanting on it. I'd never heard music like that. I had no idea it was actually made from two records being cut up and they were deteriorating as they were being cut and they were compressed and fuzzy and crunchy and it was this production quality but it was tough. It was the best break ever being Apache by... Incredible Bongo Band, which was also a secret for so long it was known as The Rock. Nobody knew what it was. Kool Herc played it for many years until anyone really discovered what it was. But I wanted to know what that was. And I remember hearing, actually hearing, what was it called? Something like... Big Apple Noise or something. And it was actually an edit, like a cut edit thing, but I thought it was a turntable mix. But I had no idea how it was done. I remember getting a real... I remember dragging a stylus side to side across the record going... trying to get the duv-a-duv-a sound, because you couldn't do that on a Gerard belt drive. As soon as you touched it, the needle just jumped straight out of the groove. So even if you saw someone do it, it didn't seem possible. So all these things, but I worked out that you could actually get a strip of tape and run it under the tape head and go... and make the same noise as the scratching noise. Really? Because I'm trying to do that too. Yeah, and stuff like that. And, you know, it took us a little while. There wasn't like a whole lot of footage or a whole lot of information. And, you know, tapes would come through and a few records would come through. And there were no hip-hop acts. There were no hip-hop DJs for a while in Cambridge or London. It took a little while. Yeah, it definitely took a little while. Me and my contemporaries were sort of the first, really. Well, hip-hop DJs in Cambridge, anyway. My brother and his buddy Mace were doing it a year or two before me. Did you hear it on the radio? I'm just curious about where you heard it. John Peel would play it. Without question, the first time you heard that style, maybe something like Rammel Z. The jumping over to all the sucker MCs to be among stars to be on the top for a number one and the pick of the clock. It's like Casanova at the top of the hill. You know how to love it with a heart of steel. Pioneering early odd sort of space hypno. whatever it is you could more than likely hear on a John Peel show um And then there were import record stores with stuff coming in, but they'd have very few copies and they're expensive. It's like not only do you have to buy one copy of this £15 import single, you've got to buy two of them. And then what have you got? You've only got one record that you're only going to play for three minutes. So it's like down to build a set of all this stuff. So it took time to develop. But it's not like we weren't DJing music and there wasn't music around. There was a huge reggae movement at that time, a huge movement for rare groove, like beats and disco boogie and soul, like underground warehouse parties. It's not like... I don't know, like raving was invented in... was sort of synthesized in the lab by Danny Rampling in 1988. No. You know, people have always partied and always done their thing, so I think it just... Like as movements come and whether I come and go but come along they take a while to filter into into a scene or a movement and develop and grow and that's actually something that's changed in recent times with all this instant information is that scenes Sometimes don't necessarily have a chance to grow the sermon as soon as someone has a bright idea. It's on the internet It's global. It's rinsed out. It's done. Everybody knows about it. It's cool. Now. It's not cool. Now. It's over what's the next thing Whereas I think, you know, maybe in the times of punk or hip-hop or those kinds of movements, there'd be a core group in an area, say the Bronx or, you know, South London, somewhere who had actually been developing their way and their style for a couple of years before the press got to notice or, you know, they'd made enough of a stir. And then they actually, there was a root. to the movement. These days, they're tense, and as far as I can see, they're the very latest thing. doesn't have a foundation. Right. You know what I mean? Or, you know, they haven't, it's like, here's the next big thing. I was like, okay, well, what's the roots of this? It's like, well, what the guy watched on YouTube yesterday, which was what the dude watched on the day before on YouTube. You know what I mean? And it's kind of, it's a little. I don't know if it's throwaway, but it's things that have become very instantaneous and maybe just a little sort of flashcard-y. Well, when you're talking about especially punk and hip-hop, those two genres of music, big genres of music, are so culturally tied to the culture that created them that it's like they don't really exist without, you know. you know, they don't really exist without each other, whereas I think other genres maybe that are coming out now, they don't necessarily have a cultural attachment to them. They could be made by anyone in the world, and they're just these products. Yeah, I think, yeah, well, scenes are now globalized rather than localized, you know, and that's something I've found definitely, you know, maybe it'll be, you know, I can... pretty much play in any town in the entire planet. I don't know 150 people will show up and hear me play. You know? Anywhere in the entire fucking world. Whereas... you know, I don't know, whatever, 20 years ago, I was packing the ministry out with 5,000 people, but like, I couldn't have got a gig in Amsterdam. You know, and that's, that's the difference. So, everyone has the access to the same amount of information. Yeah. Which I think is good. It levels the playing field a little bit. There's no excuses for, you know, ignorance is not an excuse anymore. It's like, Well, it's there, mate. The biggest library in the world is right there. Educate yourself. There's no excuse to be like, oh, the major labels don't like me. Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, hopefully that sort of digi world is saving the music industry with, you know, with the sort of dollar downloads and stuff because there's no manufacturing cost for a digital, you know, for them to make the next one doesn't cost them. 25 cents, do you know what I mean? It costs them zilch. So, like, with no manufacturing costs, there's actually, you know, maybe that money coming into the industry will help support the artists and the musicians to the extent they deserve to be supported instead of necessarily being, all their profits being filtered out by sort of clauses in major record company contracts. So let's step back again. Let's go back to where in the mid to late 80s you heard about hip hop. You've been getting into it. You're paying an arm and a leg. 80s prices too for the two copies of these records so you can juggle them and whatnot and then so you did you go you're like I need to know more about this culture I need to see what this is about and then you left for New York is that what happened? well yeah we were totally into it and my buddy's dad got killed in a slaughterhouse accident in the States somewhere And it being America, of course, they soothed the arse out. out of the place. I've already got a monster inheritance and bought me a ticket to the United States. I'm like, nice one, mate. And off we went to find hip hop. So we arrived in Washington Square Park. There was one chick we knew that lived at number one Fifth Avenue. We look up, hi, is Emily in? It's like, no, she's at school. Like, where? Oh, upstate Vermont or something. It's like, oh, so we lived in the park for a week Right, and fed the Rocksteady crew. Ended up living with them for a minute. Like, walked up Manhattan, up into the Bronx, and like, we must have looked like complete fucking idiots. Like, two skinny white English dudes in sort of Dayglo feeler tracksuits, Kango hats, brand new out of the pack, Run DMC sort of limited shell toes and stuff, walking around with a picture of a breakdancer in Soundview Park going, anyone seen this guy? You know, we're lucky to be alive. But as soon as they heard our accent, it was like, okay, these guys are just idiots, not cops. But we had a whole lot of fun and got to see some of the glory days of hip-hop and visit the great clubs like Danceteria, the Roxy, the Reggae Labs, the Devil's Nest, Save the Robots. area, to name but a few. You know, we really did it up the same, everywhere except Paradise Garage because I didn't want to go dancing with a bunch of puffs. At the time? No, I mean, actually, we did go dancing with a bunch of puss at the Saint, actually. Unbelievable. But we weren't looking for that music. We were looking for hip-hop. We weren't looking for garage and boogie. So we didn't go to the garage. We wanted to hear... whatever DJ Flowers in a park in the Bronx you know like even the more benevolent hip hop then still did it still like skew like masculine I mean you were a teenager as I was so you were probably like yeah but I've never been homophobic it's like that's not an issue you know I've had my cock sucked in a bus were by a drag queen I was like well there's nobody watching you know it's like you know it's like why not it's like why ever not come on into the modern world like sexual sort of orientation is God almighty, I mean, if anyone actually sort of considers that an issue, like, I don't know what other time zone they're in, you know, it's so archaic. So that, you know, that's not an issue. By the way, like, after a couple of sort of, you know, how do you know you wouldn't like it? I tried it out and I didn't like it. There we are. You know what I mean? I gave it my best shot, mate. It was fucking horrible. You know what I mean? So there you go. It just, you know, whatever angle you dangle wangles, it's all good with me. Thank you. I think there'd been some form of graffiti culture in England long before hip-hop graffiti culture. You know, people would write "Man United" on the wall or "Steve the Biscuit." You know, these kind of like people would tag and mark, you know, certain sort of groups and crews would tag. Once in a while you get something a little more, you know, with more effort put in, with a sort of a fancy opening letter, you know, like they have in old Bibles or whatever. But, um, and I seem to remember enjoying vandalism, you know. for the sake of it. And I think bombing as such does hold the joy of vandalism no matter what people say. They're getting up, they're marking their territory, whatever they're doing, but they're also enjoying being a vandal. I think maybe piecing might be a little bit different because you put more effort into it and it is more... more of a work of art. But I think, you know, seeing the stuff on the streets and trains in New York and hanging out with some of the graffiti writers and going down into the layups in New York and hitting some trains and stuff. I mean, I was never really very good at drawing. So it was, you know, after giving it a couple of years, couple of goes and I wasn't really as good as many of the other guys so that wasn't sort of my leaning and I've sort of been into music and the rest of it so the DJing thing kind of fitted in with that. easy enough at what point were you did you actually try to spin some hip-hop while you were there or were you not while i was there at all we would you know i was just sort of working out how to dj really at that point although we'd had a few sort of dj parties it wasn't sort of the art of dj and as such wasn't so much what we considered it was just it was sort of providing a soundtrack and so and so from there there were several trips back and forth from new york Yeah, over a few years, just sort of coming and going and getting influence and checking things out. And I think during most of that time up until I started hearing, you know, like a lot of dance music coming through, I was heavily into the hip hop scene and the, you know, the sort of rare, what was called rare groove in England at the time, sort of southern soul sound. Yeah, and then just, you know, just sort of a natural progression, I suppose, just DJing, that kind of stuff. Right, and yeah, at what point did you, what was the first party when you came back to London? Was there something before Moist? Yeah. Well, the whole of the sort of Tonka thing was before Moss. Oh, right, okay. We're playing a bunch of music and having some parties, and it seemed that the DJ was being the star of the show, i.e. me, my brother, or a couple of friends, and what I wanted to do was form like a group identity as the Jamaican sound system said, you know, there's Java, Hi-Fi, Young Lion, Saxon, you know, there's lots of different ones And they have a system of, you know, it's a group core. It takes five or six guys to play a record. You've got your operator, your selector, your engineer and your DJ and a couple more besides. And everyone wears the T-shirts and the boxes are painted and you have a logo. And a lot more people can enter in. to the feeling of having contributed to the party and that was the basic idea behind Tonka Hi-Fi and as we started off as just sort of like an alternative reggae hip-hop sort of wondering what direction sound system into a fully fledged sort of happy dance music you know rave party sound system. And that moved into Moist, Winnicott? Yeah, I suppose Tonka sort of... It's where you were getting your footing and figuring things out? Yeah, we were pretty solid for sort of three or four years, and then I think it just sort of petered out. You've got a bunch of people who we couldn't make a decision, we couldn't think straight or make a straight idea or anything, so we just sort of... fell apart slowly and then I suppose shortly after that we started well me and Heidi the mother of our child started doing this club in a little night in Covent Garden in the basement of the gardening club called Moist That's dead centre, right? Yep, right in the middle of the west end of London. And that was really a push into sort of... You know, the sort of garage, maybe sort of take on dance music, you know, more of a focus on sort of New York sound, sort of funky rock and boogie, slightly more down-tempo, not quite so sort of modern for the time, not so much techno-edge, or there was a lot of sort of like, you know, transfers coming up and progressive house and stuff like that, and I was trying to sort of... I wasn't trying to do anything, I was just the music I liked at that time was like a lot of the influence that I'd heard, you know, or was hearing from the New York and Chicago scenes from a few years earlier. People made a lot about the time that Larry Levan came and stayed with you. Yeah, Larry's... How did you guys meet? I was friends with his... boyfriend Victor Osado at the time we'd kind of chased each other around Japan on a tour one time and become friends and when Larry came to help set up the Ministry of Sound I'd sort of gone there to hang out and knew Victor and got introduced to Larry and we were buddies and And I think Victor had stayed for a while and Larry ended up staying for a couple of weeks and that was a nice time, you know, and get some good stories and get to know the guy and soak up the voodoo as it was. And he came and played for us at Moist, which was a fantastic night. I think he was very relaxed and enjoyed the night. So that was a special moment because we didn't know it, but at that time he probably only had three or four months to live. So it was nice to be able to get one of the few chances to hear him do his thing. And it was spectacular. I never got a chance to see him, but it seems like you guys have in common just the way of that other kind of third of... playing a record which is I think often overlooked without even necessarily doing anything too fancy you know like you're not running stuff out of label 10 and do it's just like the way that people talk about how he played records is kind of how I imagine that you play records too it just seems very like emotive and yeah I mean I only actually heard Larry play a couple of times and I've got a couple of tapes And, you know, his influence, I mean, he's definitely a heavy influence. I mean, I think he believed in letting the records do the work. If a record's well made and well produced, you don't have to play another record on top of it, you know, because it's already complete. You know, you'd probably make a mess if you played two vocals on top of each other. And maybe programming was a priority rather than the mix. So it's like, I'm going to play this record because it's the next record I want to play, not because I know it's going to mix perfectly with the last record and take that risk and maybe mess it up. but who cares, you know, the next record's spectacular, let's enjoy it. And actually, I quite like bad mixing, it's more exciting than good mixing. Good mixing's so boring. And so easily achievable now, right? I don't know, I think so, I think you can press the mix these records for me button, you know? Right. So, yeah, I like to hear people fighting the mix and sometimes it kind of going out, whatever, you know they're making an effort, you know, Maybe that they haven't, I never practice mixes or whatever. I'll just pull one out of the box. I want to hear this one. And they say, oh, it's not going to go. Dance amongst yourselves for a few beats and we'll get this one on, you know. And these are the things you can kind of, effects you can throw over that if it gets too nasty. Yeah, you know, throw the siren on and away you go. Right. No, I think there's more drama in it they gradually get better unless they're getting more fucked up so it's kind of a nice drama you know what a crowd likes nothing more than the system blowing up halfway through the night and then coming back on again five minutes later But we used to do it like it happens so often at the Zap Club, at the Tonk. It happened almost every time that people thought we were doing it on purpose for effect. But it works so well. You know, the height of the night, the fuse blows, you know, and people go insane. And when it comes back on, man, love is the message. Yeah, it's contrast. Through the roof. It's contrast because they think, oh wait, is the party over now? Yeah, is it over? Oh no, like, this whole thing and they're just like, yeah! And that's something that can be achieved by just turning the record down. I've spoken about that before. Simple things like volume control. Or taking space between records. Yeah. David Mancuso doesn't mix at all. He can leave many seconds between records. People have a breather. People have a chance to applaud, appreciate the last record, wonder what's coming next, and then clap when the next one comes in if they recognize it. different thing. If you think of reggae DJs who don't mix records together, play one turntable, you know, someone talks in between it as long as long as it flows in some in some way and there's an intention and people people will go with it and have a good most people want to have a good time right so you were so you're kind of after Moish you were kind of the next thing the step was to Ministry of Sound and is that is that where do you think was you learned the most from these different residencies and collectives and I don't really know. I suppose each place has its merits or not merits or whatever. The question is what you learned at the Ministry of Sound, I guess, because that was a big deal, right? Yeah, what did I learn at the Ministry of Sound? not to wear a cream jacket in the DJ booth. I'll take it. You know? Yeah, yeah. Which just seems like a loaded place. There's a lot of expectations there. Well, the Ministry of Sound is an incredible space to play. It's like driving the Titanic. Right. You know, you're the captain of a big ship with big buttons. and a lot of power to control the emotions of the crowd. And I suppose maybe something I learned there was the power of maybe a very minimal record on a big system. You could have something with a very, very simple drum and bass line that could be extremely effective on a large system that may not have quite so much impact in a smaller room. Also things about common denominators, the bigger the crowd, the more people you have to appeal to. Energy levels, if people are really sweating hard for like 45 minutes to an hour, give them a breather. There's cleansing the dance floor. If you're playing for six hours, you don't have to have it rammed out for six hours. clear the damn thing out, start again, build it back up with a different vibe. There's loads of things to learn. Things like volume levels, not to hurt the crowd. If you've got a huge sound system, be sensitive with it. Hurt them. but not all the time. And what was, this was like a long slot, it was like a six or seven hour slot usually? It really kind of varied because they had all sorts of different guests and people coming through and different things happening on different nights. At the height of my time there, I was doing both the graveyard shifts, the 6 till 10 on Friday and Saturday, Saturday and Sunday mornings, which was a great time to play. The Friday nights were more of a UK techno-y kind of sound, and the Saturday nights were US garage jersey sounding, like Tony Humphreys. Frankie Knuckles and that playing but I'd often take over the morning shift and do my thing which is you know the crowd would be open and well warmed up and pretty messy by then so I could you know indulge myself with a Led Zeppelin track or a Jar Shacker record or something like that and not necessarily like straight ahead silk curly beats Six hours. And so in Black Cock, did that start around this time or was that after? Yeah, around that same time. I think around maybe... Probably around the time of Moist, actually. How did you meet Jerry Rooney? Jerry had just been a friend of a friend, like hanging out at the parties and everything, and we just kind of got on, and he was really into music, and he's a record dealer and had access to great stuff, and we got on like a house on fire, and just kind of, I don't know. it just sort of happened, you know, he had a, you know, a fantastic, you know, music library of the most obscure, wonderful records and stuff, and stuff maybe I didn't have or whatever, and we'd cut them up and that was the thing, and yeah. If it made us fall on the floor laughing, it went on the record. And so when did these kind of come to the Windshear Sound and Blackhawk, when did that kind of wrap up? What time were you talking about? I don't know. Later 90s? Yeah, I suppose mid to late 90s, I suppose. I really can't, the exact timelines, I can't really remember. So talk us through the first time in LA or how you got inspired to move over here because that was the next major leap, right? We did a club called New Hard Left, which was one of the sort of, or is lauded now as one of the sort of clubs that made Hoxton the hip. Really? Even though now it's, they call it Shoreditch or it's moved to Shoreditch or it's somewhere else. I think, no, we made Shoreditch a hit. Now it's Hoxton and Hackney or something. You know, yeah. But whatever that was, you know, 15 years ago, that was sort of part of that where, you know, there was little to none. underground clubs opening and little boutiques and the artists and musicians moving into the lofts and all that sort of thing happening and we were doing our club there. And I suppose I was just sort of following on from what I'd been doing but I think I DJ all night myself at that and we sort of set it up and do it on our own terms and rarely have a guest. The ministry had become a pain in the ass in many respects. They couldn't handle me and I couldn't handle them. Well, and were you making a decent living full time from the DJing enough to support yourself or did you have to pick up anything else? I had a few shitty jobs. You know, I worked in a camera store for a year when I left school. I did a little sort of handyman job for a minute. Then I saw that all my friends on welfare were surviving really well, just slinging a little weed, you know, or playing in a band. So I was no good at drug dealing. So I played in bands and went on welfare and did that for like seven years. And then I did motorcycle couriering in London for a couple of years up until I turned... pro pro DJ in like sort of 87 88 okay and I've managed to I haven't worked a day since managed to make my living from my art ever since which has been pretty amazing that's great yeah it's really really amazing very very few people have well some people have the opportunity but very even less people actually manage to pay their rent from something they almost enjoy doing you know right You were telling us earlier about the L.A. trip, and you were just with a friend or a friend's parents. Well, my first trip to L.A. was actually on the back end of one of those trips to New York. I think the guys I was staying with had managed to steal all my money, but they didn't know how to cash my last $75 American Express traveler's check. So I bought a Greyhound bus ticket and... Came to Los Angeles and came to see a girlfriend, another girlfriend that was at school somewhere else. In fact, I think she was actually, and I need to look into this, she was running the security for the Lakers in 1985 and she was a 17-year-old girl. Right? Get with that. Right? I've got my eyes against that. Now, this is what I can remember, and I don't know if it's true. I know she was down with basketball players. I know I was supposed to be going to Magic Johnson's New Year's Eve party in 1986 with her and her boys, and she dumped me, this, like, seven-foot-tall black dude turned up in one of those, what are those cars called, with the big pipes coming out the sides. You know the one Duesenbergs or something? Right? I was supposed to go and they just left. And I was stuck in this house up in Los Feliz all night. with a drunken mother upstairs in the bed, this alcoholic, I just remember this crazy story. And at 12 o'clock, when the gunfire went off, I thought it was fireworks, so I went out on the balcony. I was like... Get inside, it's gunfire, not fireworks. Back then, everyone went bang, bang, bang with their revolvers wherever I was staying, Los Feliz or something. I think it was called Silver Lake. Yeah, Silver Lake. Close to a pet cemetery. God, now I'm rambling. It's all good. But I guess the point is, what about L.A. struck you? And 15 years later, we're here now. Well, yeah. So on that trip, came to see this girl. I wasn't around, blah, blah, blah. But her father took me on a trip down to Venice Beach. Saw the guys with the suicidal tendencies on their roller skates. And these sort of gangster kids and amazing skateboarders. And the whole dog town scene. And it was pretty... Yeah, like I say, rough and ready down here, but at the same time, you know, we'd walk a little further down and the guy's dad was like, oh, that's Dudley Moore's house and Jim Morrison used to live there and Charlie Chaplin lived there and Mae West used to hang out there and, you know, this is a pretty excellent place and the doors are from here and Little Feet are from over there and Charles Manson had a spot up there and the first Manson murder was done up there And funny, because when we did, when I made the move to America, like whatever it was. Early 2000s? Yeah, so it's probably like, I'm trying to think, like 10 years, well, 15 years later, made the mistake of moving to Santa Monica, which is where people go to die. We actually live very close to an old people's home called Upward Bound. I couldn't fucking believe it. Upward bound. It's like, mum, we've got this place. You're going to be a little safer there. It's called upward bound. Oh my god, we did actually stay on top of a place I called the death factory like you know like it was never there was always old ladies the old men only lasted a few weeks like it was a men die young you know but anyway so Santa Monica was just too clean and too tidy and people go there to die and it was really straight and there's no community the kids don't play on the street people just drive their cars into their little manicured lawned apartments and I wonder what they do in there they must do something really strange because they've got plenty of money And then, I don't know. They're up to something in there. You can't smoke outside there? It's just weird. It's a strange place. And I did have a little sort of strange idea many years ago that I thought marijuana had always been legal in California. California because that's where hippies were invented. You know, I thought it was this very liberal, open place. And so there's various, I mean, it's very square, very white, very conservative, you know, there, I mean, there obviously are bastions of sensibility and little pockets of stuff. And, you know, the, the, the, the, you know, this is the heart or whatever the foundation of station and stuff like sort of new ageism and metaphysicalism and all that. And you But you find that a lot of those fools are really square and conservative too. It's like, yeah, Hitler was a vegetarian, so fucking what? And that's the truth. When I came out to Santa Monica, I had this vision of it as being this kind of 60s, grass-rootsy, crunchy granola place. I guess a lot of that's in Venice. Some of that is in Venice. It's funny. You see the border between Santa Monica and Venice, and the quality of the tarmac changes. It's beautifully manicured. It's the black top, they call it here. It's got lovely white lines. As soon as you hit Venice, there's sort of a puddle of piss. The second you step over it, there's maybe someone asleep in it. And then there's potholes and rusty bicycles. And they're like, welcome to Venice. And then there's the list of all the things you can't do in Venice. No smiling after 10.30. No smoking. All this stuff. It's like... Funny. funny things but Venice is Venice is my home it's my heart I love it here it's the dark side it's the edge of the western world it's as far west as you can go you know it's the end of the Route 66 it's the it's the heart of California Voodoo with the Mansons and the Beach Boys and Topanga and Laurel Canyon and all the weird and wonderful horrible stuff that goes on here has a really nice foundation in Venice and it's spicy and dangerous and creative and all the fun things and it's also got a really rock solid community that in some respects really actually looks out for each other, you know, you don't have to lock your door in Venice, you know, you have to lock your bicycle but you don't have to lock your door, you know, and it's... It's a great place and it took me like a year and a half to work it out when we moved out here and been here, I don't know, like pretty much 10 years ever since. And so, you know, when you're coming back here, it seems like you were involved in a few remixes here and there, some in the 90s and 2000s, but it feels like there was a gap, you know, when you decided you weren't going to entertain, like, remix offers or productions or opportunities. Is that true? I don't... I do remixes because people offer them to me. But not everyone that's offered, right? No, it has to be lots of money as well. Right. Because it's work. Thank you. It is work. A majority of the time I'm giving really awful records to remix because otherwise they wouldn't want them remixed. You know, so it's like, okay, we're working with a pretty damn average track here and I have to, it seems. I don't know, you know, like, sometimes it comes out okay and sometimes I don't, but then there's no accounting for taste and loads of things that I think are shit people think are great, so if I do a piece of work and I think it's shit, other people might think it's great, so then I'm not going to go like, you know, I made the great mistake years ago, someone came up to me and went, Harv, I love that remix of blah, blah, blah, blah baggage I had of sweating over that track for a week and hating every minute of it he just put the record on and enjoyed it right you know so it's a difficult thing and my emotional pendulum really swings both ways on the remix thing I won't really do them unless I have to or they're favours you know or it's stupid amounts of money It's almost, it's really the more, it is in many respects kind of like the work side of what I do. It's not like say, Loco Solos where anything's possible, we just, you know, let's have some fun and make some music. It's like with a remix, it's like, okay, you've got three days to make a better record than the one you've just been given, you know. And that can be a lot of pressure, you know, because when that time runs out, because the label wants it in three days and you couldn't hit the inspiration button in those three days, and over something a little lacklustre, and then they're like, oh, well, Harvey's Mix wasn't all that. You know, and it's like, ever wondered why, peeps? Right. You know? Well, it seems like a trade-off because it's, in some ways, remixers, they don't want something that's so brilliant that there's nothing to remix. But you want something that's not perfect so they can add something to it, but at the same time, you can't be held accountable for some, you know, making champagne out of shit sometimes. Yeah, you know, what they say, you can't polish But I mean, I think with any record, even the most, you know, a fantastic, perfect record, it would be easier to make a version, you know. And a lot of my, I used to actually just traditionally remix and that used to freak everybody out. So I wouldn't add anything or take anything away. I would just remix what they gave me. And they'd be like, what's that? I'm like, that's a remix. You didn't say make us another. the record which is what they want that's what I think it's come to mean for a lot of people it's like add every new album except the vocal oh we're gonna get a Harvey record for a grand nice one fucking not you're going to get a grand's worth of remix mate and that's what you get so beware out there indie record label owners that want a Harvey remix you know you get what you pay for cash in those buns that's it I'll never ask me again thank god for that So at what point, backtracking again a little bit, when did the impetus for the sarcastic parties, because that's, you know, I think where a lot of people out here really got to know who you were. How did that start? Did you meet Paul and then you guys were like, let's do a party? Was it very simple? I think Paul and a couple of buddies had been throwing parties out here for a while. And then on one of my visits, you know, they booked me to play. And I think the party was called Headroom back then. and did a couple of those and we all got on really well and you know for the first couple of years I wasn't living here so I'd come out and play. Yeah, and everything went really well. And then I think the headroom thing slightly collapsed. And then when I actually moved here solidly, I'm like, all right, Paul, let's put something together. My name's Harvey. Your label's sarcastic. Let's call it Harvey Sarcastic. All right, that's good. You know, I'll play the records. You do the artwork and the promotion. Junior can find the venues. Warren can put up the money and help out with the bar. Done. And that's our unit. And we use the same sound system and lighting guys and everything. And that's how it works, actually. It's very simple, but it's not as simple as it appears. You know, I think people have made the mistake of thinking, all right, just hang a mirror ball, play some records we've got a sarc disc going but oh no on that note can you kind of tell us for people who haven't been to a sarcastic party because I'm sure it's different I'm sure you're putting similar things on your rider when you're touring to different countries but there's a place where you have control you're building it all from scratch so what what are the important things to you that the party needs um a safe and secure venue with as good acoustics as we can find. Probably the next most important thing is the bathrooms. The next most important thing is polite security. Then probably the sound system and the fact that it's a good sound system and that it works and the timetables are isolated and it's a good signal path and all the rest of it. Then probably the records I decide to play. Also the people that happen to show up, make sure they're not all... lunatics or whatever, you know, but I think we've kind of got that down. We've got a really solid, you know, core group of people that are very loyal and come and behave themselves very well and dance all night and have the best time ever. It seems to have a similar kind of collective vibe now, even though you are doing the selecting and the operating. But it seems to have that kind of talk. Yeah, I mean, people do know, you know, Paul's running around in there making... sure everyone's okay juniors running everyone else is sort of like check you know running around making sure people are happy and everyone's okay and sorted out and you know there's no dramas going on here then like monitoring host hosting and you know making sure everything's okay and people know who they are and it's like you know there's there's a solid enough say sort of 500 people who know exactly who's doing what oh and it's also i think we should mention for people outside that officially bars close at 2 so you really in order to get more than a 2 or 3 hour DJ set you have to find a place where you can do that that's why it's again it exists in the grey area Whereas, I think we were mentioning, I'm going to chat about this earlier, whereas if there's a rave in the middle of the forest and nobody hears it, did it make any noise? Right? Now, if there's a rave in a warehouse in the middle of downtown LA and nobody hears it... Did it make any noise? No, it didn't. So nobody called the cops, no one was upset, no laws were broken, no nothing, no thank you very much, good night. And that's kind of how we do it. And I think something that had happened in England in the late 80s, early 90s was a thing called the Criminal Justice Act, which was brought in to stop, basically to shut down raves, to stop gatherings of... of people and it was as a direct result of people partying at other people's expense. you know, going bang, bang, bang, bang, bang all night because we want to party, all right? You know, I'm going to get in the way of our partying. It's like, you know, if my child was trying to sleep or I had to get up in the morning or I had to live next to a course, you know, it doesn't matter who you are. If you've been raving all night, you don't want to go to sleep next to a rave. Maybe your neighbours are playing opera when you get home from your A but deafening tone, like you're going to not be very happy about it. So I think that you have to be... considerate when you put on a party and then you will actually be allowed to do things which if you piss people off are considered against the law but if you don't upset anyone you can do whatever you want that's it pretty much let's get to that too because recently I think a lot of people know about you got all of your visa issues sorted. You weren't allowed to leave the States for a while, but obviously America's huge and there's a lot of things to keep you busy in that time. But you got out last year and around the same time, I'm not sure which happened first, but the Locus Solus records started coming out somewhere around the same time. And these are both two things touring internationally and putting out your own material, original material that hadn't happened for a long time. So I'm sure you got as your... you know, reputation had grown around the world. I'm sure you got a lot of offers in different capacities. And at one point you had said, you know, I'm drawn to things that feel like positive and progressive. And so I'm just wondering if you can elaborate on how, you know, you decided to. put out these records, like what about that offer seemed good? Like what, you know, how'd you know that you'd be taken care of in the way you want to? - Basically my manager, Heidi, who I've had a 20 year relationship with, knows me better than I know me. Knows what I'm capable of and what I'm not capable of. and basically sets it up accordingly. You know, like I didn't think I could do this, what I'm doing right now when I woke up today. But she knew that I could. So here I am. So it's like that, you know. And we do, you know, we obviously ping pong about every idea. It's not like I wake up in a country I have no idea. Well, actually that does happen. all the time. But it's like, or I look at the itinerary and there's somewhere on the list that I didn't know I was going or whatever. And it's like, okay. And I think while I was away, what with the internet and all the rest of it, luckily my sort of reputation, sort of absence made the heart. grow fonder but but people were informed of what was happening during the absence and it kind of kind of worked like that and you know i visited some of the places i've been to before and some new spots i mean i mean as far as sort of progression is concerned i would say you know maybe like the the just the the sort of the newer clubs like like dj vibes club in in a portal in portugal industrial like the Bergheim and Panorama Bar which to me are new clubs they might have been around for quite some time but they're newer clubs so I was interested to get into places like that that are really happening and be relevant and be modern disappeared at my own California sunshines out of my arsehole. Speaking of the, obviously that's a loaded place too, Berlin, the Berghain Panorama Bar show, with their camera policy, like I heard varying reports from different people, you know, being like, oh, it was like this, or someone else being... oh, it was like that. And obviously we weren't there and so there's no way to know because they have a camera policy, which I think is kind of brilliant and I'm just curious if... that's something well they always used in the very in the early days of the the acid house scene there was a no camera policy oh was there because very famous people were out of their minds on ecstasy at these parties like rolling around on the floor having sex on the dance floor and like you know maybe Elton John doesn't want to be filmed having sex on the dance floor. But he wants to have sex on the dance floor, but he doesn't want to be filmed having sex on the dance floor. So the policy of no cameras let a lot of it a lot freer. And the same happens in Berghain. Maybe there's some politicians or whoever it may be, you know, mother's sons that don't want to be documented doing the things they're doing in there for one reason or another. and it makes it a little freer because you realise that you're not going to get caught on camera. And it's good, but I actually think that most nightclub photographers he's pretty the same it's like there's a DJ in a DJ booth that doesn't tell you what his set was like it was like there's a bunch of people the crowd's in their air oh it's a Britney show I thought it was I can't tell the difference to the fashion kids yeah so I think it's better for stuff to be rumour and legend and hearsay stuff, you know, legends grow and that's what, you know, like, I love and I enjoy legend, it would be someone like a DJ like Ron Hardy who I've only ever seen one small grainy photograph of and heard some crunchy... tapes of and I don't think I've ever seen a picture of like the full interior of the box or whatever so it's perfect in my imagination you know the ledge you know your brain fills in the gaps when things are distorted that's what your brain does that's why distortion sounds good right so even if a photograph is you know anything that's that's slightly distorted that brings a yeah your mind creates fills in the gaps and create something special which makes it even more personal in a lot of ways. Your idea or interpretation of how... In fact, you have two people standing side by side in Berghain in front of DJ Harvey. One's having the time of his life and one fucking wants to die. Do you know what I mean? Everyone's bringing their own stuff in there too. It's, yeah, horses for courses or, you know, and that's really my thing. You know, when I DJ, I would like to think that the majority of the people within my crowd, in front of me, had a good time. And that's the best I can do. You can't do all the people all the time. You do some people all the time and other people, but you can't satisfy other people all the time. And as long as the haters say they hate me, I don't mind. Right. On the internet. Yeah, right, right, right. Because then they say my name. Exactly. It's repetition. It's adding to the legend. Silent hating doesn't help. Right. You're very publicly anti... Not anti-internet. per se but just not really anti-forum well I've never sent an email I've never posted a thing or whatever like I mean I do have a Facebook thing and I actually did I did write something I wrote thanks I got 10,000 fans on my Facebook thing so I just said something like hey I got 10,000 fans nice one That's about it. That's about the extent of my... And that took me 15 minutes to type. So, I mean, obviously in your sets there's some older records, but what are the... How do you find new records? Because I feel like in the last couple of times I've seen you, I've heard a lot more stuff that feels new. I mean, not feels new, that is new. Certain tracks I knew, and I feel like when I was first listening, I didn't, or maybe I just wasn't aware of it, but it feels like there's a lot of new records as well. Yeah, maybe I'm playing more newer stuff. I'm just curious where you find it. I mean, I don't find it. I play the records people give to me. Right. Or how do you go through that process? Because I imagine there's a bunch of records. Or do you just listen to them all and give them all fair? Well, what happens is, in the 90s, I'd get maybe 200, 300 records a week. now I get two or three records a month so that's the difference and what will happen is but what would happen is out of the 250 records a week there'd only be two or three a month I could actually play so now I'm getting quality instead of quantity so what will happen is I'm playing a gig and a producer or DJ or someone who's made his record will actually bring me their record and give it to me and I'm thankful you very much I'll check that out and if I like it I'll surely play it because I need as much new music because I can get my hands on and that's kind of how it goes and sometimes even with older rare records maybe a dealer will come and say like you know I think you'll like this one and you can you could use this you know and that's how I kind of get the older stuff And I don't, I mean, the only records I buy, like I'll go down to record surplus and buy some Beard Rock. You know, I very rarely find records that I can in shops. I bought a record online actually. Really? Yeah, called Don't Give Up or Don't Give It Up by Blood Hollins. It's the only record I've ever bought on the internet and it was something like $175 or something. Which you go I spent that on sushi last night. That's nothing, man. Right. Like, that record will be around forever. That thing is cheap at 175. that thing I would have paid $500 for it like records should be twice as expensive you know what I mean I think you spend $250 on a pair of jeans no worries like oh this designer t-shirt was $40 but this 7 inch thing was $15 oh dear let's have a Chinese meal and spend $300 on it right it's like get with the program kids records should be I don't know they're like I mean it's relative it's like if you're You know, if you're broke, then a $2 record's expensive. So, but it's not like I buy... 10, 150 dollar records a week, I bought one in my life, so I don't think that's out of order. You obviously really wanted it. Yeah, I hadn't heard it before, wondered how that one had escaped, and I'm like, I've got to have that damn thing, and maybe there's not that many around, and like, often if you don't buy it when you see it, or, you know, I remember going to record fairs, and humming and harring, and deeply regretting that But the record thing, records just seem to sort of come to me somehow. I mean, I have, you know, Josh gives me loads of records. You know, it's like he listens to music all day for a living. You know, like while I'm asleep in bed, Josh is up at night slaving over a hot computer listening to every record that ever came out. And he knows my taste and will be like, hey, here's a new album by the German Techno Kids. And I'm like, wow, that's fantastic. And those things are things that may have appeared on a resident advisor or something. That's the stuff that I'm playing that you would have heard before. You know what I mean? And I think actually that's becoming a bit of a bad thing. Like these sort of, a lot of the sort of... Although I haven't monitored it, but I'm getting a vibe that there's only sort of five online record shops and they've all got the same records. And it's not like there's 3,000 record shops or 10,000 record shops in the world, each with a sort of one dude with an eclectic buying selection. It's like, so if... If I get a house record that someone's actually heard on the internet, everybody has actually heard that already. Do you know what I mean? So, yeah. But again, that wouldn't necessarily put me off playing the record, but I wouldn't be confident in, it's like, hey, listen to this new one, kids, you know, that's only been on the internet for three months. You know, but it's like, okay, this is a great record and I'd like to play it now. just because you guys were sick of it I'm sorry especially when you're going to different places you know you toured a lot of places in the last like year it Something I've seen is that, obviously, even in the internet era, it takes certain scenes to become popular in different areas. You know what I mean? For them to pick up on it, it might be there, but I still feel like it'll take them an extra year or two than it did here, or vice versa. So it's impossible to tell who knows what newer records, in some ways. Except for the big ones that you know that everyone hears. Yeah, I mean, actually, sometimes I think everyone knows all my and then someone comes up and goes, I didn't know any of those records. So it's, you know, I think it's, it's just, it's not a matter of necessarily knowing them. It's how you put them together. I mean, Paul, you know, Paul T actually said to me, like, he's like, you know, every kid in the room knows every single record you're playing. I was like, I don't give a shit, mate. It's like, no one can play like So there you go. It's like, it's not, it's not having the ax, the sword, it's how you wield it. Right. I think a lot of people get caught up in that. It's finding the rarest stuff. And a lot of times more abstract stuff that is not, will not work in a room. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's, you know, I've heard some sort of rumors of like, Harvey's not cosmic enough these days. I for crying out fucking loud. You know what I mean? It's like, it's because I'm a party DJ. I'm an entertainer. You know what I mean? It's like, where were you in the cosmic days then, mate? That was 20 years ago. If you're on it now, you're so far behind the times. It's a joke. Right. I think people know that you can go in a lot of different directions pretty deep, for lack of a better term. And especially with the disco, in the Harvey sarcastic disco, people are like, oh, Harvey only plays disco. But if you look back, there's so many different phases where one thing was dominant or a few genres were dominant. But now, I feel like, you know, it's just a big mix of that. It's like looking at your kind of history of your influences. Yeah, I mean, if you come to the party on Saturday night, there should be a wide range of modern and classic dance music. As simple as that. Some you'll know, some you won't. And hopefully I'll put them together in a manner that will make you jump up and down and smile. That's kind of it, really. And then sleep for a couple of days after. Oh, yeah. And then go to Japan for a 16-day tour with no sleep at all. That's what I'm doing. Next week? Yeah, I leave pretty much straight from sarcastic on a monster Japanese radioactive anti-tsunami earthquake tour. For good cause. Oh, yeah, my wallet. Well, great. That's great. I can't wait to get out there. I've been to Japan many, many times. I've got friends and family out there. It's obviously pretty damn concerning. I used to play... I've DJed in Sendai a couple of times that doesn't exist, a city that doesn't exist anymore. Like... You know, but people in adversity want to have a good time and party and hang out and they're like, come on, we want to have a good time. So I'm like, yep, it's on. I'm doing almost like, my itinerary is stupid. Almost like 16 gigs, one straight after the other. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Thursday, for three weeks or whatever it is. So that's going to be hardcore. But I live through Chernobyl, so I can live through Fukushima, And one more final question before I forget. Speaking of Japan, I heard a rumor recently that someone was at your show and looked down at a record of yours. and either pissed or shit himself. Is that true? Yes. Or both. He pissed himself. Okay. It was in Japan. He was the owner of the club when he saw I was about to play Black Cox No Way Back. And the guy said to me, they're like, oh, touchy hair. The expression was, shah. I was like, I've never heard that before he's like it's a black cock on a cock next one he sha I was like what I was like there's this big fucking stand the guy's just standing there just kind of like kind of not knowing whether this is a laugh or cry I was like congratulations mate you're a fucking superstar that's amazing yeah I'm really glad that's real he became known as DJ Sha after that
