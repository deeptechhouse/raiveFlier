Thank you. ♪ ♪ Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week we're sitting down with Delano Smith. Thanks to his tracky yet soulful style, the Detroit artist became a go-to producer in the 2000s. especially for European DJs looking to fuse deep house warmth with a hypnotic sensibility. Judging from the dates, you might assume Smith was a new Detroit export, but in fact he's one of its elder statesmen. He was DJing in Detroit on belt drive turntables and mobile sound systems before house and techno even existed, and he came up under the wing of Ken Collier. one of the Motor City's most significant DJ pioneers. Smith sat down with Matt Unicombe in Berlin earlier this week, giving us an insight into what it was like in the earliest days of Detroit dance music and the production methods behind some of his key tracks. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Delano Smith is up next. How long are you in Europe for this time? 10 days. 10 days? Yeah. And do you always do it like that? Like you come for a few weeks and then go back to the US? I used to come here and stay, what, two or three weeks at a time to stay at Yossi's. But, you know, all the travel and being away from home, I... It kind of wore on me a little bit, so now I just go out just on the weekends, like two weekends out of the month. Well, there's only two weekends in the month. So I just come out, I just go out and come back home, man. I have a house that I like to enjoy. You have a lot. Exactly. You know, I have a wife that I love and my mom, you know, my dad, my family, you know. And do you still live in Detroit? Yeah, I live in Detroit, yeah. In the city, not in the suburbs. I live in the city of Detroit, yeah. I was actually born in Chicago. My family moved here when I was about five years old. Well, I moved to Detroit when I was about five years old, and that's where I was raised. So that's where all my musical inspiration comes from. It comes from Detroit. from chicago yeah of course um what does it did later yeah you know but yeah not how is detroit because we keep hearing about like uh rejuvenation and i don't know that things are looking now what do you think now it's better it's uh it went through a very uh dry spell back in the 90s and in the early 2000s There was, after the Music Institute closed, there was kind of a long dry spell there. It was very much small, very niche kind of clubs, well, crowds and everything. It wasn't until, I think, probably until the Movement Festival. what was called DEMF, the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, is when we saw some resurgence in it. And then with the rise of social media and everything, I think that kind of, it played a really big part in the scene kind of blowing up again. You know, the social media has made the world a lot smaller, you know. And, you know, kids see what's going on in Europe and they kind of want to emulate what's going on in Europe. and their hometown and everything so yeah it's gotten better do you still have lots of music buddies in detroit i don't know you chatting about music with people there and seeing your old dj pals well yeah all my dj pals i see them over here more than i see in detroit yeah that's what i was that's what i was thinking so uh it's just rare that you know i get a chance to talk with jeff or derrick or or somebody like that in Detroit, you know, but more of my closer friends like Norm and Baby Huck. I'll see them in Detroit more often because Norm and I, me, he and I are closer. We have a closer friendship, so. I talk to him on the phone every day. Oh, really? The guy's like, yeah, I don't know if you know Rick Wilhite. Yeah, of course. That's a really good friend of mine, and we spend a lot of time together. So it's not like you're in isolation there. Oh, no, not at all, not at all. Yeah, cool. Yeah, it's cool, because I guess that's the cool thing about being from somewhere with such history. If you're me, I had to move out, like move away from my hometown to get deeper into this music. Where with you guys, it's part of the history. So you can have the same, you can have a friend for 20 or 30 years who you've been doing this music kind of with. Right. And yeah. But it's weird, but there's a lot of people that's from Detroit that were doing music. I did not meet. know in Detroit until I got to until I started touring Europe like Shady Mirror. He and I are very good friends now. I didn't even meet him until my first time I was in Berlin. And now we're like, you know, we're almost best buds. And, you know, I didn't meet him until, you know, 20 years after the fact. And I met him right here in Berlin. Yeah. It was weird. Yeah. And when did Europe start becoming, I assume most of your gigs are in Europe, or most of the big gigs are in Europe now. They are, yeah. When did the switch happen? Like for US? After the release of my first record on Mixmo, The Fieldus. Yeah, the hit. Yeah, right. The Fieldus. The Fieldus and My Life. Exactly. No, actually, no. The My Life came later. Okay. But The Fieldus on Mixmo, the MMO one, The Fieldus. I was thinking Direct Drive, My Life. When I put that out, the guys over at Panorama Bar called me shortly after it was released. And that was my first gig I ever did in Europe was at Panorama Bar. It's not a bad first gig. No, not a bad first at all. But I'd never heard of it prior to that because, you know, I was, you know, my style of playing was even different back then. You know, I didn't really change until I got on board with Sushi Tech here. And then after the Sunrise EP on Third Ear. is when things really, really took off. And then, of course, you know, after Odyssey, the album Odyssey, it really kind of... It really took me to another level there. I can see why this early record was a hit in Europe. And it's something I actually wanted to speak to you about. A lot of your music is pretty reduced and kind of groove-driven. A lot of other Detroit and US house, it's maybe more... Your music is also jazzy, but maybe there's more emphasis on melody. There's more breaks and it's a bit more chaotic. Where yours is this very, or it's often pretty loopy. That's because I'm not a musician. I make music from a DJ kind of standpoint, if you will. And that it's, I think with all of us that started as DJs, a lot of our music is very groove based and very loopy. You know, you'll probably switch up the... the drums at the 64 by adding a little fill or a roll here or there. But we very rarely change the key or do a... progression or something like that because you know I'm not a musician I don't know how to read music and all of my music is basically kind of loopy and sample based but this is the most playable like versatile stuff you know like what you're looking for clubs yeah yeah exactly and yeah and on that point at least from my perspective like a lot of people think this kind of loopy sound is a European thing But actually, like, there's so much US house. Like, for example, DJ Skull. Right, yeah. Some of the earliest U.S. house was this all pretty reduced. Yeah, yeah. A lot of the earlier stuff like that. A lot of stuff on Dance Mania, all the stuff. Yeah. All of the house, all the house that came out of Chicago, even early Detroit stuff, all of it was basically just loops. I mean, we didn't guess. play a piano man everything was on the on the mpc 60 or you know early early days yeah yeah i don't know i guess a lot of people think when they think of us house yeah they think moody man and like as you say like big chords and uh yeah well all of early uh early moody man stuff was just disco samples though yeah so yeah yeah all of all of his hits were you know, Sister Sledge, last samples and disco samples. And yeah, so, yeah. And I think it's, I think it's a matter of picking an interesting sample and it's all about how you manipulate it, you know, and keeping it interesting for six minutes, you know, that's the challenge. And how do you keep it interesting for six minutes? Do you think some people have it and others don't? Yes, I definitely think some people have it and others don't. Because even when you think about even your tunes like My Life, that's also just a tiny lick. nice groove and the bass line. Exactly. Well, the bass line, well, it was, my life was actually just a sample taken from George Duke, I Want You For Myself, which I think a couple of other people did it, but it all depends on, you know, your interpretation of it. I just did that with probably, I think, a chord sample on the top of it. I think I'd probably just shorten the loop at the end and you got to try it. But why do you think it works? Is it the same with this Dancevania stuff? Some people just have an ear for groove. And then some people don't. I don't know what that is. I don't know what it is, you know. without giving too much away, I think it's about your mindset when you're making the track, you know, what, what, you know, what you're drinking or what you're, what you're smoking or whatever, you know, it kind of, you know, brings the variations out, you know, while, while you're listening to the group or while you're listening to the loop for like six hours straight, you know, it's like, well, what else can I do with this? You know, and when all you can think of is a hat here and there or probably a ride. And sometimes that's all you need, you know, at some point. If you listen to a lot of, you know, Mr. G stuff, that's all it is, is he'll be doing it. When he puts the ride in, it's like, oh my God, it's a whole, you know, you feel a whole different kind of way about the track then. Maybe it's also a confidence thing. Like just having the, yeah, the confidence to just put out such a reduced tune. You don't need to have all this like crazy stuff going on. It doesn't need to build up. really intensely. That's because the market that we probably, that we produce for and to is just for clubs and for DJs. You know, we don't... make music to, you know, sell 5,000, to get 5,000, 10,000 downloads on iTunes. You know, you do it for the, you know, for the heads, for the clubs and, you know, the DJs that, you know, that rock that kind of vibe, you know, and those are the type of vibes that, that, that. They're rock clubs, man, you know, head music. Yeah, I think it makes sense now that you say that. Yeah, because you were DJing for a while, or for a long time before you started to produce. Yeah, actually before the inception of... of house and techno, I was DJing in Detroit. Like, started in 79, I think it was. Yeah, I was probably one of the first, well, a guy named Daryl Shannon was actually the first teenage kind of DJ, the DJ that was still in high school DJing. He was the first one that had any skill at beat matching and mixing then. This was prior to... Technics 1200s even being invented or whatever. We were still mixing on belt drive turntables. Some guys were mixing on turntables, believe it or not. They didn't have pitch controls. I mean, out doing gigs like that. And, you know. But yeah, I started actually probably really, really got going and doing backyard parties and stuff like that in 1980 is when everybody heard Ken Collier on the radio. And he was the first person to actually introduce beat matching, you know, to the public. I wonder, you know, what the hell was he doing? on WLBS and WTRQ mixing two records together and when I first saw him do it, it changed the whole musical landscape. Detroit, if you will. Do you know where he, why did he start doing it? Did he see Frankie Knuckles? I know he knew Frankie and I know that he and his brother, Greg, I think they used to go to New York or whatever or Chicago to hear this, but I don't know. exactly where they drew their inspiration from. Probably there's another DJ, Stacy Hale. She was a DJ long before me in Detroit, and she was also good friends with Ken, and she's still alive and doing well in the city. She could probably brush on that more. She could probably tell you more about that than me. but I can just tell you for the straight kids, our generation, we drew our inspiration from Ken Collier. And he introduced DJ culture to Detroit. And I wasn't the first kid to do it. We were all doing it. But I think I was the first one. I was the first one to actually have a legitimate residency at one of the clubs that kids went to in the city. It was called Luomo. And I was able to grasp the concept of beat matching relatively early. And I think I was probably kind of good at it. Did all the DJs know each other back then? Yeah, yeah. But there were still cliques and crews back then, too. A lot of animosity, you know, towards different cliques and crews and stuff like that. So there were some rivalries going. Daryl and I had a rivalry. for a long time when we were kids. And his crew and my crew always often, you know, kind of bumped heads a lot of times. But when we got older, that kind of stuff dissolved. No grudges anymore. Not anymore. Well, why? You do your thing, I do mine, bro. Just keep it moving. What were the parties like? Who would you play for? Back then, it was very kind of, it started on the west side of Detroit. It was very kind of black, straight. Black and gay parties. This was prior to House and Techno, so we played a lot of synth pop and stuff on South Soul, Prelude, Emergency, a lot of disco and post-disco stuff. And it was still relatively new. Mixing was still new. There was no CDJs or no internet. nothing like that so in order to keep mixing interesting we'd have to buy two copies of a record and just you know do stuff like extend the beginning extend the breaks you know by just you know constantly flip queuing one from another and everything and that they're kind of defined you know, your skill, you know, working acapellas on instrumentals and stuff like that and, you know, it kind of forced you to be creative in that respect. Mixing like that forced you to be kind of creative. And then a lot of tracks weren't made with drum machines back then. Yeah, much harder, almost impossible to beat that. Exactly, yeah. So you kind of had to be creative in how you came in and how you went out of a track and everything. And, you know, especially working on belt-driven turntables, not having 1200s or, you know, quartz-locked turntables where the pitches are real. It makes DJing now seem ridiculously easy. Especially on CDJs. It's ridiculously easy when you can just... You see the BPM. You can see the BPM right there, just match it up and just... go and then you can automatically especially if you got your stuff in record box you can loop effortlessly and everything it's like it's so easy to be a dj now as it's i guess it's good you know it's good for the industry you know good for people for the youngsters youngsters well i'm not going to comment on that but you know but uh you know i'm not hating on anybody that's your thing. And, you know, you started off with CDJs and you're successful now, more power to you, you know. You were DJing for how many years until you went back to college? I started, until I went what? Until you went back to college. Okay, yeah, I started, I think in 1980 and then right when house hit is when I stopped. So probably from 80 to 86. And then I stopped until about '91, I think. I took a hiatus of about five or six years. Went away to school, got a job. Back then, there was no money in it. I was getting paid $35, $50 to play all night. Did you get free drinks at least? I wasn't much of a drinker back then. But when we did, no, we didn't get free drinks. So a lot of times, especially when I played at the pub, I played at a place called the Downstairs Pub. I played there with Ken. It was open for Ken, like at 83, 84. I just turned 21. I don't think I even was 21 yet, but we used to sneak drinks in. Even Ken used to bring his own bottle in because... We used to have to buy drinks. That's even now to this day, some clubs in the US will not give you drink tickets. I know in Detroit, some of them won't. You end up in Milas after the games. I know one club for sure, if you're playing there, you still have to buy your own freaking drinks, man. And that's a shame. And then the pay, it was so horrible back then that people just used to, we used to play for free sometimes just so that we could play. It was really bad back in the... back in those days, but hey. And the years that you, this break that you had, do you look back on that time and think there was something missing from your life? Yes, I missed a lot of good records during that time. Records that now cost two, three hundred bucks on Discogs. I really hate that I just because I when I when I was stepped away from it, I stepped completely away from it. You know, I didn't go to clubs. I didn't do anything. I was because I was so frustrated at. how, dude, I've been playing for years. This guy comes and he's playing for free. You know, now you're booking this guy because I'm asking you for immediately 50 bucks and, well, he's not charging me anything, man. And, you know, and the club's packed. And, you know, I'm like, you know, screw this. And plus, you know, guys that I went to high school with, these guys were in college and, you know, they were about to graduate and everything And I thought I'd better get some education under my belt before I was too late. And then I was in my very early 20s. And I just didn't want to be this bum, this guy trying to DJ and stuff like that and working crap jobs. That's when I just left Detroit, went away to school. It was the best thing I ever did, you know, because when I came back to the music, I looked at it from a whole different perspective. You know what I mean? So and I think when I came back at it, I look at it from more of a business kind of standpoint. And being more than just a DJ, you know what I mean? Just being looked at as more of an artist than kind of just a DJ, you know? Did you work afterwards? Yeah, yeah. When I got back, I had to work because I couldn't get jobs. I couldn't get jobs DJing. Plus, I wasn't really producing really anything until 98, maybe, something like that. I started toying around. I had a drum machine a buddy of mine let me borrow, the Yamaha RM1000, I think it was. I did my first track on Psychostasia with that. I did a track on the first Beatdown compilation with that drum machine. And then I started getting off into the DAWs. Got the MPC, got the Motif workstation. I started working with that type of hardware. And that's what I did after I did the Sunrise EP. And that's when this guy here called. And we started doing SushiTech stuff, and that's when everything just... Did you make direct drive in these tunes on MPC? I made direct drive, and I made that in Ableton. Okay. Yeah, I made that in Ableton, yeah. But I think I used a 909 drum machine. I ripped the samples in Ableton, and I just... Looped it out in Ableton. Would people like Jeff Mills and Derek May, they would watch you DJ at parties? Before they were... I don't remember seeing Jeff. I remember seeing Jeff when he was... I think Jeff and I are the exact same age. But I remember a disco DJ named Dale Willis brought... Jeff out. No one knew Jeff. Jeff came from nowhere. Whereas Derek used to come to the club. Derek used to come to Lumo and everything. Derek was kind of a party guy, kind of, you know, he lived out in suburbs and stuff. He used to come to Lumo and all of the, you know, high school parties. He used to come there when we, you know, before he started DJing. He used to come and watch Daryl Shannon and I. I think Eddie did too. Eddie Folks. Yeah. Jeff was an anomaly because he came. from somewhere else. I don't know where he came from. Same from space. Exactly, exactly. But Dale Willis kind of brought him onto the scene and kind of introduced him to everyone. And when Jeff first came on, he was good. We were like, who the hell is this? You know, when he first came on, scratching, cutting, and transforming everything, we were like, who's this guy? You know, and I remember I was in a DJ contest at this club called The Lady. And it was myself, kind of Dwayne Montgomery, Daryl Shannon, a lot of old school heads for back in 83 and 84. You know, we were just mainstays in the game. Ken Collier was one of the judges. Another one of the judges was Steve Nader. He was the director of Dance Detroit, which all of us belonged to. Dance Detroit was a record pool where... We would get promos from stuff like that. Subscription kind of... Yeah, you paid every month and labels would, like, labels like South Soul and, you know, Warner Brothers would send their, you know... their dance mixes and all, you know, these versions to this record pool and you would fill out a sheet as to how each record was doing and everything and you give your feedback sheet every month, you know, and you'd get, you know, you'd go by, you'd go every week and get records. Sometimes you only get, you know, four or five in your pack. Sometimes you'll get ten, you know, but... This is how a lot of us got our records back then. Of course, you know, we were still buying the, you know, what they would call disco singles back then. That's, you know, when the 12-inch was still relatively new. But going back to the DJ contest, Jeff was actually the opening DJ, and he played in between the competition. And people were like, this guy is better than the people that are actually in the contest. You know, so, and that's how we all got to know Jeff. And after that, man, his residency at Cheeks. And he was playing up in, I forgot the name of the club he was playing in, Ann Arbor. But then he, of course, the Wizard Radio Show and the rest is history. So how many places, like on any given night? How many different parties could you, would be going on? Like a Friday night in Detroit. There would probably be back in those days, it would probably be one, probably two or three. Because the crowd was still relatively small. And it wasn't multicultural back then. It was all black. So, and it was all on one side of town. So probably three to 400 people, maybe on a good night, probably two or three parties. That's on the straight scene though, going up. But on the gay scene there, there could have been more, but you know, I didn't frequent, you know, gay clubs back then. probably on the straight scene, probably two to three, maybe. But there was a high school gigs, and then there was the young adults, too. Studio 54 was still going back then. Studio 54 in Detroit. And I think Ken had a residency at this place called The Chess Mate. There was another club called Todd's. in which Ken's brother used to play and another DJ, rest in peace, Dwayne Bradley, used to play at a place called Todd's. So the scene was very much divided in straight and gay gigs. But we would, as far as the straight gigs, the parties that we were doing, probably two or three a night. And when did it eventually start to become more mixed up? After movement. After the DMF. After the DMF, the gigs started becoming more multicultural, if you will. And then people started bringing in acts from Chicago. And well, mainly Chicago, New York. And that's when the gig started. And then when the white promoters actually started throwing parties and hiring the black DJs. And that's when it became more multicultural in Detroit. This was probably in the probably early 90s, mid 90s. is when it started to transform to what it is. Now it's madness. Now it's very strong in Detroit now, I think. There's three clubs in Detroit now that's going very strong, very multicultural. And a lot of guys are bringing a lot of good talent from all over the world. So Detroit is looking good right now. And if you speak to an average kid at one of these parties, like today, will they know about Detroit's legacy? I don't think so. I think now everything is kind of in the moment, if you will. And I think a lot of people go for more of a spectacle now than knowing the history of it. Because somebody, you know, somebody said, oh, you were the OGs, aren't you? I'm like, dude, what is OG? Is it old guy? Was it original gangster? I don't know what this OG is supposed to mean. But I don't know if I should be offended by that or not. But I guess I should. I guess. They may have some form of respect. I know I'm only kidding, but still. We're still looked at as the OGs and everything, so it's okay. I don't think it means much to them. I think they're very much in the now, in the who's hot now, who's putting out the stuff that they like now and who is fashionable on social media and stuff like that. I think that's... where it is now as far as cats like me it's like you know we're still trying to remain relevant you know, in all of this, you know what I mean? By continuing to put out, you know, music and DJ. This scene was so, like, it was born from a black community. How is it for you to travel to Europe and see... See what it has morphed into? Yeah, considering you... I think it's a beautiful thing. I think it's a beautiful thing. I haven't seen any footage. or anything to show what the scene was like in, say, Berlin or London in 85. But I know what was going on here, and I know the music we were listening to. I know where DJ culture, what was happening in 85 and 83. I know what was happening and I know that we were on to something, that we were on to something musically fresh and new. I had nowhere, I had no idea this was going on anywhere else other than our little small part of the world here. Because like I said, there was no internet. There was none of that. There was no way of knowing. who was doing this other than you, unless you actually went there. And after, you know, after the inception of House, we used to drive Chicago. We used to drive Chicago just to record the mixes off BMX. You know what I'm saying? It's crazy. But after the inception of house music, you know, we knew what was going on in Chicago. So we would actually crew up and go to Chicago and try to go to Cotton Club or the warehouse was kind of. When I started going like in 86 or 87, I don't know if Ron was still around back then, but I never got a chance to hear Ron or Frankie in Chicago. So the only person I did really get to hear when I was a kid was T. Scott from New York. And I heard Tony Humphries. I heard him at a WMC once, but that was back in the 80s, back when we used to go to. Winter Music Conference when, well, in the 90s when we went to the Winter Music Conference when it was really a music conference and not just a bunch of after parties. Back when you used to have to take your record and try to shop it to distributors. When people still took records. Exactly. You took records and if you were lucky enough to get a record for someone and it happened to be nice, especially at test pressing, man, it was great. Those were the days right there. Yeah, it's so hard for you to imagine. I'm 29. Dude. Yeah, it's so hard for you to imagine what it was like. I think I got kids your age. Yeah. Well, even just how it's changed in the years since I've been into dance music, just as you say the social media thing, you can be an international touring DJ just from having a... Just by having 100,000 likes. Yeah. It's crazy. I mean, more power to these people and their PR companies and their management that's able to do this for people, for people to... you know, explore their passion, you know, to live their passion and do this through, uh, through fashion and social media and everything. And all of a sudden, Hey, I'm playing, uh, Ibiza. You know, it's like that kills me, especially when some of us had to come up through it the hard way. I have a friend running a label and we were chatting about Instagram. He says, yeah, man, if I post a picture of my new record, say, hey, it's out. Like, yeah, 100 likes. If he posts like some photo of his dog. 500 right exactly that i can't explain it man but you know what are you gonna do i guess it just became a real industry it's the same with like sports or i don't know just entertainment in general the actual thing is just a small part of it now the music is just a small part i think it's a big part well yeah i think it's a big part of it but i think the the the social media aspect of it. A lot of promoters and clubs are very, they're really looking at that to see the appeal of the particular artist. You know what I mean? If you're, you know, you only have 5,000 likes, you're not going to get booked. But if you're, you know, if your fan page has 200,000 followers, I mean, from all over the world and everything, you can best believe you're going to get some bookings. And promoters are going to feel confident in booking you, especially if you're very active, you're very fashionable, and you're putting out songs that are halfway decent and that other DJs are playing and charting and people are commenting on your posts. not only commenting on them, and you're engaging with them, and they see you engaging with them. You know, it's very much a big part of, you know, artists getting gigs now. Would you have social media if you didn't have to do it? you know, if it wasn't part of the game, would you be doing interviews and this kind of thing? If I was a regular guy, I would not have social media. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say a regular guy, but if I wasn't, you know, an artist of any kind. No, I wouldn't want anyone to know where I was. I mean, why? I mean, I would probably have it, but have a very small group of friends, like someone I know from high school. It's like, oh, I wonder how so-and-so is doing. And I'll probably go to do that, but I'll probably be under an alias or something like that. I wouldn't want anyone to know where I am. You know, I mean, I prefer to remain kind of private. But being that we're in this business, it's a necessity to have this. So how were you in high school? Were you always the music guy? Not always. Not until like the last maybe two years. The last two years, I was always kind of the social kind of person. I was in these, in high school, we had these social orgs. Organizations that we used to you know, when Hall rent halls and give parties and hire DJs do the parties That's how I met kid. Yeah, no, you can book him $200 exactly We just be able to book kid for $200 that sound system and everything Oh, oh, so you'd bring your own sound system if you're as that. Yeah. Yeah, that's how we all start We all started as mobile DJs back then I never had like my own sound system back then. I used to work with my partner. His name was Carl Martin. And we had a sound company. It was called Soundwave. And Gerald Shannon and Todd Johnson, they had direct drive. And there were a lot of different DJ crews. And everyone had their, you know, big Suriname Vegas speakers and everything. And we used to get bookings for like a hundred bucks. $150 and you'd bring your sound system in to these halls. Yeah, put them in the backseat, put them in the trunk of the car and we should drive to these places, set up and do parties, do weddings, everything. Yeah. But back then we used to... to uh yeah you we would be able to book ken for 200 man and would he tailor his set to like high school students like no rude uh yes i i think he did because like when we wouldn't hurt him at the older parties he used to play a lot of really good disco you know what i'm saying really good disco and everything and you never heard tracks like parliament funkadelic those parts you play like Like, you know, it would be considered underground disco then. When he'd do the high school parts, he'd be playing Knee Deep, you know, George Clinton, Knee Deep, and Rick James, stuff like that. He's like, no, no, no, no, dude, we want what you were playing last week at that other gig, you know. And you never really told Ken what to play. You know what I'm saying? I remember I was with a high school organization called Courtier. We had this party at this club called the Cotillion Club. It was like in the hood in Detroit, you know, back in the day. And this is like my second time actually booking Ken for a gig. And he was playing Aqua Boogie by George Clinton. I don't know if you're familiar with that tune, but look it up. It's by Parliament Funkadelic. It's called Aqua Boogie. It was a 12-inch on it. The record was about 15 minutes long. And he played this. And I actually went up to him and said, could you play something else, please? And the look that he gave me was like, I could have died in my pants right there. I could have just died. He was like, little boy, get away from me. You know what I'm saying? That's the look that he gave me. But thankfully, he forgave me for that. We became friends. Did he ever mention it again? He never mentioned that again. He never mentioned it to me. I guess he thought I was probably young or didn't know what the hell I was talking about. And now you give people the same look? I try to, that's one thing I don't do. I try not to demean anyone, especially now. Maybe when I was a kid, I probably was a bit arrogant. But now, I try my best to, you know, if someone, I try to give someone the time of day. I try to be nice to everybody. If people are paying money to come out and see you play or they're buying your records, man, the least you can do is just give them five. minutes of your time for some conversation. Yeah, definitely. You seem like a friendly guy. I can't imagine you being rude to someone. I think I'm pretty much friendly. He'd probably say something different. Yeah. If you're wondering, I'm talking about my friend Yossi is here. My man that runs Sushi Tech. None of this could have been possible without him. I thank and I appreciate him all the time. In Detroit, were the parties also attracting people from different socioeconomic levels? As you just said, there was a party in one of the poorer areas. Of course, yeah. There were people from all socioeconomic levels. Poor people. people from the suburbs and everything, everybody kind of partied together. So even since then, dance music in Detroit, it was also about this inclusivity. Everyone is welcome. Exactly, yeah. We were all kind of a family then. Well, not a family, but we all knew each other. Everyone kind of, because of the high school. thing we all kind of we all kind of knew each other it was all it was some type of relationship there and plus it was really cheap to get into the parties then it was like two bucks you know the highest price party back then was seven dollars and if something was seven dollars it was like dude That's seven bucks. You know what I'm saying? It's like $7 was a lot of money to go to a gig because gigs were basically three bucks. Would you approach the party the same way you would today? Like you meet up with your friends at someone's house, then go to the party, then stay till the end? Yeah, same thing. Yeah, same thing. But see, then we used to get to the parties when the door opened. In Detroit. back in the early 80s because we if Ken was playing we used to we we used to want to hear everything he played so we used to get there the party started the party well the closing time of Detroit it still is two o'clock but it was two o'clock in the morning back then too so we used to get there get to the party shortly after the doors open sometimes before they open And then sometimes we'd get there early because the price went up like after 10. So you had to go get there early to actually, and we, you know, we want to stay all night, you know, until the end of the party. And, you know, a lot of other people thought like us because there were lines to get in parties at, you know, nine o'clock. Now in Detroit, party starts at nine. People don't get there until 1230. Yeah, it's empty for the first two hours. Exactly, and that's one thing I don't get. Do you go to parties in Detroit very often? No, no, not at all. I go to things that my friends do. Someone from out of town is playing. I'll probably go, but for the most part, I'm over here. And then I'm trying to do work at home, and you can't hang out and make tracks. Yeah, exactly. Crawling out of a club in the morning. Exactly right, yeah. Plus, you know, I've kind of been on the older side. You've been to enough parties. I've been to enough parties. I've seen some amazing things, you know, both in Europe and in the States. And, you know, it's kind of hard for me to... be impressed now, you know what I mean? So has any DJ impressed you like Ken Collier? Yeah, yeah. Is he still number one in your... All the time, all the time. These kids nowadays, man, are great. I'm not going to single anyone out. I was like, dude, how come you didn't mention me? It's like, everybody's great, you know what I mean? Everybody knows what they're doing now, man. I think the lot of the jocks that are... that are out here now, man, everybody's knowledgeable, man. Everybody's good, bro. Everybody's good. You know what I'm saying? We just had a sushi check. We just had a gig at... Renata? Yeah. And I went to the rooms, and everybody sounded good, man. It was not everybody sounded good. Everybody was playing a track that I didn't have. You know what I mean? Everybody's playing a track that I wanted. I was like, dude. It's like everywhere I go, the guys that are opening for me all over the world, man. It's like all these guys are good. All these guys are banging great music, man, good tracks, man. And guys are producing good stuff, too. And it's really good. I think it's really a good time. uh in music now it really is especially well especially with the technology now too and you know you can buy a laptop and sound like you're in a 20 track on a 20 track board now you know what i mean so so when did you start to think that you could do this for a career when i got laid off from my job in 2003 i think it was 2005 maybe you know i took the pension that they give you. And when I started getting calls, you know, after I put out a couple records and I started getting calls and I started looking at my life differently, look at this profession differently, stopped wanting to just call myself just a DJ. That seems so kind of, I just hate that term. You know what I mean? I just hate the... I'm a DJ. Yeah, exactly. I think probably after my second or third release, I knew that I wasn't going back to work again. I started to garner a lot of support. My fan base started to grow. I said, I think I'll stay in this lane. Are you happier now, now that music is your main thing or your only thing? Are you happier as a person than when you were working for the man? I'm much happier as a person. Did you say working for the man? Yeah. You're absolutely right. It is good to wake up. and to have your own business, you know what I'm saying? And to determine, to be able to determine your self-worth, not having to punch anyone's clock. And your success totally remains on you and what you do and what you put into it, you know? And I like having that responsibility on myself. You know, I've never been more successful at anything. as what I'm doing now in any field of work I've ever done or whatever. I've never been in my education or whatever. I've never had more success than what I'm doing now. The friends that I've met along the way in this, we all are in it together. We think alike in everything. I couldn't have made a better choice. Yeah, that's interesting. I've also been thinking about this recently. For example, I was thinking about fitness and exercise. I was thinking maybe part of the reason you can get a... obsessed with it is because it's also one of the few things in your life that you have total control over. If I want to go to the gym and get strong, there's nothing stopping me. The only thing I need to do is buy the gym pass. That's right. Yeah. But with work, I could work my butt off for 12 hours a day. Right. And still get, well, hopefully not. And still maybe get fired like two months later. Right, exactly. You know? And then they can replace you. You can work your butt off for somebody and they'll fire you. And without any consequence to you or nothing, they could just fire you and you could just be replaced in this. It's all on you. Yeah, if you spend 12 hours a day, maybe you've got five records at the end of the year. Exactly, right, yeah. You've got five physical, and you get bookings out of it. Exactly, you have something to show for it. You know what I mean? If you're decent at producing, you know what I'm saying? You could be an excellent DJ, but a crappy producer. You know what I'm saying? And you could put out records. It's like, your tracks probably aren't that good. You know what I mean? People don't find them appealing, you know? So I think, you know, we're all blessed that, well, I think I'm blessed that I was able to, you know, make the right kind of connections and be inspired by the people that, the producers that inspired me. I'm able to kind of look at someone's career and kind of be like, okay. I'll see how they do it, how they did it, whatever, not actually copy them. But, you know, but, you know, there is a road map here where you can kind of if this is something you want to do and you see where the music is and you see how your sound fits into this landscape of it all. You know what I'm saying? If you're smart and you can figure out your place in that. I think you could be successful. And I think that's what I did. Is that the kind of advice you'd give to people? Find your own, find your, that's the kind of advice I'm giving now. I generally don't give advice to people. People don't really ask for my advice. They don't ask, what do you think I should do? I'm like, you know, I don't know. I mean, no one has really, I've never been really asked that question. So I can't really say that I've given any advice. But if I were to give advice, that would be the advice I'd give. When you were first starting to reduce, like we were talking about, making this more like DJ friendly sound, was that a conscious decision? Or it's kind of just what came out? Were you thinking like, I want some, a groovy bomb for the dance floor? It's like, it's that conscious decision. You know, I don't, I don't really don't go into a project with a blank slate. You know, I kind of go in kind of knowing what I want the track to be, like how I want the bass to roll, you know, how I want it to sound, how, what kind of a scene I'm trying to set, what kind of atmosphere I'm trying to create going into this. Do I want it to be funky? Do I want it to be techno? Do I want it to be housey, funky housey? You know, I always have a concept of it when I'm going in. I generally don't just, okay, I'm starting with a kick, I'll go with a hat, and then I'll just play around some bass lines. No, no, no. I have a concept of what I'm doing before I even start. So what determines that concept? Like your mood? Sometimes it could be in a dream. Oh, really? Yeah, or like if I'm in the bathroom or something and my wife is playing music on the second floor and I'm on the... first floor, whatever. And I'm hearing, you know, just bass. You're not hearing what the track is, but you're hearing bass. And then I'm like, okay, that would sound good like that. Then I'll go and I'll lay it down. You know what I'm saying? And then I'll leave it alone. Then I'll come back to it later. Like sometimes I even do that at night. Sometimes when I'm... I'm laying out, I'll think of a bass line or some type of melody. I'll hum it to myself, you know, on my phone or something so I can come back to it the next day. But oftentimes when I do that, I'm like, oh man, that didn't make any sense. It's like someone. finds your phone one day and they hear this. Right, right. But so sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. You know what I mean? But a lot of stuff comes from, you know, parts and songs too. A lot of old R&B stuff, a lot of jazz stuff you're riding around in the car or whatever and you hear like one little snippet and it's like, ah! I'm going to grab that when I get home. And I do that. And sometimes it'll just be the sample. And sometimes the sample would just loop into something else. And I end up not even using the sample. You know what I mean? But yeah, there's always some specific start off point. Exactly right. Yeah. Yeah. Your tracks actually have a lot of variety. Yeah. There's more the W kind of stuff. Right. Exactly. Then there's like the housey side. Exactly. Right. Yeah. Yeah, but it's all for the dance floor. Perfect dance floor tracks. Yeah, I think so. Because at the end of the day, I am a DJ, and I think that a lot of my tracks are just dance-forward driven. Maybe one day I'll do some artsy stuff. But for now, I'm playing in clubs. And I want to continue to play in clubs for a minute. And I want DJs to buy my stuff. And I want people that like dance music to buy my stuff. So I'm going to keep it where I have the most success at now. I'm going to just keep it there. Thank you. Thank you. so you
