Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Roth. and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Horsemeat Disco is a club night and DJ collective whose legend is bigger than just about any niche you could stuff it in. Originally based out of the Eagle in South London more than a decade ago, the party was the city's earliest and largest night to bring back the sound of New York's bathhouses and gay clubs in the 1970s. The music, along with the inclusive and enormously fun vibe, struck a chord both in and out of the gay scene. attracting an enviable roster of guest DJs. A series of seminal compilations, a New York residency, a wholly unique party at Glastonbury, and hordes of DJ gigs have turned horse meat disco into a decidedly international concern. Stephen Titmuss touched in with one half of the group, Luke Howard and James Hillard, at our London office recently to hear the magnificent story of the Queer Party for Everyone. 🎵 So going back to the start because of course you were all four individual peoples but how did you all meet initially? Hey it's quite a long complicated long-winded story. I think the first people to meet was maybe me and Severino. I was living in Italy at the time and I was working for a record label called Irma Records out there and he came in one day and we kind of hit it off. straight away got chatting he was living in London I'd obviously moved to Italy from London and he was living in Brixton that's where I was living so we kind of like you know created this kind of nice bond quite quickly because we lived in the same neighbourhood and we sort of arranged to meet up when I came back to London and in the meantime he'd met Jim Stanton me Jim and Seve all end up going out one night to a Rooty concert down in Brixton and then that was where me and Jim met and that's kind of really where you know start to talk about clubs and stuff and whilst all this was going on my favorite club in the world at the time was where Luke Howard used to play out and that was Queer Nation at Substation how did how did you meet everyone Luke? I met Severino because I used to work at Defected Records and he used to come and get promos from Guy Williams who was doing the club promotions and so I kind of knew him there although he said I was quite moody with him but it was probably because I was so stressed out but that's how I first met him and I used to see him around and Jim I actually asked out on a date when I met him first. I met him at the end and we went and had dinner, but we never took it any further than that. But then Jim started working at crash he started sort of working in club promotions and i was working at qn at queer nation and he sort of knew me so i used to see him around and i guess i met you at queer nation as well at substation back sort of in the i suppose it was the late 90s was it yeah and were you all really into disco at this point or is this something that came a bit later perhaps I think I can safely say for me and Luke, we were already really into disco. I think Jim was, Jim's always been more of a kind of indie kid or sort of like house music. I think since we started Horse Me Disco, that's when he started to get into it. But in terms of me and Luke, we've all, I mean, my dad was a DJ in the seventies and eighties. I grew up with a lot of those records being in the house and stuff. And my dad's sort of turntables were set up in the, in the dining room and his sound system and stuff. So I remember listening to a lot of that when I was young and I'd, I'd invent a gang that I had with, with no members apart from a few teddy bears and we'd listen to records and like that would be our. club anthem I think it was um State of Independence Donna Summer was our was our club anthem because I loved it so much but yeah I've always been a big disco fan even at school I was a repentant disco fan and probably got beaten up a lot for it it's hard hard Somerset you know growing up in the sticks in Somerset was rough Yeah, I think Seve was quite into it. He had quite eclectic taste because he'd been a DJ since the 80s in Italy. And so he grew up around all that sort of Afro. That's what they call cosmic in Italy. They call it Afro. So he kind of knew all that sort of Afro stuff. and I was always into it as well. I mean, I used to play disco and house when I started, I guess I started DJing in about 1990 at Queer Nation, which was at the gardening club, and DJ Harvey's night was on Friday and we did Sunday, so I was good friends with him and Heidi. And I used to go and listen to Norman Jay and people like that. And so I got turned on to a lot of music by Norman, by Harvey. And disco records were like 50p when I moved to London. No one wanted to buy them from the record and tape exchange. So, yeah, I've always sort of been into it, really. And it seems with Horse Meat, you know, it's very much been inspired by, you know, the 80s scene of New York and what have you. But was that just was it you know something that you got in contact with personally yeah i mean i i guess it was around the time that i was um i was working at new phonic records and it was around the time that we'd done all those compilations the loft compilations and i was working with adam goldstone um who's based out in new york and stuff as well so it was just at a time when i was kind of really discovering oh i used to work at strut as well and that was around the time they put out the In my sort of first few sort of forays into working in record labels, it was all around the time that, you know, they were doing all these sort of disco comp, compilations, which was great because that's what I really loved. So, so yeah, that was kind of. you know, cues are sort of taken from that really because, you know, it was the main place where a lot of the music that I was really into was kind of made legendary or, you know, so yeah. What was the question again? Well, I don't think there really was a follow-up. You answered it really well, but I guess the kind of idea of like an imagined ideal, but yeah, I think that makes sense. I was sort of back. yeah when I first started being a DJ I was quite obsessed with the idea of Studio 54 and the Paradise Garage. And I guess it was before the internet. So you kind of, it was all word of mouth. So when I used to go to New York, I used to go to the shelter, which was where Timmy Regisford used to play. And it was about 91. And it was where all the sort of garage heads used to go. And basically from about... sort of 6 or 7 a.m till closing at midday or 1 p.m he would just play back-to-back classics and so being in that environment and seeing everybody react the way that they did and singing along and and it was only like I guess three or four years since the garage had closed so there was still like I talked to a lot of people there and they were still talking about the garage and And I'd never heard anyone mix disco better than Timmy Regisford, FYI. And yeah, so that, I guess that was what inspired me going there and going to the sound factory and because you would get classics at the sound factory as well. So, yeah. One thing I really love that you've said before, Luke, is that British people kind of are obsessed about disco and obsessed about scenes that they might not have lived through. It's almost like a stamp collector's thing. I found that really interesting, you know, that, you know, you guys, for example, weren't there first time around, but you see what I mean you kind of you know you've really kind of lived through it and I think that's a lot of the same with British collectors and you know I think I think there's definitely something to be said about sort of the British British tastes has always been quite you know ready to accept a lot of sort black American music was the mainstream in America probably wasn't taken up. I mean, it was people like Dusty Springfield who brought, you know, Motown to the UK and, you know, the Motown song became big and that, you know, through that really the whole Northern soul thing. So I think there's definitely a much bigger appreciation for. black music here than maybe there you know there was especially in sort of like white circles in the states anyway so yeah i mean you know a lot of musicians will all will attest to that as well by saying yeah you know people like kid creole whose career in in europe in the uk was much bigger than it ever was in america you know even delight to a certain extent kind of had much bigger success over in in the uk than they did in america I guess English people or British people just want to dance and want to have a good time and probably weren't caught up in the whole sort of, you know, politics of what was happening in America in the 70s, I guess. So just spinning forward a bit, what was the gay nightclub scene in London like before you started Horse Meat Disco? I'll leave that one for you to talk about, Luke. Well, the gay nightlife scene. in London, it's always had really good bits and kind of other more commercial, generic clubs playing quite generic music. and often in quite a very in quite a druggy environment so yeah it's sort of always been like that really and I think when horse meat started there was the whole what's that genre no what's that um like there was the electro clash thing happening so there was clubs like the cock and nag nag nag so there was this kind of alternative thing where people were getting a bit more experimental and they were looking to the past a bit and then you've always had like indie nights in in london and on the gay scene like ducky and pop stars where they would be a much more eclectic and then you've got the kind of generic boysy sort of clubs where the muscle boys take their shirts off and they play kind of circuit music and then you have a few sort of other genres catered to like R&B, Queer Nation was a sort of New York house club so You know, it was, as it is today, a mixture, but the bigger clubs tend to be more circuit-y and then the smaller clubs cater to more sort of eclectic tastes. So I don't know if that answers your question. I'm trying to be very diplomatic. There's no need for diplomacy here. We're all friends. Yeah, basically it was really rubbish before we came along. We basically saved the gay scene because, you know, without us... It would basically be, I don't know. I'm trying to think of an analogy, but it would be awful. But I guess the question I really wanted to ask was, was Horse Meat Disco and the use of disco a reaction to anything specifically? Or was it just something that you wanted to do? Well, it was just music that we really loved. And, you know, I mean, it's not rocket science. Playing disco music to gay people is hardly sort of like, you know, it's not very experimental. It's like, you know, it's going Well, I guess it just wasn't in fashion. I mean, well, they've always been sort of like these kind of disco clubs, but for a long time, those disco clubs were like where you go and put your... flares on and you're kind of your afro wig and you'd go down and sort of dance to Gloria Gaynor whilst whilst that's fine I don't have a problem with that but like for me and for us in general disco was you know it was more than just being cheesy music it was like we actually you know the music was it's very sophisticated and we just wanted to kind of put that across really so it's just kind of taking our love of music and and you know bringing that to people I actually did do a few nights where we played disco, like back, way back when we had this night called Studio 76. And I think it was, I can't remember what night of the week it was, but me and Geoffrey Hinton used to do it. And it was a club called Pandemonium, which became Bar Industria. So we had a night there, but it never really took off. And then I did it, there was a club called Coco Latte. And downstairs, they used to play kind of more sort of circuity house. And they had a bar upstairs. And I used to get booked to play in that bar and play disco. So I mean, there was always like maybe little bits of it. And then on the gay scene in London, there's always been sort of R&B sort of crowd as well and that often you'd hear kind of classics maybe as well so you know there's always been a little bit it's not like it was unheard of. So when you first got together was it all, was there any kind of master plan involved or was it more like just let's sketch it out on the back of a fag packet and see what happens? The name came along first really. I was looking in a, well cleaning my house and there was like a stack of newspapers and the headline was horse meat discovered in salami. It was covered over. So just a horse meat disco and that was it. It was like that's a great name for a club. We'd already done a few sort of little parties here and there. And I got kicked out of the venue that we were at before. And this name came up. I was like, God, we've got to run with this. I mean, let's just do a few parties. And we did. And, you know, I think it was pretty, you know, right place, right time, a lot of luck. And that's kind of really where it kind of... sort of spiraled from really i mean like there was no master plan or you know all of us just a party where we could play music that we really liked and knew that other people would like it too you know like i said before it's not like it's not rocket science it's not exactly challenging the crowd? I think it was sort of the right time and the right place had a lot to do with it because it wasn't kind of like, right, we're going to do this night and it's going to be, you know, there wasn't a formula, but I think one of the things that helped it was when we moved to the Eagle, it was the first party that we did there was New Year's Day. And there weren't that many things actually 10 years ago or 11 years ago, however long ago it was, there wasn't that many parties on New Year's Day for some reason back then. It was all about New Year's Eve. Now there's tons of things on New Year's Day, but there was nothing on on New Year's Day. And basically everybody showed up that was still up from the night before or whatever. And it just kind of, it's just sort of happened, didn't it? It just ended up being this really brilliant, fun party. And I think someone, you know, the smoke machine got left on or something. So it just, you know, it just went crazy, didn't it? And also there was another DJ called DJ Rock that was booked to DJ after me and he didn't show up. I was running out of records. And so I just ended up playing things that I may not have played normally. And so it kind of made it a bit more eclectic and maybe played things that I didn't think people would get into. And what were those things? I don't know. Just like, I mean, definitely running up that hill was one of them by Kate Bush. But then, yeah, and I had this CD and it had these like medleys that I'd done for this fashion show. And so it was all kind of like mashups of, not mashups, but like little mixes of sort of eight minutes long that, you know, that had like Chic and Michael Jackson and Blondie and things like that on it. And so I just ended up having to play them. And so it just, it just kind of. Yeah, it just kind of worked, didn't it? It was just good fun. I think as well, it was, you know, a lot of the people that came were people who hadn't been out clubbing or sort of felt that like the gay scene had sort of like got away from them as slightly older queens, I suppose. And I think they just sort of, you know, realised, oh, this is the music that we used to dance to. And it's just so nice to kind of find somewhere that we sort how successful it became is that people would really you know genuinely rate i mean they still do people rave about it and you know so it's great so spinning back a little bit before you move to the eagle can you describe the very first horse meat disco party um the very first horse meat disco party was in a in a basement in chinatown which at the time was called flip i think it's under the pony boat it's called flip and you know it was it was well attended we had some good people come and play it was it was a funny venue had like metal floors and stuff it was corrugated iron floor but i remember we had some it was very eclectic back then we were sort of finding our feet i mean although it was kind of rooted in sort of disco there was you know a lot of the djs we had come and play would play you know really across the board but It was definitely a great place to kind of start, you know, and it was a Thursday as well. So it was a different day of the week. But, you know, it had a certain amount of success. Like the first party was really good. The second wasn't too bad. Then it sort of tailed off a little bit. And then the owners decided that they wanted to turn it into a straight venue and said that we could stay, but we'd have to change the name, change the artwork. And so jog on And then we kind of were in the wilderness for a while and then we decided we'd do a New Year's Day party. It was Duke's then, wasn't it? Which was amazing. It was like a proper boozer, like flock wallpaper, carpet, but it had this amazing reggae sound system. Like, I don't know how many megawatts it was, but it was booming. And in a small wooden kind of structure, it just rattled. It was immense. And I think that's why it was so good because everything sounded really good on that sound system, didn't it? So it was kind of like hearing things that you may have heard before or whatever and then hearing them on a really good system because it did have really good tweeters and stuff, didn't it? Good bass but good mids. Everything sounded so good and I think hearing stuff on that, it just lifted the party so much. Yeah, we had that sound for quite a while, but then it got taken out, didn't it? I think the neighbours complained. It took them a while. I mean, we had it for like a good few years, sort of three or four years before they told us that... Hell no. Which is very unusual in London in such a compact space to kind of get away with that kind of thing. Yeah. I mean, at the time there wasn't really much, there probably wasn't anyone living across there. I mean, the only people that would live next door back then, I think they were sort of like, I don't know, probably drug addicts. I think there was like a drug, like a meth house next door. Yeah. Or a DOS house next door. So they were quite easy So, of course, one of the things that, you know, I really think of when I think of Horse Meat Disco is the amount of colourful characters you kind of get there. You know, was that from the word go? Like I read a story that, you know, on one of the first ones, there was a guy that rang up and was saying he would come naked. You weren't expecting it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, God, I remember like he called up and it was quite cagey. It Can I come naked? Sure. Why not? I mean, I thought he was joking and it certainly saved on having to pay for a turn that night, you know, and he's been coming ever since. And people really kind of look forward to seeing him. And he's a super lovely guy. He's a poet. He's very talented. And I think the great thing about disco music is it's quite a leveler and it kind of attracts all kinds of people. And for me, that's always what a good party is about. It's not about being surrounded by people who look like you or who are the same as you. It's about being thrust into a situation where you're surrounded by people from different, I don't know different origins different social backgrounds that's you know that that's why those parties like at studio 54 Paris garage or things like that were quite sort of Legendary or pyramid club because they just kind of attracted all kinds of people and for me. That's what makes a good party Well, of course your slogan is the queer party for everyone. Yeah exactly. We still stick with that I mean, I think it's it's kind of important in this day and age to kind of at least be open-minded I think there was a time and quite naturally where people like gay people just wanted to be in gay clubs But I think we're sort of passed that to a certain extent now and I think it's good to have, you know, I think I love it when straight people come down. I mean, I think that's the thing is like straight people are prepared to come to a gay club. Then we should be prepared to accept them as a community because, you know. you know that's what equality is isn't it that's what it's about so just moving on a little bit how does it work with four djs in the group you know all got different egos i imagine different things they want to play is that tricky to kind of run with that no we're all very kind of supportive of each other and very you know very nurturing no there's no I know it's bull. No, I mean, no, it works out pretty well. I mean, actually there really isn't that much ego between us all. We get on and, you know, I think what's really good is that we all come to disco through different kinds of routes. So it's really important to kind of... have that to kind of bring so otherwise if we were just all coming in from the same angle there'd be no kind of difference really and and there you know at least there's a different sort of sound what i play to what luke plays to what jim plays and sebi plays so i think it's really important and have you ever had a situation where you know one of you really wants to take a certain gig or anything like that is it a case of rock paper scissors or it's a bit like a kind of disco conclave it So is there a sense of a dynamism between what you guys play though? You know, you said you've got different stuff. I read you two, you know, Luke and James play slightly older stuff and Seve plays stuff and Jim plays slightly newer stuff. Would that be right to say that or? Yeah, probably. I think we definitely cross over where there's stuff we all like and that we all play. yeah i think jim and seve are much more into new music and i am a little bit but i'm not i'm not kind of obsessed with it and i'm much more obsessed with collecting old music so I think James and I are the kind of crate diggers as far as like disco goes or soul but I mean we all kind of bring our own thing and we sort of mix try and mix it up you know because also Seve's got the whole Italian thing going on the whole Baldelli you know so he knows all that sort of music and James also speaks Italian and I go to Brazil a lot and I speak Portuguese, so I like Brazilian, I like collecting Brazilian music. So we all have our own thing going on, really. One thing I did want to speak to you about, Luke, is I guess sleaze or morning music, which is kind of a disco subgenre that you kind of champion a little bit on your SoundCloud. And I know it's very much a sound that's involved with Horsemeat Disco. Can you just explain what that is as well? Well, I think it's what they used to play at the end of the night at the Saint, pretty much. That's kind of, you know, the DJ would slow it down and maybe the last hour or so would be... or a couple of hours would be after the sort of frenetic 135 BPM for like eight hours. People need to kind of like rest a bit. And the Saint was the New York club, Nicky Siano DJed in the 80s, was it? No, it wasn't Nicky Siano. It was Robbie Leslie and Jim Burgess, plus quite a few other residents. And it was, yeah, it was an 80s. It was a big club. It was in a big sort of... bank I think and it had a major like light show almost like a planetarium light show and it was men only as well it was sort of like I suppose some people would say it was kind of like the white version of the garage the music was definitely kind of more euro and kind of it wasn't such a soulful sound it was more the Boys Town or the high energy music that got played there and I think yeah so Jim Burgess was probably the one who was like the the king of sleaze and actually some of the like Robbie Leslie when we met him he said I don't like to call it sleaze I call it morning music because sleaze kind of sounds like it's something dirty and it's actually not it's often very pretty music and it's sort of often very heartfelt there's a lot of kind of broken heart songs um in that sort of canon i suppose like phyllis hyman um loving you losing you things like that by phyllis hyman so yeah it's kind of a lot of heartbreak sort of stuff but it's slow it can be as slow as kind of 80 bpms up to make i mean nothing over 120 really and so it just it's something that yeah we've sort of become a bit obsessed about like And also just finding tracks that maybe weren't played there, but really fit into that genre. Because there's a kind of canon from the saint, really, of sleaze. But often we find things and we think, well, that's a total sleaze record, even though it may not have been played there, or a morning music record, as Robbie Leslie likes to call it. And actually, yeah, a lot of people come up to me and say, oh, I really like those mixes. So they obviously touch a nerve for a lot of people because people, you know, and a lot of people say, oh, will you play at my wedding? And me and my wife love your mixes. so yeah it's kind of it's nice actually well I think it's interesting for me personally it's just because it's it's a subgenre an area of music that's not very much discussed in a lot of the kind of the history of disco and things like that and because it's the more soulful less you know dancey side of it it's often records that were overlooked on albums and things like that you know yeah and especially like you know since I've been buying music you know you'd buy an album you'd buy it And then you'd like, you'd sort of scan through it and there'd be like this really slow thing. I think, oh, that's horrible. And then like years later, you kind of go back over the go. Oh my God, that's amazing. Yeah. And like Bobby Vittariti, who played at the Trocadero Transfer, who's become a friend of ours and he lives in New York now. And like, sometimes he'll play me a sleaze track and it's, it's almost like It's just a set of end of the night records one after the other. It's just that's kind of really what it is. So talking about some of your guests at Horsemeat Disco, you know, you've had so many. Just you two personally, what would be a favourite if you had to pick one right now? I mean, I always love it when Daniele Baldelli plays. He's one of my favourite DJs and we've had him about three or four times and we've been on the bill with He's just so unique and so interesting. And, you know, he's sort of the only person who can play a night of music I've never heard, but yet it's still be really kind of engaging and really exciting. And then for months afterwards, I'm like hunting down those records, you know, based on the fact, because he plays things in the wrong speed, based on the fact that there's a snippet where I know what the word was. And it's amazing the internet, you know, even that much can I liked it when Bobby played because that's like, he's a bit of history, gay disco history. And I also really like Prince Thomas, actually. I always love what he plays. We haven't had him down for a while, but in the early days, he used to play quite regularly. And he does a good set and often finishes it nice and slowly. And he's not afraid to play something commercial as well. He's not just someone who's going to play everything underground that no one's heard of. He checks the dance floor and keeps it going. So I like him. And also Thomas used to DJ in a gay club. So he gets it pretty more than most other people. I mean, the one thing that's always... makes me laugh is how nervous people get when they come and play at the club like it's kind of it's quite endearing it's pretty I mean it's amazing that all these kind of grand dams of the DJ scene suddenly like sort of become quivering wrecks like five minutes before they're going on and you know it's nice that we can have that kind of effect on people but most of the time they don't have to worry and that's amazing you know for a gig which is essentially in a pub you know these people that are used to playing in front of thousands of people exactly yeah but I mean our crowd can be quite you know if they don't like it they'll let you know if they don't like it they'll go out in the garden and have Is there sometimes a very quick reaction to someone they don't like? Is it a crowd that will give someone a chance? Generally, but yeah, if you don't play Donna Summer within the first five records, then you're probably going to get murdered. It depends what kind of night it is, to be honest. On a bank holiday, you can pretty much get away with anything because it's packed and everyone is just really up for it. And the dance floor is like, you know, because there's nowhere else to really move. if it's kind of a slower night and you know after 11 years you know there are some sort of um slightly slower nights and that that's kind of when the crowd just probably want to hear the classics and things if you happen to have a guest on it that you know is a kind of coincidence then it can be really hard it can be really difficult for them but we i've never you know i've never felt the need to have to jump on and sort of rescue someone Just like sort of watch them squirm, really. But no one's ever really felt that badly, have they? No, actually, the crowd, they usually go with it. You know, you might get a few people that complain to Omar and Simon on the door because they haven't heard all the records that they are used to hearing. But usually people just go with it by midnight. They're all dancing. One set that I did want to mention, and it still talks about on... disco forums I don't know listeners out there will probably think you know what nerds there is such a thing but Mark Seven's set you know was seemed to be oh the Salute to the Men of Voxel yeah that was awesome that was like a three hour and that had quite a lot of sleaze at the end of it morning music because he's kind of another really great sort of researcher of of sleaze and stuff so yeah that was great I remember a whole summer I think I listened to nothing but that mix and you know depending on what mood I was it was usually the last CD which was my favourite which had things like that Nicolette Larson and that was quite fun trying to hunt down all those because at the time I didn't know any of those records and then kind of saw bit by bit you start to find them and that was yeah that was quite a fun summer So you guys are obviously both crate diggers. You just sometimes get people along whose record collection you like more or less than with the case of someone like Mark Seven or... Yeah, I guess so. I mean, people that we know who are into it and maybe they've been into it for a long time. Like Felix, for instance, he's always got great music, hasn't he? So whenever he's done it, Felix Dickinson, he's always got some nice surprises up his sleeve. Yeah, and we booked someone. We met at McLastenbury last year. This guy called Greg Belson. He's from LA. And he basically just like a lot of sets of gospel, sort of gospel disco music. So we booked him. Not quite sure how that's... going to go down but I mean it was the best set that I heard at Glastonbury last year so if he can recreate that I'm sure it'll go down well but yeah you know I mean we've we've had a lot of sort of DJs who've sort of who are big names and some ones that aren't so sort of big but you know I think it's just really important to have people like that come and play because you know not only does it keep the club fresh but it kind of also turns us onto a lot of new music and stuff and i think if you don't have that then you can get quite stayed and not you know you don't want to go out digging and stuff you get quite reliant on your own record collection but it's always great to have people to like you know turn you on to music and to be fair one of the first places I ever heard about horse meat disco was through a dj who'd played there talking about it so it was that a big factor in the success of it spreading I mean I think that's the only reason why it kind of spread so much because I mean especially you know you've got a lot of djs who love disco and they tend to be mostly straight and it's a kind of fantasy of theirs to have played in a gay disco at some point And this is their chance to kind of do it. So they come, they have an amazing time. time and they go away and they spread the new you know they spread the word and tell other people how you know how amazing and how such a great time they had and the reaction that they got from the crowd and stuff so yeah you know it's um it's definitely been i think at the beginning how the the word sort of spread and how our name kind of got out there because we weren't releasing any music and we still don't really release that much music so it really is word of mouth based on you know how much fun people have at Daniel Wang's sets at the club have been something of legendary and he's been one of your biggest advocators, you know, online and all over. How did you first meet Daniel? I met Daniel when I was working at Newphonic and I think, I don't know if he ever put anything out on Newphonic, but he was definitely kind of part of that kind of world, that sort of like new disco sort of thing and the kind of... early 2000s late 90s early 2000s i guess it was um and i remember he came in and we really bonded really quickly on the fact that both of us speak several languages we're both linguists and and yeah i mean like danny's instantly lovable and you can't you just you know you just want to be his friend you just want to hang out with him as much as you could That's what it was. And that's where our friendship kind of grew from. Yeah, I mean, Danny is a total disco nerd, isn't he? And he's a sound nerd as well. And yeah, he's got a real passion. And his interest in music is sort of, it runs much deeper than just, you know, he's really interested in how music is made. and the music of the 70s. And he's a super, like, interesting person, really bright, really intelligent. And also he always has been a sort of champion of like, don't just fantasize about clubs that you never went to, make your own club. So that's why I think he has always really liked what we do, because it's like, well, we're doing it. We just, we just made a, you know, we just happened to. do it I mean there's no formula you just have to have fun and invite your friends and that's what he always says it's like don't just obsess about getting every record that was ever played at the garage or whatever or the loft just go out and have fun and play some records you know and so that's why I think he loves coming to play and also he's he's turned us on to a lot of records as well hasn't he he always has some surprises up his sleeve and he's like a little I don't know he a disco wizard that always has something disco fairy exactly Was there a real point when you noticed, hang on, disco's getting really popular now? Because in course of the time that you've been doing this, you know, disco's almost gone from a dirty word in club music to something which is in every bar up and down the country. Yeah, I mean, there definitely was a moment when I noticed. I guess it's when we were getting quite a lot of sort of press attention and things. I guess it really kind of started happening around the time of Hercules and Love Affair's first album. I think that was when everyone started to kind of catch on to it. I mean, I remember actually quite soon after we started Horse Meat Disco, there was like the kind of things to look out for next year. And, you know, they were sort of talking about disco and things. So it's really weird. I'm not sure if we were really that instrumental in kind of starting it. Because in my sort of opinion a lot of the clubs were playing disco and it wasn't that different you know few and far between but a lot of the djs i knew people like um the idgit boys a lot of people who were sort of working from new phonic and stuff would always be playing disco or i see derrick made always drop some sylvester if he was playing so you know it wasn't sort of unheard of but but weirdly enough on the gay scene i guess it's just kind of there wasn't really any apart from i don't know cheesy jukebox in some sort of spit and sawdust bar or something like that but yeah and of course you know the success of not just disco but the party itself has allowed you to go on to do residencies in berlin and there's been like especially the parties at tape they sounded fantastic can you describe what they were all about uh i mean they were amazing i mean tape was such a great club and the guys who run tape actually uh yoni and uli which tape's not around anymore but They really became our Berlin family and we wouldn't really consider doing anything there without them. And I think Uli's about to give birth very, very soon. So she's listening to this and she's giving birth. Well done, girl. Yeah, Tate was a really special club because it was a sort of destination club. in Berlin and also when we started doing our night there wasn't that many places that weren't playing techno or people thought of Berlin as being a sort of techno place and yeah some it just suddenly became people people showed up every month and we still do it every two months at another venue called the Prince Charles and it's still really busy and full of fine, Berlin's finest gay boys. Yeah, it was strange. I remember playing in Berlin, you know, well before we started doing our residency and like no one wanted to, no one gave me the time of day for playing discos. I was too black apparently. Danny actually that's what Danny said to me it's like oh you were too black you were giving them too much Ashford and Simpson but I guess that kind of whole sort of minimal thing probably just got a bit saturated after a while and people just wanted something a little bit different I think that's the thing with Berlin it's a very nihilistic city and the music has always been quite nihilistic whether it's been sort of like post-industrial or you know techno it's always been quite sort of heavy and I guess some people just want something a bit more I don't know something a bit lighter and yeah I think once we've you know from the first time I played in Berlin where it went down like a lead balloon to when we first did like the first couple of parties that would become a residency it was quite amazing how things suddenly changed and, and how, how long, you know, we've been doing it five years now, haven't we? So, you know, it's quite amazing that we've managed to kind of, you know, maintain that for five years and it's still be absolutely packed every time we do it. So basically it's just. a lot of fortuitous timing as well as anything else. Yeah, exactly. Well, I think that's pretty much the kind of overriding factor in everything we've done. It's kind of the right place at the right time. You know, obviously we've put everything, our heart and souls into it. But I think at the end of the day, a lot of it was down to a lot of luck. And so that's why I touched wood. Everywhere I go. And it's really interesting for me, you know, how, you know, your message is pretty much spread around the world. You know, the guys... honey sound system say they're directly inspired by you guys that must be a pretty edifying thought to think that you've actually inspired a lot of parties around the world as well yeah i'll be able to die knowing that i've left my mark on this world and therefore be very happy about it but no it's you know obviously it's great to hear people sort of like quote us i never really quite know how to sort of react when people start sort of blowing smoke up your bum but um it's quite a nice feeling you love it i think the most amazing thing for me actually i would have to say is djing in new york because we play there about four or five times a year whenever there's a holiday on a monday we do a horse me disco party that's promoted by josh wood in new york either cielo or output And that to me is the most incredible thing about the whole Horsemeat Disco story because it's like New York to me is the mothership of disco. It's like where it all began. It's where it comes from. So being able to play there and have a crowd that really love it. you know it's just an absolute honor really is and not only that to have like djs kind of come in the booth like um danny cribbit ted patterson people like this and kind of say oh it's amazing you know it does feel a little bit like kind of selling snow to eskimos i think in the beginning we're so nervous because it's like god you know how are we gonna get this over but i think for a long time sort of new york club land was pretty much decimated so actually you know that sort of like period of the 90s where giuliani was empowered and kind of really killed nightlife in new york it was just on the kind of the the recovery out of that so it kind of just uh again sort of right place at the right time and you know it was like a good 10 years where there really wasn't much happening in new york underground clubland and yeah right time right place let's be honest being in New York and getting Danny Kravitz in the booth as a disco DJ it's not getting much better than that right no or any less panicky to be honest I think I was totally shaking and then he asked me for what a track was so I gave him the CD I was like have it it's yours if you like it you can have it so it was nice but it is amazing the amount of love that we get when we go to New York it's quite overwhelming and we always leave kind of really really on a high that you know we can sort of in a way sort of be pioneers in a city where it's all been done before you know it's kind of you know sort of being in you know going to shops and sort of people sort of recognizing you you know i've had that a couple of times like going to new york it's really strange i mean i never believed you know in a million years that that would be the sort of reaction that we got from someone like new york i mean you know as it like luke said it's an honor just to talk about the compilation for a second though It must be quite a challenge to try and distill what is essentially a four or five hour night into a CD. How do you even approach that? You know, we were talking about morning music earlier. High energies are so much into that. I think we just don't really sort of try and condense anything. We just try and do a good mix for an hour. I mean, it's hard. I mean, with the sort of fact that licensing tracks is not easy, especially if you're on an independent label. A lot of those disco records as well, they're owned by majors. So it is hard to sort of pick the stuff that we really, really want. But luckily we're diggers. So we can really sort of dig into the records and find all those sort of independent things. And luckily there's some sort of really great, unknown, sort of rare. independent kind of stuff that we can license it's just a question of like you know really digging in our collections finding those tracks and then trying to kind of create something out of them really if you could license anything you know was it was there some real awesome disco albums that you would have wanted to i mean i think we would have always wanted to maybe um license something but you know i spoke people like donna summer i mean like some of the the tunes that really define the club like was that all it was jean khan lucky Donna Summer, which we actually did an edit of, but we can't put it on because we can't get the licensing. You know, some Sharon Redd, Ashford and Simpson, Chaka Khan, things like that would be great to put on it because, you know, some people might get the idea that a lot of, you know, our sets are just really obscure and stuff. And it's really, you know, that's pretty much the stuff that we can license. It would be really lovely to get our hands on some sort of some licensing catalogs from places like universal or warners or something like that because you know a lot of the disco was quite commercial and you know we're sort of precluded in a way from putting any of that on our compilations which is a real shame but you know we you know we're still really proud of them regardless and if you want to hear those classics you can easily come down any sunday and hear them so can you just briefly run through some general horse meat disco highlights The popper piñata was quite a good one. We did like this kind of Mexican theme party when we were really into doing themes and could be bothered to go out and get decorations and tart the place up a little bit. But yeah, we got a piñata and we thought, what can we put in it? And there were loads of bottles of poppers at the pub because we sell poppers as well. So we just put loads of them and not thinking for a minute that you've got to smash the piñata So we just filled the piñata with poppers and the poppers just smashed everywhere. And I remember our friend Mel, who's quite a demure Chinese girl, to be carried out at one point. It was quite an intense 10 minutes on the dance floor, let's just say that. We had a drag pageant, a ball, a kind of, we called it a vogue ball, but it wasn't really a vogue ball because no one was really voguing. I think two people may be vogued. But that was super fun the first time we did that because we didn't really think anyone would show up or be bothered. And it was absolutely packed, wasn't it? Everyone was waiting. be entertained by and we had categories and that was really insane the first the first couple actually and then we did one elsewhere didn't we and we even had that judge from um strictly as a judge you had a strictly come dancing judge yeah and not not any we had crave revel hallward as one of the judges and that was super fun and super funny and yeah that was a lot of fun. Yeah. The Vogels were great. Cause I remember when we first started doing horse meat, people go, you should do a ball, you should do a ball. Cause I mean, you know, we were all as gay men obsessed with Paris is burning. Well, if you're not obsessed, then you're worthless really. But yeah, so we were kind of, we kind of wanted to kind of pay homage and it really was a homage. It wasn't like kind of trying to kind of imitate it's pretty much hasn't ceased has it really didn't you once do a small festival where you had a lot of that kind of action going the milk oh we did a milk yeah milk in the park that was really nice i was actually just opposite the eagle um mark oakley the owner of the eagle wanted to do something sort of tying around this sort of you know sort of memory of um harvey milk and that's great we had candy statin she came and sang and opened up she got hit by a flying umbrella it was like the calmest day of the year not a cloud in the sky but some sort of freak wind just picked up some bar umbrella and smashed her in the head with it she still went on she's a true professional we had face action play crazy pee us djing i think we had i can't remember the dj but that was a really fun day one of the other things that i've loved that's kind of been part of the horse meat disco journey is the nyc download glastonbury as well that has been an amazing event every year it's kind of like the best club in the world isn't it james so we always go and do that i'm a big big part of that whole vibe and can you just describe what that looks like for people who probably don't know the nyc download is a it's a it's like a film set basically of a new york sort of bombed new york tenement building It has a taxi crashed into the third floor. It has a sort of... apartment that's kind of all bombed out with a bathroom and then you kind of go down this sort of alley and then there's a club which is called the NYC Down Low and it's supposed to be like going back in time going to a sort of club in the East Village in the 70s or something like that and it's an so when you're when you see it it doesn't look like anything else at Glastonbury it's totally the spec and the detail that they put into it it's amazing I mean they even massive advertisement hoarding poster on the side of it and they have like a booth where they sell moustaches because you have to get a moustache to go in and it's got like vintage gay porn in it and stuff like that and then inside when you're in it it's the spec is really high and you feel like you're in a club and it's just an amazing experience so it's been great to be involved in that. Yeah, it's the best club in the world. It's only open for sort of three or four days a year. It's the way it should be and also it means that we can kind of both get our drag fix for the years. Yeah, the drag bag comes out at Glastonbury and it goes back after Glastonbury and it doesn't really come out again but it's, you know, it's great to be part kind of hundreds of people really running, you know, involved in it in some way. And it, you know, for me, and I'm from Glastonbury as well, it's my home, my home village pretty much. So to have something like that and go home and have your sort of, your old babysitter come down and wonder if you're a transsexual these days. And, you know, it's great. I absolutely love it. And actually, I think it's done so much, you know, acceptance of you know gays and transgender people i think is you know from my experience of going back to the country and sort of like talking to people they absolutely love it and you know whereas 10 years ago they would have been very kind of quite homophobic and quite transphobic about it they're actually really positive and you know i really really do believe hand on my heart that the nyc download has done so much for kind of you know acceptance of kind of you know, LGBT people. And we're also lucky enough to have a radio show every Sunday between 1 and 3 p.m., plug, plug, on Rinse FM. And the Rinse FM family have been so open to what we do, which has been a real surprise and a real joy and a pleasure because, you know, originally we just thought it was a sort of dubstep station and they've been really into what we do and really supportive. So it's nice to kind of... have that family as well to do our show and we really love doing it don't we yeah and also it's a way to kind of you know as we sort of said before we're massive record collectors and it's not just sort of like peak time disco it just means it's it's a kind of outlet to play all those kind of songs that we really love that you'd never be able to get away with playing in a club is you just have so much more freedom on the radio than you do in a night club to really kind of share the music that you really love and you know that's it's still a really relevant and great medium radio so it's great to great to have it and you've got a great face for radio as well james so do you dear Ain't gonna wait till two I need your love Rock and touch me You're fucking a mistake Touch me now, you know You're fucking a mistake Touch me now You're fucking a mistake Touch me now, you know Thank you.
