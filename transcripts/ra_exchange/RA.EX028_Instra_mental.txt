Thank you. Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and producers. promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. One of the most exciting developments in drum and bass over the past few years has been the autonomic sound, spearheaded by the duo of instruments. and Exit Records head Deebridge via a hugely influential podcast, they've shown what happens when you half drum and bass's tempo, embraced melody, and generally found more in less. As I talked to Instrumental at the Zoo, their island-bound studio that's so named because of the animals that often walk in, and the centerfolds from the similarly named Lad's Mag that adorn the walls. I found that drum and bass was the last thing on their minds these days. So I guess I want to begin from the beginning because I was reading over the interview we did with you a year ago for the nonplus. label of the month thing and you guys said you met when you were 10 at school was it this early yeah i mean we weren't at school we were just kids running away weren't we um was it in this area yeah london just at the road yeah yeah um dame owned a video shop his mom owned a video shop at the top of the road and uh i'll connect I can't exactly remember where we first met but it was something to do with that because there was an arcade machine in a video shop kids kind of congregated there and uh that's it I guess I don't remember how I met you it's just a long time ago fucking over 20 years and uh was it the bonding was it music, sport, just being kids in the same area. It was music and computer games, really. Music, computer games and film. Yeah, totally. What computer games were you guys? Atari STs, we had Atari STs. I mean, you know, the early consoles. consoles, but we got a... Spectrums, Amstrad, I think all of them. But when we got with the Atari STs, it was just the one. And I remember we used to go to some pirate... That was the ultimate, wasn't it? After all the... Pirate gaming club over the airport. It was a British Airways. It was like people would get together and copy games. We thought it was amazing. My dad used to take us over there and then... Yeah, we just had disc boxes full of 3.5" floppies, didn't we? Back in the day it was all about taking your disc boxes and game swapping with people. We had STs, it was like a little club, an underground circuit. And then we used that very same ST to write our first tunes on, sequencing with Cubase. Which was a nightmare. Yeah, it did well though. Solid. What was the videos that you were watching early on? We watched whatever we wanted from the video shop. We used to sort of like half help out my mum. We'd just like take films and just watch them. We'd go and stay at ours for the weekend. take loads of videos over by VHS and we'll just go on a marathon horror one just watching all the horror films because we were big on horror back then and then maybe slip in a couple of electric blues into secret cases and nick them out of the shop. It was all about electric blue porno series when we were kids. Yeah. I'd stay at his house on a Friday and stay at mine on a Saturday and we'd just sit up watching films. I remember Channel 4 used to be really good back in the day. They'd put a Godzilla film on every week and stuff like that. They used to run some really cool stuff. Yone TV raps. Through the 80s, yeah, Yone TV raps. We really got into hip-hop and we were ordering like there used to be a record store in up the road from us and it's called Rainbow Records and we used to go in there and we used to buy like the source and what was it called? The other hip-hop magazine. I can't remember if we'd see what was going on. and go in there and order the tapes. It'd take about a month to come in, they'd ring up, got your tape, we're like, yeah. Because it was all still underground. Back then, obviously, no internet. Yeah. So we used to just go in, yeah, we used to have to read them, like, things, and then, like, order from, get imports in from the US. But we had loads of cassettes. So the record shop, didn't actually have the records. Okay, the magazine that you could like find out the records. Yeah, yeah. I mean, even the magazines were important, weren't they? You know what I mean? I don't know where we'd get the magazines, but yeah, they were about six quid a go at the time. And yeah, it's just a neutral love of film and music, you know. You just meet someone, your best mate as a kid. We just always sort of like stay friends. No one else shared the same passion like with all the people we grew up with and went to school with. Shared the same passion for music as we did. And it's funny because... We didn't see each other for years when we moved on to secondary school. We saw each other in the playground and stuff, but we didn't hang out. And then after we left school, I'd been DJing. I got my turntables and I was completely obsessed with DJing. And I ended up paying some studio time with someone just to have a go, writing a tune. I can't really remember why, I guess it was just a natural progression. Anyway, a friend of ours lives opposite Dames and I was over there one day and I saw Dame come out and said, "What have you been up to?" And he said, "I've been in the studio." I said, "Yeah, so have I." And then it was kind of like after a few years where we hadn't been hanging out so closely. realised that we both sort of ended up on the same path and then from there it was just like, well why don't we set a studio up, give this a go. And we were like 18, 19. About 18, yeah. About 18. Were you both still listening to hip hop mostly at the same time when you wanted to become a DJ or was it hardcore? Yeah, I mean hip hop stayed with us. for a long time didn't it? Hip hop was always there it's just one of those things that's always ran and sometimes it obviously peaked and certain artists come through but then it was like erm Back then, yeah, I was listening to a lot of like, back in the early 90s, like 91, 92, just hardcore and sort of like techno stuff. It was all kind of fused back then as well, like the whole hardcore techno thing was very fine line, like similar to what it is today. Like genres, people, because of the tempo, everyone was playing all different types of stuff back then. But then it sort of like, I suppose, yeah, progressed into... Jungle. Jungle. Big on Jungle. And we were like, yeah, we're both in our own circles, we're massive on Jungle. And then, yeah, into sort of drum and bass. But the whole time, yeah, listening to Warp stuff as well. A lot of Warp material. growing up. I'm surprised if you were around the same area though you wouldn't run into each other at the record shop or something before that. Oh we used to run into each other all the time it was always good like friends and everything but you know like when you're growing up you have your own little groups of posses and but we used to sort of see each other out and about. Because we were in different years of school, Dame's a year younger than me so. I went to that school a year before. Back then, a year is like... Yeah, exactly. So I had my own friends and always just see Damon talking and all that. But, you know, it was just like you're doing your own thing for a few years. Then ultimately, you know, after we left school, like I said, we ended up, we found out that we were on the same path and that was pretty cool. And then we hooked up. We started going out, hanging out again. My dad got us a load of credit for a load of studio equipment. We originally planned to spend like that 600 quid and we spent six grand. And we were paying him off like 100 pound a week until it was all done. because we were both working doing whatever and we didn't even know how to turn the gear on to be honest we didn't know what we were doing and we ran into Jim from Source Direct in London in a club one night and we all sort of got out of our brains together and we kind of made a friendship with him and then we started working in the studio with him We didn't even know we had a studio, did we? For months, we used to hang out. meet up and like go to clubs and just party and stuff and he didn't even realise we had a studio and then one day I think it was back at his house he took us back to his studio or no no no I said meet us at my house later on um tonight and uh so on and so forth and for whatever reasons and he um yeah he came he came down came down to my mum's and we had a studio there a bit like this a bit smaller in a double garage she'd done it out for us for my 21st birthday and it was sort of like boarded up and we put the gear in there and he walked in he was just like what He didn't know because we hadn't told him. Full out board studio. Yeah, and that's all it was back then, wasn't it? Did you know what you were doing by that point? You said you didn't even... Yeah, yeah, yeah, just a couple of years afterwards. I still didn't know how to use compressors and stuff like that. It was just like twisting knobs. It was still experimental because when you don't know anything about it and we brought so much equipment, it was like... to learn everything. It's insane, so we were just scratching the surface, but we learnt how to use the sampler, the emu and stuff. And obviously, yeah, Cubase and how to route things through, but things like compression, EQ and all that was a little bit touchy back then. Because there was no one else around here who could show us anything. There was no internet, so it was all very... And to this day, no one's shown us how to do anything. trial and error and experimentation really and then we never sold the equipment I mean obviously we've added to it with Surrounded by Machines now we've added to it over the years but What was the first piece of equipment that you guys bought? I mean when you went in this sharp end spree. The first synth we ever bought was this one. Which I don't mind. Yeah, that's the only bit of kit we let off. JP8000 was... That was the first synth we bought and we bought mixing desk and we had like outboard time. we used an EMU ESI 4000 I think it was like originally it had no waveforms on it you had to cut the samples up by numbers and that and buy it about an hour just to do a break or two hours just to cut a break up. You just have to write down all the numbers and then go to the next number. Write the point down where you did the cut. Have you seen that film A Beautiful Mind with Russell Crowe? Do you know that room where he walks in with his numbers? That's what the studio was like. Post-it notes everywhere. It was just like, oh, yeah, it looked like... We upgraded that and we came up with the EMU64 Yeah, which cost us about... Two and a half. Yeah, about two grand. It's fully loaded. Yeah, we were using that for quite a long time, but I mean that was our industry standard by that point. Everyone was on their sample, it was the one to have. A lot of people still use Aqai's. Aqai's got a really great low pass filter on it. It's a 12 bit is it? It's just got a nice warm crunch to the low pass. So it was Akai or Emu, but Emu definitely I'd get up ahead. - Because of the filters? - Yeah. It was awesome, the right filters. - What were the best parties that you were going to with Source Direct? You were going into London proper? - I mean, were there things that were really... - Well, there was always Metal Edge running. They were always at the forefront. Metal Edge... Leisure Lounge and Camden and Bingwalls. And then Café de Paris. Café de Paris, Hoxton. Oh, Blue Note, of course. Went to Blue Note. Was there a particular party that really blew your mind or was it just the entire sort of scene? Back then the whole thing was just a non-stop party. We were completely out of our heads. We were young, just sort of like drunken on drugs for years. You know, it's what you do when you're young though, isn't it? It's a very hazy time. And it all had to sort of come to an end when I had a daughter. I had to sort of slow the party. I've slowed down. We just got a little bit older as well and it was like, yeah. - You've started to slow down. - Yeah. - It came abruptly, didn't it? Everyone started to slow down. - Yeah, you know, certain things change. I think the first, there was a club called AWOL, A Way of Life, which had five residents. It's sort of like a club in London. It started at Paradise Club, went to SW1. And anyway, it was a tape by Randall that I heard. It was just, that was just like a turning point for me. That's what made me buy some turntables and want to take things further. I bumped into you, didn't I? In the Roller Express a couple of times. Yeah, just... Just out of the blue, just... This is the time when we're sort of split up and weren't like... We weren't friends but obviously we'd seen each other. I bumped into him at Roller Express, they used to have tenors and fivers, these gigs. I think a couple of times bumped into you down there, completely out of our heads. Yeah, I remember I still got vague visions of you sitting down by the lockers, like, you know, eating out your brains. Just, "Alright, huh?" This is a messy one. It's just a great, great, great vibe and a great time to be, you know, we grew up through Jungle Hardcore as it evolved. And I was talking to Fawlty DL about it because he's like jungle obsessed. He was just like, Jesus Christ. He said, you were over here, you lot were over there like trying to get your hip hop tapes. And all I wanted to do was get a jungle tape. And he goes, but you, and he was just so leave off like he was asking me all these questions about you know what was it like and the music and It was really weird to sort of, you know, be talking about that because it was just something I'd never really thought about before, you know? And then speaking to someone else on the other side of the pond, the equivalent of what we're doing with hip-hop, it was really exciting for him, so that was really cool. And he was part of a small minority out there who even knew what it was or even gave it down because it was just hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, wasn't it As far as DJing, so you were mostly doing hardcore and jungle? Yeah, it was just jungle. yeah that's all I ever bought. You know I didn't really listen to like techno or that early on we were literally children of the rave generation obviously that little bit younger Acid House and all that Manchester and blah blah blah but we were there for like hardcore jungle. We used to listen to a lot of like There was a lot of techno being played on Green Apple and stuff. Yeah, I know. I guess. It was kind of like a hybrid though, isn't it? It was a 4-4. Techno with breaks, like Detroit influenced and just people with samplers. Classic. So I guess, yeah. Like Trolloc House, like Kevin Saunderson. I've just recently fit that back in my set. Classic tune from back in the day. But that was kind of like another one that was like pure techno call back in. We used to be this pirate radio station called Green Apple which had all the big names and all that. - Green Apple, you know that. - It was such a wicked, yeah, getting your Green Apple tapes, getting your record on. - A little later, Don FM, but Green Apple, it was the one round here, it was the pirate station. I think it was right out of Slough from what I heard. - Yeah, they had some big DJs on that, didn't they? - You know, every Saturday I used to go with my friend Benz and his mum and dad would go to Bingo's. We had the house with all the shipping. draw and go around there and stick green apple on and just sort of like dance around until we're at a rave when we're like 14 years old you know just uh just loving it loving loving it all yeah thinking back you know it's a good good time to be alive good time to be young you know through the rave generation yeah the 90s was definitely it was a lot of fun good for you what's the The first tracks that you guys were creating, I'm assuming, you were... it was all also Jungle, Jungle and Bass. Was Source direct like... helpful in doing the production stuff and showing you around a little bit? He was on the first tunes that we wrote. He engineered them and we just sort of took some sounds out from our studio. We all sort of chipped in but he ultimately engineered them. But then, you know, it's not like we didn't learn a great deal. Just pick little bits and bobs up. You know, just how people do things or how people, you know, it's not just necessarily about techniques. It's just picking little bits and bobs out of how people work, you know, like the process of it. Just pick things like that up along the way. But yeah, he engineered the first tunes and I think we got on well because we realised that we're all very, sort of like, thoughts. similar things about music as well. He was breaking up with his partner as source director at the time, that was all going on. So I think it was nice for him to have a couple of other people around who he got along with and could sort of relate to on a musical level. As far as your first productions, where do you feel like that slotted in within the scene at the time? Was it more...? It was basically... because Jim, who was obviously source director, was still a firm lover of the Eamon break. And to be honest, the Eamon stuff calmed right down at the time. and there was a lot of the optical spawns where everyone was trying to do mutant bass lines and the two step thing. So obviously Source Directs hadn't paid out anything for a while and then when he came with his collaboration with us, he drew the aim and break and he always had a classic aim and break and it was just massive subs, just a big 808 sub. tear out Eamon and like this so catchy little sample and I think at the time it just so happened to be really good it was sort of cut through because no one was doing that everyone was trying to clone someone else and it made quite a big impact with like all the metalheads crew like Goldie and everyone loved it it was getting hammered yeah much to our surprise it became a really big tune yeah so at the time of making it I don't think personally but both of us weren't that keen on it. But it was one of them ones that grew like after hearing it out in the club and stuff and seeing what you've done it was like yeah it was quite exciting the first time we started to hear it without metalheads. Why weren't you keen on it? Because William Connor Because we also heard the aimer brake so many times. Obviously I grew up listening to hardcore and everything was the aimer brake. When Optical did his thing it was very refreshing for us because we've always been quite forward thinking and we're ready to accept anything new if we like it. It's not like we've never really been stuck in our ways. And yeah, we were just sort of very much into what Optical was doing early on, which was sick. And yeah, we wanted to do some stuff along those lines to kind of leave the brakes alone. And ultimately, it became a big part of what we did as Instrumentl. When we came back in the scene, we wouldn't use any brakes. because they've been rinsed out so badly, I couldn't really listen to them anymore. It's like, how can you do something new with something that's been used thousands of times? So, yeah, but, you know, that was moving on a little further. How much stuff did you do before you got this? Took a break. How many singles? Three on Source Direct. We did Yo Bitch. Snow Blind the Place. Yeah. And Hired Guns. That came out as a test presale. Yeah, I don't think that reached in the end. Came on the other side of something. No, I did something with Jim, like, late on. Really hazy back then. You were having a proper drink at the time, weren't you? Yeah, it's pretty much alcoholic party. Were all of those tracks after the Amen? Not all of them. But Yo Bitch, the big one, had Amen in. Even if you listen back to Snowblind and... You can see the minimalist style of Snowblind and stuff. That's what we were trying to do. Yeah, it's really weird. Stabby bass lines. Yeah, it's quite weird listening back. I heard it the other day. About 12 years ago, yeah, little stabby bass lines, very minimal beats. So I think that's like, because we really sort of kind of took the reins on that. I think we'd said we don't want to use any brakes and that, can we do that? And it makes us go back a long, long time when people were still hammering brakes regardless. It was quite interesting listening back to that. You could sort of hear the seeds of what you were doing. Yeah, yeah. It's a good one, I enjoyed that. It's just cold and dark. So tell me about the brake, I mean, was that... because you had a kid and things were changing and you just weren't sure or was it because you were fed up with the scene? We basically partied out really hard and kind of everyone burnt out. Alex had a kid. I was going through quite a rough patch. So was Jim because obviously when you're that young and we were selling records, a lot of records back then and like know six seven thousand copies or whatever and that is money in the bank I mean when you're that young it's quite easy just to go out partying every night and just like we're basically living in London partying so hard yeah days and days without like hardly any sleep and stuff like that people want to talk to you and you're in the party and people want to talk to you about your music no you're young you're just like buzzing in a way you think you're like a bit of a rock star and that but I know it sounds ridiculous, but you do, you know, when you're young and you're meant to enjoy yourself, so I guess it doesn't sound ridiculous. Kind of all burnt out, though. Alex, yeah, had a kid. Yeah, I had my daughter, and I think, I mean, I had her young, I was about 21, I think that was a very, it wasn't planned, obviously, but I think it was for the best, you know, it really sort of brought it all in. And lived our lives for like six years and I'm still in touch with them. I used to see him all the time. He used to pop around on weekends and so I lived in his house and you know in all honesty the party didn't really slow down that much. I moved in with a few friends and it was constantly going on whatever we were up to. Ultimately, Dame said to me, because we had not sold the studio equipment, I had it set up in a flat. I just lived down the road at a two bedroom flat. purposely got a two bed I think to put the studio in but it was never really used. He used to sit round there and use it more than me and I'd kind of lost interest so I was kind of making a load of money doing other things and you know I was wrapped up chasing girls and you know everything was great. I was just having it. And then But you kind of knew in the back of your mind if you didn't sell the gear that maybe it would come back. Because we still had this massive passion for music. That never went away, regardless. But yeah, yeah. But I mean, Dame pretty much talked me back into doing it. So I remember saying... You know, Dame, I don't know if this is reality, you know. Do you remember I was saying, I said, you know, it's all about making money, you know, blah, blah, blah. But after, you know, I'd made a bit of money and I've lived and met all these girls and, you know, done all that shit. It's just like, you know, what's left? And when you sort of come back down to earth, all I ever enjoyed doing was DJing and messing around on studio equipment. Because I had a little setup back at home, didn't I, at the time? Because all the digital stuff was just coming out. So I bought myself a nice PC at the time. some sort of immune sound card and all that. I took the immune sample back and I had a desk right up at my house and I was basically just experimenting for like the years. I was working and it was like coming back. and sitting on my computer and messing around with all these new digital plug-ins like Reactor and stuff which was really, really, at the time, mind-blowing because of what Reactor could do. And I could hear what all the Watt people were doing and I really wanted to recreate all that glitchiness and stuttery sound. But yeah, that's it when we set it back up at Al's house in the other room. I think I did some really dark, sort of old metalheads type thing that pokes Rico's ears. Yeah, that's right. Rico runs Dark Astral. Because yet again, it was something I was never going to give up on because there's nothing else I want to do, really. I mean, I do other certain things, like quite light sort of design, like visual design and all that. music is the only thing and you know when you're so hell bent on something I remember everyone trying to talk me out of doing the music at one point all my best friends sitting down having like the heart to heart with you know stop chasing the dream they had the interventions with you yeah yeah you need to sort of grow up wouldn't it Everyone do it. You need to grow up and get yourself a job. But I'm a real stubborn bastard. I'm really stubborn. And I don't listen to people. And I don't like being told what to do either. I think that had a small sort of... Played a small part in why I wanted to... Prove these people wrong, you know? How does that manifest itself in the studio of both of you? We're stubborn bastards. This is why you have sort of... Oh, we know now. Well, yeah, no, yes and no, but we know each other so well. Yeah, you know when you throw up someone, you know someone sort of inside out, so you kind of know what's going to work. You both know what you like, so, you know, compromises can be made in the studio because you think, OK, we're both going to like this, we're both going down this path sort of thing and do the stuff that you wouldn't normally compromise doing in the studio. So you can go off on a bit of a tangent and do something a bit weird. So when we're in the studio, we know what we both like and what works. Yeah, and it's quite bizarre listening to his solo stuff and Dane might have had it the same with mine. It's like, you hear parts of yourself in it. Yeah. Because we've been a unit for so long. It's... that's quite strange but cool at the same time it's like it's something we're both sort of like still sort of getting used to I guess and yeah it's good though it's fun it's really interesting listening to if you listen to both of the Bodica and the John Convict stuff you can hear instrumental kind of what makes up the sound in a really weird way so yeah it's pretty interesting and I think that become more apparent to everyone as more stuff comes out. When you did the first thing with the Pricked Ears of Rico, was that the first thing that you had done in a while? It was the first because obviously back then it got to a point of finishing tracks, just sketches, nothing could ever get finished. And then this one track... I sat down and made it in his spare room. I think you were out and about doing things and give me a key or something. Basically go in and just sit in the spare room. Yeah, I just done this thing. It sounded pretty much finished in my ears. It was like it needed some bits and pieces. I was like, it's actually, I think I finished a tune. Sent it to Rico and he just loves real dark sort of, he loves that early metalhead sound and all that. And it had sort of like, it was very source direct influence. And he was just like, that's really good. You need to sort of like do some more stuff. When we decided to sort of really go back in, we got this place sorted for a neutral friend. And he put a bit of money in. Got to shout Jay out on that because without him this wouldn't have happened really. Well, it wouldn't, period. He was going to come in and do some work with us, you know, with Set Shirt, because he always loved music and it's quite handy on a keyboard and stuff. But he kind of lost interest. It wasn't really for him at the end of the day. So, you know, we kept it on and we kept paying. rent and combine equipment and we sat in here and this is where the rebirth of Instrumentl was like right here on this island and we've sat in here for many hours many late nights just in session you know and it's just that it's an amazing feeling when you first you do these first tunes and stuff because it's like you're just here you know you're just in this little room and then as soon as you start sending the music out and you hear DJs playing it all over the world and stuff like that just from this little room, I mean that's just highly addictive. One of the first really exciting tunes we did in here was Comanche - Naked Zoo. Yeah, yeah. And the first time hearing them on the radio and stuff, it was really exciting. I think we were tuning in, listening. It was such a buzz. I sent Naked Zoo, Naked... Was that it called? Naked Zoo. It's called that because we called the studio The Zoo because of all the animals that used to come to the door. There'd be squirrels, ducks, dogs. - Nice rats. So it's like it's a fucking zoo. - We've had ducks come in the zoo. - We feed them in here, ducks. - They used to sleep on the doorstep, there was three of them. They used to come back every year. - Little family. - And when you used to open the door, they'd be sleeping on the mat. And they'd sort of get up, start quacking, and come in and start eating bread inside this part of the studio. - So yeah, we And soon because of all the magazines that are everywhere. Yeah, Naked is it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Send that tune to... I understand the naked part. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Hence all the chants. Send it to DJ Lee, old friend from Source Direct Days. And he was like, my God, this tune's amazing. I was like, is it? And he was like, can I send this to Marcus? Sent it to Marcus and he was like, I want to sign it and put it on the compilation. We were just like, is this really happening? This is crazy. And everyone really liked that tune and it was just, once again, no break. It's very minimal. Detroit-esque, just... Were you listening to much of the stuff that was going on on the label at that time? Nah. Right? Well, there was... So there was no... You weren't actively writing things against what was going on at the time. You were just... Actively writing things that were... Our roots were in drum and bass. Yeah. And we decided to sort of stick with that. It was going way too fast. We said, we'll work at 170 BPM. It was completely random, you know. So let's work at 170 BPM then. And we won't use brakes. And we just do whatever. And that's... how everything came about basically. And the Naked Zoo thing just sort of like, let's say, just gathered momentum and it pricked up people's ears. I guess it, because it was just so different. We were going around to Reef as well for listening sessions and we were listening to a lot of dubstep, like the early, early dubstep. And he was playing us this stuff and it sounded like sort of like what drum and bass was. Toasty and Luke Envoy and that. Yeah. because they were doing something like, I don't know, break step or whatever, but all that stuff, dubstep and the breaks and stuff, sounded like old jungle and stuff. And that was like, influenced to for us to slow it down as well, and then just use drum machines. I think we added like, we were doing glitchy hats, because we had a couple of plug-ins in Reaktor. a couple of plugins I wrote in Reaktor as well, just to do glitch and grain effects. And because people weren't using, over abusing the glitch, glitchy edits and stuff in John Bass, all up dubstep. because that was another thing I used to love about all the old tech and all that stuff, the warp stuff. So we incorporated glitches, so if you listen to Comanche, it's like glitching out the drums and all that and stuttering things up. Bye. And we used the V-Synth for the stuff as well. You can put your own beats in the V-Synth. It's got like a touch pad that you can assign different modulations to. We were filtering and glitching beats on the V-Synth, which was quite fun. We heard Doc Scott was at Sun and Bass and he had Comanche. We ran it about three times and people said it was the tune of the festival. you know, what was that tune and blah blah blah and then just sit it on the plate, didn't he, for like a good... year and a half, two years before it even came out. And, you know, people, same story, once a big DJ plays your tune, everyone wants to play it. It just sort of went from there. And it was just, that's all the incentive you need to keep going and inspiration is just to know that people are playing your music and they love it. I mean, that's... ultimately why me personally I do it. Certain people like Drexia and War Packs just completely changed my life musically. all the money and the lifestyle that comes with this is cool but ultimately it's just about leaving a bit of a legacy and making like people's lives that little bit more that little bit better you know just sort of like you know what it's like when you hear a piece of music you love you never forget the first time you heard it the time the place nostalgic feelings you get say 10 years on and to think that people do that with our music is just you know that's a beautiful thing But it's interesting that, you know, even though people are having those experiences, that you're not at all trying to replicate that. Like, you listen to the new album and it's completely different than the autonomic stuff. We don't try and do anything. We just write. Yeah, I think it just boils down to, like, points in time where we're at musically. And, you know, we didn't say, oh, we're going to write something that's quite cold. very different to Autonomic. We just sort of come in and we've just started writing at different tempos. Because we've always been doing slow tempo stuff like the Apple Pips thing we had like that was 141 so the other one was like an Electro thing which was like 120 something. And we just came in and started writing and it just so happened that it started to form like we brought a few new toys for the studio and it started to come out very quite sort of stark. dystopian, like, metallic robot sort of music. But we love that, you know? We love, we love, we can't say we love it all, we love everything, you know, basically, musically. It's like, you know, soul, darkness, just whatever it is, you know, there's always something good in it. So, it's like, it's really hard to talk about or explain. Once you get in a vibe, you get in a place. just sort of run with it and that's what I figured. You start thinking about things too much, it slows everything up. I'm kind of in one of those stages right now where I don't quite know what to do. to write because I'm thinking about things too much. It's all about vibing, you know. You get a vibe. Sit down here so many times and you're like, right, I'm going to do this sort of tune today. And I end up going off on a massive tangent and writing the tune. Nothing like I set out to write. And it's just that you grab a vibe and you go with whatever direction. You mentioned Dee Bridge, and you were saying that he was one of the few drum and bass guys that you were listening to back when you first began again, it was sensible. Was it that he was playing a little bit slower, and it was a little bit less focused on the dance floor? Yeah, it just wasn't as busy, it was just some nice... sort of rollers and you know because i mean it was so silly by this point but drum and bass it was just i couldn't even listen to it i guess that just it's getting a bit older and we've got such a musical knowledge it's sort of like just weren't working for us and darren Definitely doing something against the grain. Yeah, that bit more interesting. It was stripped back, it was sensible. It wasn't noisy, rowdy, kids music. It was just like, this is really nice. I think it was a mix, he was back to back with comics, was he? Yeah, and also we heard him out, didn't we? Somewhere, we went out and we heard him play something. He played that solo a bit. Yeah. With the fractured sort of beat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. really good at it, it was really minimal, it was like just this little beat panel and it wasn't filled up with breaks, it was like this is really interesting, I know he was definitely doing something interesting. The first thing collaboratively that you did, the track on his album? Yeah, yeah that's right. Blush Response wasn't it? Blush Response, it was done over like about a year wasn't it? Thank you. Yeah, and do you know what? We didn't even have the final mix, the day was mastering and he said please I want that churn for my album so much, please can you do this? And I remember we came down here and we did it and I usually like to record about 10 versions of a track, like, and I'm listening to them all, you know, get it just right, tweaked up nicely and I had to get this, we changed loads of little... parts I think we put a new snare in and everything and he said unheard of for me just to like right record a tune and that's it done and we recorded it and we aimed it to him in the mastering house and he got mastered about an hour later so thankfully it came out alright you know but yeah yeah that was that was quite crazy but Darren was an early supporter of our work How did you guys come up with the idea for the podcast originally? What was the sort of idea behind it? I think it was a case of basically there wasn't a lot of DJs or radio stations playing like a full selection of what we wanted to hear. And there was people like Flight who were supporting on our one extra show and stuff. But did you have to listen to all this drac? No, she used to play quite a good section, but at the same time we were really, really picky with what we liked. Yeah, of course. And we were getting some stuff sent to us. I just think we wanted to create a radio or something that people could listen to the sound that we were doing. loads of it because we had loads of material from us and Darren we were getting a few bits sent in from like some other guys that were like listening to our stuff and did you not look into doing like a radio show or something yeah it was just all it was just long though so we just decided it'd be easier just to do a podcast and then we could do it like as we went along it'd be a lot easier it's no sort of like to work whenever but uh yeah just wanted to do like um 12 shows. I think originally we had a track, we were going to call it Autonomic, like this track we were doing, and it sounds really good. If you look up what Autonomic means, it sounds really good. So we've done that, Autonomic Podcast. the whole layer thing come from old anime called Serial Experiments Lane. Each episode was a different layer, layer one, layer two. It's like, yeah, so use that because it sounds quite futuristic. But we all just sat down. It was just an outlet for us to put our music on and get it heard. Like what we were doing, the whole minimal sort of beats and stuff. But yeah, and then to make it a little bit more special, we just thought, yeah, let's do an influences section, just so people know what's influencing what we're making, what we're doing, so people can go back, look at the tunes, and go down the path. When I was younger, I used to take in my... mini disc or whatever, or iPod into someone's house and they have loads of people around them and smoke. You sit there and play loads of tunes that you love and you play these tunes to people and you've got to listen to this and people are like, it sets them off and they're going like, buy the album, whatever. So it's basically another thing like that. just for people that hadn't heard these artists we were listening to they could go back and listen to some great music and discover great music it took a lot it was got a lot of enjoyment out of doing the influences as well yeah it was like uh who could come with a bigger tunes like yeah it was just it was just good though and i think it was to like make the mixes longer as well because we wanted to do a monthly and there wasn't enough of the sound we wanted to push but there was enough to sort of make it work if we did it sort of that way you know what I mean because otherwise you'd just have like half hour sort of podcast you know we wanted to do something a little bit more substantial but once again we hadn't envisioned anything you know sort of like what it would do. When did you realise that it was getting to be quite enormous? Well, the first one got like 10,000 downloads. My mate was running the server and he wasn't expecting that because he only had a small server and the bandwidth was chewed right up and he said I'm going to have to get a bigger server so we got that. Suddenly my mates got in contact and said "Right, we're going to have to buy a professional server" "because they've kicked me off and shut down his account" "because of the bandwidth and what you've used" And he's done like, because he's really intricate with James, and he's done like spreadsheets about how many people, individual hits we were getting and individual IP addresses and had all these things printed out for us. It turns out by number four or something, we were getting 60,000 downloads a month. I was like, holy shit, okay, this is quite serious. From what started off as just a little outlet to play tunes with, it was like, okay, this is really good. It made sure it was all up on iTunes and all that running by then. We got a bigger server that we pay monthly for. And yeah, it just kept going up. I think we crashed another one as well, didn't we? Yeah, we crashed another one. Yeah, we crashed the copper servers and we had to pay a really expensive server, like all this bandwidth. Because there were so many people downloading. Because by the time we got up to, say, eight, for instance, people were downloading all the back ones as well. So there was a lot of traffic. But yeah, we give up looking to see how many hits we're getting towards the end because it was ridiculous. We're getting serious downloads a month. And then by the end of that though, it dried up quite a lot. So we didn't do the last two for ages because we got so busy because we've done the Fabric CD. And we got so busy working off the back of the Fabric CD as well that we couldn't really do any podcasts. We didn't have the material. And rather than just stick things together, because it had been such a solid series up until that point, rather than just stick things on there for the sake of it to make up a podcast we thought we'd rather just hold back, wait for some really good material to come around again and then complete the podcasts which we've completed last year I think. It took about a year to complete the last two but it was worth it and that's it. We finished it as 12 so there's like 12 podcasts. At what point did Club Autonomic come into it? That's like six months after the podcast started. Well, at the same time, at the time we started the podcast, like we thought that we were always going to do a club off the back of it as well, because a club to play. We sat down and we all talked about it. We said we need outlets for our music. Basically, we need a club, you know, like people could go to get that sound. Was there an actual meeting at some point where you sat down in a room and were like, here's the plan? Well, we just didn't hear it. Just didn't hear it. Because Darren used to come down and we all used to work. And it was just like, we need outlets for people to hear this music, for it to be and we brought the domain clubautonomic and that's where the podcast came off of that because we always knew there was going to be a clubautonomic and when we done the Fabric CD, clubautonomic came off the back of that and we were doing the clubautonomic first weren't we? I can't even remember. Did it start at Fabric though? Were those the first gigs that you played as part of that sort of banner? Yeah, yeah, Fabric was the first one to get on it. Did we start the club first or did we do the mix first with Fabric? What do you mean? Did we start doing Club Autonomic first or did we do the mix first and then do the Club Autonomic off the back of the mix? Pretty sure we'd done the club first, so we'd seen how busy it got. It was only one night or something we'd done so far. Yeah, but it was gathering such momentum, the whole thing that we were doing. That's why we ended up doing the 50th mix for it, which was cool. I'm kind of interested in the club aspect. I've never seen you guys play at Fabric. Obviously from what the sound of the podcast is very mellow for the most part very laid-back is that what it sounds like in room 3? When you play there? Not anymore. I mean things have changed things have changed a lot. I mean ultimately the Autonomic Podcast was meant to be about electronic music. And it is, you know, I say meant, it is. It just so happened that what we did at 170 had sort of like, had such an impact and really sort of blown up. podcast ended up being associated with 170 sure drum and bass sort of minimalism or whatever i think with non-plus obviously it's you can tell that it is electronic yeah exactly and i mean this this is this one trying to say it's like say branching out it was never meant to be that way but we sort of just rode that wave you know it was like okay they're all different they're to the podcast like slower tempo yeah with like the stuff because we were doing so tempo stuff that we wanted to people to hear as well but uh so ultimately yeah it just because the 170 became so big that's what the podcast became mainly associated with which obviously you know we've got a lot of work from it and everything's cool but i was never like massively happy about that it was like i needed you know that's why early on there was like a slower slower one as well because it was like it wasn't meant to be just about this um but it's all good because you know the way the way i see it now autonomic sort of light is like the umbrella over non plus exit the Autonomic Record label. It was always meant to be like a brand but the thing is I think where it all got a bit pear-shaped is people started to call the music we were doing like silly names. We called it Dark Lounge and like Minimal Step and all this crap and it was just like what we'd done then we just tagged it and said look it's Autonomic. of what we're doing and we just gave it like that was an easy enough description for people to say oh it's all on it well and i think looking back on it the influence section of the podcast is actually really important facing the people that it isn't just this. - Exactly, yeah, there's that as well. - And there are all these things coming into the form of what you're doing. - Yeah, it was just sort of like, it was our thing to do what we wanted to do, and that's it ultimately. So getting back to your original question of what's the room like, we go to Fabric and we play whatever we want. I mean, originally we were like, we were playing stuff people wanted to hear off the so on and so forth but it's like now I mean we're in a completely different place now anyway So instrumental work just kind of got known for like, you don't know what you're going to get when we go out and play. And we ended up like... So you know what you're going to play? Yeah, I know, yeah. I know what I'm going to play, but I think... Are you finding it easier and easier over time? Because I know you're sometimes getting billed at like Substance. Berlin which is a dubstep party you're getting builded drum and bass parties Maybe other places are house techno things like is it are people Seeming to get it more and more. Oh, yeah, it always the case. No, no, I mean we were playing drum and bass kicks last year stepping up on the drum and basically doing an electro set and that. It was getting crazy last year and we ended up not being so busy at the end of the year because in our minds for the last 12 months we've been writing different music and we were somewhere else. In the public's eyes we're still what we were when they knew us from Autonomic. 170. Well they only know what you're working on. It takes a minute for you to realise that as well. When you're writing you just get so wrapped up in it. I don't really think about much else. We were just doing crazy drum and bass gigs, doing crazy sets and so on and so forth. That just wasn't working out. But right now the UK bass is melting pot. I just think is so, so cool. So much music. And because we're playing at 128 up to 135 on some occasions, I mean, I'll pitch up and down in my sets. With that sort of scope, you can reach the house, techno, electro. all the UK based stuff, all the stuff we were writing and I've never had so much fun like writing the album, we wrote the album, writing my new stuff as Bodica, Damon his comeback stuff. It's like do what you want now, you know, it really is, it's like in some ways that can be quite... daunting because I sit down and think you know sky's the limit here. This is crazy you've got no restrictions. We never really thought like that anyway your tempo is the only restriction but I think yeah right now everything's so much more acceptable and sort of people are just so much more open-minded. In Leeds a couple of weeks ago it was like one night in Berlin with Marcel Dettmann and all of the general bar in one room and in the other room it was like me, Scott. and that was like really good and that was like the last set I played was like a really, this is what I was saying, it's got to a point now where we're just playing the music we want to play and it's just like this melting pot of play whatever you want because it's all similar tempos and that like set I managed to fit like Carl Craig, Kevin Sanderson, Allteca, Aphex, Dexter, all into my set. tunes spanning from all different years and they just all blend in just perfect. It's amazing. Yeah, it is amazing to be able to play like things like playing All-Techer in my set. I didn't think I'd ever be able to do and get away with it with the crowd still going like wild. I just heard which you know in Aurel that Aphex Twinders played Block. He played a couple of my tracks in his set and he played a Ramadan Man track in his set. And I mean that's just, you know, that's like, that's a big, big achievement for me. And it's like, it just goes to show it's great that these like electronic sort of gods and like die-hard techno purists are embracing the future. And I mean, I think it speaks volumes as to like how open-minded everyone's getting and sort of like what this melting pot that we're talking about, how sort of vast it is and how much impact everything's had on everyone. I think it's brilliant, absolutely brilliant. The podcast, I really like looking back. because you don't realise what it's doing because we're locked in this little room. You don't realise what things are doing to people out there. It's only what you hear back from certain people, but the podcast really, really made a massive impact on so many people on so many different levels. People have come up to us and openly spoken to us about it, like, love the podcast. It's totally changed my way of writing, like, scuba, loafers, scream. People have come up to us. say like you know it's the most surprising person you said Apex played one of your tracks or someone that you're just like you're listening to this you hear all sorts I mean there was um Pete Tong, he was tweeting on his Twitter that he's listening to instrumental absolutely deep and all this and someone's leaked it. You don't really expect people like that. You don't realise. who your music's getting to unless people tell you so you don't really know. So I'm sure there's people out there listening to it which you wouldn't even expect. It was quite shocking to hear people like Loafer and Scuba totally scream. It really influenced them to start wanting to write and change their writing style. These people are huge in dubstep and all that. big names and then to turn around and say to us like really inspired them really good. I don't know, Dubstep, Kraus, other producers, you feel like... Sorry, we wanted to do what they were doing. We wanted to slow down. And then people like Scuba and other people like you said, they wanted to do what we were doing because it was really fresh and exciting to them. It's like, oh, this is crazy, you know? Yeah, like Scream was coming down to the studio and we wanted to write slower stuff and he was just like, I want to write 170. It was just nuts, we can't win it. But with other drum and bass producers, obviously the Exit compilation you have a coherent group of people, but do you find that other groups are... opening up to what you guys are doing and listening to your stuff? Playing your stuff? What I've heard is that lots of people are playing stuff. The new album and stuff on the new album is a lot more accessible because of the tempo of it. I don't know. Everyone sort of... always been behind what we've done but whenever I've met people out and about in clubs it's almost like I don't think there's many pictures of us on the internet we haven't done too many interviews and I don't know the impression I've got is like people I also wonder why we didn't get sent tunes and I found out a lot of the time because I've never been happy with my mix downs or this or that you know no no one ever is it's never perfect It's never how you want it, you know. You just have to let go, as they say. And, yeah, I've kind of figured that people wouldn't send us tunes because they didn't think they sounded good enough. You know, it's like, what are you on about? You know, it's like, why don't you send me tunes I need at that place? And it's just like, so many producers are hung up on, like, their production sound, you know. It's like... And it's like, I know what I mean. If I'm sending tunes to someone, I think it's got a real tight sound in this. You sort of send the tune and send a little explanation about it. You know, it's like, yeah, you could do with this, you could do with that. So I just... You're also seeking for someone from... Yeah, exactly. I just kind of figured that people thought we were a little bit unapproachable. I don't know where we got that from. I was talking to Joy Orbison the other day. We were doing some work, Pete. And he said, really weird for him to hear him say this. He said they were listening to the Autonomic podcast when they started hearing his friends. And he said, and they were just like, they were just so magical. He said, we used to be driving around in a car or we're doing this. And he said, we used to listen to him. We used to sit there and say, he said, because it was all very faceless, you know, there wasn't pictures of you anywhere. I don't know if it was purposeful, it was just how it was, I guess. And he said, you sit there and he said, you know, I wonder what they're doing now. I wonder if they're doing the next one now, this, that, that. And I was just like, it's just nuts, you know. You're just like, it's But it's really interesting to hear him say that because it gives you an insight into what is going on into other people's minds and what their perceptions are of what's going on and this and that. It's funny whenever I hear people talk about anonymous techno producers. It's always half and half. Some people are trying to be anonymous. Other people just... No one bothered to take a picture of them. No one bothered to like... Yeah, yeah, exactly. Interview them. It just worked. They just got lucky and it kind of worked for them. But I think we made it clear that we didn't want to work with many labels. And I think that was another reason why the slightly sort of standoffish approach was with us. And it was for no other reason and we didn't want to spread ourselves thin and, you know, we just want to work with friends. You know, it's as simple as that. So what's coming up for Nonplus? There's Vodka 12 off the sampler, the instrumental album. And then that's going to follow up with the LOL album, which we just think is fantastic music. Looking forward to getting that out. And then we've got Kassim Moss, I spoke to him about two weeks ago. He's going to have an EP finished for us by the end of April, so he said. Another Scream 12. Another Scream 12. Lofa was meant to do us some tunes, but whether that ever materialises, I don't know. I speak to him every day, but I'm always cracking the whip, but we will see. I can write something for long past if I don't have John Convict. Yeah, Dames... Wasn't there supposed to be a Kyle Hall thing at some point? Didn't happen. Kyle, for whatever reasons of his own, pulled out of it. Even though he'd done us a remix and sent us a tune. It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. That was all a bit naughty, really. But, yeah, that's not happening. Zombie at some point this year, he's been sending me tunes again and yeah he's on the case so definitely like to get something from Zombie. What else have we got lined up? I'm trying to think. Joy Orbison's writing this at 12 as well which I'm excited about. Endian. Oh Endian yeah some dusty techno from a new artist that we've sort of discovered. Dusty sort of house techno. There's 12 there. Seems like quite a bit. Yeah, there's quite a bit there, definitely. But it's like... It's coming on non-limited as well. We've got like the Barry Manalog 10-inch coming out. Barry Manalog, yeah. Which is just like a pure analogue workout. And that's coming like limited to 500 or something. So we're not even going to let anyone know when that one's coming out. We're just going to drop that in the shop and just going to go. Do you find that Stuff is selling quite well. I mean, it's all obviously you've talked quite a bit about how it's just electronic music but when you talk to a distributor these days, they want to be able to say it's something and you can't really do that necessarily. Yeah, yeah, I mean the stuff that does sell well, I mean with the first Cassie Moss 12, slight tangent, he was very underground. When I heard him, I was like... Oh man, you know, this guy's music is just incredible. It was very dusty, interesting, do you know what I mean? Not over-polished. Just great, great vibes. And I said to Dame, I want to ask him to do something. And Dame hadn't been listening to his music as heavily as I had. I mean, there was only a handful of stuff anyway, the workshop stuff. but it just really had an impact on me so I sort of made contact with him and asked him if he'd do us a 12 and I didn't know whether he'd do it or not but he did and I saw it as kind of a chance maybe, I took a chance, but I just saw such potential in the geezer and he's really come a long way since the non-plus release, he's just I don't know, his name's just a lot more it's a lot wider spread and I think he's just going to develop and develop and develop I think it was a really great move getting him on board I was really happy to sort of have him on board. He's such a talent. And that's obviously you got in contact. with Low Tech, I assume, through him? - Yeah, yeah, because Low Tech runs Workshop and once again got a lot of respect for Workshop as a whole. Spoke to Jens and yeah, I've seen the Dota 12 as well. I just love their, they've got their own little style going on there, Leipzig, Leipzig, however you pronounce it. It's quite distinctive. Yeah, I was excited to have them both on board. Kind of proud that they're going to be involved with it as well. It also seems like the stuff that they're doing for you is quite a bit different. and stuff but you can still kind of hear it. I didn't want them to do that I made that clear but I think Gunnar Kasim he wanted he felt like he needed to write something for Nonplus and I was like just do you that's all I want but I was massively happy with the 12 at high res he's sort of like about 150 odd BPM. Just so sick. Just the groove man, just doing its thing. And the other side, you know, some slow weird burning house thing. And it's exactly what I wanted. So I really can't wait to see what it comes up with for the EP. Thank you. I genuinely get excited about his music. Big fans. I think that's it. Artists we pull in are friends and we're fans of them. So very honored to sort of like have anyone who does release like Samovac just a big fan. Hazyville. It's just like wow. Guy's on one. Yeah. I kind of see your new album a little bit the same way as his album. Obviously the sound isn't the same. Have you heard the album yet? Like the aesthetic. Have you heard the album yet? Your album. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. Like that tempo is kind of all over the place. And it's just about kind of sketches. Because all the songs are like four and a half, five minutes. I mean, they're all... songs but they're not like long seven minute drawn out things they're just kind of like ideas and then we're done it just depends you know this obviously club club burners on there but if why my mic could track any longer than it needs to be if uh if it doesn't need to be. - Yeah, some things you just listen to it. So you can understand if you're doing like long techno tracks that needed to evolve over a certain time, then obviously it'd be like a lot longer. But I think a lot of these tracks, the structure of them, like they didn't need to be long. They needed to just be like a maximum of five minutes really. And it gave us, obviously, 'cause I think we filled up the CD with like the 12 tracks. Was it 13 tracks? Did we have a hidden track on them? Don't know. I can't remember. But yeah, I think they all just work because there's a few club tracks on there, but even just the more mellow ones, you could have just wrote... I added an extra four minutes onto it and I said, oh, this one's really deep, ease your head, do you know what I mean? Once you're listening to it for eight minutes. But same loop. But seriously, it's like... It's just the whole thing's like a journey. It's another one of those things you've got to listen to start from finish. A lot of people don't listen to albums from start to finish nowadays, which is a shame. I think it'll make a lot more sense if you get in the headphones, listen to it from start to finish and you sort of hear the structure of it and everything has got a running theme throughout the whole album. Yeah, it's very coherent, the sound of it and the vibe of it. It's like, yeah, because we did it all at once. We had tunes from before, you know, that we thought we could use this and that, but... It just didn't fit in. Nah. And that's why we didn't put When I Dip on the CD because it didn't fit with the track listing but we wanted to get it out there because it's doing a lot of damage. So we just put it on the sampler. But as the album runs, I think it's pretty coherent and it's just vibes. And there's a lot of dirty analogue equipment and crazy techniques used on it. which are one-off sounds, hands on us, never gonna make that sound again. Just us, human touch all over it. And it's just like, we're proud of it, man. We're proud of everything we do. - What was the hardest track to finish? - Delta Zone, probably, 'cause it changed, didn't it? That tune changed possibly about four different times, the samples and the beat. I've got like four different versions of that. But it wasn't a case of it being hard to write. It just kept... The whole thing was pretty natural, man. It rolled. It came together pretty quick. It's like, hold on, we've got enough tunes for an album, man. I was very surprised to hear that you were putting out an album so soon because it just seems like you guys have been so productive. What other people are saying. why haven't you done an album two years ago? But I kind of saw people something about the 170 aspect of it and all that, but in all honesty, I kind of saw the Fabric CD last year as like, for us, anyway, the pinnacle of our 170 stuff. After watching you, we couldn't seem to better ourselves and I wasn't about to, neither of us were about to sort of like drop in quality of what we were doing. It has to be as good or if not better than what we've done already. Because otherwise you're just cashing in and we don't work or think like that anyway. That's a shit way to work and think. Watching new was big wasn't it? And for us it was one of them things that, because it was really big in everyone's eyes, they were like, oh, watching new tracks is great, the vocals, the processing is really good. We've never been one just to milk out a sound and rinse it clean out. Which is boring. You need to use the vocal again, you need to do that sort of processing, pitch it up and grain it. And it was like, nah. It sounded wicked on that track and it was different but why keep doing something? Do you know what I mean? And it just waters down the original as well. I don't think it's a conscious decision though, we just move on. But I do think you have rinsed out this idea of creepy watching people. You have voyeur watching you. Oh yeah, we love... There's another song. We love sleazy. We love seedy stuff. Sleazy, seedy stuff. Sleazy, red light, back street, dark, rainy alleys or whatever. City life. It's like city, city nights basically. Massive sort of. between the two of us, we've got this... We're not perverts or anything. - Believe it or not, What You Knew was originally wrote at 1:40 and Darren done vocals. And it wasn't actually even in the way it's been laid out. We chopped it all up and replaced the sections and made it save for different things. You know what, I love that original tune as well, but we lost the arrangement so we just reused the vocals. We've got like a sketch of it somewhere haven't we? We reused the vocals and they just slotted onto like what we were doing one day. oh, oh, that sounds nice. And we'd started watching you about a good six months before we finished it and it needed a big bridge and that was a big section in the middle that sort of came across and then just brought it back in. And once again, it was just very natural. Didn't think about it too much, you know. When things are falling into place, you've just got to ride it, you know. Ride it and make the most of it, make the best of it. I can see you watching me. I can see you watching me.
