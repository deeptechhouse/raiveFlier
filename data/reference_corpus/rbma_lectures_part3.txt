Torsten Schmidt
If you’ve ever had any contact with Red Bull Music Academy, you likely know Torsten Schmidt. One of the founding members of the crew, Tor’s been around since before day one. A longtime music scribe and editor for leading German club/pop culture gazettes Spex and Groove, as well as for selected national newspapers, he’s chewed the fat with Trevor Horn, Melvin Van Peebles, Dr. Bob Moog, Derrick May, Just Blaze, and Moritz von Oswald on the Academy couch over the years, among many others. (He’s still waiting, however, for someone to tell him why Miroslav Klose thought he could run around the pitch for Bayern after being nurtured by his beloved 1. FC Kaiserslautern.) Ask him about Iyengar yoga, his vintage synth collection, white wine, red wine, contemporary novelists, or Scottie Pippen, and you’ll want to buckle up for a long conversation. You’ll be glad you did.

Noel Watson
Noel Watson was one of the first DJs to play house music in the UK, spinning at clubs across London in the ’80s and working in Soho’s fabled Black Market record store. As part of RBMA Weekender Belfast in September 2014, Watson sat down to talk about his pioneering career, Paradise Garage, DJing with the Beastie Boys, and more.
Transcript: Todd Burns Hello. Welcome to the second lecture today at Red Bull Music Academy Weekender in Belfast. I’m very honored to be joined by house-music-and-hip-hop-in-the-UK pioneer Noel Watson. Noel Watson Thank you. Todd Burns I wanted to, I guess, begin in Belfast, because you grew up here for the first 18 years of your life. Noel Watson Yeah, I was born in Belfast and I grew up here. I left Belfast around about 1979 in the summer, just after my 19th birthday. Todd Burns What do you remember about growing up here? Obviously, London is a big part of your life, but I’m wondering before that, what was this city like growing up? Noel Watson I came from a community in east Belfast, a Protestant community that, during the ’70s, because of the Troubles and everything that was happening here, all the different aspects of the war in Northern Ireland, it made growing up in Belfast really interesting, actually, in one respect, because you’re watching what was happening on the 9 O’Clock News at night that was actually occurring in your street or your neighborhood, that you were actually a part of as well. When I was a young boy, I got involved it, because you do, because I was a working-class kid from Belfast, and that was part of my culture and part of my upbringing. Luckily enough, I didn’t partake in that thing very often, or not after I was about 13, 14, because I was only a child then. Once I realized what was going on and what was happening, I realized this has got to stop. This isn’t good at all. It’s detrimental to a lot of things in your life. It was scary in Belfast at times, as well. If you were going out at night in the town center, as Terry said earlier on in his talk, it was absolutely deserted. The streets were deserted, and the people that were hanging around were a little bit dodgy, to say the least. You had to be very careful. I, on the other hand, my mother and father were very liberal thinkers, and my father was a free thinker, and my mom actually became a Jehovah’s Witness. I had a very strange upbringing. It was very odd. My brother and I both worked in a tailoring business in Ann Street in Belfast when we left school, a Catholic family business. My brother would make the suits and the clothes, and I worked downstairs, and I would measure the customers up, and I ran the dress-hire company and blah, blah, blah. At night, we’d go to Bangor, and at the weekends, we’d go to a bar called the Viking, which was in I think Ann Street or one the little streets that runs, I can’t remember the name of it. It was an upstairs bar. On Saturday, we’d all meet there, and we were all Young Americans. We’d already have got into the fashion that was happening in parts of London. Morris and I met this guy who would bring us plastic sandals and Bowie jackets and bits and pieces from London. Then we’re only about 15, 16 at that point, and then basically, we would then travel back and forward to London if we could save up some money and go on shopping trips, and then come back and go out and hang out and party here in Bangor. Todd Burns Fashion was a big part of growing up for you, obviously. You were doing this tailoring business, and you were quite interested in it. Where were you going in London specifically and looking to, store-wise or fashion-wise? Noel Watson To Sex, Malcolm McLaren, Vivian Westwood’s shop Sex. It was still Sex then, actually, just before it became Seditionaries, and Acme Attractions, and Robot. The King’s Road was the place that you would go to then. That’s where all the really cool shops were. You’d maybe go into the west end occasionally, but we lived for going over to the King’s Road. That’s when I eventually went and moved to London, I got a flat in a place Onslow Gardens, which is close to the King’s Road in Kensington, in Chelsea. That was the epicenter then of cool and fashion and punk rock. It was amazing, and really vibrant and an incredible experience, because it was so different to growing up in Belfast. Just seeing all these different types of people and cultures, and the whole aspect of life there was just so amazing. I fell in love with it immediately. I lived on a riverboat over in Richmond on the Thames. That was the first place I stayed in. It was just beautiful and getting up in the morning and traveling into the town center going to King’s Road and things… it was just really good fun, and something completely different for us. Todd Burns When you moved to London, you were looking to get in the music scene. What had you been doing already in Belfast, musically, before then? Noel Watson Morris, my brother, ran a club night in a place, down just outside Bangor, called Crawfordsburn Inn, I think it was called. He put on a little disco there, and we would play indie music and alternative music and things like Kraftwerk and The Slits, and we ran a couple of little nights there. We were just kids. Todd Burns This is the late ’70s? Noel Watson This was about ’77, ’78, yeah. We had a band. We had a house in Hollywood that we all lived in, me Morris, Ruth Priestley, the Stockman brothers, the Priestley brothers, and Harry Binns, who was Tom Binns’ brother, who Tom Binns is now one of the biggest jewelry designers in the world. He lives in LA, and it was through Tom that I met Malcolm McLaren when I went to London. It was all interconnected, and we would put on parties at the houses that we lived in in Shepherd’s Bush and Hammersmith, and things and start to get... That was before we started doing the illegal warehouse parties. Todd Burns In the late ’70s, obviously, you were listening to electronic music like Kraftwerk, but also you were quite into post-punk and industrial things that were coming out too? Noel Watson Yeah. When I was a kid here living in Belfast, you couldn’t really get many independent 7" punk rock or electronic records. I would send off for them, mail order through the NME and things like that. I’d buy singles. I’d buy bands like Pink Military from Liverpool and Wah! Heat and Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire, because the first albums I got into as a boy were Roxy Music – I was a big Roxy Music fan and then I got really into Iggy Pop and David Bowie, especially Low and the [Berlin] trilogy series. Then more ambient work, like by Brian Eno and people like that. Also listening to John Peel and listening to the radio and dub and reggae and we’re hearing black music as well. Todd Burns You’ve mentioned it before as a huge touchstone to you in introducing you to a lot of this stuff… Noel Watson What’s that? Todd Burns This Dub reggae and, I guess, black music in general. Noel Watson Yeah, I mean I just got that one day that you just listen to something and you realize, “My God, this has just touched me some way. This music is incredible. I can’t believe it. I can’t believe how they make this, the rhythm of it is so energetic. It’s so life affirming.” Listening to early Roy Ayers and Stevie Wonder albums, then getting more deeper into black music, it just took over my whole life. Todd Burns Tell me about the first couple of years in London. Obviously, you had some friends you know, Malcolm McLaren, you were getting into a scene I guess. Noel Watson What happened, how that all panned out was basically when Morris and I moved to London together, because he had the tailoring skills, he worked then in a shop in Beak Street called Demob. Demob is an incredibly important shop and aspect of the whole subculture of music and the club scene in London. Next year, a project I’m working on at the moment with a company called Test Pressing. Test Pressing are a very chic and hip kind of organization. It’s a design company, record label, and they’re involved in many aspects of culture in London. Basically –I’m losing my thread here – but it’s kind of Morris worked then for the shop Demob and through Demob, there was a guy called Chris Brick, who ran Demob. He suggested that we put on a club night or a party because so many people were coming to the shop and it was beginning to become like a scene on a Friday night just down at the shop. They had a big room at the back and it was curtained off. Basically, if you’re in the know and you could go in behind the curtain, have a drink, there was drugs. You could smoke and there was coke. There was a recording studio downstairs. All the movers and shakers were coming in and out, and it was this bohemian kind of hip scene. They suggested that they put on a night. The first night, they asked Morris and I would we DJ for them because they knew we had records and we were into hip hop and black music. They said, “Would you play?” and we played. It was at the electric ballroom in Camden and it was rammed. It was really a very successful night. From that, they then decided to start doing regular parties but doing them illegally in warehouses. Todd Burns This was the early ’80s we’re talking about? Noel Watson This is around ’83, ’84. Todd Burns This is right when hip-hop was really starting to become a bigger thing and these records were coming over. How were you getting them? Were they being in shops in London that you could buy? Noel Watson Yeah there was a couple of import shops in London. There was a shop called Groove Records, where we would all go on a Friday afternoon and we would wait for the imports to come in because they would only get so many copies of a certain thing, and you would have all the other DJs in there waiting to buy them as well. You had to be quick and competitive and just get in there at the right time. Things like “Sucker MC’s” by Run-DMC for the first time, on Profile, coming in. All of these early electro and rap records that were just incredible, like “Hip Hop Bee Bop” by Man Parrish and these different records. Todd Burns Was this stuff accepted immediately when you were DJing or was it a little bit of a hard sell to get people behind it? Noel Watson No, the night we played at the Electric Ballroom, they went mad. People loved it. They tore the roof off. The other DJ’s were playing a lot of rare grooves and northern soul, which had been a staple diet of that underground scene at that point. Morris and I just took, we had also decided that we would invest in some equipment. We were still young. We were kids. We thought, “What’s the future? The future is DJing and music…” Then Technics turntables suddenly appeared, and we thought, “We want those.” We bought four turntables, a DMX drum machine, two mixers, reel-to-reel TEAC machines, keyboard, and set up a studio. Todd Burns Was this all through Demob money that you were paying for this? Noel Watson This was through Demob money and I worked. I worked in a vegetarian restaurant in Battersea, and I had income coming in. We were kids. We didn’t drink then much or anything or go out much. We just were obsessed with music. It’s like with practice all the time and practice cutting and scratching and mixing and learning how to use equipment. Todd Burns You were some of the few DJs that were cutting and scratching in that way in the UK at that time, as far as I understand it at least. Noel Watson Yeah. At that point in London, we were probably two of the first white kids to embrace that culture and just really immerse ourselves in it. That’s why we met the likes of Malcolm McLaren and stuff, through Tom Binns. He would come down to our parties at Battle Bridge Road, and I had meetings with Malcolm where he would want me and my brother to take over as A&R people for different labels and things like that, because we were then being asked to remix records and mix compilations. He kind of knew and could see that we were cutting-edge. He would have people like Massive Attack, the whole band, come along to our nights at Battle Bridge and sit on stage behind us and watch us DJ and cut. People like Jazzy B and some of the Clash would be in there. Joe Strummer was in there a lot and Mick Jones and some of the Sex Pistols. Paul Cook used to come. It was like a vibrant crowd. Neneh Cherry did our bar. She was our bar girl, her and Andrea Oliver. I would give them 500 quid on a Friday and they would go down to Acton and get a load of beer and alcohol, set that up on the stage on one side, set the decks up on the other side, fill the whole room with camouflage material and turn out all the lights. Then we would let about four or five hundred kids in there. It was crazy. Todd Burns Battle Bridge Road?
Speaker: Noel Watson Battle Bridge it was called, yeah. Sean Oliver DJed with me and my brother Morris. Sean played the bass for the Slits and Rip Rig & Panic. Basically, he was a dread guy, a dreadlock guy. He died from sickle cell, Sean, because he got ill with sickle cell disease. We were quite wild, and Morris and Sean would go off to Berlin even back in those days and DJ in Berlin and do little one-off parties and I’d hold the bells and bring a guest in to play with me at Battle Bridge. Then one night, we turned up after about six months of it and the police were waiting for us outside. Todd Burns You had been doing this party weekly for about six months? Noel Watson Yeah. Todd Burns It was an abandoned warehouse? Noel Watson It was an abandoned school hall, behind King’s Cross Station, in Battle Bridge Road. That’s what it had wooden floors so there was a great sound in there. We would put the turntables up on cement blocks up on stage and the stage was wooden as well. Hire in a really good sound system, so quality of the sound was really good for that period of time. Morris and I would cut a lot of records up and Nellie Hooper, as I say, and all these people would be there. They just used to sit and watch, and they loved it and it was electric. Todd Burns Then the police showed up one day? Noel Watson Yeah, the police came one day because it was illegal, and they had got wind of thousands of kids turning up at this street behind King’s Cross Station. They sealed the road off, actually cordoned the road off and threatened to arrest anyone who came through the cordon. This had happened to us before. We did a club called the Speakeasy and Substation. Substation was another illegal venue, which was held in another underground basement by the Demob guys. It was also a really incredible event. People like Sade would come there and dance in front of us until 6/7 AM in the morning. There was a lot of things going on there. We had a little bar. We put sawdust all over the floor and the turntables are way up on a little mezzanine. A lot of movers and shakers from London, Don Letts and people like that would all be there on a weekly basis. Don Letts actually shot the “IOU” video for Freeeze there. It was an amazing venue. Once again, we actually got shut down because of Paul Foot from the Daily Mirror and the local residents, they made a complaint. They were waiting on us one night outside with loads of placards and the police suddenly appeared. They chased us actually. We had to run. Todd Burns They chased you? Noel Watson Yeah, the police came after us. They wanted to arrest us. They were vexed that all of this had been going on and they didn’t like our attitude. There was a lot of drugs going on at these clubs as well. At that point in time, in the mid-’80s in London, our biggest problem was heroin dealers. The heroin dealers would usually take over the girl’s toilets and deal from the girl’s toilets. That used to be a slight problem. Speed and heroin was the drug of choice then and a bit of LSD or acid. Then it changed. Todd Burns This was before ecstasy had come to the UK, basically en masse, at the very least? Noel Watson Yeah, this is before E. This is before ecstasy. The ecstasy scene started to happen in London round about 1988, late ’87, ’88. I think a lot of the kids who were coming back from New York or Ibiza had discovered ecstasy and also the house music culture and the Balearic culture that was happening then in Ibiza played a major impact in that. At that point in time, around 1988, Morris had actually gone to live in New York full time at that point. I carried on Delirium with Robin King at Heaven, and then at the Camden Palace. Todd Burns Even before that, though, you were in New York traveling there a bit and seeing the clubs there. What kind of impact did seeing what was going on in New York have on when you came back and what you did subsequently? Noel Watson It had a huge impact. Morris took me to the Paradise Garage and took me to Choice. Choice wouldn’t even open until 6 AM, and you would go in and sit there at these tables in this really bizarre warehouse party. There was no alcohol allowed. It started at 5/6 AM in the morning. I think Roger Sanchez was the resident DJ. I’d never even heard of him then. He would play a lot of dub. He would start usually his sets with Grace Jones and a lot of early post-industrial dub and electronic music and then gradually, it would build into disco and the classic Loft kind of sounds. The place would fill up and everyone would dance, and it was a wild atmosphere. The Garage, as well, was wild. Levan would turn out the lights for maybe 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and you couldn’t see anything. The music would stop, and everybody would just be buzzing around, and it would be weird. Then suddenly, you would hear that boom and that beat and then the lights would gradually go up and the place was just going off the hook. They had a little cinema in there that used to have a curtain just across as well. You couldn’t go into the cinema, if you get my drift, unless you were of a certain… It was very sexual what was going on in there. They did have the big glass bowls of punch on the bars. They were all laced with, I don’t know what they had in them. Todd Burns Something. Noel Watson It was like tripping. You would be tripping after you’d have a couple of cups of this juice. It was early like MDMA and ecstasy. You would lose your bodily functions, but it was brilliant. It was mental. It was scary as fuck, but it was brilliant. Also, listening to Larry Levan play this incredible disco music and the way it was played and the loops. They used reel-to-reel a lot as well, and the edits of things were just incredible. I would go to another club called The World and watch Frankie Knuckles and Larry Levan play there. They would have a lot of stuff on loops as well, just on tape. It would go on all night.
About 6 AM, 5 AM seemed to be the time in New York where it really started to kick, and it really got busy and everybody really started to get into what was happening, because they didn’t drink alcohol. They took drugs. They had energy. The alcohol wouldn’t sap their energy, so they’d be up all night. They’d just be getting going about 5 AM, and these parties would go on for two days. Todd Burns One of the things you said earlier was the Battle Bridge parties, the sound was quite good for that time period. I wonder if you went the Paradise Garage and you heard that sound system you must have thought, “OK, this is actually an amazing sound system. This is how it should be done.” Noel Watson Yeah but, as I say, at that stage, Robin King and I had already taken Delirium to Heaven and we had a Richard Long system installed in Heaven. Todd Burns He’s the same guy who did the Paradise Garage system? Noel Watson Yeah. Basically, the sound system at Heaven that we had at our disposal was incredible. We took the club over every Thursday night. I would bring over DJ’s like Frankie Knuckles for the first time he’d ever been in the UK. We brought Frankie over and he ended up staying with us for two months and becoming resident with me at the club. I learned a lot from Frankie Knuckles, DJing with him. He would give me records and albums of things that were priceless and acapellas by black singers that you could just never get or find anywhere. Also, just the way he played his music and records, like the Isley Brothers “Inside You” parts one and two on the 12" and things like that that – ten minutes of pure disco funk, but he would glide it all smoothly in and mix it all together incredibly well. Just sitting watching him was a great learning curve for me. Todd Burns You were coming from that hip hop DJing style where you were doing quick cuts… Noel Watson Yes. I’d come from the hip hop background because Morris and I had mixed the Electro album series. Hip-hop in the ’80s and mid-’80s, around ‘84, ‘85, ‘86, was the prevailing choice of music that all the kids wanted to hear when they’d come to the big clubs on a Saturday night. We opened Delirium at the Astoria. On our opening night, we had LL Cool J, the Beastie Boys, Whodini and I think Run-DMC all on the same bill.
Speaker: Todd Burns Not exactly house music. Noel Watson No, not at all. Then the following week, I think we had Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers. Then the following, we had DJ Cheese. Then we had Schoolly D and Code Money. We were bringing in people who were making cutting, like Schoolly D had just released “Gucci Time” and “PSK.” We wanted these black American artists to come in and bring them into a bigger, wider audience in the UK. They wanted to play for these crowds too, so it was cool. Todd Burns I wanted to ask about this moment where your own personal tastes and I guess interests moved from hip-hop more strongly to house because I get the sense that if you were playing house to an audience that was knowing you just for the hip hop stuff, it must have been an interesting transition? Noel Watson Yeah, because Morris and I were DJing every Saturday night at the Astoria on Charing Cross Road and it held around two-and-a-half thousand, three thousand people. We would turn away nearly two, three thousand. It was so popular. It was packed. These kids were coming from every part of London. Our crowd then was very mixed. It was I’d say 70-30%, 60-40% black and white. We had a lot of kids who were into the hip hop culture and wanted to hear hip hop and wanted to hear music that was related to that culture. When we changed, Morris had decided that when he’d been to New York and gone to the Garage and he’d come back just with a big parcel of disco and early house. He said, “Look this is it. We have to change. I don’t want to play hip-hop anymore. It’s boring. Also, it’s becoming more violent. I don’t like the aggressive tone of some of the crowd. We’ve got to change this. Clubbing should be a fun experience.” He didn’t particularly like the vibe that was beginning to occur. We decided we needed to change that. Todd Burns What did you think when Morris came back with these house records when you first hear them? Were you immediately falling in love with it? Noel Watson Yeah, I was still into my hip-hop, much more than my brother, but when I started listening to them. Then when you listen to the roots of those records as well, like Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, “Bad Luck,” the 12" of that, and the re-edit of that. It’s just an incredible experience and an incredible feeling to hear that music. I fell in love with it as well, not as quickly as my brother, and not as obsessive as my brother. We left the Astoria eventually, because we had problems with the management. They were complaining about our crowd. They said it was too black and they said that they didn’t spend any money behind the bar, and they wanted them out. We thought, “That’s racist. We don’t like this. We don’t like your stance.” They were gangsters, and basically, we left. At this stage, as a group who were running the club, we went separate. My brother moved to New York and got married in New York and then had a child there and stuff. He never came back really. I stayed in London, and Robin and I took Delirium to Heaven on the Thursday nights. Todd Burns Tell me about the genesis of Delirium and Heaven. Heaven was already a club that existed. You had been there before, and you liked it, right? Noel Watson Yeah, when I discovered Heaven, the first time I went to Heaven was to go see New Order’s first ever gig, after Ian Curtis died. It was their first time playing a gig after his death. I thought, “Wow got to go to this. Where is this club Heaven?” A friend of mine, Ruth, who I lived with in Hollywood who was now in London with us, her and I took a lot of magic mushrooms and acid, and we got on the tube and we went to Heaven. Basically, we were tripping even on the train on the way there but when we got into Heaven, I was just like, “Fuck, this is like unbelievable, this club.” It was just incredible. The Star Bar upstairs was all lit up and it just had this electric vibe about it. The fact that it was a gay club and it reminded me of a New York club. It reminded me of the Garage. It reminded me of that kind of vibe. I thought, “Wow, I’ve got to do something here at this club. This place is incredible.” It was years later, before we moved there and took on a night because when Heaven opened, it was a predominantly gay venue. They wouldn’t do straight nights. That’s why we did the Thursday night, because they wouldn’t give us Friday or Saturday, because they were predominantly gay nights. We said fine. It was a bit of a risk moving from a Saturday to a Thursday, but it worked. As I say, we’d bring in Jellybean Benitez to DJ, Derrick May, Frankie Knuckles, Todd Terry. We had thousands of people coming. Then we’d have people like Danny Rampling and Jenny Rampling, before they’d even started Shoom. People like Andy Weatherall and people like that all sitting on the speakers with their ponchos on, watching us an what we were doing.
We didn’t realize they were discovering the ecstasy and the scene in Ibiza as well. Paul Oakenfold used to come and sit with me in the booth, but he was still kind of hip-hop-orientated. I made sure that the music policy downstairs was strictly house, and the music policy upstairs was hip-hop still so that there was an alternative for both sets of people. We’d have Afrika Bambaataa come and DJ. That was fun because putting Bambaataa in the Star Bar in the club on a Thursday night in London and he was just part of this massive New York hip-hop culture was odd at the time. People were wild and crazy, but they loved it. Todd Burns It must have been a little bit of a culture shock for them, the artists. Noel Watson It was. We put DJ Cash Money up there and he was a hard nut from the Bronx. He was a real tough nut. He was a bit like, “Hey dude, what’s going on here with these dudes in this club?” I’m like, “Look dude, it’s a gay club. We have house music downstairs, hip-hop upstairs. You’re going to be fine. No one’s going to bother you. Just do your thing. Enjoy yourself and have fun. I’ll talk to you later.” Later on, after they’d done their set, and they were amazing. They blew the place apart. He was like, “Wow thank you so much. I love this. It was fantastic.” Bambaataa loved it as well, so it was cool. Todd Burns You mentioned earlier the word “subculture,” and I wanted to come back to that a little bit. Was this subculture at that point? You said you were turning away two to three thousand people. Noel Watson Yeah. I mean I met so many amazing people at that point in my life and I was still only 26, 27 years old. I was a kid, but I was then asked to produce and DJ for independent bands, like Age Of Chance, who I did join and who I mixed a couple of albums with and then I toured with Age of Chance and joined them as an indie rock band and I would scratch and cut. We would go to festivals all over Europe. It was amazing. There were so many amazing things happening. We were getting asked to go to New York City by Comme des Garçons as models and walk in fashion shows. We did a show and one of the models with us was Jean-Michel Basquiat, the artist. Jean-Michel had been a friend of friends of ours in New York. We knew Jean-Michel. Man, he took a serious amount of drugs. Jean would never get up until like 4 PM in the afternoon, and then he’d go to Warhol’s studio and paint. Then we’d all hang out and mix and go out with Malcolm as well in New York and go for dinner and then go to clubs. There was a whole, the subculture – it’s regarded as subculture. Last year I did an exhibition for the ICA gallery in The Mall. It was called Subculture Off-Site. It was celebrating the fact that these things had happened artistically, fashion-wise, music-wise and film-wise in the ’80s had a massive impact on what is happening now in the culture of today in design, film, music and art. It was an incredible exhibition. We had vitrines, where I had the collection of books and artifacts from that period, and old flyers from Delirium. We showed a film of Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys live at Delirium that night, because we had it on film. Also, Neneh Cherry and looking after Run-DMC and driving them around London in Tessa from The Slits’ old Morris Minor car. It’s mad footage. Gregor Muir, who is the director of the ICA said to me, “Noel, this is now archival art and basically you are an archival artist. You should think of this as that thing and we want to carry this forward. We want to do something with this.” That’s why I met the Test Pressing guys, because they were doing the Ibiza Q Exhibition with Too Many DJ’s. We were all at the opening party and they said, “Noel, would you like to be involved and do something and carry this through with us?” I thought, “Yeah, I would.” That’s why, for next year, that’s what I’m working on and that’s what I’ve been doing this year in getting all of these things together, which we’re turning into another film exhibition, book, compilation albums, blah, blah, blah. Todd Burns What is it like to look back on this stuff? I imagine in some sense that, at the time, you probably felt like this is amazing, but did you know exactly how special it might be viewed nowadays? Noel Watson No, I didn’t, not at all. It’s quite amazing what’s happened. I’m so glad that I kept all of these artifacts I have. I’ve got Rick Rubin’s original little card. “Hey, here’s my card,” when I met him in New York with the Beastie Boys and stuff and hung out with them. I ended up DJing with the Beastie Boys at private parties in London and in New York. I’d written a column for i-D magazine at that point. I said, “I want to fly to New York and hang out. They can pay for this and I’ll do blah, blah, blah.” Yeah, cool. It was, sorry… Todd Burns No, it was just kind of… Noel Watson Yes, the thing that has now become… yeah, it’s scary in a way though as well, because you realize it’s 30 years old. It’s 30 years ago. Am I that old? Has this all happened, and where has the time gone? Wow. It is amazing but it’s really cool that it’s regarded in the vein that it is. The exhibition at the ICA, my vitrines were beside Tracy Emin’s vitrine and Gilbert & George and [Michael] Clark, the ballet dancer. Just an incredible group of artists and people and to be regarded and asked to contribute and become an artist alongside people like that is amazing. Todd Burns One of the things that I find very fascinating in all of your talking about names, you’re saying The Slits and then the Beastie Boys and then Rip Rig & Panic, these are all very different sounds that all seems to cohere at that time. All of these people were mixing and talking to one another and creatively vibing off of one another. Was that your sense as well that it was just completely natural for these scenes to be interacting with one another? Noel Watson Yes, it was. I find it really natural and I think so did all the different people involved because the Beasties, when they came to London, we would go hang out at an old pub on Portobello Road, an old Irish pub. The Clash would hang out there too, Strummer and Mick Jones. I took the Beastie Boys to meet the Clash actually. I took them to Mick Jones’s house and we all hung out together. Mick Jones was obsessed by the Beastie Boys and Def Jam. His band, BAD then released a single on Def Jam. Adam and the Beasties, they were really into punk rock remember. They had been originally a punk rock band. They loved the Clash and they loved Madness. I took them to meet Suggs and Chrissy Boy and we’d all hang out together. They loved that London culture as well and that underground thing. Then basically black music at that point as well, the post-industrial stuff that was happening, just seemed it was changing sound-wise and evolving into hip hop and evolving into other different areas of black music. It felt really natural. Todd Burns It seems like house, specifically, was one of the dividing genres. I remember in an interview you did, you talked about the Beastie Boys. They were not very excited about house music in the slightest. Your audience that you talked about, where you were playing hip hop, they were like, “No, this is not…” Noel Watson Morris at that stage lived in New York. He knew the Beasties as well and the two Adams and Mike D, and basically, they were like, “Hey man, you guys are barking up the wrong tree with that music.” We were like, “Well, we’re DJ’s and we work in the club scene. No, there’s definitely something happening here.” To me, the whole culture of house music was similar to the whole culture like punk rock in the ’70’s or the hippie movement in the ’60’s. It was a wave and a new form of youth culture and music. With it also came a new drug, new fashions, a new way of life. Anything that happens in that sort of sense has to be regarded as a major happening culture-wise. Todd Burns I know we’re jumping around a little bit, but you mentioned fashion again and I do want to ask you, how did you end up as a model again on the runway in New York? Noel Watson Just because Morris and I, we had long red hair at that stage, and we were kids and we knew people who knew Yuki and Peter who run Comme des Garçons in London. We were asked to come to a shoot and audition. We thought, “Yeah, why not? This could be fun.” Morris my brother actually ended up marrying a Japanese girl and working for Comme des Garçons full time in New York, in their flagship store. They flew us to Paris, New York, Milan. It was really good fun and something different. You were meeting different people and it was just of a time when things were different. They’ve always had a different aesthetic as to their models and who wears their clothes. It’s a Japanese very haute-couture brand and still is. It’s funny because in London at the moment, they own a building in Dover Street, called Dover Street Market. This is crazy because that’s where the ICA originally was based and started in the ’50s. Artists like Richard Hamilton and some of the early Andy Warhol and artists like that would come and exhibit there. Now that space is owned by Comme des Garcons, and they share Test Pressing and Idea books are based there as well. It’s this whole new culture. It’s an amazing little set-up really. It’s really weird, because a lot of people don’t really know about it but it’s over six floors and it’s an incredible building. It’s steeped in artistic history. It’s just mad that all of this is still connected. Todd Burns Yeah, it seems like the fashion and music industries are quite connected in a way and you’re one of the few people who actually is bridging that gap in both senses. Noel Watson No, I mean there are a lot of people are involved and have bridged that gap. We were just lucky and were in the right place at the right time, and we knew the right people. It was just of the time. Fashion and music has always gone hand-in-hand. I mean I am obsessed still by the early ’70s and David Bowie and Low and that whole experimental scene of Brian Eno and Talking Heads. It’s just amazing. I went to see Tina Weymouth from Talking Heads last year in London at the 100 Club. Afterwards, I said to Flora, my girl, I said, “Look, I really want to meet her and speak to her. This is important.” We ended up… she came out suddenly and I just approached her and said hello and spoke to her. She was really friendly. She knew some people that I had known back in New York. Then she completely opened up and we spent the whole night together and hung out. We were talking about this whole culture and scene and David Byrne and Brian Eno and Talking Heads and just the whole way it had changed everyone’s lives and also how fashionable it was as well. Fashion has always been a major part of music culture and vice versa. One doesn’t really exist without the other, to be honest. Todd Burns What did you get up to in the ’90s? We talked so much about the ’80s, I’m wondering where you went after I guess the way that I understand it, Delirium at Heaven got taken over by another DJ basically? Noel Watson Yes. We finished on the Thursday nights, Robin and I, after about a year and a half. Then we took it to Camden Palace. Paul Oakenfold at that stage then, he took our night over and he called it Spectrum, or Land of Oz. Then he would do a Monday night and a Thursday night. I was a little bit vexed at this point because I just thought, “Man you’ve just taken our crowd and stolen our ideas.” But he hadn’t. He had done it entirely off his own back. He turned the whole place around. He pushed the whole acid, ecstasy culture through his night Spectrum and Land of Oz. I toured with Paul and DJ’d for Land of Oz with Nancy Noise and Paul. He was a lovely guy Paul. He was an old friend. What he did there was incredible. Then that culture just exploded and took off. It was amazing, and it was logical that somebody would come in and do that night. We struggled at the Camden Palace, Robin and I, even though we put on some amazing events, brought over DJ Mark The 45 King for the first time to London. We hosted a big event with MTV and brought Derrick May back over to DJ, The Orb, Andy Weatherall. It was really amazing as well. There were some fantastic nights. It was a huge club – and it’s Coco now – in London. To hold a Thursday night event there, just me and another guy running it, was very stressful. There was a lot of money and a lot of work involved. We just gradually, Robin had decided that he wanted to leave London. He moved and left as well and moved to Paris. I was on my own. At that stage, I just thought, “I’m now working in Black Market Records during the day, DJing at Black Market, playing music there all day six days a week. I need a break from this as well.” Then, basically, I got asked to play every club all over the world. I traveled to Italy, Spain, Germany a lot and France. I guest DJed basically. Todd Burns Are you still playing? Like tonight you’re playing here in Belfast. What can we expect to hear? Are we going to hear classics or is it stuff that’s coming out now? Noel Watson It will be a little mixture of both but, to be honest, I’ve been given a lot of new tracks by producers like Richard Seaborne, who did a track recently that Todd Terje had charted and stuff like that. He sends me unreleased material that he’s working on. Some of it’s awesome. I’m going to play that. Also, I edit things up on Logic and then put acapellas in, and I program my own beats and play keyboards and things like that on top of it. I’ll be mixing bits and pieces like that in and out. I love still embracing the new music. There’s so many brilliant producers out there at the moment. House music is having a really amazing creative time again, a rebirth. It’s actually I’ve fallen back in love with house music and that whole culture after leaving Belfast again and moving back to London. There will be a lot of new music, and some old music interspersed in between. Todd Burns Cool. I wanted to open it up to questions, if you don’t mind, from the audience. Noel Watson No worries. Todd Burns Does anyone have anything they’d like to ask of Noel? Noel Watson We’ll take that as a no, yeah? Todd Burns There’s one right there. Audience member [Inaudible] Noel Watson Yeah, I did. I came back, and I played at the Art College for David Holmes. I did two Sugar Sweet gigs and they were amazing, really, really incredible. That was the first time I realized Northern Ireland and Belfast has totally changed. I actually started feeling really comfortable coming back home and coming here. I could see the whole change in everyone’s attitude and the way people were coming together, and the part ecstasy and the drug culture was playing in that as well. I thought, “Wow, this is amazing.” What David was doing and how that all progressed and the DJ’s that were coming in and playing from Boys Own, Andy Weatherall and Terry Farley and people like that, it was amazing. I thought this is incredible that Belfast has changed and is coming up and through this. So yeah, I did. I came back to live here in the mid-’90s just for a couple of years to look after my mom, and also to get out of London for a little bit. Then when I was here, I got involved in some of the local festivals, the Corridor Arts Festival etc, and Out to Lunch and would help bring over bands or DJ’s. I loved it and it was a great little period as well. It was nice to see… I DJed with The Fall and Dan le Sac and the Public Enemy guys here in Belfast, and had brilliant nights. It’s amazing how it’s all come full circle and how it’s evolved. Really good. Todd Burns Are there any other questions? Audience member [Inaudible] Noel Watson Yeah. You have to love your art and you have to study your art. You have to become good at what you’re doing, otherwise you get found out as a fraud because, sooner or later, you’re going to be asked to do something with other people who are really professional and who are dedicated to what they’re doing. You’ll get seen as a fraud. All I can really do is music. Even at times in my life when I wanted to do other things, it seems that I always come back to music. Because of doing this work with Test Pressing, I’ve got two more big mixes to come out, interviews and, as I say, lots of other thing. Morris and I practiced and really studied our art. You were just asking me about what I did in the ’90s. In the ’90s, I set up a recording studio and I released a lot of independent 12" singles. I had my own label, Join Hands. Then I got a deal with Warner Brothers and signed a five-album deal with Sonja Sohn, who was my partner at the time, who was a spoken word artist from Brooklyn, New York. Then Sonja got her role in Martin Scorsese’s Bringing Out The Dead, and then she went on to become Keema, the detective in HBO’s The Wire. She wanted to leave the music business. Warner Brothers changed tack, and we lost the deal, but I didn’t really mind at that time. It was cool working for a major record company was really hard work and stressful. It was great. That’s why I managed to build a recording studio. They paid for everything and I had some great times doing that with Sonja. We shot two videos in Paris with Daft Punk’s directors and stuff. It was great fun. I learned how to engineer and program as well and how to use Neve desks and SSL, and go into the studio, I could use samplers and I could do things with samplers that it didn’t tell you about in the manuals. You just discover yourself, by different combinations of buttons etc. I immersed myself into production and doing my music even then as a different… because the gigs were stopping to come as regular as what they had been because I was getting older. New DJ’s were coming through. You’re not in fashion anymore. Things change, and I just thought what I wanted to do anyway from day one is produce music and at least try. Even if I’m not successful at it, at least try and do what I’ve always loved doing. The fact that we got the five-album deal with Warner Brothers and I released about 17 records, I’m happy with that, and I met a lot of really new people as well through that scene. It was cool. It was cool. Todd Burns You said just now that you always wanted to produce, maybe more than you wanted to DJ even at the beginning? Noel Watson Oh no, not at the beginning. At the beginning, when I started DJing, I fell into DJing, as I say, Morris and I, really purely by accident. Then when I got the bug, I lived for DJing. I was obsessed, and my brother was very obsessed. Morris would practice eight hours a day on the turntables and he would program and do different things. He was obsessed. He had double copies of every record.
Obviously living in New York, he was able to buy them cheaper and get the classics. I’ve still got some of his collection. It’s all promo 12" material from the ’70’s. He ended up, my brother, actually playing with Larry Levan at a club in New York. The two of them would get very high and wasted, and he would phone me at like 6 AM and go, “Larry can’t see the labels. Don’t ever take ketamine because there’s a guy talking to the wall.” I’m like, “Morris look, it’s 6 AM. I’m sleeping, man.” When he would come home to London sometimes to see me or whatever, he wouldn’t sleep. He would be up all night. He would be DJing and mixing, and then he went off on a tangent but obsessed. Obsessed, totally. Todd Burns Are there any other questions? Yup. Audience member [Inaudible] Noel Watson I don’t know where I got the energy from. I just, as a boy, I remember being about eight years old or nine years old and hearing The Beatles’ “Hey Jude,” and asking my mom if it was OK if I couldn’t go to school and just for an extra 10 minutes so I can hear the outro of this record. It touched me in this way, and this funny thing went through me. I thought, “My God.” Then I would go out and buy little 7" singles on my way home from school. My mom bought me a little Dansette turntable with a little arm on it, and I would pretend to be a DJ. I would have my own little top ten and I used to torture my poor mom, because she’d be standing in the kitchen and I’d play my No 1 record ten times over because it was No 1 that day or whatever. I just became obsessed with music when I was young. I would travel to London a lot as I say and then I would go and see bands like Cabaret Voltaire or the Pop Group and the Slits. Then I was meeting these people. They were inspiring me to do better, to work harder, to do something because this is an opportunity you can’t waste. These opportunities only come along once in your life, so if you’ve got something like that happening to you, grab it by the hands and do it. The scene that was created by them, I wanted to be with those people. They seemed to get in everywhere for free. They seemed to have all the coolest friends. They seemed to be invited all over the world, and they were making money, and they loved what they were doing. I wanted that. I didn’t know anything else. We were very lucky, my brother and I. We were blessed and to meet the people we met… it was a fantastic opportunity. It’s still happening. For example, Gregor Muir, who is the director of the ICA is an old friend of mine that I met through the music scene and who really loved my brother. It’s quite incredible. I bumped into Rifat Osbek actually just yesterday, the fashion designer. He didn’t remember me. I said, “Rifat,” and he went, “Yeah.” I said, “Do you remember me?” He said, “You’re the boy from Black Market that used to sell me my records, all those records, Raze ‘Break 4 Love.’” I said, “Yeah.” We were talking, chatting. He had a new shop open in Notting Hill and he was standing outside it having a smoke. We were just reminiscing about those days and Black Market records. The Pet Shop Boys would come in and then I would deal up the Pet Shop Boys with all their music. I’d give Chris. I’d say, “Chris you need this 12", this house track.” They would spend £500, £600 each session on music. It’s just kind of mad you know. Then all the DJ’s would come in. DJ Harvey used to come in and I used to play with Harvey a lot in London on a Sunday night at a Club called Solaris. It was cutting edge underground club. Harvey used to come in in the mornings and me and him would have breakfast together, coffee and a sandwich, and just talk about music and beats and torture each other before he went off to LA and became this superstar kind of like enigma that he is, which is amazing because he’s an amazing guy. Todd Burns Was he always a character? Noel Watson Yeah. Harvey was always a little bit left of field and always mad. He used to come in with his duffle coat on, him and Choci. They always wore duffle coats and baggy jeans. They were hippies. They were into rock as well. They had the Tonka soundsystem. Last year, actually, I did the Secret Garden Party and the Wilderness Festival with the Tonka soundsystem guys. Choci and Harvey came to one of them. Justin Robertson played and we did Glastonbury and we did all these different festivals. Yeah, it was amazing. Todd Burns Hopefully that kind of answered your question. Noel Watson Was that okay? Audience member [Inaudible] Noel Watson I nearly got there, yeah. The people that I met along the way kept inspiring me. Your Neneh Cherry’s your Bruce Smith from the Pop Group and Mark Stewart, Sean Oliver from Rip Rig & Panic, Malcolm McLaren, Tom Binns, Comme des Garçons people and staff. They just all continually inspired you to reach a higher level. All the DJ’s that I met as well through the scene. It’s just important to stay aware of what you’re doing when you’re doing something artistic and creative and not let yourself get waylaid by the other side of it, which can take you to different places and you’ll meet different people who are not so creative and will latch onto you and create havoc for you in your life as well. There is a long of hangers-on and there’s a lot of people who pretend to be something and that they’re not. There’s even people on the scene now who pretend that they did this and they did that. I know they didn’t because I was there and I was doing it. It’s cool. It’s cool. Audience member [Inaudible] Noel Watson Yeah, yeah, cool. That’s really amazing. That’s good. That’s cool. It’s nice to know that people are aware of it. Sometimes I think nobody gives a monkey’s any more and nobody even took any notice of this. It’s nice to know that some people cared like yourself and you’re here today. So, thank you. That’s really nice. I really appreciate that so thank you. Todd Burns Thank you, Noel for being here. Noel Watson Thank you everyone. Todd Burns I really appreciate it. [Applause]

Otomo Yoshihide
The line between mainstream and underground is merely a pinstripe for Otomo Yoshihide, a composer and multi-instrumentalist with over 100 releases under his belt. Otomo became known to the world in the ’90s as the leader of improvisational noise band Ground Zero. Now, though, he's nearing household name status for his compositions of a different sort: he’s hit the Top 10 in Japan with his soundtrack for Amachan, a popular TV drama series about a teenage sea urchin diver who becomes a pop idol.
Speaking at the 2014 Red Bull Music Academy, Yoshihide went deep on noise music, collaboration, the Amachan soundtrack, and more.
Transcript: Susumu Kunisaki Hello everyone. Thank you for your patience. We’ll spend the next hour or so with the musician Otomo Yoshihide. Mr. Otomo Yoshihide. [Applause] Otomo Yoshihide Hello everyone. Susumu Kunisaki And I’m Kunisaki, your host for today.
I’m the executive editor of Sound and Recording Magazine, which is a monthly mag for people who create music. First, by way of introduction, I’d like to tell you a little bit about Mr. Otomo here. I said earlier that Mr. Otomo is a “musician”, but he actually has many faces. First, he’s a guitarist. Otomo Yoshihide Yes, I play the guitar. Susumu Kunisaki He plays the guitar. And he’s also a turntablist. Otomo Yoshihide I’m probably one of the first in Japan
to use turntables in that way. Susumu Kunisaki So a turntablist. Recently, he’s worked on sound installations. Otomo Yoshihide Yes, I have. Susumu Kunisaki Installation art, as it’s known. What else do you do? Susumu Kunisaki I write soundtracks for movies and TV. Otomo Yoshihide He’s a soundtrack composer. Susumu Kunisaki I’m also a producer. Not only of music but also of events. And that’s about it. Otomo Yoshihide He’s involved in a wide range of activities, so it’s hard to cover them all one by one. But first, could you start by introducing some of your music to us? Susumu Kunisaki Right. My music first. What should I start with? If you don’t mind, I’d like to start with this. This is Fukushima in 2011. To elaborate, the earthquake that struck also triggered a nuclear disaster. The habitability of Fukushima City was a major concern. This is the outdoor festival that we held in Fukushima City. This is what it was like. The festival itself took place throughout the entire day, and my part was for about an hour. This is a little excerpt from that. I performed with the people in the audience. The audience included regular, ordinary people as well as musicians who participated like Ryuichi Sakamoto and other famous people like that. The sound recording’s not good, but here’s an excerpt from the TV documentary. Let me show it to you. (video: Excerpt from “Project Fukushima!” documentary) This is probably what my collaboration
with you (during the academy) will be like. There were 280 players participating in this festival. I’ll skip ahead. I conducted a group of regular people, including those who can play and those who have brought instruments there for the first time. That’s Kazumi Nikaido, a famous Japanese singer. Skipping ahead... I used several hand signals to conduct an orchestra that anyone, no matter what their playing skill, could participate in. I’ll explain why I decided to do this later. That dancing person is Kazumi Nikaido who I mentioned earlier. The recording is lousy so it might be hard to grasp. The person I gave the loudspeaker to is Michiro Endo, the pioneer of punk rock in Japan. He’s 64 years old now. It’s not coming across but it was really loud, although everything was acoustic. Apparently there were about 16,000 people there. I’m pretty sure this was the first big event held in Fukushima post-disaster. Sorry for the lousy sound. Susumu Kunisaki In that segment, you were using your hand to give out various cues like a conductor. Did you and the musicians, well, everyone who participated, rehearse beforehand to match the signal and action? Otomo Yoshihide Yes, we did. We rehearsed for about an hour. Only my part was shown just now,
but the conductors changed and each one could conduct according to his or her own rules. Susumu Kunisaki Like what, for example? Otomo Yoshihide Really simple ones. One finger means a short sound. Bam. Five means a long sound. Keep going, and stop. Three means beat out a rhythm. [Wiggles finger] This means copy somebody else’s sound. [Makes a U shape with his hand] This means keep doing what you’re doing. [Holds a thumb up] This means stop. It’s possible to do various things with only about eight different signals. Susumu Kunisaki So both professional and amateur
musicians came to participate? Otomo Yoshihide And even those who’d never played before. Susumu Kunisaki Is it possible to make music
even with such people in the group? Otomo Yoshihide That’s what I’m aiming for. For example, an orchestra typically has a musical goal to achieve, so the players strive to improve and be creative. But this isn’t the same. Unless everyone can participate
with the skills they have, a hierarchy is born between the players and non-players, which I didn’t want. Susumu Kunisaki I find that strange. You’re a professional musician. So that hierarchy is your livelihood. Otomo Yoshihide Right. The hierarchy is more lucrative. Susumu Kunisaki Isn’t it? So why get rid of it? Otomo Yoshihide Musical hierarchy isn’t all bad.
Everyone here aspires to be a pro, and by doing things that amateurs can’t, they might create great music and maybe make money. But music isn’t something that’s reserved for professionals. Music was originally... how to put it? It was something everyone did. In particular, before records began to be sold and radio was born, I think performing music was more common. During the last hundred and something years of music being a commodity, professionals and amateurs have become split. Especially in Japan. Ordinary people don’t do music
besides karaoke. Karaoke is all right,
but over the past decade or so, I’ve been thinking that there should be places where ordinary people can enjoy music in other ways. Susumu Kunisaki And this orchestra is such an attempt. Is it an orchestra? Otomo Yoshihide It’s an orchestra. Though the style was different at first and I tried other ways. When I first went to Fukushima after the disaster... I grew up in Fukushima, so I frequented there post-disaster to help. There’s no music scene or pro musicians to speak of in Fukushima, so making music with the people there meant involving mostly amateurs. So I had to devise a way for those people and the pros from Tokyo to stand on equal ground and make interesting music. Especially because this was the first post-disaster festival, the people in Fukushima had to stand up and do something about their plight, not wait to be saved or be moved by some musicians from Tokyo. To achieve that through music, the people of Fukushima had to do it. Susumu Kunisaki To participate and make music. Otomo Yoshihide They had to create the festival itself with their own hands. So for this festival, they did all the preparations themselves. Making way for a system like that was the important thing. Susumu Kunisaki From what we just saw, everyone who participated looked like they were having loads of fun. Was it a blast? Otomo Yoshihide It was a blast, but at that time... Honestly speaking, the situation was dire. It still is. Certain parts of Fukushima are off-limits because of radiation and while the festival grounds were miraculously not so bad, we had to decide if people should gather there. Susumu Kunisaki Whether or not it should be done. Otomo Yoshihide Exactly. Of course it was something
that had to be discussed, and we had to measure radiation levels. The reason why we started this was because the government had been hiding the radiation levels for a month or two post-disaster and I felt something needed to be done. To set up a system where we all could measure radiation levels ourselves and make our own informed decisions. An outdoor festival seemed the best way. Susumu Kunisaki To show that there were places where the radiation was low enough? Otomo Yoshihide That too, but more that it’s OK to measure radiation on your own. Susumu Kunisaki Instead of waiting. Otomo Yoshihide Exactly. Measure it and discuss the result with scientists and other people. We had a table at the festival to do that. Susumu Kunisaki To discuss the propriety of the event? Otomo Yoshihide Right. We were encouraging people to think. Not to tell people that it was OK to live in Fukushima, but to use the event to present a way for people to think about how to live their lives under such circumstances. So that was the purpose of the event. Something we tried out at the festival at the time was the project to cover the grounds with furoshiki cloth. Today’s audience wouldn’t know... Susumu Kunisaki Furoshiki is hard to explain. They might not get it. Otomo Yoshihide I’m sure the interpreters are explaining what a furoshiki is right now. I have photos of the furoshiki somewhere. Susumu Kunisaki They’re nodding. They’ve explained it. Otomo Yoshihide Really? Thanks. Hold on one second. I’m not very organized so I can’t find the photos. Where are they? This one? Ta-da! There we go. The furoshiki. As the interpreters have explained, a furoshiki is a piece of cloth about this big that’s traditionally used for wrapping and carrying things. Most Japanese households have one. We sewed lots of them together to cover the entire grounds, over 6,000 m2 of grass. This is a photo of what it looked like. This is a photo of the process. We took pieces of cloth about this big and dozens of people sewed them together over the course of three weeks. They’re laying them down before the festival. The reason we did this was, in August 2011 in Fukushima, most of the radioactive isotope cesium was on the ground. Not in the atmosphere. So to prevent the cesium on the ground from flying up and getting on people, we laid down sheets of furoshiki to cover the entire area. Like this. This is the sewn-together furoshiki. By covering the surface, we wanted to visually demonstrate that radiation existed in Fukushima. So we held the festival after taking necessary precautions. When we promoted it, we never once said that it was safe to come. We presented the accurate radiation levels and said there’d be risks. Susumu Kunisaki You gave the facts and said you’d try to reduce the risk by covering the area with furoshiki to prevent cesium from getting on people. Otomo Yoshihide To prevent inhaling or ingesting it.
We also checked all the concession that was sold at the festival and presented the data. I’m sure we were the first to be open about that in Fukushima. But at the same time, though the event was in Fukushima, not all of it is contaminated. We chose a place with relatively low radiation. People live in areas that are far more contaminated, so I thought it might actually be better for them to come. So a lot of thought went into this festival and the process was kept open. Susumu Kunisaki Why did it have to be a furoshiki, though? There are more useful materials to cover the ground. Otomo Yoshihide At first we considered using plastic sheets to do this, but Fukushima City gets really hot. If we put down plastic sheets in August, everyone would die from the heat before being harmed by radiation. So it had to be cloth. And Japan has a common saying, “Spreading a big furoshiki.” And what “spreading out a big furoshiki” means is that you’re setting goals that you can’t achieve. So it was a double meaning. We were criticized a lot for that. But the people living in Fukushima need humor to keep going, so we chose “Big Furoshiki” as the title for the event, which was a word that a Japanese person would notice as a bit of a joke. Also, it was better to spend some time on it, with people cooperating. Buying the cloth would be meaningless. If some supplier did all the work, it’d be simple. But we thought the process should take a bit of effort, so we got people to donate the cloths and sew them themselves. We thought it’d be great if both amateur and pro musicians could all stand on it and make music together. Susumu Kunisaki Then the orchestra that you’ll be doing with this audience will be an extension of that festival? Otomo Yoshihide It’s an extension. It’s been four years, so the method’s changed a bit. Plus, most of you here aren’t amateurs, and can play instruments to some degree so I’ll probably raise the bar a bit. Also, I don’t want just one person to be in the center controlling things, so the conductors will interchange. Susumu Kunisaki Why do you want them to change? Otomo Yoshihide Because I feel uncomfortable always being in the center, so there’s that, and the music changes when the people change. It’s far more interesting that way with this method. Susumu Kunisaki You mentioned types of music. While there are the kind with precise scores to be performed according to
the composers’ intents, the kind of music that you described is spontaneous and unintentional. You don’t know how or where it will end up. Otomo Yoshihide No, I don’t. Can’t be reproduced, either. Susumu Kunisaki So that kind of music give you pleasure as a musician? Otomo Yoshihide Of course. I wonder why... Probably because my influences were originally free jazz and improvised music. And also psychedelic rock. So none of these styles of music have scores, which is probably the biggest reason. The other one, and this most likely has to do with my character, is that I get bored when I get people to reproduce something that I completed in my head. Susumu Kunisaki You get bored. Otomo Yoshihide Very quickly. It’s far more interesting when the unexpected occurs, and it doesn’t work if I do it by myself. If I do a solo with my guitar, it’d be nothing more than what I do. So I love making a machine run wild or getting feedback on a guitar because I can’t control them. Making music with other people isn’t about control. They bring other ideas, meaning you don’t know what’ll happen. For some reason, I seem to enjoy it when things seem to come and go unpredictably. Susumu Kunisaki You mentioned guitar feedback just now. You play “noise music,” and for that you create noises with your guitar as well as with a turntable like this one. Otomo Yoshihide This is super easy. You don’t need any skill. Like this. [Demonstrates noise by lifting and setting down the tonearm of the turntable] Even just this is interesting enough. Now when I adjust the tone control, the sound changes like this. Cool, isn’t it? I guess not. I think it’s cool. I love it. And you can change the cartridges, too. This isn’t worth applauding. [Laughs] I can’t do it today, but turntable feedback is awesome, too. I wonder if the engineer will get mad
if I create feedback? [Demonstrates feedback] Isn’t it great? Like that. [Applause] This isn’t worth applauding. Susumu Kunisaki This is awesome. Otomo Yoshihide The subwoofer is fabulous. Susumu Kunisaki There is a Genelec subwoofer back here, and it’s like body-sonic audio. Awesome. Otomo Yoshihide [Holding up Red Bull can] How many of these did they have to sell to buy this subwoofer? [Laughter] Susumu Kunisaki You talked about enjoying the uncontrollable and noise, but you seemed to be controlling the turntable impeccably. Otomo Yoshihide That wasn’t very serious, but I do control it in my own way when I perform. Susumu Kunisaki You know from experience what will
happen if you scratch certain places, or touch the cartridge or the needle? Otomo Yoshihide Not all of it, but I know about 80%,
and the rest depends on the sound system and how the venue itself sounds. And I can tell those things as well, but I think I better not. Susumu Kunisaki You prefer not being in control. Otomo Yoshihide I like not being in control. Unfortunately, people have memories. But I’m sure I’ll become forgetful as I grow older, and then I’ll enjoy making music more. Susumu Kunisaki Forgetting experience and starting anew? Otomo Yoshihide Right. I’m hoping it’ll be like that. [Laughs] In any case, even when I’m playing solo, I prefer the uncontrollable like this. I try to create an uncontrollable factor
when I play solo. I really don’t like doing what’s already been set up. Susumu Kunisaki You don’t like being asked to do
what’s been set? Otomo Yoshihide When things are set, I stay within bounds but do something that’ll turn people off, something different. Susumu Kunisaki I see. You use turntables to perform, and you also do sound installations. Otomo Yoshihide Yes. Susumu Kunisaki Could you tell us about that? Otomo Yoshihide Sure, let’s see if I can find one
on YouTube. Let’s see... This is an installation called “Without Records.” (music: Otomo Yoshihide – “Without Records”) Isn’t it fun? Over a hundred of these were switched on and off by computer. This is the sound of feedback. So I think there were maybe about 120 of them then? 120 turntables. 120 of them being turned on and off randomly. Susumu Kunisaki And true to the title “Without Records,” there are no records on any of the turntables? Otomo Yoshihide None. And from each turntable... I didn’t set this up myself. Dozens of people worked on it. Planned it out. Whoops, my guitar solo came on. Let’s stop it for now. I asked the participants of a workshop to create a mechanism of producing sound from empty turntables. Susumu Kunisaki So the participants set it up? Otomo Yoshihide Yes. They spent about three days. Susumu Kunisaki People ranging from schoolchildren
to elderly men cooperated. Then we set them up in the room and a computer switched them on and off. In various ways, like turning on just one, or all together, or on and off from there to here, like the wind blowing. Set in motion according to various settings. Susumu Kunisaki You used Max/MSP, the Cycling ‘74 software for this. Otomo Yoshihide Yes, that’s right. Susumu Kunisaki From what we just saw, it appears as though the turntables are being operated at random, but they’re actually being controlled to some extent with Max. Otomo Yoshihide That’s correct. A single one might play like a soloist, and various other settings. But the frequency was random, so even I didn’t know what would come next. Susumu Kunisaki Not everything was set from start to finish. Otomo Yoshihide No. Susumu Kunisaki Some randomness left. Otomo Yoshihide It was programmed to never repeat
the same pattern, and the turntables were all old, from the ‘50s, ‘60s and ‘70s, so they often broke or changed
from the initial settings. It was impossible to maintain the same sound. We kept them going for five months. Susumu Kunisaki Was this in Yamaguchi? Otomo Yoshihide At YCAM in Yamaguchi. All 120 were playing at first, but in the end only about 80 were left, and their breaking down was also part of the work. Susumu Kunisaki To explain a bit about YCAM, in Yamaguchi Prefecture in Japan there’s the Yamaguchi Center for Arts and Media... A museum, could it be called? Otomo Yoshihide Yes, I think so. Susumu Kunisaki With a focus on media arts. Many creators, such as Carsten Nicolai, to give a familiar example, and Ryoji Ikeda, who’ll be at the reception later on today, have worked in residence on various works of art at YCAM. “Without Records” was such a project. Otomo Yoshihide Yes, that’s right. It’s a project I did there in 2008. Susumu Kunisaki It’s located far from Tokyo, in western Japan, in Yamaguchi City. Nowadays people from overseas
skip Tokyo and go there. Otomo Yoshihide What’s amazing about YCAM is that it’s not just a venue. They’ve got great engineers and technicians there.
So you can team up with them to bring your ideas to fruition. That’s the best thing about it. Susumu Kunisaki In media art, which I’m sure today’s
audience is interested in, while it’s possible to just program something alone, it often involves labor-intensive methods to bring it together with the help of many people to make things and do the programming. It’s necessary. Otomo Yoshihide It’s definitely necessary. So the title of the overall exhibit for that was “Ensembles,” the pluralized form
of ensemble. Meaning not only musicians but also technicians, artists, and many others create the work, like performers playing in an orchestra. Susumu Kunisaki From what you’ve told us, you really seem to have a strong desire to work with various people, including even the ones you can’t control, and create something that even you find surprising while enjoying the communication. Otomo Yoshihide I work alone, too, of course, but I quickly get bored of working alone so I enjoy working with others. Susumu Kunisaki Is there a knack in working with others? Otomo Yoshihide A knack? No, because the experience differs from person to person. I don’t think there’s a single ideal way to work with others, but perhaps the key is to not demand a quick solution. Susumu Kunisaki You mean don’t write someone off quickly after meeting them and tuning up together, for example? Otomo Yoshihide Oh, that happens sometimes. [Laughs] Some people I’d rather not work with. But what I mean by not demanding a quick solution is that it’s more interesting if the result of the collaboration between that person and me isn’t obvious. And also, I enjoy the process of the collaboration so if I push what I want to do too hard onto the other person, it would no longer be an ensemble. So the back and forth between that person and me... How to put it? Not aiming for a set goal from the start is the key. To discover the goal through the process. Susumu Kunisaki I see. So you held an exhibit
entitled “Ensembles” at the Yamaguchi Center for Arts and Media, YCAM. Like everyone here today, many people from Tokyo couldn’t go see it then. (music: Otomo Yoshihide/ENSEMBLES – “Quartets”) Otomo Yoshihide This might be hard to get, but there are four screens there, positioned to form a box in the center. The silhouettes of improvising musicians are shown randomly there. I named it “Quartets” because the four sides usually show four musicians. But it’s not possible to see all four sides simultaneously because it’s being shown on the sides of a white cube. That’s me on guitar. That’s Jim O’Rourke. And the images of minute, microscopic things moving in reaction to the sounds is shown on the opposite wall. So there are eight screens in total, all playing randomly. Susumu Kunisaki That’s a Japanese instrument. Otomo Yoshihide It’s a “sho.” A traditional Japanese instrument called a sho. This is Kahimi Karie, the vocalist. This is Jim O’Rourke on synthesizer. This is Sachiko M generating electronic noises and sine waves. I’m playing the guitar there. Martin Brandlmayr of Radian is on drums. Axel Dörner on trumpet. He’s from Berlin. On percussion is Doravideo. The silhouettes of the viewers are shown as well. This goes on and on endlessly, and while it’s playing, even we don’t know what the combination will be. These are things like small balls placed on the speakers or oil covering them, moving with the vibration and reacting to the sounds. I think these are extremely fine threads placed on the speakers. Close-up shots of such things are magnified on the screen. So you can actually see the physical movement of sound along with the silhouettes of the musicians like this. This will be shown from November 22 in Tokyo, so although you probably have to fly home, if you can extend your stay and see it, that’d be great. Susumu Kunisaki So on the four sides of the cube, the musicians appear on the screens randomly? Otomo Yoshihide Randomly. Susumu Kunisaki You don’t know who will appear? Otomo Yoshihide There were eight musicians but you never know who’d appear. Sometimes two overlapped on one screen like an error, and sometimes there was nobody. It was programmed that way. Susumu Kunisaki Did each of the eight musicians originally play according to some kind of guide? Otomo Yoshihide No. The musicians recorded a few takes of solo playing in a proper studio while having their silhouettes taken. Susumu Kunisaki They didn’t hear anybody else’s music? Otomo Yoshihide Each recorded two to four takes of solo performances, ten to 30 minutes in length. So these can stand on their own as perfectly fine solos. I just told them we’d be playing their recordings with other musicians so to leave some space for that when improvising their music. That was all I asked. Susumu Kunisaki So four are randomly selected from eight and the combination changes? Otomo Yoshihide Yes, the combination changes rapidly. And sometimes it’s played solo. Susumu Kunisaki Oh, just one person? Otomo Yoshihide Sometimes, yes. There are periods when nobody is playing purely by chance, and similarly, sometimes the players
overlap so there are than five. Errors were programmed to occur. Susumu Kunisaki You can only see two sides at a time. Otomo Yoshihide Right. Two at a time is the limit. Susumu Kunisaki Because it’s a cube. But the sound
from all four sides... Otomo Yoshihide You hear the sound but you can only
imagine what’s going on over there. But what’s happening on the other side is displayed as the things
moving on the speakers. Susumu Kunisaki The close-ups. Otomo Yoshihide You can see the materials instead. Susumu Kunisaki I see. I saw this installation at the time. I thought it was impressive and beautiful. Otomo Yoshihide Wasn’t it? I made something beautiful for a change. Susumu Kunisaki Unlike the violent noises that we heard earlier, it was very delicate and lovely. I’d wanted to see it again. Otomo Yoshihide It’s been five years since the last time. Susumu Kunisaki I see. I made a point of explaining
that you have a “beautiful” side. We’ve introduced a couple of your sound installations and such event-like projects so far. Now I’d like to focus a bit more on your music. The kind of music we’ve heard so far could probably be called experimental, and while you do such work, you’ve also written soundtracks for TV and film. This isn’t to make more money
on the side, is it? Otomo Yoshihide No, but I get that a lot. Susumu Kunisaki I’m sure you do. Otomo Yoshihide Because I had a hit last year. There’s a morning slot for series of TV dramas broadcast for 50 years on NHK, the public broadcasting network in Japan. I wrote the soundtrack for one of them
that aired for six months. It became a huge hit, so I get that a lot now. Susumu Kunisaki I’ve known you for a long time and know that you’ve always written soundtracks. Otomo Yoshihide Yes, I have. I don’t think that abstract music is the only kind of music. I love jazz like anyone else. There was a time I learned samba
from a Brazilian. I’ve played various kinds of music so I like those too. Love them. Susumu Kunisaki So when you’re asked to write a soundtrack, you don’t change your frame of mind, so to speak, to switch over from your usual experimental music? Otomo Yoshihide Not really. What takes priority when I work on soundtracks is finding the music that best matches the drama from the stock I have within. It’s not about expressing my own music. So if noise matches the drama then I’ll use it but if it doesn’t... For example, that hit of mine last year was a comedy starring a teenager. Susumu Kunisaki Not noise material. Otomo Yoshihide No. So I focused on the teenager
for the first half. Susumu Kunisaki Let’s listen to it, then. Otomo Yoshihide The drama is called “Ama-chan.” Here it is. This piece. It’s my big band. (music: Otomo Yoshihide – “Ama-chan” Theme (Live)) It’s like that. Susumu Kunisaki So different from that violent noise. Otomo Yoshihide Completely different. Susumu Kunisaki Shockingly so. Otomo Yoshihide I’m shocked, actually. Because it’s so different. Susumu Kunisaki When did you develop the skill to write music like this? Otomo Yoshihide This kind of... I hate to say proper music, but I’ve never properly studied music. I got started playing music in a band in high school for the school festival. So I could play rock and pop songs on the guitar then, though I wasn’t very good at it. I developed the formal skill to write such music after I turned 30. After I began getting work writing music for soundtracks, I learned how to arrange music because I had to. Susumu Kunisaki You’d have to write scores for this kind of music. Otomo Yoshihide Yes. Normally it’d be necessary to write scores for this, write out every note for all the parts. But in my case, when I selected my members, I chose musicians who didn’t need scores. Though everyone you saw just now are classically trained and can’t improvise. But they were all interested in my kind of music so I chose them and had them do something they’d never done before, play without scores. Susumu Kunisaki I see. You didn’t hand out music? Otomo Yoshihide Oh, I did. I handed them out, just simple ones with only the melody, chords, and counter lines, and told them we’d discuss and build up the rest like a rock band. Susumu Kunisaki To do the rest themselves? So you chose musicians who could do that. Otomo Yoshihide Yes, exactly. If I’d chosen only professional studio musicians it wouldn’t have sounded like this. For example, that triplet rhythm in the hook of that piece wouldn’t have turned out like that from just the information on a sheet music. So we discussed everything on the spot, like the nuance of the rhythm. Or about how to play – exactly together or shift it a bit? We discussed such things as we went along. I’m sure it’s a completely different method of working from ordinary professional composers of TV and film soundtracks. Susumu Kunisaki It’s great that there are musicians willing to work like that. Otomo Yoshihide Yes. So about 70% of those musicians I chose were classical ones who regularly use scores and the rest were rock and jazz musicians. So I bring such people together and watch what happens. I want to see the unpredicted result of such combinations when I compose. Susumu Kunisaki Is it actually possible, though, to obtain that kind of skill past 30? I imagine that for many people, including those in the audience today, who are used to programming, for example, EDM-like sounds, it would be very difficult to learn to write scores for big bands like this. Otomo Yoshihide Maybe. But when I was in my 20s and learning to play the guitar, I became discouraged from trying. The reason was because, for example, I wanted to play like Jim Hall, the jazz guitarist, but couldn’t, and that distance between my skill and my goal was too far. So there was a period when I’d quit playing for about seven, eight years. But you don’t have to aspire to be like somebody. For example, trying to write a big band
score like Duke Ellington’s is too hard. Susumu Kunisaki That’s pretty daunting. Otomo Yoshihide Right? But if you don’t set that as your goal, if you focus on trying to write something good in your own way... It can be daunting if you set a certain goal, but it’s manageable if you don’t. Susumu Kunisaki So you try to enjoy the process,
and like you mentioned, you have confidence or a conviction in your choice of music for that image? Otomo Yoshihide But it’s difficult each time, and I’ve got to say I don’t have confidence. I discuss things with the director
as I go along. Every time. I’ve written about 80 soundtracks for TV and film during these 25 years. But I still worry about things and the right answer never comes easy. Susumu Kunisaki So the images don’t necessarily
trigger ideas. Otomo Yoshihide Sometimes I lie and say that they do, but no, it’s never that easy. But when I do come up with something, it’s often instantaneous. Susumu Kunisaki Do you enjoy collaborating with people
who specialize in moving images? Otomo Yoshihide Yes, it’s fun. Because the people
who specialize in images don’t use the same vocabulary that we musicians use. They communicate a much vaguer nuance, so the process of translating that into a musical vocabulary is really interesting to me. Susumu Kunisaki Could you give some examples? Otomo Yoshihide Let’s say we have an image of a high school student, and of a blue sky. When I’m requested to compose music
like that blue sky, I don’t understand what that means. People interpret things differently, and sound is colorless to begin with. But I translate that request in my own way. Why was the sky referenced? Because the teenager’s emotion is reflected in the distance between her and the sky. So musically, placing this sound here might express that. That’s my thought process when I’m working. Susumu Kunisaki Have you ever come across a scene where you thought noise would work? Otomo Yoshihide I have, actually. On that NHK morning drama series, a scenes of the 3.11 disaster (the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster) were depicted. For those I used noise, my usual kind of music, and I think it worked really well. To be precise, I didn’t set music to the disaster itself, but to the various events that occurred afterwards. So at one point in 2013, my kind of experimental music was heard every morning in Japanese living rooms. Susumu Kunisaki That was surreal. Otomo Yoshihide But everyone was focusing on the drama and not the music, so I never got any complaints. Susumu Kunisaki Do you consider that a good thing? That people don’t focus on the music? Otomo Yoshihide I believe that a soundtrack has failed
if people notice it on their first watch because it’s there to enhance the drama. So yes, it’s a good thing. Susumu Kunisaki I see. Well, you’ve gotten a glimpse
of Mr. Otomo’s wide-ranging music activities. The time is now almost 6 o’clock, so we’ll move on to the Q&A. Mr. Otomo will answer any questions you may have. He’s involved in noise music. He creates sound installations. He spoke about the “Chaos Conductor,” and about composing soundtracks. He’s got many sides, so if any of you have any questions about any of them, ask away. Anybody? Audience member I notice that you have some particular signals for your conducting, giving messages to the musicians. Did you come up with them or are they borrowed from other conductors, and why did you choose that kind of signal? And also, are you using them with us? Otomo Yoshihide Well, about this idea, I got a hint of this method in the ‘80s. I think it was a work in ‘84 of a musician in NY, Lawrence Butch Morris. I remember he passed away last year or two yeas ago? I got a hint from his work “Conduction.” He conducted using various signs that are so complex we need to rehearse for three days. First, I knew it listening to his record, and when he came to Japan twice in the ‘90s I performed with him as a member of the “Conduction.” It was my first experience creating music alone with signs of a conductor. That was a big influence on me. But the signs were too complex to be introduced to amateur musicians right away, so I made them simple, like reducing them from a hundred to one. Selecting one percent out of the signs and changing them simpler to introduce them to people without instrument skills. I’ve been trying various ways
in these 10 years but this experiment is still in the process. I’m working on it with amateur musicians and the process is a real trial and error. Susumu Kunisaki About the trial and error, could you tell us an example what was difficult or easy? Otomo Yoshihide For the people without instrument skills it is difficult to pick up on quickly the nuances of improvisation. They’re not full of ideas for creation and their ideas are simple. It is rare for amateurs to be flashing ideas like professionals. Even though we had less various ideas, I needed to try to enrich their sound as a professional musician. Susumu Kunisaki I see. Thank you very much. A microphone, please. Audience member I was wondering if you separate noise and more traditional music in terms of the attention that they deserve, that you give them? Do you listen to noise around the house, do you have to give more attention to it? Otomo Yoshihide Well, I have two ways to answer that. The first one is, to make the matter simple, I called my experiment “noise” and called others “traditional.” Actually, any music can be noise and any sound can be music. That is the way I think. For example, (something) everybody regards as music, like the Beatles, their “Yesterday” is wonderful music. Even though it’s great, if you play the song for someone who is trying to sleep, it will definitely become noise. Depending on the situation of the listener, anything can be noise. We could say the opposite too. Something not regarded as music can possibly make you feel better. In that sense, I don’t have a clear division, “this is noise and this is music.” This is my first answer. And I have another answer but... I understand what I’m going to say doesn’t cover everything. Of course, there is a difference between some music that follows traditions and music that doesn’t.
Let me show you an example. [Demonstrates noise from the turntable] This sound, I don’t regard this as the same as traditional sounds. This is because the sounds that are organized by traditions and history and the sounds that come out incidentally are different, I think. However, the traditional sounds are recognized only when the listener knows what the traditional sounds like. I mean, not simply the sound itself having messages in it, but the message is always created by the relationship between listeners and composers. This is what I believe. In that sense, when I create experimental sounds or “noise” like this, I’m always trying to elicit a feeling
inside of a person’s memory that betrays the fixed idea of “this is real music.” And there is another thing we need to recognize. I’ve been listening to “noise music” since I was young, so listening to rough sound makes me extremely happy. It means that the sound is already traditional to me. I feel that way, sometimes. Let me show you the music I listened to when I was young, my favourite great guitarist, Masayuki Takayanagi. He performed this piece... where is it? The music that he performed was like “noise music.” I’ve found this on YouTube now, performed by legendary musicians, Masayuki Takayanagi and Kaoru Abe. They are the first musicians who played free jazz in Japan, but for me, it sounds like noise music. (music: Masayuki Takayanagi & Kaoru Abe – “Mass Projection”) This performance is in the ‘70s. Bit lousy. Well, since this lasts another 50 minutes, I will stop this here, but I love their music so much. I love this so much that I could die for it. What I can say is, it means this sound is not a noise at all. Susumu Kunisaki Traditional..? Otomo Yoshihide Yes, this is a traditional music for me. So I think it really depends on how one takes what traditional means. Okay? Susumu Kunisaki While listening to your talk, I noticed that you always care what situation the listener is in or how the listener feels the music has great effect on the music itself, do you think in that way? Otomo Yoshihide I think music cannot only be defined by what the musician plays. Music always stands in a relationship between players and listeners. I think that is music, swinging endlessly. So even though you play a noise to make everybody hate it, still, it is possible to make somebody love the noise, like me. It tells us we can never control listeners, and we cannot control ourselves as a listener. That is music, I guess. Susumu Kunisaki I think that, in these 10 years, listeners have greatly changed. What I’m saying is, as you showed us the ‘70s sounds right now by searching it on YouTube, we can find and pick up “old sounds” as “new sounds” to listen through the internet. Otomo Yoshihide That’s right. Susumu Kunisaki Without recognizing it as historical, all music seem like it’s lining up flatly in front of listeners. That could be good in a way, or in another way, we can say that the context of music is ignored. How can we see this sort of “flattening”? Otomo Yoshihide Well, it is not only the matter of
YouTube but... I felt honestly confused when the internet started delivering music services. I felt like something very significant to me (was) being lined with trash. Susumu Kunisaki On the same shelf? Otomo Yoshihide Yes. But I listen to various music through YouTube almost every night, and this is a very happy and welcoming situation. On the other hand it is not a mere matter of display but a way of listening. Most of us these days use earphones, don’t we? I think these really cause a problem. Sure, these are good and useful for us, but when I was child, I was listening to music through speakers. Mother scolded me, “it’s too noisy.” Susumu Kunisaki Definitely, mothers did. Otomo Yoshihide In that situation there is someone
between the music and myself. I can say it is an impure relationship with music because it has some noise. There is always a noise, “a mother.” We could not listen to music in an exclusive way, in those days. Nowadays we can listen to it, so we feel as if we are doing it purely. In fact, I think it’s better listening with noise. It is nice to have a mother complaining, “It’s noisy.” Or a girlfriend saying “Try listening to this. It’s better.” Not remaining in a one-on-one relationship with music and
allowing various elements between you and music. I rather prefer that I cannot create a relationship with music easily. Susumu Kunisaki Now everyone can listen to music very directly and exclusively alone. We can listen to music all over the world with just one click. Otomo Yoshihide It’s great, but I still want to snip
everyone’s cables from their back with scissors. Susumu Kunisaki On a train? Otomo Yoshihide Snip-snap... Susumu Kunisaki As a creator of music, is there anything you are conscious about with this “flattening era” we are now in? Otomo Yoshihide The biggest change inside of me for
the flattening was that I quit making albums. Susumu Kunisaki Why was that? Otomo Yoshihide If you make a CD or LP... I think especially in making CDs, everything can be lined and displayed flatly in the internet. Our consideration of the order of tracks and the length between the numbers, like five seconds, becomes useless. That made me think that the album itself has no meaning. Susumu Kunisaki Did you think about creating albums
that nobody can cut apart? Otomo Yoshihide Exactly, that’s why I started to perform installations. Headphones never bring you the experience that an installation does. What I showed you through YouTube was not an experience for you, so you need to visit. You can mix music by stereo like this. You can put it into earphones, but
something you cannot mix by stereo, that you cannot catch by recording, that I’m interested in trying to perform at an installation or the event I showed you at the beginning – you can see it as video picture but we cannot reproduce the acoustic pressure. So that made me more intrigued to things we cannot reproduce or record. At the same time, I really love YouTube. Every night I’m excited listening to, like, ‘40s Duke Ellington. So this is good, computer stuff is great, I mean... both are good. Susumu Kunisaki We are under a situation in which
we need to be aware of both. Thank you. Any other question? Audience member Hello there. You collaborate with a lot of people – do you ever struggle letting things go, or embracing different personalities? Are you a naturally accepting person, or did you use any of these projects as a sort of therapy or anything like that? Otomo Yoshihide Therapy... For therapy, I would rather get a massage. [Laughs] Susumu Kunisaki You wouldn’t prefer collaboration? Otomo Yoshihide I like to collaborate with a person massaging me though. Of course it is not easy all the time. And sometime it doesn’t work well. I always work with many different people so I don’t think about it much. Many things won’t go so easy anyway. So I don’t tend to care about them that much. Alright? Thank you. Susumu Kunisaki One more person. Over there, please. Audience member Hi. Japan has produced some very important and influential noise musicians and has a longstanding history of it, yet Japan is a society built on some very longstanding traditions, and Japanese are often perceived as being polite and quiet. Do you think the desire to create noise music is a reaction to this societal behaviour? Sorry to go too deep on you. Otomo Yoshihide No problem. I would like to ask you back, but did you find that Japanese people are quiet and controlled when you came here? Audience member Not controlled, but I'm Irish so maybe you hear I'm a drunk... Otomo Yoshihide Yes, yes. [Laughs] Audience member And where I come from, the Japanese are known to be quiet and they always bow and say please and thank you. Otomo Yoshihide You are really right. [In English] But in Shibuya at midnight you can see a lot of crazy Japanese drunken people. But anyway. Let me think. I suppose most Japanese are not in a position where they can see themselves objectively. I mean, few Japanese can compare and say what is the difference between foreigners and Japanese, I guess. This is because, first, the language problem. And the other is, if you see TV shows, most of them are domestic ones. We live in very domestic circumstances. In my idea, few Japanese people compare themselves to people from other countries. That may become our drawback and also our advantage. Talking about noise music and why this happened... A backlash is one possibility, and other is, I assume, wrongly conveyed information. I regard myself as being in the first generation of noise musicians. All of my generation who play noise are influenced by rock music. When we listened to rock, we had few chances to see real American or British bands playing. We all listened to them through records, sitting in front of speakers and listened to them. We all thought rock was extremely loud. In my brain, in my head, an aspiration and a dream for rock was swelling and soaring. Rock is radical and loud and players move violently like a storm on stage. Those images alone were amplified in our brain. We saw on TV, Jimi Hendrix destroys his guitar. The Who breaking their guitars, we believed it was cool! This part of our memory was swelled. Then we got an amplifier for our guitars and went to a club. A club in Japan is so small compared to ones in the U.S. or Europe. Even still, they used Fender Twin Reverb or Roland Jazz Chorus 120 amplifiers. So when they played, turning its volume to the max, the sound was so loud that microphone feedback occurred. That maybe because I think we extremely misunderstood rock or free jazz. We imagined rock and jazz must be very, very loud. As a matter of fact, we did
performances with volume at the max. I’m wondering if that was the true reason for it. We composed music without right information and in addition, there were extreme misunderstandings. I imagine Japanese noise music was probably born by that biased information. Susumu Kunisaki So you think it was created not by coincidence but as a backlash against something? Otomo Yoshihide When Japanese noise music was born, the English guitarist Derek Bailey played a role. He visited Japan for his concerts. Many noise musicians were influenced by his concert here, like this band Hijokaidan was influenced by him, and I was too. When listening to this music, this sounds nothing close to Hijokaidan. This is such a wonderful performance of improvisations. (music: Derek Bailey - Unknown) I remember this was in 1976 or 1977. Excuse me, it was in 1978. Derek Bailey came to Japan when I was still in high school. He had concerts in dozens of cities in Japan. None of us could understand him at all. We honestly couldn’t get it but what we thought was, even if we cannot play the guitar, we can be on stage. We misunderstood in that way. He played this with super high technique, but we couldn’t realize it then. A year after his visit to Japan, small clubs in Japan were full of musicians like me copying him. “Stop it please.” The club owners told us, “No Derek Bailey.” There are some music stores on Denmark Street in London where they have posters saying “No Stairway to Heaven.” Like the music stores in London, stores in Japan banned copying him. Among the many musicians copying him and remaining misunderstood, it has evolved so much. That is one of the features of Japanese noise music. Susumu Kunisaki Limited information made misunderstandings and illusions. The situation was different from now. Otomo Yoshihide It was. Susumu Kunisaki Less information... Otomo Yoshihide Because of the lack of information, we didn’t have a chance to know what Derek Bailey was saying. For example, a 12-year-boy imagines, “what is a girl?” That kind of imagination, we had. I guess like this. Susumu Kunisaki Thank you for a solid example. Time is running out, so this is the last question. Anybody? Then you, go ahead please. Audience member Since this is the last question I’d be interested in how you see your own development in the future and if there is something you're heading to, from your perspective? Otomo Yoshihide Talk about my future. I’m 55 years old now. I’m rather thinking about my health, I’d like to work with good physical condition. Musicians around me, around our age, often lose their health. I see someone become ill. I don’t want to die yet. Audience member I wasn’t talking about your upcoming death [laughter]. Otomo Yoshihide I know, I know. At our age when we think about future, “death” comes to mind. At your age, the future is full of hopes, and many possibilities. For us, possibilities are diminishing. There maybe nothing but music that I want to do. All I think about is music. I hope I can play the guitar
till the end of my life. But in this age, I prepare myself that someday I cannot play anymore. I hope I play. Another thing I felt after the Great East Japan Disaster, I used to hesitate about speaking in front of people or giving a lecture like this. But since the quake, I’m more available for doing this if I get an offer. The reason I changed my mind is I would like to think that music dies when people die, and I still think of it this way. For example, when Charles Mingus died, we don’t need a musician like him in the next generation. He left recordings anyway. So after my death, we don’t need a musician like me. There is no need to tell what I did. But I’m saying this not especially for musicians, but also for non-musicians. I’d better tell them what I’ve seen in the world in my career of 30 years. The world I’ve seen is that I have been playing eccentric music in various places through my tours. The world I saw during my career is different from the view of people who live in one place.
There is a world they still don’t know. As I said, in Japan, I see many people not noticing the world outside of here. This is not a problem of Japan alone, but now, some people make hate speeches against Korean and Chinese people who live in various places in Japan. While seeing such people’s violence and acts of discrimination, I’d better show or tell people that I’m the one who creates and plays music with “my” philosophy, not “theirs”. I play music that sounds violent, so if there’s something wrong, my music could be taken as a message for excluding others. I’d like to raise my voice and tell them that my music is different from them. I try to speak out. Susumu Kunisaki Thank you for the time with us. In a few days, you will perform with us. Otomo Yoshihide Yes, I’m looking forward to playing music together with you all. Susumu Kunisaki Thank you very much for today, Mr. Yoshihide Otomo.

Title: Malcolm Cecil

Malcolm Cecil
Although he initially made his name in the British jazz scene, Malcolm Cecil was a key figure in the development of the synthesizer and his best-known work was made in collaboration with soul legends. After playing bass in a series of ’50s and ’60s jazz bands, Cecil was a founding member of Alexis Korner’s Blues Incorporated. But it was the possibilities provided by synthesizers that really excited him, and with Bob Margouleff he formed T.O.N.T.O.’s Expanding Head Band, releasing two albums of highly original music in 1971 and 1972. The name was an acronym of an analog synth designed and built by Cecil himself – the result was a synth on which each note sounded like a different instrument. A dazzled Stevie Wonder instantly recruited Cecil and Margouleff to his cause, making them co-producers on the series of classic albums Wonder recorded, from Music Of My Mind through Fulfillingness’ First Finale. He also had long-standing relationships with the Isley Brothers and Gil Scott-Heron, as well as with Steve Hillage, Dave Mason, Quincy Jones, and many others.
In his 2013 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, Cecil talks about creating T.O.N.T.O., what it means to produce, working with Gil Scott-Heron, and more.
Hosted by (music: Malcolm Cecil – “Laser Ballet”) Malcolm Cecil It’s really wonderful to be here in front of this very
selected... I’ve been told that you guys have been highly selected out of a
huge number of applicants, so congratulations and I’m very pleased that you’ve invited me to come and speak to you. I appreciate your attention. Torsten Schmidt Now, this wonderfully soothing recording that we just heard, which just
happens to be here in a sealed copy [picks up record] - this is the David Letterman moment - it’s actually not that easy to find so that doesn’t really help, but what have
we been listening to right there? Malcolm Cecil The last piece that you heard was called “Laser Ballet.” This was an album
that I did right after I left Stevie Wonder and the Isley Brothers and Minnie Riperton
and all of the heavy R&B music. I was what I call ‘boinged out.’ Torsten Schmidt That’s not a word they teach you in German English classes. Malcolm Cecil OK, I don’t think they teach it in any classes. What it really means is that
the main use that the synthesizer was put to in most R&B, the primary use,
was as the bass. We also used it for many other instruments. We also used it
to process the Clavinet for Stevie, but in
general, the real essence that makes the difference, I believe, between a lot
of the material we put out and the material that came before was the low end.
It was the bass, the capability that the synthesizer has of producing
incredibly beautiful bass sounds. As an acoustic bass player, an upright bass
player, I really appreciated that and it was something that was very important
in the formulation of the music, because it gave the whole flavor to the
music. The concept of having the ability to change the bass sound so drastically from something very soft and gentle to something which was really powerful and, if you like, like a lead volleyball bouncing down the room, really heavy duty bass. Most of the stuff with the R&B was of the lead
volleyball type, and that was what I meant when I said ‘boinged out.’ After a
while you hear these sounds and you get to a point when you’re programming the
synthesizer, you can’t hear any more, you don’t know what you’re doing any more, you lose complete objectivity and so you have to step back. At that point my ex-partner Bob Margouleff and I created the phrase ‘boinged out.’ I would turn to him or he would turn to me and say, “I’m boinged out,” and that
meant we had to take a break. I was pretty well ‘boinged out’ with the whole
lead volleyball bass thing, wonderful as it is. Anything, if you do it long
enough, gets to be wearing. So I was desperate to try and come up with
something softer and gentler and show that the synthesizer could be used for
something other than just powerful basslines and the occasional lead line. I
felt that it was a true instrument and, in fact, that was my attraction to the
instrument and why I started building TONTO, The Original New Timbral Orchestra, because I felt that an orchestra of synthesizers would be absolutely phenomenal and I had for many years wanted to experiment with
sounds that I couldn’t get musicians to play. Time signatures was one of the
things I couldn’t get many musicians to play, the time signatures that I
wanted to play. John McLaughlin was the only guy in England who sort of saw things
the way I saw them and we played together. In fact, the last gig I did on bass
was at the Edinburgh Festival with Johnny McLaughlin as a trio and Pete Brown,
the lyricist from Cream. He was a poet, actually, and he used to hang out and
do jazz and poetry. He used to hang out with the weirdos, which was John
McLaughlin, myself, and a few others of the younger jazz musicians at the time
in London, who were looking for something new and different. We were trying to
break away and not be just following the American lead – although that was
important, because jazz is after all an American artform and that’s what we
were playing – but we wanted to bring something different to it and one of the
things we discussed greatly was theory of vibrations and so on. John and I
were very much into vibrations and how they blended together, the harmonics
and the cycle of fifths and so on and so forth. We also realized that if you
slowed down vibrations enough you go below the limit of hearing and if you
make the vibrations such as you can hear it - in other words, not a sine wave
because that’s smooth, there’s no edge - but if you make it a pulse or
something with a leading edge, you start to get tempo. It slows down below 20
cycles, your ears start to drop away, you body starts to pick it up and it becomes tempo. So, the concept we had with time and everything was, well, why wouldn’t you be able to play harmonies in rhythm? The first obvious harmony was already staring us in the face and was the underlying underpinning of jazz, which is two against three. Well, that’s like the second and third
harmonic beating together. Now, the theory of vibrations will tell you that
you get the sum and the difference, that means you’ll get one and you’ll get four.
Well, one is the fundamental, four is two octaves above the two, which is an octave
above the fundamental, and you now have the three – is the fifth – so you have a
complete one, two, three, four, the first four harmonics. Now, if you actually do that
rhythmically, you get that very well-known – you want to hold this for a second? [passes the microphone and beats out a rhythm] One-two-three, one- two. Very African. It’s the basis of jazz, a lot of jazz is built on that two against three. But that’s harmonics slowed down, so we decided, what if you
did the five too? What if you slowed the fifth harmonic, which is the third?
We found that that worked too. To this day I still play jazz once a week on upright bass because I keep my fingers in, I go to keep my ear in, I go to keep playing and I go to keep in touch with the roots, the basic instrument. Four strings and a piece of wood, there’s nothing more basic than that. It doesn’t matter if the power goes out, I can still play. In fact, one of my
fantasies was to have a live performance where right in the middle of the
performance everything went out, including the exit lights, and then you just
hear the bass come through. Then people realise they’ve been fooled, but it
never came to be, it was just an idea. But the concept here was to create a rhythmic major chord, one-three-five, which is the first, third and fifth harmonic.
That major chord then should sound good rhythmically, and as I say, when I’m
playing jazz waltzes I’ll play five across it. The guys I’m playing with now
know what I’m doing. At first they used to think I was trying to play six and
missing. I explained to them, “No, no, you just stay where you are.” I wrote a
piece called “3/4, 4/4, 5/4,” what for and why for I don’t know but that was
the general idea. I have the drummer playing in 4/4, the piano playing in 3/4
and I play in 5/4 because nobody else could do it. That was the problem we had
with John McLaughlin, we were playing things in 21/8. Sound complicated? Uh-
uh, no. Can you count to three? Alright, you do three measures of 3/4 and a
half a measure of 3/4. Yes, I did say a half a measure, i.e. 3/8, one-and-a-half beats. So it goes: one-two-three, two-two-three, three-two-three, one-and-a-one-two-three, two-two-three, three-two-three, one-and-a-one-two-three... 21/8, doesn’t sound bad, does it? Johnny and I wrote a piece in 21/8
and played it at the Edinburgh Festival but that was part of the thing. It wasn’t until I came to America some years later that I was introduced to the Moog synthesizer and realised that this was an instrument on which I could do
anything I wanted to, any concept that I came up with. So I started
experimenting with putting the sequences into 7/4 time and playing against
them, and I got it so that I could actually feel 7/4. Until then I couldn’t
get anybody to play it long enough or often enough for me to get into it, to
get a feel for it. I think this was also true of people like Dave Brubeck with
his “Take Five,” and later on, “Blue Rondo à la Turk,” Dave Brubeck was into
experimenting with different time signatures. But that was the motivation for
me to get into synthesizers - not just that it could play different time signatures, but that it could come up with sounds that just were never anything you heard before. The opportunity to actually play with a synthesizer occurred a year after I came to the States. I’d had maybe a little brief
inkling that there was a such a thing as a Moog synthesizer. I’d seen the
credit on The Beatles records, The Wall; and I listened to The Wall and it
didn’t sound a lot like anything I really wanted to do, but it did have some
interesting things in it. I don’t know, but it didn’t have any forms in the music that was interesting stuff, I got the impression they were just recording, running the tape and playing with the knobs and seeing what came out. And that’s pretty well what I ended up doing when I ran into the first
synthesizer, which was in Mediasound. I’d been in the States by then for a
year. I don’t know how much history you want before that. Torsten Schmidt There’s a lot of that, but I think before we get into that, there’s two things
that strike me about this in particular that people find probably a little difficult when they listen to non-per se dance music. A, how to rhythmically organize it, and B, you hinted that this particular piece or this particular album was also used to be the basis for poetry and spoken word as well. Could you elaborate on that a little bit? Malcolm Cecil Yeah, one of the reasons why this album is not out there, and I didn’t push it
out there in a way to promote myself – this was after I broke up with Stevie
and my partner Bob Margouleff at the time, and I ended up with the
synthesizer, which I still have alive and well, living in upstate New York
with me about ten miles from Woodstock. This particular set of pieces, as I say, was originally done as a sort of a therapy thing for me to get away from the lead volleyball-type basslines. You’ll notice that on this particular record there are no basslines like that at all. There was a doctor who was a friend of mine, we called him Dr. Jim Levin, and he was very into fine art and
music and everything. He was very supportive and he would come down to the
studio and just hang out there and he would lay down on the couch. Every time
I would go to a bass sound and start playing, he would call out, [lofty
voice] “No lead volleyballs!” In a sense he was my therapist, I suppose. He
was never officially that, but that was sort of the role. During that time the
record company that I was making this record for was called Unity Records, and they got a
call from one Muhammad Ali, who called them up because of their name and said,
“I have these spoken word pieces that I’ve been putting together.” They were
to do with his training in the Muslim faith and he just wanted to record them
and put them out, and he thought that he would find a record company that was
an appropriate name. He found Unity Records and he just called them up because
of the name. Of course, Peter Georgi, who was the president of Unity Records,
called me and said, “I’ve got this thing with Muhammad Ali, would you produce
it for me? Because, obviously you know how to do this stuff. Hopefully, you’ll
be able to help me out with this.” So I agreed to do that and we went into the
studio and recorded five lectures. They varied from 12 minutes to about 30
minutes in length - the purpose of life, the tragedy of life, heart and god
and prayer, that was what they were about. I thought they were worthwhile things. It so happens that he did one version of one of the lectures called “God,” and I gave him a copy of the cassette of the lecture, which I’d edited all the “Um’s” and “Ah’s” out because he was just losing his speech at that time. He knew he had Parkinson’s, that’s why there was a little bit of urgency
about it, his speech was just becoming slurred and he wanted to catch it
before he couldn’t speak any more. So we had these sessions and everything and
I gave him this cassette, and I put this music behind it because it seemed
like it fitted to me and he flipped, he thought it was wonderful. He said,
“Oh, this is great, we’ve got to put it out this way.” Well, unfortunately Unity went bankrupt and then a series of unfortunate events happened after that, which prevented this record from coming out. It was going to come out , I’d been trying to work on this for 30 years, but about 15 years ago I almost got it through and crossed all the T’s and dotted all the I’s and then of
course, 9/11 happened. The record company got cold feet and said, “No, we
can’t put anything like this out about Muslim people.” I said, “But it’s
Muhammad Ali!” And they said, “Don’t care, doesn’t matter who it is. Not the
climate right now.” So it went back into mothballs. I’m still trying to get
that released. I wanted to hold this record, not have it out there on its own,
because I didn’t want it to appear like he’d just done it over that record, so
it never got released. However, the first pressing - as I say, the record
company went bankrupt - I bought out the whole stock of the pressings. I
brought a few with me today, probably not enough for everybody, but if you do
want to get one and they’re aren’t enough to go around I will take your name
and number and send one to you. But that’s the story behind the story. [laughter] Torsten Schmidt That’s the bit we should keep off the video and off eBay and all of that. [laughter] I’m really curious because, obviously, Ali at the time, many would argue he
was really instrumental in developing what was later known to be the artform
of being an MC, and he has this beautiful cadence in his speech and there’s so
much rhythm in there. It’s probably an issue a lot of people face in their
daily production work, how do you work with or against that rhythm of what you
have in a vocal track? Malcolm Cecil Well, the rhythm of the vocal track in terms of when it’s a spoken word, it’s
very easy because really there are no really important cadences that are necessary. All you have to do is make it so that it makes sense. Without the music, what we found, was it sounded a little disjointed and you heard all the page turnings and you heard all the breathing and it was just a little awkward
in the sense that like now, there’s nothing else going on. Sometimes there are
pauses. I’ll pause and go “uh-uh-uh.” I try not to do that too much because I
feel like a fish out of water, but when there is a gap. It can be filled with
something. Usually, the gaps in conversation are filled with music, this
happens in jazz. These days jazz is only played, as far as I can tell, in the
concert hall where everbody comes and just sits quietly and listens and is
very polite and applauds. Or it’s in very noisy environments, like bars and
restaurants, where it literally is background music. When the conversation
stops, the music takes over and so there’s no awkwardness. When you’re dealing
with spoken word it’s relatively easy to find those places. You can stop, you
can phrase the spoken word in with the music. Even though it has its own
rhythm they usually don’t conflict. I didn’t find it to be conflicting at all
with the particular pieces that I did with Muhammad, because you’re focusing
on him anyway. The music just acts just like it would in a restaurant or a
bar, carrying it through the little silences and awkwardnesses, and more
importantly, it was covering over the imperfections in the original recording.
Very often you can’t get him to do it again – he comes in, he sits down and he
does it. He’s not the sort of person that you can say to, “That was very good,
but could you say it again with a little more emphasis on the third word?”
He’s not going to respond to that. If you were in the ring and you said to
him, “Just hunker down a little bit and then hit him with the left,” you could
expect him to comply, but I think when it comes making records or speaking in
a certain way, there was no attempt made to regulate him. We just recorded him
wild and then I put it together as best I could. The thing that got edited was
the vocal - the thing that got moved, if anything got moved - because you
can’t really move the music, the only thing you can move are the phrases. Torsten Schmidt Seeing that, as you earlier said, it’s a room full of very smart people, they
will by now have figured out that your accent is not exactly American.
Nevertheless, the first entry in your discography is a pretty quintessential
American recording, and we wondered what your role in that one was. Let me
quickly play a bit of it. (music: Miles Davis – “’Round Midnight”) Malcolm Cecil Well, this is, of course, the Miles Davis ’Round About Midnight record that
was made in 1957. I spent probably a considerable amount of time each year
working for Crescendo records, GNP Crescendo, that’s Gene Norman Presents.
Gene Norman is the president of the label. It’s a family label, his son Neil
Norman is now running the label. Gene is in his late eighties, he’s in so-so
health, but for his age he’s doing quite well. He employed me in the capacity
of an archivist, to be in charge of looking through his library of recordings.
My job was to come up with tapes that had been stashed in there that had never
come to light. This was easy to do because he was also a promoter, a concert
promoter, and he also opened a club called the Crescendo Club, specifically
for the Stan Kenton band. Crescendo is the Kenton label, Stan Kenton and
Crescendo are like synonymous. He was a radio personality in the ‘40s and he
had a radio program five nights a week and a television program five nights a week, when there were only four TV stations in LA. So he was very famous and very rich and he opened this club called the Crescendo on Sunset Boulevard, specifically to present Stan Kenton, because there was nowhere
other than concert stages for the band to play when they went to LA, and that
was the motivation for him to open the club. Being a radio guy, whenever he did concerts and promotions he would record them. Now, in the old days - this is a bit of history - in the ‘30s before tape machines - now, tape machines were invented in Germany, they were invented by Telefunken and were only
discovered by the Allied forces when they broke into the bunker that Hitler
and Eva Braun were supposedly staying in. They came across this weird looking
thing and they didn’t know what it was. They eventually discovered it was a
tape machine. And the thing about tape machines is that you can’t hear the
surface noise that you can hear on a disc and it’s very audible. Prior to tape
machines all recordings were done on disc and that included recordings for
broadcasts. There were two ways of recording on a disc. You can record - mono, this is - you can record waggling the needle laterally, left to right, and that works quite well. You can also record waggling the needle vertically, that’s called ‘hill and dale’ recording. That also works quite good, but of course, you have problems that show up when you have large amplitudes. When
it’s left-and-right, large amplitudes will tend to cut into the groove you just cut, unless you open up the grooves of the revolution before, which requires quite a bit of engineering expertise and it’s not easy to do – unless you have a tape machine, of course. But prior to tape machines, no way. We had no capability of knowing up front whether there was going to be a loud level that would cut into the previous groove that you just cut. In other words, if
the needle’s going like this you have to open up one revolution ahead for it
not to cause an intercut. As I say, before tape machines there was no way to
do that, there was no way of time-delaying, there was no way of seeing what
was going to come next. But the radio people could use that method but they’d
have to use a very wide pitch to prevent that from happening on the fly, so
you didn’t get much recording time, it ate space like mad. Whereas with hill
and dale recording that wasn’t that problem, you could pack the grooves right
up against each other and they would go up and down. They only problem is, of
course, if you went too loud you’d throw the needle up out of the groove. It
would jump out or it would go down into the aluminium, because lacquers, which
is what they were in those days, are just paint on an aluminium disc. So the
radio people, however, decided at least with this we can record a fixed amount
of time, we can tell how much time we can record and if we do it at relatively
low level we’ll be able to record a complete half-an-hour broadcast. This they
were able to do with 33 1/3 microgroove recording, with closely packed grooves
that didn’t move from side to side but just moved up and down. So this was the
method, but the trouble was you heard all the clicks and pops. With tape you
didn’t hear that, and the upshot of all of that was, after the Second World War,
the tape machines began to be manufactured in the States. The two people who
were part of the intelligence team from the US and Allied forces that
discovered the machines in the bunker there, and later found out what they did
and how they worked, ended up being the founders of Ampex and 3M corporation.
Colonel Ranger was the 3M guy, and I’ve forgotten the name - AM somebody
Pexman or something, I can’t remember the guy’s name, but the guy who did
Ampex. He went with the traditional single, friction-driven puck, whereas
Colonel Ranger came up with what he called Isoloop which was a serrated puck
that had two different diameters and created an isolated loop to go around the
tape head. Anyhow, this was all part of the situation. Radio Recorders were a
company that recorded all types of broadcast. They had telephone lines,
ordinary, standard telephone lines and they were 600, unterminated balanced
lines. If you’ve seen 600 Ohm balanced lines, that’s where they started and
you can feed 600 Ohm balanced lines thousands of miles, you can feed them
across the country. They had high quality telephone lines fixed to every one
of these venues. So when Gene Norman, who was an old radio man who knew about
recording, he would call up radio recorders and say, “I’m putting on a concert
at the Shrine Auditorium tonight, I want you to record it.” Now, you can’t
take a lathe, a cutting lathe,
to the Shrine Auditorium. They’re not portable. They’ve got to be on a two-ton
block of concrete that’s floated so that it doesn’t get the traffic noise,
doesn’t get any vibration. You can’t move those things, so you bring the sound
to it with the telephone lines, and Gene Norman did exactly this with these
concerts. So he has all of these tapes, many of them of have never been played
since the day they came from Radio Recorders. They were just sent over and the
guy at Radio Recorders didn’t know who was on the tape, unless he was
listening and most of them weren’t. They probably used two or three lathes
because you had to have a back-up in case there was a problem technically. So
Gene Norman would record his concerts this way and all you’d find would be a
disc, which would be a 15” disc you couldn’t play on a normal player anyway,
and it would just say, “American Festival of Jazz 1957, Side 1” - no
indication who was on it, what it was. My job was to go through these discs, and later when they went to tape, they still put the tape machine at Radio Recorders, they didn’t take the tape machine to the Shrine or the Pasadena Civic or anywhere. They still did it the same way, but they substituted tape
machines for the lathes. So, Gene Norman religiously recorded all his
concerts. I’m going through these tapes and I’m listening to some of the
concert tapes. I didn’t do too much with the discs, although I was going
through them, but it was much more difficult to retreive from disc. The tapes
were pretty good. I was going through these tapes and I came across one,
“American Festival of Jazz 1957.” I thought, “Oh, maybe this is Stan Kenton.” I put it on and it’s Gene Norman introducing the Miles Davis Quintet at the Pasadena Civic 1957, the only live recording that that original quintet made. That’s with John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Red Garland on piano, Philly Joe Jones on drums and, of course, the ubiquitous Paul Chambers on bass. There are no other live recordings of that group and so I said to Gene Norman, “I’ve
found some gold here, I think we’re sitting on gold. We can release this.” He
says, “No, we can’t release it.” I said, “What do you mean, we can’t release
it?” He said, “We don’t own the rights.” I said, “How do you mean, you don’t
own the rights? You put on the concert, you paid for the recording, you paid
the band. Surely the tapes belong to you, you can release them?” He said, “No,
you don’t understand. Record contracts with artists are exclusive. It doesn’t
matter who records them, where, all that matters is when. If it’s during the
period of the contract, guess who owns the rights? The record company who
signed the artist. End of story. There’s no way we can release this.” I said,
“Well, who owns the rights?” He says, “If you can find that out, maybe we’ve
got a chance.” So I went through all the old books. I found that he was signed
to CBS at the time. Fortunately Gene, who knows everybody in the business, was
able to do a deal with CBS and they literally bought the tapes from Gene
Norman for a flat fee, something like 50 grand, and some small royalty that’s
still being paid. But the bottom line of it is, they rereleased the album that that group made in 1957 called ’Round About Midnight, which is what you heard at the beginning here, and they put a second disc out, which was the 30-minute concert that I found and that I restored. It’s probably because it’s most recent of the big ones, the top of the list. But Miles is probably one of the biggest artists I’ve ever had the pleasure to be remotely involved with,
but I didn’t record it. [laughs] Torsten Schmidt Did you meet personally him? Malcolm Cecil Oh, yes. In fact, my second child was called Miles, because my wife was pregnant with him at the time when I toured with the Miles Davis Quintet. I was in the band that opened for him, called The Jazz Five, and we played the first set and Miles played the second set and that was a six-week tour of
England. It was the first time a full American jazz group had come to England,
and I’d just got out of the Air Force in time to do that gig, which was
fantastic. I got very friendly with Paul Chambers and Miles turned out to be a
really nice guy, actually. All this turning his back and being obtuse, that’s
all a big publicity thing. He’s actually a really nice guy. The first day at
rehearsal he had Fran, his wife, I had my wife Polly, and she’s pregnant,
Fran’s pregnant. Miles comes over to me and he says, “Is that your wife?”
“Yeah.” He grabs her hand, “Come with me.” Takes her over. “This is Fran. This is Polly. You guys stick together.” [laughs] So I never actually played with him. I’d love to have, but I played opposite him and I had a personal relationship with him, which was excellent. Torsten Schmidt Let me play something else from probably around the same time. (music: Tony Crombie Quintet – “Gut Bucket”) Malcolm Cecil Yeah, this is very old. This is from my days back in England. I had to even
ask who it was. I don’t remember this one because this was a piece I did with
Tony Crombie, who was a drummer back in England in the Ronnie Scott days. I’m
playing acoustic bass on this, this is one of my early albums from before my
career in America. Torsten Schmidt What was Ronnie Scott’s? Malcolm Cecil Ronnie Scott’s is a jazz club that was founded in, I think it was 1959, 1958.
It was the first jazz club in London to be founded by a jazz musician and it
became the mecca for jazz. In fact, the British Invasion was part of the
reason for its success - that’s the British Invasion of America. We had all
sorts of American appetite for The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones, and a
number of the other popular groups from England at the time, The Who, I
believe. We had a problem because of the union situation. The same union
situation that prevented me from working later when I came to America, where
American musicians couldn’t work in England and English musicians couldn’t
work in America. So what they did, they came up with an interesting formula.
Harold Davidson was the promoter and Harold was a very smart man. He owned 51% of Ronnie Scott’s, he was the money behind Ronnie Scott’s club. He made all tour arrangements for The Beatles and The Rolling Stones and so on, he was a big promoter. And he got the unions to do a deal which he called ‘man
concerts.’ As far as the union was concerned, it wasn’t the money that the men
were paid, it was how long they played. In other words, if The Beatles played
one concert, that was considered four ‘man concerts.’ And for that, you could
get one American musician to come over and do four concerts. So they parlayed
this into a very clever scheme, where, for all the Beatles concerts and all
the Rolling Stones’, all of the pop groups that came over, we built up these
‘man concerts.’ Then Ronnie would bring over Stan Getz, JJ Johnson, Johnny
Griffin, Roland Kirk, Donald Byrd, Wes Montgomery as an individual artist, and
play with the local rhythm section. That was where I got to meet lots... I did that for four years as the bass player. The first person I played with was Johnny Griffin, and all the people I just mentioned, I played with all of those.They would do a two-week stint. So two weeks would be 14 ‘man concerts,’ not counting the all-nighters because they were counted separately. So 14 ‘man concerts’ is like three-and-a-half nights for The Beatles. So we had a
constant stream of American, top-line jazz musicians coming to Ronnie Scott’s
to play and playing with the local rhythm section. That’s why in 1961, when
Miles came over with the full quintet, that was a big deal because that had
never been before, but they had some ‘man concerts’ over. Torsten Schmidt You earlier said you just got out of the Air Force in time to play with Miles.
What were you doing in the Air Force and what did you learn there that
benefited you in your other ventures? Malcolm Cecil Good question. When I first went into the Air Force I wanted to play, of
course, and I told them – I was called up, conscription, different to the
draft. Conscription means everybody goes, it doesn’t matter. You have to be pretty well dead before they’ll not accept you, either that or a complete cripple. But the bottom line is, everybody went. Draft, one person in three. That’s the difference. At that time it was conscription in England and you got deferment if you were studying. I was studying at the London Polytechnic for a
degree in physics at the time, but I was also playing on the TV once a week
with Dill Jones and I was 19 at the time. That was what got me into the Melody
Maker polls, because I was in front of everybody’s TV every Monday night. I
would be on for three minutes and because I was so young I used to get
featured a lot and my thermodynamics professor didn’t like this much. When we
were in class he said to me – we were discussing entropy, you know what that
is? Entropy is sort of the total energy of a system – he came up with this
comment that in a machine, if you run the machine ‘round its complete cycle,
there will be some energy lost and that is known as a loss of entropy. The
next phrase is the one that got me. He said, “And so the entropy of the universe is slowly running down.” This didn’t sit with me because I had read Hoyle, the astronomer Hoyle, and I’d also read Einstein and relativity and a few other advanced tomes on Physics, because I was really interested in it. So I put up my hand and said, “Excuse me, Dr. Fewkes, there has to be a balance,
but surely in the center of a star there’s fusion going on, and isn’t that
positive entropy?” Well, that was all he needed from me. “Some people are in
this class just to get out of their service to this nation, and their service
to Her Majesty, to appear on television every week playing jazz. These sorts
of people I don’t want in my class, so you can leave now and not come back.”
That was basically his answer. So I got thrown out of the class, which ended
up resulting in - he failed me in thermodynamics, which was an essential for
the course. So, at the end of my first year, poof, that’s it, my deferment’s
over, I had to go in the forces. I go in and they say, “What do you want to
do?” I say, “I want to play.” “Well, sign here for nine years.” “Erm, what
else can I do?” They wouldn’t let me do it for National Service, no. They
said, “Well, you’re very qualified in technical stuff. We suggest you go into
radio and radar, you’ll make the most money there.” So, to cut a long story short I ended up doing nine months of training as a
radar fitter, which is down to the last nut, bolt and screw in a radar in
England. I was in charge of ground control approach, GCA radar, which is
talking people down - I didn’t do the talking, I did the fixing of the
equipment - but it’s talking people down who are flying, it’s being done by
pilots. They talk them down in bad weather, which is all the time in England,
and you’re parked in two trailers at the end of the runway. You have to be
totally self-contained and you’ve got to be totally independent of power
failures and everything, and you have to keep everything running. So, one
trailer is a power truck with two diesel generators in it. In case one goes
down, you have to bring the other one up, phase it in, flip them over –
complicated stuff. Because it’s lives in your hands, people’s lives who are
being talked down to land in bad weather. I was involved with that and then
they sent me off after I did my training - I passed out top of my class
because I was used to studying, I’d just come out of a year in the Polytechnic
on the top of my study form. They posted me to a station just outside
Newcastle upon Tyne, which was a plotting station with an EMI plotting table,
which was, of all things, voltage-controlled. One of my jobs was to maintain
that table. I did not know that it would later mean that I knew about voltage
control when it came to synthesizers, I knew exactly what was going on.
Remember, I’m the guy who has to fix this stuff, I’m not just the guy who’s
running it. I have to know every nut, bolt and screw and when it goes wrong,
it’s on me. So, I had a tremendously good training in electronics, very, very
detailed, very, very thorough, for which I am eternally grateful. It really
made a big difference. The fact that I got sent to this place, the only RAF
station in the entire world that had an EMI voltage-controlled plotting table,
and I get sent there to work on it. It’s just too serendipitous for words. Torsten Schmidt Did you know anything about how synthesis could be used for sounds back then? Malcolm Cecil No, synthesis was not even a thought, wasn’t even in my mind at that time. This was 1959. I went in 1958, I joined up, and I was in it until ‘61, I was demobbed - no idea at all that synthesizers were going to come or that voltage control would work. I did, while I was in the Air Force, design a thing which
used telephone-type switching rotors and stuff, which I called my ‘music
typewriter.’ You played on it and it would type it out in music. I also,
inadvertently, apparently invented the nine-pin dot matrix printer, because
that was how I was going to print it out and I came up with this idea of nine pins that would go out and print. I didn’t know that many, many years later, Seiko were going to do that for the Games in Toyko and come up with a dot matrix printer. Had I known, I would have patented it years before. [laughs] Torsten Schmidt Well, maybe that was the axis getting back for stealing the tape machine. [laughter] Malcolm Cecil Probably. The whole experience in the Air Force on one level was very good and
on another level was bad, because it was also in the Air Force, while I was up
in Newcastle upon Tyne, that I met Michael Jeffrey, who was to come back into my
life many years later as Jimi Hendrix’s manager and the owner of Electric Lady
studios where I worked with Stevie. He and I started a club called The
Downbeat Club. On the same day that Ronnie Scott opened Ronnie Scott’s in
London, we opened the Downbeat in Newcastle upon Tyne and I believe that club is
still running. It turned out that Michael Jeffrey was a high-ranking officer
in the British secret service. I didn’t know it at the time. He did arrange
for me to have a posting down to London because he knew I wanted to go down
and play in the jazz clubs, but it was in exchange for me handing over to him
my shares in the club, which I was happy to do, because I knew that there was
no way that I could keep track of anything that was 300 miles north. In
England, 300 miles is like you might as well be on the other coast over here. It’s like 3000 miles in America today. Then, 300 miles in England was like that. Torsten Schmidt Probably something else from England around the time, a little later though. (music: T. Rex – “Get It On”) Malcolm Cecil Well, what can I say? I worked with a band in England called Alexis Korner’s
Blues Incorporated, which pretty much every British jazz musician of any note
went through. And not just jazz musicians, but rock & roll musicians. Alexis
was the person who is probably responsible for the blues still being a viable
form of music. It had died in the States, he brought it back to life in
England and it was reimported with the British Invasion. It was Alexis that
was at the bottom of that. Alexis had everybody and anybody that was any good
in his band at some point, including Mick Jagger, and I was in the band for a
while. The band was a constantly moving band. But this was to come back later
in 1972 when I was working with Stevie Wonder at that time and the big problem
was to break Stevie to the white audience. He was big in R&B, he was big
in the black music market, but... Torsten Schmidt Big in Italy as well. Malcolm Cecil That may be true. I wasn’t there, so I’ll take your word for it. Torsten Schmidt I wasn’t even an afterthought. [laughter] Malcolm Cecil Anyhow, we came to the realisation, that in order to break him to white audiences, we had to do something that would get him in front of them. My lawyer was Johanan Vigoda at the time, who was also Stevie’s lawyer, or actually in the process of becoming Stevie’s lawyer, which didn’t bode well
for me in the long run, but at that time we were all one family. He’s a very
good lawyer, he’s a doctor of law from Harvard. You know what they teach in
Harvard that’s different to every other law school? The art of distraction. Every Harvard lawyer that I’ve come up against has been an expert in the art of distraction. It took me a while to figure it out, but I did in the end. Anyhow, Johanan and I were talking and Jo said to me, “Do you know anybody in The Rolling Stones?” I said, “Why?” He said, “Well, I see here in Variety
they’re going to do an American tour and it would be great if we could get Stevie to open for them.” I said, “Well, as it happens I know Mick.” We get a call through and using me as the introduction, Jo gets through and they connect business-wise, and basically, the conversation went something along the lines of, “Hi, this is Malcolm. I want to introduce you to Johanan Vigoda,
he’s my lawyer. We wanted to ask you, do you know Stevie Wonder?” “Oh yeah, we know Stevie. Little Stevie Wonder, we like him.” Next minute we’ve got a deal, Stevie’s opening for the Stones’ 1972 tour – big, huge tour. We’d just put out Talking Book,
we’d just been roasted by Motown for not having a single on Music of My Mind. The single that we had on there, “Mary wants to be a Superwoman” [“Superwoman / Where Were You When I Needed You”], Motown didn’t consider worth pushing, so of course, it didn’t make a hit. So we didn’t have a hit
single, but it was our fault, of course. We decided we were definitely going to have two hit singles, one opening each side on Talking Book. The first one was “Superstition,” and the second one was “Sunshine Of My Life.” And those two songs literally broke Stevie to the white audience and broke him through in 1972, it was the biggest thing that happened to him. Torsten Schmidt Nevertheless I’m a little bit baffled. So the main link-up was, what was your
involvement in the T. Rex session there? Malcolm Cecil T. Rex, I did the recordings of all the vocals when they came over. Marc Bolan
from T. Rex was a very strange guy. He drove cars with his eyes shut, that’s
how he died, driving a car closing his eyes. He was a really strange guy, but
he was an incredible singer. I did the engineering on Electric Warrior and
he was the first person who I ever was able to record multiple vocals and it
sounded like it was just doubling. He sang exactly the same every time. We
had, I think it was a 12-track machine at the time, a 1” 12-track we were
working with. I think six or seven tracks were filled up with instruments and
he just went one after another. I think we did the vocals on Electric Warrior in, I think it was two afternoons. We did all the vocals on all the songs, multi-tracking them, just like that. He went straight through, never had to retake anything, an amazing vocalist. Torsten Schmidt What studio was that at? Malcolm Cecil Media Sound. Tony Visconti was the producer of that one. Torsten Schmidt What happened in between? How did you get to be the recording engineer on this
one and out of army? I feel there’s a little gap there. Malcolm Cecil A little gap, yeah. When I came out of the Air Force I went to work at
Ronnie’s for a number of years and that was when I played with a lot of the
musicians, the American musicians I mentioned. Then I got to a point where I
wanted to progress and I wanted to go into a different area of music and experiment and be a more rounded musician and be accepted more, because I was getting this thing about, “Oh, jazz musicians can’t read music,” and, “They can only play jazz.” This used to infuriate me. The BBC advertized for a principal bass player for their new radio orchestra and it’s the charter to
the Queen that they’ve got to advertise in Melody Maker, they have to take
auditions to everybody. So we did the audition for the BBC and I passed it and
became principal bass to the BBC radio orchestra. At the same time I had my
own consultancy business, because when I came out of the Air Force I needed to
make money for my wife and kid. I had this electronics consultancy business
and I was building equipment for musicians, Georgie Fame & The Blue
Flames, and I built a PA system. You couldn’t buy PA systems in those days.
Today, you just walk down to any of the stores on 47th Street, 48th Street. Torsten Schmidt They’re not there any more. Malcolm Cecil They’re not there any more? It’s a while since I’ve been in the city. But you
can go on the net and you can buy PA systems coming out your ears. In those days they had to be custom-built, there were no such things. I was doing guitar amp repairs for Boosey & Hawkes, and they got an enquiry from somebody who wanted a PA system, and that’s how it started. Then I went on to
put the sound system in Ronnie Scott’s and the Establishment Club and Prince
Charles Club in England. I was doing all of that type of thing, of course,
burning the candle at both ends - BBC during the day, Ronnie’s at night and my
business in between - burning the candle at three ends. Of course, guess what?
My health gave out. I ended up getting two collapsed lungs and they wouldn’t tell my wife that I was going to survive between the operations - two operations, while they were operating on the one side the other side went down. So, I’m very lucky to be alive, and after I came out of that operation
they told me I had three years to live, and that changed my whole outlook on
life remarkably. So, my wife and I decided that I was going to give up my
position at the BBC and I needed to go to a warmer climate. They told me
Arizona or Johannesburg, both of them 9000 feet above sea level with an
average of nine hours of sunshine a day, which was what I needed, apparently,
to recover. I felt not strong enough to go to the States, so I went to South
Africa and this was during apartheid and that was not a very good experience.
I was there for a year, and at the end of it my wife had to leave for England
in a hurry, and I had to get smuggled out by a student of mine, a bass playing
student, who was South African. He was Afrikaans-speaking, which made him
special compared to English speaking South Africans, who were considered to be
very, very low on the totem pole. Basically, they wanted to throw me in jail
for putting on mixed race concerts, and whilst it worked in Cape Town it didn’t
work in Jo’burg. So I left, sneaked out through Mozambique and got a ship to
America. We were supposed to go through the Suez Canal, Mediterranean to New
York, but there was the Six Day War and the Suez Canal was full of sunken
ships. So we ended up going across the Pacific and Malaysia, Singapore,
Philippines and ended up on the West Coast of America in San Francisco. [laughs] So I entered through the back door, came in through San Francisco. I’m very glad I did because it gave me a very, very positive view of the States. I was in California for a year during which time I tried to play, but I ran into the reverse problem from the other side of the Atlantic with the union and not having a green card and all this stuff, big deal problems. So I ended up
having to fall back on my technical expertise and I got a job at Pat Boone’s
studio at Sun West as chief engineer there and put in the first 16-track
studio in LA. Later, at the end of that year, I moved to New York, because I
tried three times, couldn’t get in through the immigration in LA. It was all
to do with the Civil Rights Act, and the fact that there was no longer a
British quota that was never filled and you just walked in if you were British. Now I was standing in line behind everybody, Mexicans, Orientals, everybody who was coming into California, which was a very popular spot, so I was like 9,000,375 in line. I ended up going to New York, basically on my way home, and did a six-week stint at the Record Plant as chief engineer, during which time I learned a great deal and met a lot of very good people, and met the gentleman who later introduced me to Stevie
Wonder. A guy called Ronnie Blanco, who I mistakenly thought worked for the
studio but actually turned out to be the husband of the receptionist. He was
trying to keep an eye on her because she was having an affair with - what’s his name, the ‘Wall of Sound’? - Phil Spector. [laughter] Sometimes I remember people by their other names. He was helping me out and I didn’t realize for four days that he didn’t work there, it was very funny, but
we’re still friends and he’s been a big catalyst in my life. He’s a bass
player, too, and he later introduced me to Stevie, because he played with
Stevie, and he was the one who brought Stevie to me at Media Sound after I
finished the six-week stint at the Record Plant, which was basically to get
the place ready to go public for the first time. They had to have the
equipment all in order and everybody had to be fired, all the staff, because
they weren’t union - the union thing keeps coming up - but a different union,
this was the electricians’ union, the mixing engineers’ union, whatever it was
back then, it’s now defunct, I believe. I think it’s still around in the film
business but not in the record business. Of course, none of the record plant
employees were union. What was happening was, TVI was buying out the Record
Plant for like $5 million and when the engineers heard this was happening they
were breaking the equipment, because they knew that if the equipment didn’t
pass muster the deal would not go through. My job was to be a scab and come
and fix the equipment in the middle of the night that they were breaking and I
was pretty successful at that. Chris Stone, at the end of the stint, gave me a
piece of paper and said, “Go and see this man and tell him he needs you.” On
the piece of paper was written, “Bob Walters, Media Sound, 315 W 57th Street.”
And I did what he said. I’d never done that before in my life but I went and gave them this piece of paper and said, “I’ve got to see Bob Walters. Chris Stone says he needs me.” Bob Walters said, “What do you do?” I said, “I’m a technical engineer, I fix stuff.” “Come on up.” He got his chief engineer to interview me and half way through the interview, it switched because I had a magnetometer with me. The first thing he asked was, “How do you align a tape
machine?” I said, “Well, first you clean it and then you check to see if the heads are magnetized.” He looked at me and said, “Well, how do you that?” I seized the opportunity and I picked up my magnetometer and said, “With a magnetometer, of course. You don’t have one?” The interview flipped, all of a sudden, I was interviewing him. [laughs] It turned out I got the job as chief engineer, and he didn’t get fired, we kept him on as the daytime chief engineer, he was a nine to five sort of guy. He was good, but they needed somebody who was more,
shall we say, oriented towards the record industry, so that was where I came
in. Torsten Schmidt Who was recording there at the time? Malcolm Cecil Richie Havens, that was my first client, Jimmy Spheeris. It was not so much a
recording studio for records as it was an ad studio. Madison Avenue booked it out, our strings, our horns, our harp, and this is where the synthesizer was. This is where the first part of TONTO came in, because when I first walked in there, there was this synthesizer, a big Moog 3C sitting in the iso-booth of Studio A. I thought, “Oh, this is great, I’ll get to mess around with this
thing.” I spent a lot of time looking at it and it had an ignition switch on
it, to turn the power on and off. I thought, “That’s very interesting,” and I
made some enquiries and found out it didn’t belong to the studio. It belonged
to this guy Bob Margouleff, who apparently only showed occasionally and very
late at night. Well, that was my time. I would come in at five and work. I’m
working on the console in Studio A one night, about five nights after I
started work. This guy walks in with a fur coat on, it’s winter, and he’s got
this hair down to his rear end, really long, long hair. Now I had wide hair,
he had long hair. He walks in and I realized straight away this must be Bob
Margouleff. So I say, “You must be Bob Margouleff.” “Yes, that’s right, and
you must be the new maintenance engineer.” We had heard about each other. He
says, “Tell me, do you know how to run this?” – and he points to the board,
which I’ve got half open. I say, “Well, I’d better. I have to fix it.” He says, “Nobody ‘round here will show me how to run this thing. Will you show me how to run it?” I looked at him and I said, “Do you know how to run that thing?” - and I pointed to the Moog. He says, “I’d better. I own it.” I said, “I’ll tell you what, I’ll show you how to run this and you show me how to run
that.” He sticks his hand out and he says, “Deal,” and we shook on it and that’s how we started in partnership. We started that night and started trying to record things and it was all experimental. It wasn’t until six months that later that Herbie Mann, who I’d played with at Ronnie Scott’s, walked in the door and saw me standing there. “Oh, what are you doing here? Malcolm from
Ronnie Scott’s, right?” “Yeah, I’m here now.” “What are you doing?” “I’m a
maintenance engineer at the studio.” “Really, I didn’t know you did that. Are
you doing any music?” “I’m playing a little bit with Jim Hall.” I was playing
at the Guitar Club with Jim Hall doing subs for Ron Carter, because there was
this black-white thing going on in jazz at the time and Ron Carter was getting
a hard time because Jim Hall was white and Ron Carter wasn’t, so there was problems going on. So Ron wouldn’t show very often at the Guitar Club, which was like four, five nights a week that Jim Hall was down there. The Guitar Club was a block and a half from Mediasound so Jim Hall would call me up
because I was playing on Sunday afternoons with the New York Jazz Band, with
Al Cohn, Zoot Sims, Bill Berry, Billy Watrous and Jim Hall was on guitar and
we had really top line players, it was a great band, and about 50 people in
the audience max. So he would call me up and say, “Ron didn’t show again
tonight” - he’d already done the first set - “You want to come down and play
the last couple of sets with me?” So I just grabbed my bass and ran down. My time was my own, I would go back and work until four, five in the morning, as long as I got my work done nobody cared. That was pretty well what I was doing at the time. I said to him I’m doing a little bit of that, talking now to Herbie Mann. I said, “What are you doing here?” He said, “I’ve come to check
on my group that’s recording downstairs in Studio B.” I said, “Oh, that’s the
16-track studio I just installed.” That was the first 16-track studio in New York. He said Nesuhi and Ahmet Ertegün had advised him not to take out this huge amount of money he’d made from an album called Push Push that had made a huge hit in Japan. They said, “No, leave the money in and
start a record label and then if any of the albums take off, you’re in really
good shape, but if they don’t the money just gets written off. Otherwise you’re
just going to pay it in taxes.” Torsten Schmidt There was a different tax scheme at the time, right? Malcolm Cecil Yes, this was when it was very common for rich people to invest in records. That’s how Unity Records was, Unity Records that put out my Radiance album. It was like a tax thing. Peter Georgi would go and speak to very rich people who needed to write off $10,000 or $10,000,000 in some cases - I don’t think he ever got that high, but $10,000 he would get. He’d get artists like myself and fund us and that was how record labels worked. The idea was if you
invested, it came out of what you would have paid in taxes and it was a very
good system because it kept the industry going really well. There were a lot
of well-funded projects at that time, that was at the height, in the heyday of
the industry. So I said to Herbie, “After you’ve finished with your group
downstairs, maybe you want to come up and check out this stuff I’m doing on
synthesizer.” He goes, “Synthesizer? Synthesizer, you?” Because I was a real
purist when he knew me in England. I said, “Look, don’t knock it ‘til you’ve
heard it.” He did come up, and I played him the first track, which was a track
called “Aurora,” which was the first thing that we had ever tried to put together on synthesizer that first night, Bob and I. I sort of put dim lighting on in the studio and everything and invited him in and sat him down and played him this. (music: T.O.N.T.O.’s Expanding Head Band –
“Aurora”) Malcolm Cecil [comments over music] It’s like the birth of the universe. We were trying to write timeless music, music that could have been written at any time in
history. Audience Member [inaudible] It can even get as in depth as to... Malcolm Cecil I hate to break you off here, but do you think you can do five words or less,
or preferably one? Anybody? What does a producer do? Audience Member Produce. Malcolm Cecil Produce, yeah, that’s not the word, that’s cheating. OK, this was taught to me
by Clive Davis when I failed to get Stevie Wonder to sign off on “Superstition.” He wrote it for Jeff Beck and we recorded it and spent $40,000 on the recording and getting him over and putting up the band and hotels and studios and you name it.
Anyway, $40,000 later we have “Superstition” in the can and I don’t have
clearance from Stevie in writing, because it’s hard to get Stevie to sign
anything. The only contract I had with Stevie was to stop work, never had a
contract of any description with him. So basically, I got hauled over the
coals by Clive Davis, who was Jeff Beck’s label at the time. It was Epic
records, which was under CBS’s heading at the time, which was before Arista
when Clive was still at the top of CBS. He called me at the office and
basically said - he asked me that question, “Do you have clearance for
‘Supersition’?” I said, “Well, verbally.” He says, “No, no, not verbally. I
want something on a piece of paper.” And I said, “Well, no, I don’t have
that.” He said, “You call yourself a producer?” I said, “Well, yes.” He said,
“Well, what sort of producer are you?” I said, “I think I’m a very good one.”
And I’m sort of trying to draw myself up to full height, sitting there, get the back straight, you know? So he says, “I don’t think you even know what a producer does.” So I said, “Well, yeah,” and I went off into something similar to what we heard from this very nice young lady here. And he did exactly what I did. He went, “Five words or less, preferably one,” and I had the same
reaction. He says to me, “A producer gets it done. You want one word? Delivery!” That’s your job as a producer, is to deliver. He says, “You didn’t deliver, I’m not paying these bills.” Expensive lesson, but that’s what a producer does. So there you go, you got it for free, but that’s because you’re
bright. I wasn’t so bright. [laughs] Torsten Schmidt There’s a nice little video that we could probably use for - because I feel
like there might be one or two more stories we would like to hear, despite
time constraints, so if we use this little video for an emergency bathroom
break, it runs for about four minutes. So do you want to see this? (video: excerpt of TONTO & Stevie Wonder
documentary / applause) Torsten Schmidt There’s a million and one questions from that bit alone, and we also hear
there’s this thing called the Internet where there’s a longer version of a
similar documentary around as well, so you might know people in this building
who will be able to pass some of that on, maybe. I don’t really know where to
start to be honest. The one thing is, obviously, when you now go to the Motown
museum and they tell you how Berry Gordy in his wisdom has detected that artists needed
to go a different way and needed to take creative control and so on. Somehow,
that’s one side of the story, right? Malcolm Cecil Yeah, that makes sense from Berry. From his point of view he would, I’m quite sure, say something like that. The reality is that Stevie became 21 and in Illinois, which is where he lived, in Detroit, that’s where Motown was started – when he turned 21, you come into your majority, which means that any contracts that you had signed when you were under 21 were now null and void.
Well, Stevie had discovered when he was 17 that he didn’t own his publishing. Now, for those of you who don’t understand how big that is, let me point out to you that for an artist or for a composer, publishing is where the money is. You don’t make money on your records or on your live performances usually. Big money is in publishing. So when Stevie realized that he didn’t own any of his publishing, not any - Jobete, the publishing arm of Motown owned it - he
clammed up. Because, what he used to do was, he would compose a song and then his musical director, Gene Keys, very nice guy, very beautiful man, very knowledgable, very musical, he would sit down with Stevie. Stevie would play the tune, Gene would write it out, and then Gene would take it away, arrange it for orchestra, go into the studio, record with the musicians that Motown provided him with, all without Stevie. Then Stevie would be called in and a
Motown staff producer would tell him where to sing, how to sing, what to sing
and just generally produce him in the Motown manner, and then send him away while they went back and did the mix. And Stevie basically hated this because it never came out as he said. This is how we got Music Of My Mind, he said,
“It never comes out like the music in my mind. The music never comes out like
it is in my mind.” And he wanted to go with the synthesizer for that reason. So the reality is that Stevie became 21 and no longer was bound by those contracts. So he went to Motown and said, “OK, I’m not signing with you again, I’m not going to re-sign.” Berry Gordy hit the roof and Stevie told him, “I want you to pay me what you owe me.” His lawyer Charles King had figured out
that they were owed $3.1 million. The most that Charles King could get out of Motown at that time was the point-one. Stevie got $100,000 put into his trust-fund account, as he called it, and that was what we used to make Music of My Mind and Talking Book, because he was not under contract to Motown at all during the making of Music of My Mind. And that’s one of the reasons I never
had a contract with Stevie, because he didn’t have a contract with a record
company, so there was nobody [to send a letter of direction]. As you may know –
if you don’t know you should know and I will tell you now – if you have an
artist who’s got a label deal already and you’re producing him, you have to a get a letter of direction from the artist to the record company to get paid, because they’re going to pay you out of his money, they don’t pay you separately. Now, that’s the way it was back then. Obviously, things change but that is the basic rule, is that the record company they pay the artist and now if the artist goes and gets his own producer, he has to pay him and he has to
make arrangements. So, there being no contract with Motown, or with anybody
else for that matter, there was nobody to send a letter of direction to
anyway. Plus you have to remember, I personally had been told I only had three
years to live, so what was the point in raising a huge hullaballoo about
futures that I will probably not even live to see? At least that’s the way I
saw it at the time. It was not on my front burner, shall we say. [laughs] More
important to me was making the music, learning to use the synthesizer and
answering all the unanswered questions, musical questions, in my head about
things, like how many intervals are there in an octave and so on. I’ve got a
whole proof about how you can make cycles, resolving cycles, of many numbers
of different notes. Twelve is just one, the cycle of fifths is just one. You
can use 17 tones, you can use 19, 22, 24, there are a number of different
numbers that will actually come out and give you a resolving cycle of fifths.
As I say, I’ve got all the mathematical proof of all this, plus, it all bears
out in reality. One of the songs on the Tonto album, “Riversong,” the
lead line sounds very Middle Eastern. It’s in 17-tone scale. Now, how did I
get a 17-tone scale on a synthesizer, you ask? You may well ask. Well, I will
tell you whether you ask or not. Normally, you tune a synthesizer so it goes C to C as an octave. But what if you were to tune C to F as the octave? That
would give you 17 tones. If you want to do 19 tones, you tune C to G as an
octave. You can do it on the one upstairs. It sounds very strange but when you
actually start to play it, you will find with a 17-tone there is a diatonic
and two pentatonic scales you can play and with 19-tone there are two diatonic
and one pentatonic scale. And, of course, both of them have a chromatic scale.
So there are more than 12 tones that can be experimented with. This is something that I was struggling with, these whole concepts and this was what I was trying to figure out and trying to prove in my own way, being partially scientific, partly musical and a lot feeling and spiritual because the
importance of music isn’t the technicality of it, it’s the emotion of it, it’s
the message it carries. It’s, what does it do to you? How does it make you
feel? It’s all about feeling, and if the music has no feeling, then it doesn’t
matter how many tone scales it’s written in, it doesn’t matter how complicated
it is, it’s meaningless. It has to have some sort of feeling. So, all these
theoretical ideas I had were really starting points to get me to a new place -
or as Berry Gordy would say, open up my head, to some extent. After playing
jazz with some of the greatest jazz musicians in the world and then playing
classical and what we could call ‘straight’ music, classical was only a
50-year period. Everybody thinks, classical music, “Oh yeah, that’s that long-
hair stuff.” There’s only a 50-year period really that was classical. Before
that was Baroque and after it came Romantic music, it’s not all one thing. The
approach really is that it has to convey something. Music is about emotion and
a lot of music is verbal. However, that does strike a problem sometimes
because it requires, whoever is listening to it, to understand the language,
and if you happen to not be of the native tongue that the song is written in,
then it might as well not have any words. And as far as music being a universal language is concerned, I’ve got big issues with that. It’s not a universal language, OK, clearly not. A universal language means everybody will understand the same meaning. OK, what does this mean? [sings/scats: Julius Fučík - “Entry of The Gladiators”]
Clowns, circus, right? But who knows the title of that piece? What did the
composer intend? It’s called “The Entry of The Gladiators” - people going to
their death! Now, I don’t know what that’s got to do with clowns. It’s usage,
it’s the fact that it’s always been associated and used as clown music in
circuses, so that’s the association. If you go on the net and you look up
Javanese or Balinese gamelan, there’s some really good stuff on there. There’s
some rubbish on there too, but there’s some really good stuff, a real Javanese
gamelan. They obviously know what they’re doing, there’s like 30 of them and
they’re working in groups and they’re all going... [sings several extremely
fast rhythms] And they all know what they’re doing, clearly they’re all doing
it together. I don’t know what it means. I don’t know whether it’s a dance of
war, I don’t know whether it’s a marriage, I don’t know whether it’s
celebrating the season, I don’t know what the music is about. I have no idea,
but clearly they do. The thing about music that’s universal is music itself.
Every culture has music, there isn’t a culture on earth that does not have
music. I teach music up at Columbia Green community college, and I always start
off – I teach music appreciation and jazz history and history of rock & roll
roll, but the jazz history people, the rock & roll history people, just the
history of music, period - they’re not all musicians, and they’re not getting
qualifications in the arts, they’re not in there to get a fine arts degree.
They’re in there to get three hours of credit in the humanities for their GDE.
That’s what they’re there for and guess what we do? I get a deal with them on the first day, I tell them just what I told you, music, basically it’s a
completely universal thing that every culture has. The class is a little
tribe, we’re a little group of people - there’s some music in here, we have
our own music. We don’t know it yet, but there’s music in this room. Well,
this room obviously, but I’m talking about my community college class. Every
semester we put on a concert with these kids. Many of them never, ever played
or been on stage - and some of them for good reason. But the bottom line is, they get an opportunity to stand up and do that and those of them who can’t or are too embarrassed to do it, just can’t get over it, they’ve got to do something to contribute towards the event. One lady usually cooks food for everybody between the rehearsal and the performance and for the outside people. Somebody does the posters, somebody else does the invitations to the
bigwigs. We spread it around and they do it, I don’t do it. I make them do it,
because this is the music of that little tribe, and it’s really to make this
point that there is music everywhere. Music itself is ubiquitous, it’s everywhere on this earth and in my opinion it’s the underpinning of the entire human race. It’s the one thing that distinguishes us as a race from the animals. Now, I can’t say that with true definition because I don’t speak
bird, I don’t speak whale, I don’t speak dog. I speak a little cat, that’s
because I live with three of them, it rubs off after a time. You get “me-out”
means open the door, “me-in” means open the door the other way. [laughter] But in general, music, I believe, is what distinguishes us. When Bob and I
first started putting this T.O.N.T.O.’s Expanding Head Band stuff together, particularly “Jetsex,” which doesn’t have any pitched sounds until the very end, it’s only got like three notes in the whole piece - and we asked the question, “Is this music?” I went
to the dictionary of music, the Penguin Library Dictionary of Music, it’s a typical British thing, this paperback I had. I looked up “definition of music”: “Sounds that are grouped together by people for other people to hear,” or words to that effect. In other words, music is sounds that are intended to be played or put together for other people to hear. They’re not just put together in a vacuum. So, that’s music. As soon as I saw that definition I
turned around to Bob and said, “Yep, it’s music. We put this together for
other people to hear, it’s music.” It doesn’t have to have any other
attribute, and then it all becomes a matter of taste. There are four points of view when you’re making a record or when you’re
producing any piece of music that’s going to go out there, that is seriously
intended to be distributed. The four points of view are really like geometrical points, you can draw them - the parallel between geometry. The four points of view are, first of all, the artistic point of view, which is
the creator, whoever created it. Without the creator, there’s nothing. I’m not talking about the creator, I’m talking about the piece of music. Without somebody composing or writing the piece of music there’s nothing for any of the other people to do. So that’s the primary thing, is the writing. The second function is the producer. The producer gets it done, the producer gets
the artist’s idea from an idea in the artist’s head, to something tangible
that other people can actually hear. That’s the producer’s job and it’s a
little different a point of view to the artist. The artist is trying to get
his or her vision out, whereas the producer is trying to extract that vision
and perfect it and improve upon it and clarify it. The third person or the
third point of view that is absolutely necessary in the creation process,
where you’re actually creating this product, is of course the technical person, the engineer. They come from a very different point of view. Their job is to make sure that there’s no technical imperfections, that there’s no things that are going to come up and bite you later and give you big problems down the line. Their job is to make sure that every nuance possible is picked
up and there’s absolutely no point in having somebody do the most beautiful, beautiful, delicate passage if the mic is three feet away and you can’t hear what he’s doing. If you’ve got to crank it up and all you hear is like ‘sss’ through the whole thing, that’s not going to work. So engineering has to also come from a musical point of view. But those are the only three points of view
necessary to create the product itself, the actual sounds. OK? And the points have to have lines connecting them, just like in a geometrical figure, and the lines are lines of communication and they have to be two-way to be strong. In other words, the engineer has to have a strong line of communication with the producer and the artist, because when the producer says, “I want you to go
back to the bridge,” the engineer has to be able to interpret it, so that’s 1
minute 22, and knows where to take the machine - whether it be tape or solid
state - back to the point that you want to go in. He has to be able to
translate musical and technical terms backwards and forwards, talk to the
artist in artistic terms not technical terms. He doesn’t want to say, “Oh,
when you sing that 320 frequency it really bothers the equipment.” He’s not going to talk to him like that. He’s just going to say, “Hey man, you know when you get up to the second in your middle register, the upper part there, can you back off the mic a bit?” That’s artist speak rather than tech-speak, but he may turn round to the producer and say, “Look, shall I put him on track
22 or track 24, which one are we going over?” That’s different speak, it’s a
different line of communication.These lines of communication have to be two-
way. The producer has to talk to the artist, “Hey man, you know when you get
to that line, give me a little more oomph there, it’s the key, that’s the
hook, we need the oomph in there, give me some oomph.” Or, “Give me a little
more green on the snare drum, guy. That snare drum’s not sounding green
enough.” Whatever is necessary to communicate, whatever language you use. So
you have these three points of view and you have therefore six lines of
communication - three two-way lines - which forms a very strong triangle and
that triangle creates an area. That area is the area of operation in the
studio, that’s the area that you work in. But that’s only three parts of the
story. How many records have ended up not going anywhere? How many people in this
room have worked on a record that didn’t go anywhere? Yeah, well, it’ll be all
the hands when you’re another ten years older, because it happens. The bottom
line here is that the fourth point of view that’s needed cannot be in the same
area, it has to be outside that area. So, if you have the area of operations,
say, on the floor here, you have to have another point of view up here that is
responsible for distributing and marketing and putting that thing out. That is
your record company, that is your sales arm if you wish. That’s another point
of view, and if that is going to be strong, that will create now a figure
which has a volume, it’s a tetrahedron. Obviously, the bigger the volume, that’s the volume of business, that’s how many records you sell. So the further away from the area of operation you can keep Mr. Moneybags, the bigger hit you’re liable to have. And the more you can keep him at the tip of a
point, the more penetration you’re going to have, because that’s the whole
idea. So if you follow that model in your head, you’ll have a model of how the
product works. That’s the model I’ve always used and it’s worked for me. Now,
they can be the same person. You can be the producer, you can be the engineer,
you can be the artist, but to be all three at once - not possible because
they’re different points of view. So when you’re an artist, focus on creating.
When you’re in front of that microphone, forget about the tape machine, forget
about the technical things, forget about telling the engineer what frequency
to turn up. Let him do his job, just focus on getting your job done, get that
emotion out there. If you are the producer, focus on getting it done, focus on
delivery, your job is to deliver a product that is salable. That’s what your
job is. And if you are the engineer, focus on getting everything to perfection
that you can, do your job as best you can. Whoever you are, set up lines of
communication with the other people. If you’re functioning in two functions,
you can’t do it at the same point in time. If you’re in the studio and you’re
singing and now there isn’t a producer, it’s just somebody on the other side
pressing buttons for you - maybe your old lady, your old man, whatever.
There’s no production happening there, so you’ve got to go through the door to
the other side of the glass, whether it be real or figurative. As you go
through the door take your real or figurative hat - take off your artist hat,
put on your producer’s hat. Now you walk in, now listen to it like it’s somebody else singing or somebody else performing and say, “What would I tell that person, how would I improve that, how would I produce that?” Same thing is true if you are the engineer. Your job is to absolutely make sure that
there are no technical problems, no technical hitches, and that you do not
destroy a work of artistic brilliance because of a technical flaw - very
common mistake. “Oh, we got to do that again.” Why? “Oh, there was a pop.”
Well, deal with it. Deal with it. The rest of the tape was like, huh? We’re
not going to get that again. I know that down here. Listen with your soul,
listen with your heart, don’t listen just with your ears and don’t let
everything come from cerebral land either. It’s got to move you. If it doesn’t
make the hackles on the back of your neck stand up, if it doesn’t make the
hairs on your back stand up, it ain’t a hit. When you hear a hit you’ll know it because the hairs on the back of your back [will stand up]. That’s what happens to me. This is a hit – it ain’t a hit yet but this is going to be a smash. That’s probably, out of the last five ten minutes of what I’ve told
you, is probably more useful than anything else I’ve told you today. How are
we doing? Torsten Schmidt Well, we could go on for a minute. Speaking of hands-on things, the one thing
that strikes one, once they see pictures of the TONTO – [shows images on
screen] and that’s one example of it, or let me pull up another one - its
ergonomics and you saw it a little bit when we saw Stevie perform earlier, and the mic positioning as well. You seem to care a great deal about the ergonomics of what people are doing there. Can you explain that a little bit using this as an example here? Malcolm Cecil Yeah, the way TONTO got to be the shape it is - that’s not a fisheye lensm photograph, that’s exactly how TONTO is. It actually curves around, those cabinets appear to be curved. They’re in fact 17” racks, that’s 19” rack equipment with the ears taken off, makes it 17” wide to keep it a bit more
elegant. TONTO originally came in cases much like the Moog 2C that’s upstairs, that you’ve I’m sure seen in what is it, studio 1 upstairs? Wulf’s new acquisition. I was
just trying to think about the best way to put this. The time when we first
got TONTO it was in a cabinet much like that one. And then as time went by we
acquired a second Moog 3C, which came out of a place called Electric Circus,
which was a nightclub that had a fire and the cases had been somewhat scorched
on the outside. The modules were fine, everything worked, but the cases had
been singed so we picked it up for real cheap. Torsten Schmidt Real cheap at the time is what exactly? Malcolm Cecil Real cheap at the time was about four, five thousand. Torsten Schmidt That was real, real cheap then. Malcolm Cecil Yes, they were about $15,000 new. Torsten Schmidt So it still was the price of a car. Malcolm Cecil Oh yeah, but cheap for what it was. What we did was, we put the two side by
side and in order to try and play it we had the keyboard on a tea trolley, on
wheels. We would pull the keyboard from one end of the instrument to the other
and we got to be very tired very quickly. This was not the way to work. So we
got together with John Storyk when we went to Electric Ladyland. He was the
architect who designed Electric Lady studios. When we got together with John,
he was a Buckminster Fuller student. Now, I’ve never studied with Buckminster
Fuller, but I’m very into geodesic domes and triangulation and his whole
philosophy and so when I found that John Storyk had actually studied with the
man I was like -[ makes a grabbing gesture] - sort of glommed right onto
him. Basically, we discussed how we could rehouse the TONTO modules into a
case that was more suitable and more playable, more ergonomic. We wanted it
playable from the front, serviceable from the rear. Now, if you go upstairs
and you look at that Moog 3C - I haven’t looked behind it but I know what’s
there. Unless it’s a very new model, after TONTO, they did not have, what we
call service loops, on the back of the modules and some of the modules, the
oscillators particularly the oscillator controllers, have to be adjusted by
pulling out the module and adjusting actual trimmers on the board. You have to
pull it out, it’s still connected. In the original case you can’t do that
because there isn’t a service loop. The wire’s immediately attached with a tie
wrap to the whole loom of the other wires so you have to put in an extender
card. Now, here comes a little bit of technical. One volt per octave is the
standard for voltage controlled musical instruments. That means 1/12 of a volt
is a semitone. A 1/12 of a volt, if you divide into 1000 millivolts, turns out
to be 83.333 recurring millivolts per semitone. Why is this relevant? Well,
that means that if you’re going to tune to the nearest cent, you’re going to
be down to millivolts - one or two millivolts is enough to put you out of tune
by one or two cents. Now, electronic resistance being such as it is, you plug
the card in, you plug the extension card in, now you’ve got a different resistance path going directly into the oscillator you’re trying to calibrate. You tune it all up, you take the extender card out, you plug it in. It’s out of tune again. Why? Because that card introduced a change. Even though it’s a
few milliohms, it put a small difference in there and people like Stevie can
hear that, which brings me to this. [holds up box] This is the little magic
box that I used to make sure that our synthesizer was always in tune. This is
a joystick controller that I built myself from a remote control for a model
aircraft. You could probably control a drone from it these days but what it
is, is it’s a joystick. Now, it’s not the first time that a joystick has been
used for a synthesizer. Putney used a joystick on theirs, but their joystick
was very hokey and didn’t have any springing on it, you couldn’t do anything
calibrated on it. So what I did was I got this model aircraft controller and I
set it up with my brilliant technical ability - if you look in there you’ll
see I’m joking. It’s a very simple circuit, which simply provides voltages,
two separate voltages out. The horizontal one I use to control pitch and
notice that it springs to the center. [demonstrates] And the vertical one I
use to control the filter. Now, the two things wrong with the Moog 3 and the
Moog 2C upstairs - well, three things. One, it’s monophonic. Two, it is not
touch sensitive. There is no way to get any dynamics out of that. That’s why Walter Carlos had such a huge success with Switched-On Bach and not so much with Clockwork Orange, because Bach was written for instruments that were not touch sensitive, it was written for the harpsichord and the organ, so Baroque music sounds great on a synthesizer. But you try to play Beethoven, which is from the Romantic period, it came a little later, you try to play that type of music, now you’ve got to have dynamics. The synthesizer, the Moog doesn’t do that readily. So how did I get around that? Also, the fact that it
only plays one note and not a chord is only half the story with the keyboard. The other half of the story is it’s only in tune over two octaves. You try getting that full keyboard upstairs into tune, all the way up, and then you try changing the range, it’s difficult. Tricky, tricky, tricky, you’re
constantly adjusting. So I came up with this simple solution and the advantage
of this is that there are two little white things at the side here, which you
can see. If you look at the back here, you’ll see what they actually do is
they change the physical positions of the pots that this is controlling.
Therefore they’re like sort of zeroes, they’re alignment things to align the
centre. This is, when you’re flying a model you want to get it so that it’s
flying straight - you adjust these little things. Well, the horizontal I used
for pitch and the vertical I used on the filter. Because if you shut the filter
down on an analogue synthesizer, it will mute the sound. It will take the high
frequencies out and it’ll make the sound more muted, which is sort of touch
control, it’s sort of sensitivity and it certainly substitutes well for it. So
between correcting the pitch with my little finger, which as a bass player I’m
very used to doing, between doing that and changing the filtration with this
little knob, the vertical - and now notice the vertical stays where it is.
Once I get a filter sound that I like or that I want to keep, I can just leave
it there. I can also do pitch bends and these knobs here set the distance of
the pitch bends and the amount of up and down that the filter gets, so there’s
three little knobs on there. Very, very simple and the switches change the
polarity so it goes up or down. Very simple but this is what enabled me to
keep TONTO in tune, even if someone else was playing the keyboard. I’d be
playing this little guy. I could sit with it on my lap, I could sit there at
the console with it and still control it and keep Stevie in tune. I’m a
musician first and foremost. This is all about music and the idea was to help
and aid Stevie in getting - or whoever was playing if it wasn’t me - in
getting the sound. So I would work with them. I’m used to working with a piano
player, a saxophone player, I’m used to playing jazz where I’ll turn on a
dime. They’ll change to a different key, I’m there. They change to a different
tempo, I’m there. They change to a different mood, I’m there. I’m used to that, so it’s not a hard deal for me to play this little box. So that’s the secret of how TONTO was probably the only synthesizer in the early ‘70s that seemed to be in tune. Torsten Schmidt We’re not only talking about something that’s 40 years ago, I mean, now when
we’re thinking about welcoming the Moog upstairs to the family we talked to
the kind person who fixes stuff for a certain German band that’s been pretty
popular with electronics in the ‘70s, and... Malcolm Cecil Well, that’d be Kraftwerk, wouldn’t it? Torsten Schmidt ...and he is like, “Oh, it sounds beautiful but it’s nearly impossible to tune, so really think hard about it, whether you want that or whether you can live with that.” You start to wonder, especially at that time, how the industry as such did not really exist at the time. As an illustration, this is the total sales - this is not thousands or millions or whatever - that’s the
total sales of Moog units sold in the years between 1967 and 71 per quarter [shows graph on the screen]. So that’s in quarter one four units sold, that’s not exactly much. So we’re talking about a really small number of people that are actually working in this environment. Now, here you are talking about the different hats that
you’re wearing, tinkering with your own piece of technology, and at the same
time you’ve got all the Buchla’s, Moog’s, Dave Smith’s and so on, the Oberheim’s and stuff. How did they react to you, because there’s not only Moog stuff in the TONTO, there’s all different kinds of things that talk to each other? Malcolm Cecil I tried to talk to the manufacturers in the early days. Bob Moog used to come
down, sit cross-legged on the floor. When I was trying to do the 17-tone
thing, he had a unit that would plug into the back of the keyboard, you’ll see
there’s two big, blue ribbon connectors on the back there. I think they’re two
30-pin connectors each or bigger. They are supposed to go to a box that he
designed where you can make your own tuning and we were going to buy this box
so he brought it down to demonstrate it. Well, he came down three or four
times, sat there cross-legged on the floor, soldering irons, resistors, this
whole thing. I’m standing there trying to do what I can to help and it’s not
happening. It never did, we never did get that thing working. That’s why I
ended up tuning the thing from C to F to get my 17 tones, I just couldn’t get
it the other way. The problem with the Moog and the Arp, for example – the next thing to come to our attention was the Arp – well, they both use, as does Oberheim, one volt
per octave for the pitch. But there’s another thing you need on an analogue
synthesizer, which is called the trigger, or in some parlances, gate – they
don’t mean the same thing, Arp made the distinction. A trigger is a single
pulse that goes up, comes back down. A gate is where it turns on and stays on
until you lift the key, that’s the difference between a trigger and a gate.
Arp noticed that difference. That’s the other peculiar thing with the Moog
keyboard, if you press down on a key and now if you don’t release that key and
press another key, it will only play one of the two notes, and the note that it
plays is usually the highest of the two. So it depends, he changed the
circuitry. On some of them it’s the lowest, but it only plays one of the two
notes. It selects the higher or the lower note. Furthermore with the Moog, in
order to get the envelope generator to work - now the envelope, as its name
implies, is the package in which the sound is delivered. In other words, it’s
the on/off pattern. The envelope is the attack, the initial decay, the sustain
and the final decay or release, that’s the standard four-parameter envelope.
Inside that we turn a voltage controlled amplifier, it’s like a fader, you
turn it up, down, it’s like an automatic fader and that controls the gain of
the output of the instrument. With synthesis, there’s three stages. The first stage is you take a rich waveform, that means you take a waveform that’s got a
lot of harmonics in it, the more oscillators the better. One of the secrets of
the bass sound on TONTO is minimum three oscillators. Minimum. Sometimes there
were as many as 12, depending on what we were doing. They’re not all tuned to
the same note and there’s also other tricks that we used to get what we call a
rich waveform. You need lots and lots of harmonics because the only way you’re
going to get your sound is by filtering it, which means subtracting - it’s
called subtractive synthesis. You take a rich waveform, you filter it and then
you pinch it on and off with the voltage controlled amplifier. Now, those
three processes - if you go from one note to another, in order to turn the
note on you have to have that envelope start, so you have to tell the envelope
generator, start now. In addition to the pitch that we send to the oscillator
we have to send a trigger or a gate, some signal, through to the envelope
generator to say, turn on the VCA now. The envelope generator, you set the
parameters on it and it goes up and repeats those parameters on a VCA. If you
change the note after you have started your envelope generator – the envelope’s started, it’s going along and now you change the note. If you change the note without lifting on a Moog, what happens is you don’t get the
envelope restarting again. The note just changes, so it can go... [sings a
tune legato] You keep on playing and eventually it gets down to the decay and
you’ve got nothing. Whereas if you play individual notes - if your gate’s
continuous, you’re not going to get it retriggered. But if you lift the note,
then you push down again it’ll start again. So now you go... [sings the same
tune with shorter articulation] ...as distinct from... [sings] ...either
retriggering or not. That is the big the difference in the way you play it. So
there’s a new thing when you’re playing a synthesizer keyboard, a Moog
keyboard. Not only is it one note, not only is it not touch sensitive, not
only is it out of tune for more than two octaves, but in addition to that, if
you don’t play it right it won’t sound right. It’ll sound awful because you’ve
got to know when to lift and when not to lift, when you want to retrigger and
when you don’t, so you’ve got to think a whole different way about it. So Arp
decided they were going to come out with a better idea, which is that every
time a new note was struck, even if the gate didn’t start, a trigger would go
and retrigger the envelope generator. So they had a different type of envelope
generator. The only difference was now it required +10V, whereas in order to
trigger a Moog it required ground, zero volts. Moog’s trigger when you put
ground on them. Very dangerous, because if you have something plugged into an
envelope generator and it accidentally touches ground, it will trigger it and
out comes your sound. Certainly very dangerous for live performance, but it
wasn’t a good idea so they went to positive triggering. Arp went to +10V and
in addition - that was the gate - then they had a trigger for every time you
redid it, so you didn’t have to worry about whether or not you were lifting.
The only trouble is, it made everything sound samey again, because every note
was... [sings a staccato rhythm] ...the same note again, the same envelope.
So it was a sort of fix but it wasn’t the perfect fix. But my job now was, how
do I get an Arp keyboard to play a Moog module? Or a Moog keyboard to play an
Arp module? Well, the voltage thing was not a problem. They were transposable,
you could just put the voltage in for the pitch, that worked. But we had to do
a lot of things so we finally decided we would settle on a +10V triggering,
which was a good thing because when Oberheim came out with the Synthesizer
Expander Modules they trigger on +5V. Everybody’s got a different thing,
EMS triggers on +5V as well. So you’ve got all these different standards and we had to standardize within TONTO, we had to come up with a standard that would make all the instruments, so they could all play nicely with each other. We’re the only instrument that did that. Torsten Schmidt Do you have a estimate on how much cable you used for that? Malcolm Cecil That’s a new question. There’s miles of cable in TONTO. The power cable alone
is 127 feet long. It’s 10/9, that means it’s ten strands of number nine wire.
Number nine wire is pretty fat. It’s not easy to solder. That particular piece
of cable is a control cable that was left over from some Apollo mission. I
hope it wasn’t 13, but it was from one of those missions. It was 127 feet when
we got it and I refused to cut it. What we did was, we put both ends to the
same terminal. This may sound like it would short but if you take a red wire,
you take it all the way ‘round the instrument, 127 feet, and then join it back
to the red terminal, electrically you’ve only got half of the distance because
you’ve got two routes for the electricity to get to the source. It reduces the
resistance so it’s like using number 18 wire – or not an 18, excuse me, number
four-and-a-half wire. It’ll be twice the size of wire, twice the fatness,
because we’ve got two routes. In other words, two pieces of parallel wire even
though it’s only one wire. How we achieved that, we didn’t want to cut the
wire, we just stripped back the insulation, wrapped another piece of 18-gauge
wire around it, then took that to each instrument, so there are seven spurs
off of that. So it’s a very complex wiring system. Then there’s another 127
feet of control cable. The control cables are 60 internal conductors - there’s
20 grounds, 20 pluses and 20 minuses because it’s all balanced wiring. We have
controls, we have audio, we have what we call trunk mounts, which is a way of
connecting different parts of the instrument together without having to have a
patch cord go from side A to side B, it goes round the wiring into a patchbay.
The patchbay on TONTO is horizontal, most patchbays are vertical but TONTO has
a horizontal patchbay. So there are a lot of different things about it, but the amount of wire, literally it’s got to be a good few miles of wire in there. Torsten Schmidt I’m almost dizzy just listening to the numbers of it. One thing that always
struck me as well, as a reference how much did you pay for a car back then? Malcolm Cecil I think, wasn’t a Mustang $2400? I think a Mustang was $2400 back in those days. Torsten Schmidt At the same time there’s ads when you see Stevie on the Mu-Tron and it’s like, “The same sound just for under $100,000.” That’s
like what, 40-something cars? And that’s just one instrument, and at the same
time you’re telling us that even Stevie, who was one of the most prolific
artists of the time, only had $100,000 in his trust fund. Something doesn’t
add up, how did you cope? Malcolm Cecil Well, the way we coped was, we didn’t make any money. Everything thing we made
- as my good lady will bear me out - everything we made went into the
instrument. We lived, breathed and slept TONTO, that was our livelihood. There
was a group of us, there was Bob and I, who were the out-front guys. I was the
designer really, Bob wasn’t technical. Bob was really good when it came to the
business side of things. You need somebody to do that, for sure. And he was
very good with sonorities, we used to call it sonorities. That is, hearing
tonal qualities and he was very good at getting down into those things and he
had infinite patience. That was the other thing, he had infinite patience with
me - and my lady will also attest you need it. The whole group of us were
supported by a background group of people. Polly, my wife, was the librarian.
She kept track of every tape that went in and out, because we were a
production company, we weren’t just a synthesizer and engineering firm. We
didn’t just do engineering, we booked the musicians, we booked the studios, we
dealt with the record companies, we did everything that a producer would do
because Stevie couldn’t do it. He was just on his own. Stevie was the artist,
we treated him as the artist, let him have total artistic reign. Whatever he
wanted he got, whenever he wanted it. As you heard Margouleff say, any time he
wanted to work. And because Stevie is unsighted, he’d call up at two in the
morning and say, “We’re going in the studio.” OK, we’d be there. Holidays,
Christmas, birthdays, it didn’t matter to him, it was Stevie time. We worked
like that for like four straight years and in order to do that you have to
have a back-up team. Stevie didn’t have one, so we were his back-up team. Polly
did all the library work. We had Dennis Palattia who was the fellow who did
all the office work, he was the one who took the work orders. What am I talking about? I’ve got some work orders here. [pulls out work order] Here’s an example of a work order, attached to it is another work order from the studio. Torsten Schmidt So this just happens to be Minnie Riperton. Malcolm Cecil This starts up here. The session would be booked, Dennis would fill in this
top corner here. This part here was all to do with special requirements. Then we turn to here when we go to the studio: the time we started, time we finished, what we did. All the things that we could possibly do were laid out at the top there. And the time it started, time it finished, W4s where the
tape was, titles of the tunes. And we had two other forms, one was the equivalent of what you would call a track sheet, and the other one was the equivalent of what you would call a legend on a tape. We had all of that information all coordinated, and everything was done with numbered tapes so
nobody knew what was on the tapes except us, that was our security system. We
could have tapes lying around and people would have to play them to find out
what they were. And that was a pretty good security system. And we also kept
lots of useless tapes around with the good ones, all part of the security
system. We very paranoid in those days. Anyway, when that finished Dennis
would go in and turn it back this way and start putting the prices down and
there were prices for us and also charges for the studio and any other
musicians costs. We did all the musicians contracts, we did everything, we did
the production, period. We had a whole production company. There were two other people involved. One of them was Uly, Ulysses Grant, Ulysses S Grant - the whole number - and no, he wasn’t the famous general but he was very important. He was my technician, my wiring technician. I would draw up diagrams and he would build them and he was a very, very good guy and worked for us for a long time and the last person – well, actually there were two
more. There was Charles, who was a carpenter who did all the woodwork that we
needed. That was after the main cases were built, they were built by a guy
called Harry Sanger in New York. He built all the cases for IBM prototypes
back in the day and he built the original cases. And then there was Jan. Jan
was - we’re an equal opportunity employer so she was a lady solderer. She did
all the solder work on all those huge cables, every solder joint on those
cables was done by her, and she worked for three years on the instrument. That
was all she did, was solder cables from morning ‘til night. Torsten Schmidt I’m a little bit in between two minds here because just looking at the discography as such, there’s people on there like the Isley Brothers, Van Dyke Parks, Joan Baez, Minnie Riperton, as we just saw. The TONTO albums as such, which are a topic of delight amongst collectors and synthesizer aficionados. Also, a lot of the Stevie stuff, obviously, we could talk about for days and some of that is pretty well documented. What we don’t get to hear too much about is your work with another gentleman. Let’s play a bit of music to give
you a bit of a breather for a second, and how about this one? (music: Gil Scott-Heron – “The
Bottle”) Malcolm Cecil This was a big hit of Gil’s. Gil and I met under very interesting circumstances. I had a studio
in Santa Monica that I had moved TONTO into after the break-up with Bob and
Stevie Wonder. I moved out of the studio we had in Point Dume in Malibu, where
we recorded with Stevie, Weather Report, Billy Preston, lots of people, and I
moved into a shopfront in Santa Monica, a 1000 square foot shopfront, and
turned it into a recording studio. I eventually took the shop next door and
that was 2000 square feet, which wasn’t really enough but we managed. One day
I was there, the front door of the shop was open. We didn’t have any air-
conditioning so we had the door open, it was a hot day. This very tall, black
gentleman poked his head into the studio. “Oh, it’s a recording studio here.”
I said, “Yes, it is.” “Can I come in and have a look?” I said, “Yeah, sure.”
He says, “I live just round the corner. I didn’t know there was a recording
studio here.” I said, “We’ve just moved here.” He says, “It looks great,
you’ve got this big synthesizer.” It turned out the name of the man was Tom
Wilson, not the Tom Wilson from the Beach Boys, the Tom Wilson who was the CBS producer who produced Bob Dylan. He was a very interesting, very intellectual guy and he says, “I have this musical called Gondwana that I need to record and it’s a
spec project, but I can cut you in...” To cut a long story short, I went for
it and we started to cut these tunes. He turned ‘round me to after we’d done
40 songs and he said, “You know what? I need to bring you some paying work in
here. I’ve got an album coming up for Arista Records.” Clive Davis had just
started up Arista. What happened was, Clive Davis had got caught - or at least
the whole company, CBS, got caught - have you heard about the coke-ola scam,
you know about that, the coke-ola scandal? What was happening was that CBS were
putting little packages of coke into the records they were sending to DJs, to
get them to play the records. It’s true, it all came out and Clive Davis
stepped up to the plate and said, “I’m guilty, it’s my fault, I’ll take the
responsibility, I’ll take the blame.” For doing that he got fired from CBS, but
they gave him $20 million to start Arista. So what can I tell you? Money talks, nobody walks. Anyway, he decided - he being, of course, Clive Davis -
that he needed a black act on the label and so he signed Gil Scott-Heron. Who
would he get to produce but his old producer who had produced Dylan very
successfully for CBS for him – Tom Wilson. So Tom brought Gil in to do the session and came in on the first day and was sitting down there. Tom had a very interesting style of production, very interesting. He would sit there, put his feet up on the console, open up the Financial Times and that was it,
that was all you’d see. The first day we’re recording, we start recording this
thing called “Hello Sunday, Hello
Road” and it gets to about take five. I think it’s a pretty good one so I turn around to Tom and said, “What
do you think, Tom?” “I’ll let you know if there’s anything wrong.” That was
his style of production, let everybody do it. His idea was, nothing makes the
farm grow like the eye of the farmer. You just have to be in the room, you
don’t have to do anything. If everything is going well, leave it alone, let it happen. So, that was how I met Gil but the story didn’t quite finish there. Halfway through the album, one day Dion, my assistant - our habit was, we would do a song. As soon as we got a take and everything was fine, Tom would leave the studio and say, “OK, do a mix and send it around to me. Do a rough
and send it around to me.” So Dion would go ‘round with a cassette with the
rough mix on it, to Tom’s house which was a block and a half away. Well, this
particular morning Tom didn’t show, very unusual. Tom was always there first.
So we go through and we get halfway through the session and still no Tom.
Both, Gil and I are getting a little uneasy. So I say to Dion, “Run round to
Tom’s house, make sure everything’s alright, make sure he’s OK.” So Dion goes
‘round. Dion came to me because he walked in when I was building the studio and I was building the ceiling, which was a gullwing ceiling, and I needed somebody to hold up the thing while I fixed it. Dion is like 6’4”, very long limbs, and he just happened to walk in the door. He was this Dutch guy, I don’t know where he came from. He just walked in the door and I turned around
and said, “Excuse me, could you just hold this.” That’s how he started and he
never left, he became my assistant, very nice guy. So he went around and the
reason I told you that is because he goes to the room and gets no reply, so
being tall he climbs up. Tom’s apartment was like, there was a basement and
then his apartment up a few steps, but you had to be fairly tall to look
through the window. He climbs up onto the railing and looks through the
window, sees Tom lying on the floor. So he comes backs to the studio, tells
us, so Gil and I go around. Gil is about the same size as Dion, 6’10” sort of,
in that region, Gil was a basketball player. Between the two of them they managed to get into the window. I think Gil hoisted Dion up and Dion climbed in. We got in and we got Tom to the hospital. It turned out that he had had a heart problem and he had to go in and have an operation. So, the whole album
came to a grinding halt at that point. Tom got out of hospital a couple of
months later, we went back to work. Three weeks later, same thing happens only
this time with not such a good result. This time, unfortunately, Tom was dead,
his aorta had burst and that was it. Here we are with a half-finished album
and Gil turns to me and says, “Hey man, will you help me produce and finish
this album?” So I said, “Of course,” and that’s how I came to produce Gil. We stayed together, we did, I think, 15 albums together and we were together for
about 22 years. We went through all sorts of changes. We did the Stevie Wonder
Hotter Than July tour, 1980. Gil was booked on that because Bob Marley
couldn’t make it. Bob Marley was supposed to open for Stevie and he couldn’t
make it, so Gil got called to do the opening, but it was supposed to be only
for the first few shows until Bob Marley was better. He never did get better
and we ended up doing the whole tour. On the first night when we were in
Austin, Texas, we went up into Stevie’s dressing room and Gil and Stevie and
myself and a couple of others - the producer of the show and so on - were
talking about how we were going to do the last number, what we were going to
do. Gil came up with this idea, he said, “Do you know what? It’s going to be
Martin Luther King’s birthday, we should do ‘Happy Birthday To You’.” Stevie
had already written “Happy Birthday” for Martin Luther King. And he said, “You
know what? We should exhort everybody to write to their congressman and see if
we can’t get Martin Luther King Day accepted as a national holiday. That would
be something really worthwhile.” Stevie cottoned on to this idea right away,
“Yeah man, yeah, let’s do that.” So that became what we were going to do at
the end of the show. That was the song that Gil got called back up to work
with Stevie at the end of the performance every show. Gil would get up there
and he would exhort everybody to go write their congressman to make Martin
Luther King Day a national holiday. That continued, we ended up doing the
whole 1980 tour, which did take most of 1980. It wasn’t continuous, but it was
like fits and starts – six weeks here, four weeks there, different areas of the
country. We would fly there and then go by coach, then get back on the plane
and fly back from whence we came. It was a very powerful experience for everybody because Gil then went on to organize, with Stevie, all of the black artists, musicans and entertainers. It started with the Motown team through Stevie and Gil and we ended up getting all sorts of people involved, and four years later the law was passed and it became a national holiday, even though
ten years in a row it had been brought up in congress and failed. This was an
amazing accomplishment that was done through music and through the dedication
of musicians who thought music was more valuable than just love songs. So much
of music is love songs, so much of music is about interpersonal relationships,
but I’ve always been a proponent of social consciousness and I believe that
social consciousness can be promoted through music and great achievements can
be done. Music isn’t all about making a million dollars or billions of dollars
or selling lots of records or being famous, it’s about changing the world.
It’s about making the world a better place to live in not just for you and
those around you but for everybody, everybody who comes within the sound. I’ve
been amazed at the number of people who’ve come up to me, because you never
know your effect upon other people or very rarely. How often does one get to
know one’s effect on other people? My wife Polly had a yoga teacher – she does Iyengar
yoga – and she had a yoga teacher who was from France, and from a very well to
do family in France. Gil had a write-up in a French magazine, very esoteric
French magazine. Now I know schoolboy French, I mean, I have ordinary level
French GCE - my matriculation to get into the polytechnic - but I couldn’t
understand one in ten words of this article, I didn’t even start. So I said to
Polly, “Why don’t get Fenech to come down to the studio one day after yoga?
Finagle her to come down and just read the article, translate it on the fly,
and I’ll set up a mic and a cassette and Gil can hear the article.” So Polly
brings Fenech down one day out of the blue, she just appears at the studio.
I’m getting ready, I’m getting the mic set up and everything, and Fenech’s
looking at the gold records on the wall. She gets to Talking Book and she
goes, “Oh, my god! You did Talking Book? That record changed my life!” She
then tells me the story. She’d been in the West Indies. She had fallen in love
with and had two children with a West Indian man who she was deeply in love
with. Everything was fine because she was from a well-heeled French family, a
French aristocratic family, and so there was no problems until her father
found out that the children were not 100% white and cut her off, cut off all her payments, everything. “That’s it, you’re on your own.” The only thing she could do to make money was teaching yoga in the hotels in Jamaica and trying to make ends meet. Well, the husband didn’t stay around very long when there was no money around so she was left with these two children to
support. She said that the only thing that got her up and through the day every day was putting on Talking Book first thing in the morning, every time she got up. She said, “I put that record on and it got me through the day.” So, you never know your effect on other people, and it’s very rare to ever find it out, but when you realize things like that are going on – how many other
people’s lives have been touched by the products that I’ve been involved with?
I don’t know, I couldn’t tell you, but I know that there are people out there
who have been touched by it and have been touched by some of the social
consciousness things that we did. I mean, “Living for the City” was no joke. “Living for the City” was the break-up of Stevie and I because it was the first time that
Stevie really realized he was actually being produced, which is what he hated,
that’s what he left Motown because of. As soon as he found out and realized
that we had actually been producing him all this time – he was under the
impression that he was doing it all, which was the whole idea. That’s really what you want to do, but it works against you if you use that technique. It’s a production technique that I used with Stevie, I’ve used with a lot of artists. It worked with Gil because Gil understood it, and Gil appreciated it, and Gil listened, and did everything I asked him to do, but with Stevie, as soon as he realized that I was actually, quote, ‘producing’ him... When I
started and stopped that tape machine - never done it before, but when I
started actually taking charge in the control room and saying, “No, do this,
do that” - strands of the old Motown came right back into his head and he’s
like, “Uh-uh, nope, I’m not having this.” And that was the beginning of the
end for Stevie and I, that’s what really broke it up. You can look at money,
you can look at business, you can look at all other aspects, that was what it
was. He did not want to be produced even though it made better product. I only
say that, not out of ego, I’m saying that because so many people have told me
and I’ve read in so many different articles - people I don’t know and writers
who I’ve never met, I’ve got no axe to grind with them - all seem to concur
that the albums we did together, Music Of My Mind, Talking Book,
Innervisions, Fulfillingness’ First Finale, those are the albums which are
the seminal albums everybody talks about of Stevie’s. It also took him three years to produce an album after we left. We produced four albums in as many years, two albums with Syreeta, three albums with the Isley Brothers. I mean, it goes on and on and on, the number of albums we produced. The “getting it done”-part of it, the production part, was being done but when we left there
was nobody to fill in that gap, nobody to book the studio, nobody to ride herd
on Stevie and say, “Hey man, it’s going over the top. I liked the other take.”
There was one case in point. We filled up the whole tape with vocal overdubs
and it was time to go back because Stevie had done a vocal - and this is
probably another important point you should remember - I always do first
takes. No matter what, I push the button on first takes whether they’re ready
or not because so many first takes have turned out to be the magical take. You
can keep trying and keep trying, it just gets worse. You go back to the first
take, there’s something magical about it. “OK, there’s problems” - fix them,
cover them up, do what you got to do, but if the vibe is there that’s the
important thing. You’ve got to recognize it and say, “That’s it.” So I recognized on the first take of this vocal that we’d done - I forget which
song it was now. As I say, we put 50 songs out and I left him with 250 in the
cans, so 300 songs - you don’t remember this stuff. In fact, I don’t remember
a fraction of the stuff I’ve recorded. You can’t keep it up there if you’re dealing in the now. I prefer to deal in the now, I’m more interested in what’s going on in the project I’m working on right now than anything I did in the past. And I don’t listen to the old albums, I’m not familiar with them that much, only while I was in the studio. So this basic idea that you’re trying to
produce and get the best possible results out of people at the time, you do
these first takes. I had saved Stevie’s first take and we’d done these 16, 17
more takes on top. Basically, Stevie had said, “No, go over it,” but I didn’t.
I just chose another track and just pulled the fader down, because my decision
was, that’s too good to go over and I’ve got spare tracks, so why would I do
that? He thinks we’ve gone over. At the end of the day I said, “That’s it, that’s the last track. We’ve got to decide whether we’re going to go over
anything if you want to do more.” “Yeah man, we don’t got it, we don’t got
it.” “Oh, come in, I’ve got something I want you to listen to.” I brought him
into the control room, and I put the first track up. He looks back and he says,
“You kept it.” He knew what it was right away, that’s the sort of memory he
had. He knew what he had done, and he listened to it and he turns round and
says, “Hey man, you’re right, that’s the one.” He recognized that he couldn’t
do it any better than he’d done it there. Now, as a musician there are many
times - on “Innervisions,” on the actual title track I’m playing bass, it’s
the only track on the whole of Stevie’s albums, those four albums, that I play
bass on, upright bass because it was an acoustic track. And I played this
line... [sings] Between the first and second verses there’s a little break,
where it’s just the bass doing that line, and so, of course, Mr. Clever has to
go... [sings syncopated variation] I had to put my little twiddly bit in,
right? And as soon as I did it I go, “Oh, no, why did I do that? Now we’re going to have to take it again.” But I kept that inner thought. We get to the end of the take and I turn around to Stevie and say, “Yeah, we’ve got to do it again.” “Why, man, why? It was perfect.” I said, “Well, you know, I screwed up in the bass break.” “No, man, you played that twiddly thing, I really liked
that.” I go, “Huh? Well, if you really like it...” I had wanted to do it again
because I had this idea that it should be like the way it was written and I
had twiddled it up. But it turned out it worked, it was something that
actually did work and there was no reason to take again. And that’s the take
that’s on the record. Technical reasons are not good enough reasons to retake
a take that’s already got feel and vibe to it. It’s more important to have the
feel and vibe than it is to be technically perfect or to be musically perfect,
for that matter. How it comes across, what it does, how it makes you feel.
That’s what’s important, nothing else. [applause] Thank you, thank you very much. Torsten Schmidt Would there be some questions? Audience Member Thank you for coming. Malcolm Cecil You’re very welcome. Thank you for coming. I’m here because of you. If you
weren’t here, I wouldn’t be here. Audience Member Tell me about it. You spoke on vibrations and a little bit on frequency, and
also on feeling and the emotion of songs and stuff like that. In the past maybe two months some of my friends have been getting me into - yoga deals with it, but meditation. I forget what it’s called, I can’t recall for the life of me - it’s in the shape of a bowl and there’s a little wooden piece that’s similar to this in terms of shape and you tap it. Malcolm Cecil Yeah, it’s a singing bowl. Tibetan. Audience Member Tibetan. It emits a vibration and also a frequency that work intertwined and
they affect your emotion, you mood so that you can focus and meditate. My
question deals with frequency and how frequency can affect someone’s mood, in
terms of sound or whatever, and if you studied that and incorporated that into
any of your songs, like certain frequencies to evoke a certain feeling in
someone that was listening to a song. Malcolm Cecil I don’t think it’s quite a simple as just a frequency because frequency is essentially pitch. Sounds are three-dimensional objects in time, OK? You can tell this from the language. We talk about three-dimensional objects in space and a three-dimensional object in space, it has a length, it has a height and it has as thickness, those are the three dimensions. They’re each independent, but for it to be a real object all three have to be present, at least in some form. Even a mono-molecular film of oil on the top of water that makes that dullish, yellowy, bluey rainbow, after the rain you see on the road - that is a mono-molecular film of oil but it’s one molecule thick, it’s still got a thickness. If it didn’t have a thickness, it wouldn’t exist in the real world. If it didn’t have a length, it didn’t have a width. Now, the same is true of sounds. Sounds are three-dimensional objects in time. They have a length, a
duration. They go from... [sings ‘ah’] That’s a duration, length in time. We
call it length, how long is the note? We use the same term. Then they have
height, pitch: low pitch, high pitch, medium pitch. Pitch is the vertical,
it’s whether you’re low, you’re medium or you’re high, that’s the note. And
the third thing they have is thickness. We talk about fat, brassy sounds,
thin, reedy sounds, OK? It’s the tonal quality. So these three things together
create just one sound, just one single sound. A sound can have many pitches.
For example, we were talking about envelopes before, maybe we change the
voltage but we don’t change the envelope. That sound has like... [sings a
series of pitches] It’s got numerous pitches but it’s still one envelope. It
has a thickness, it has height. So, you can look at music as being like very
complex sculptures of individual notes and sounds. You can play a note in
many, many different ways and you can sing a note in many different ways. You
can sing it with different tonal qualities, you can sing it with different
intensities. There’s many ways that you can vary it but you’re always varying
one of the three dimensions. You’re either varying the timbral quality, you’re
varying the pitch, you’re varying the duration or all three in some manner of
fashion. So I don’t think it would be true to say there’s a frequency, which
is just a pitch, that will do that. But there are things that will evoke
certain feelings in certain ways. For example, if you want to create the
feeling of tension, one of the ways of doing it is to play notes that don’t
sit well together. You play notes that are close together. Because of the
nature of harmonics and the nature of frequencies and the way that they work
and the way that harmonics work, as you go higher up the scale there’s a lot
more notes that are produced that will blend with the original. The all hold
multiples of the original frequency, so if you look at it mathematically -
let’s say 100 cycles, it’s a low note, it’s a bass note. 200 cycles is an
octave above. 400 cycles is an octave above that, so it doubles. 800 cycles is
an octave above that, so every octave you’ve got twice as much space, so
there’s a lot of frequencies in there. But the way we hear them, they divide
up proportionally, and the way that we usually hear them is, we hear harmonics
very easily. Although we don’t really think about them, they’re intrinsic to
every note. Everything has harmonic structure to it and whether or not you
have notes that are in that harmonic structure or not is what determines
whether those two notes are going to play together. If it’s in the harmonic
structure, they’re going to be what we call consonant, or they’re going to
sound sweet. If it’s not within the harmonic structure, they’re going to sound
dissonant, or sound not sweet. There are times when you want it to be ‘ungh’.
If you were doing a movie score and the killer’s going to come in and he’s
going to shove this knife through the shower curtain and kill this lady in the
shower, as happens in the Alfred Hitchcock movie... You listen to the
soundtrack there. What it is, it’s a semitone apart, it’s violins going a
semitone apart, rubbing against each other, a really uncomfortable feeling. So
yes, feelings are conveyed not by usually a single frequency, but by the way
you combine frequencies and that’s what chords are about, that’s what voicings
are about. If you take a piano and you look at the harmonic series, the
harmonic series goes - if you actually take the notes - one times the
frequency, two, three, four, five. We just looked at the octaves but in
between, from one hundred to two hundred there’s nothing in between because
it’s one and two, so 200 is the next harmonic. The next one would be 300. Now,
300 is halfway between two and four. It’s not quite in the middle, but what is
it? It turns out to be the dominant note. In other words, if your original
note is C, the second harmonic will be C the octave above and then you’ll have
G in that octave and then you’ll have C again. The fifth harmonic next is E.
Now look at that: C, G, E but they’re in different octaves. Now if you play C,
E, G at the bottom of the piano, all together, it sounds like mud. But if you
play C, skip an octave and a half, play G, skip up over the next C, play E,
you’re now playing the harmonics of that bottom note and those harmonics will
blend and sound smooth. It will feel very consonant, it will feel sweet. So
the strongest voicing of a major chord is C, miss an octave and a half, G and
then E in the next octave. That’s the most strong, powerful three notes that
you can put out to make a major chord and it sounds great. Much better than C,
E, G anywhere on a piano played close. People tend to forget this, but that’s
they key to understanding the relationship of harmonics and everything else.
Harmonics are really important in that they dominate all of music, and if you
obey the rules of harmonics, and understand the rules of harmonics, you can
use them. It doesn’t mean everything has to be harmonically perfect but if
everything is conforming with the harmonic series it will sound sweet. The
more you don’t conform, the more tensive it’s going to sound. If you’re
writing film scores, it’s very helpful because you now have a tool to be able
to tell you, how am I going to make this scene more tense? How am I going to
come to a point where it gets even more tense than this further on? What am I
going to do? Harmonic theory will guide you in that, that’s an important
aspect. I’m going to be publishing a book on this whole topic, but it’s not
going to be ready for a little while. I did a lot of research over my life
with this. It’s the one thing, if anything, I want to leave behind, other than
TONTO, of course. But it’s the one thing I think will be universally useful
that wasn’t around when I was born and hopefully will be when I kick up the
daisies at the end of my time here. Who knows how long it’ll be? I’m 76 now.
I’ve enjoyed a very good life up to now, and I plan to live to 120. My three
years stretched, by the way. However, my philosophy didn’t change. I still
live as if I only have three years to live, which may very well be true. You’ll find that if you do that, you’ll have a much fuller life. That’s probably why I’ve done all the things I’ve done, it’s because I never set out to do a career path, I never had a future in mind - only the present. Build the present on the past if it’s worth doing, otherwise break from it, make a
whole new start. I’ve done it many times in my life now, and it’s never failed
me. The only thing I haven’t made a new start with is my good lady. We’ve been
together for 55 years. [applause] Torsten Schmidt Unfortunately, I’m getting a lot of cutthroat signs from in between the
curtains. Malcolm Cecil They’ve all run out of media. I’ve run you out of your media! [laughs] Torsten Schmidt I don’t know how much we can harrass you later, because we know that maybe if
Erik has a little time in the studio when you’re around for a little moment,
we do have the multi-tracks for a certain track that maybe people would be
interested in having a go with. And it may be kind of explanatory if you could
be still be around for that, but I don’t know whether that’s possible. Malcolm Cecil Sure, I’d be happy to do that, I know the track. Torsten Schmidt We should probably do that in the main studio after everyone has had a bit of
rest and how does it work with you guys, maybe at seven or so? Would seven
work? If that works time-wise for you - but we will let you know and we’ll
have one of these ringing noises, but technicalities aside I want to go out
with a song in a second. But not before we give a very, very warm hand and
welcome - not welcome, goodbye, but probably a welcome again at some stage. Malcolm Cecil Does that mean I’m welcome here? Torsten Schmidt Please, everybody, join me in thanking Mr. Malcolm Cecil. [applause]

Title: Modeselektor (2010)

Modeselektor (2010)
Modeselektor calls their sound “Russian crunk.” But they are, as Londoners might say, royally taking the piss. Hailing from Germany, the duo work in a variety of tempos and styles with an emphasis on big, warpy synth sounds and the kind of heavy basslines that can threaten foundations. With plenty of artist albums and a joint project with Apparat, as Moderat, it is as an audiovisual live act that they’ve truly conquered hearts and minds.
In this lecture at the 2010 Red Bull Music Academy they bring the same anarchic disdain and chaos as they’re known for in their live sets while discussing everything from the fall of the Berlin Wall and German record store Hard Wax to Moderat.
Hosted by Torsten Schmidt It is going to be the afternoon breathing session and it is going to be
courtesy of Charlie [aka Sebastian] and Gernot, who are also known to
some of you by the name of
Modeselektor. So please join your
hands and welcome them. [applause] Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Thank you. Gernot Bronsert Thank you. Torsten Schmidt It is kind of good that you got comfy there, because obviously, this is
couples therapy. I do have my notes here and are there any issues that you
want to share with your counselor? Gernot Bronsert Too many to tell. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Let’s start. Torsten Schmidt Where do you start? Speaking of starts, there might be an outbreak of joy in
the next two hours because our dear friend Wulf is actually going into labor — or rather his baby mama — at three this morning, and we somehow made a bet this
morning that the baby is actually going to pop out while we’re sitting here.
If you see us checking the phones now and then… Gernot Bronsert …pop out… Torsten Schmidt That is going to be one giant, that is for sure. So don’t take it as rudeness,
that is the only time mobile phones are allowed here and we might have to get
a song of joy at some stage, so make sure you prepare one in your native
language. But speaking of couples, I never knew how you actually met, you two? Gernot Bronsert At school, primary school. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary In the ‘80s. Gernot Bronsert It‘s true. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary In the dark ‘80s. Gernot Bronsert East Germany, communism. Dusty air, East side. Torsten Schmidt Because there is one thing you have to understand. I mean, you are ‘75 right? You’re ‘78? Well, I was born in ‘74 as well, the year we lost against another nation
in the football World Cup and we still won. Gernot Bronsert Football was forbidden in the GDR. Torsten Schmidt Well, can we therefore erase that game from the records then? Gernot Bronsert Yes. Torsten Schmidt OK, done, hooray! But what you have to realize is that people our age were actually
raised to hate each other. You see the wall here. Am I sitting... no I am
sitting east, damn. It’s complicated. Obviously, everyone that went to the
East during those days was just coming back with all these stories. What were
the stories that you heard about the other side? Gernot Bronsert They didn’t tell us. You know, I think they are still afraid to talk to us. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary I think they were isolated, when they came over. There was no contact. Gernot Bronsert They still hate us. Torsten Schmidt Who is “they” now, just so we get the hate right? Gernot Bronsert I know one story a friend of mine told me, his name is
Rashad. He works for Dubplates & Mastering in Berlin and he came
before the wall came down to Berlin because he just wanted to be different. He
was maybe the only person from the west side who wanted to live on the east side,
and he might know the East German history better than me because I was a
child. I didn’t have an idea anyway about what was happening. It was a crazy
time because everybody was very confused — my parents, the people around us,
the teachers, the bus drivers, the police, everybody was very confused because
everything was new, everything changed. I was just a little boy in the
middle. I didn’t know exactly the day when the wall came down just because I was in
the church to get my piano lessons. I needed to go to church two times a week,
to the guy who is playing the organ in the church. He taught all the kids
piano lessons, and I hated it to go there but I needed to. My parents forced
me since I was six to play piano and I never liked it. That’s why I make techno
now or electronic music. I remember the day when I was there, I needed to
prepare something and I didn’t and I was there and the phone was ringing and
he picked up the phone and he said just, “Yes... Yes... No... Yes.” He hung up
and left the room and never came back. I didn’t know what was going to happen
and I was waiting 20 minutes, 40 minutes, one hour. After one and a half hours
I left. I just thought he went out and was taking a piss, or I don’t know
what, and I went home and my parents told me that the wall has gone and my
piano teacher never came back. I was just happy that I didn’t need to go to
the piano lessons any more, so I was just, “OK, cool. The wall is down and I’m
free now. I don’t need to go to church.” Torsten Schmidt So basically, there was like a very personal freedom that you won that day? Gernot Bronsert Yes, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Gorbachev. Torsten Schmidt So what did you actually speculate about, what do you think happened to your
piano teacher? Gernot Bronsert I have no idea. I just asked my parents recently if they know what is going to
happen with this guy, but I think he was just happy. Because all the people who were
involved in Christian movements, they had massive problems with the
communistic government and they just wanted to leave. I think he tried since
ages to leave the country. He was a nice guy… but I hated him. Torsten Schmidt Welcome to life. What was your experience of that? Sebastian “Charlie” Szary I was in bed. It was a Thursday, November 9th. Thursday evening and I was in
bed. My mother came to my room and she said, “Sebastian, the wall is down, we
are free.” “Should I go to school tomorrow?” “Yes.” I went to school and 30%
or 40% of the class was missing. That’s my story. One day later, we went to
West Berlin for the first time. We went shopping, records, clothes, Coca-Cola,
turntables. Torsten Schmidt What did you spend your 100
Deutschmarks on? Gernot Bronsert You know what? He is an asshole. When the wall came down the government
decided to give every member from the ex-GDR a welcome present, and this
welcome present were like 100 Deutschmarks. Every bank was packed with East
German people with this little paper in their hands and they were waiting for
their first 100 Deutschmarks. Western money, real money, the good money.
Everybody took his 100 marks and Charlie, he’s an asshole, he found another
100 marks on the ground, so he got 200. So I think he is the only one who
found 100 marks because some idiot lost his first present. Torsten Schmidt It doesn’t sound like much now, 60 quid. But still, how long would your
parents have had to work for that? Gernot Bronsert One-hundred marks? I think, a month? I don’t know, two years. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary I think on the black market it was a horrible exchange rate. Gernot Bronsert And he bought a ghetto blaster. I think our generation everyone bought a
ghetto blaster. Everyone went straight to the store and bought a ghetto blaster.
You still have it? You sold it for drugs? Five years later. When he became a
proper member of the Western community you sold it for weed. For Red Bull. Torsten Schmidt Knowing how much ghetto blaster you would get for a 100 Deutschmarks, which is
about everything you could save up for in a summer of paper delivery and
scrubbing the streets and whatever a young kid does to make money, there
wasn’t much of a party if you used that in a party afterwards, right? Gernot Bronsert We didn’t use that to party, we just wanted to have it. Looking at it. Torsten Schmidt And when did you actually master that thought of, “Oh my gosh, it does play
music as well.” Gernot Bronsert The thing is, the only way to discover electronic music was via the radio.
There were a few really nice radio shows in the late ‘80s in West Berlin, so
we were able to listen to the shows, and we recorded a lot of these shows on
tape. I think my mom is calling me. I think I still have some of these shows.
It was the only way to get into electronic music or music in general. You
couldn’t buy any records. For example, Pink Floyd released Dark Side of the Moon, when was it
released? Eight million years ago? In the GDR you just got it 12 million years
later. There was no new music. We still recorded the music from the radio
shows. I still have a few tapes from the old days, like Marusha, Grandmaster Flash. Torsten Schmidt I guess, that is what the then Chancellor Helmut
Kohl called “the mercy of the late
birth.” But for those who don’t know about Marusha, can you give us a little
bit of information about the significance of that person? Gernot Bronsert Does anyone know Marusha? No? One. Two. I am getting old. Marusha was the Mary Anne
Hobbs of Germany for techno.
She didn’t play dubstep at all, in the end it was more like hardcore and Micky
Mouse techno or whatever. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary But in the early ‘90s she had a really good radio show. Gernot Bronsert Called “Rave Satellite” and it was a really important show. Before her was
Monika Dietl. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary She had a very nice voice, a girl from Bavaria, a very erotic voice on the
radio. I had no picture what she looked like. Gernot Bronsert And he was masturbating. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Oh, my god! Torsten Schmidt That is something else people would not understand. Obviously because of the wall and not being able to get over it, a voice from Bavaria is about as exotic as like
a Japanese geisha, right? Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Ja. Gernot Bronsert Jaaa. Let’s think about it. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Can I take a picture? Gernot Bronsert Then everything went really fast. Torsten Schmidt Before it goes fast, one thing that is probably really hard to understand, now
you just plug it in and everything that you possibly want is there within
however long that is. The mere fact that you could not only not go to a shop,
but the availability was a totally different thing and a totally different way
of how to discover pop culture, electronic music, however you want to call it. Gernot Bronsert I am too young to describe that. I just got into music after the wall and my
musical socialization was different than to the other kids around the world.
It’s just because I grew up in Berlin, that is my theory, I didn’t grow up
with Nirvana and all this
music. The first track who really touched my heart was Derrick May, a remix of “Sueno
Latino,” I think in ‘91 or ‘92.
And that was the first music that really blew me away. I was just saying, “What is going on? What is it? I don’t know what it is, I don’t get it, it’s too amazing.” Since then I was interested in these black discs and turntables and bass. Torsten Schmidt And where was the place you would go to get these black discs? Gernot Bronsert Hardwax. Hardwax record store. It is the record store in
Germany, or maybe in Europe. UK is not Europe, OK? But I went to the store the
first time, Charlie discovered, he started buying records very early, I
think… Sebastian “Charlie” Szary I think it was shortly after the wall came down, we went to West Berlin and we
visited the shop, and they founded it in 1988. They were the first in Berlin. They
imported US records, techno and house records. A very small store, like this room,
with 5,000 records. That’s the story. Gernot Bronsert I went there very early, I don’t remember. Like ‘93 or something, and I asked for jungle. I didn’t
know what that was, it was a new thing and I was just into Underground Resistance before and techno stuff,
the Mover, hardcore stuff. Then
I heard the rumors about this new thing jungle and I went to the store and
I asked for, “Do you have jungle records?” And Pete, he still works there, he said, “Son, I give you jungle records.” He gave me a bunch of records and I
still have them. One of them was an
Aphex [Twin] record and since then I just
brought those records and I played them ‘til death every day. I woke up in
the morning and I played them. Then, I needed to go to school, came back and I
would play them. I was just listening and listening to it again, saved all my
money and went to the store. It took me one and a half hours to get there,
sometimes I had just 10 marks or something, that means one record. I spent
three hours a day to go there and buy one record. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary It was a hard life. Gernot Bronsert It was! Torsten Schmidt Hardwax actually was also great because the guy that took care of the
mailorder, for people who lived far in the West like us… Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Do you know the system of the mailorder was somebody called the shop and said,
“OK, do you have this record?” And they played it with the telephone in the
air. No e-mail, fax. And then a monthly paper with all the 12"s and
T-shirts. Torsten Schmidt What I loved most about it, I think Charles was his name? James. The poor guy
had a horrible stutter and they made him do the mailorder. Gernot Bronsert He was British, wasn’t he? He didn’t speak any German. And remember, East German,
a 15 year-old boy calling Hardwax to buy the new Jeff Mills record and then you had James
on the other side. And James was a strange person, he was always talking like
this, “Er, er, er, the new Jeff Mills? Torsten Schmidt That was way too fast. Gernot Bronsert “Er, er, hold on a second, er, hello?” It
was like this. But it was part of the charm of the whole store. I loved the store.
I still love it. Torsten Schmidt I mean, the great thing with him was also, again, phones were so expensive. We’re
really boring you with stories from the trenches here, but to call Berlin from
somewhere in West Germany for just a minute would cost a fortune, so in the end the
record would cost, I guess, about three times the cost just because the
phone conversation was so long. There was always this excitement when you went
to the mailbox, phone bill or records, what comes first? You had to find out
that there is no use in hiding the phone bill or burning it, or something like that. It all comes back in the end. Gernot Bronsert One day I replaced James. He left and they asked me to work there because I
was there every day and they said, “You should work here.” Sebastian “Charlie” Szary And after this point everything was getting faster and faster. Gernot Bronsert That was the time when we lived together, we were roommates. They paid good
money but the problem was I hadn’t got any money at the end of the month
because I spent all my money on records. I bought everything. Stupid shit. I
just wanted to have it. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Every evening he was coming back home and he had a big package of records. Twenty,
30. Torsten Schmidt That’s better than food, right? What did you do all day while he was providing
you with records? Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Chilling. Unemployed. Sitting by a window drinking coffee, waiting for Gernot. Gernot Bronsert He still does the same. But now I am waiting for him always. Torsten Schmidt Why is that? Gernot Bronsert I don’t know. That is part of my Modeselektor job, waiting for Charlie, at airports, for
example. It is not okay. So, “OK, Charlie, let’s check in now.” “No, wait! I
just want to smoke a cigarette.” “OK, let’s smoke a cigarette.” “I need to buy
a coffee. Where is my money? Can I borrow money? I need to go to a cash
machine.” Always waiting. I think he lives longer because he is very slow. And I
am so fast, so we are totally different. As you recognize already I am the
talking guy, he is more the… Sebastian “Charlie” Szary …the listening guy. Torsten Schmidt So how do you ever get anything done then? Gernot Bronsert I don’t know. That is the other difference we have, he is synaesthetic. He can remember
everything. Like when he said, “…it was on a Tuesday,” then it was Tuesday,
I’m sure we can check on the Internet, it was a Tuesday. He remembers the
shittiest, smallest things but he forgot to bring the music this morning. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Really, I remember things which are ten years ago. Gernot Bronsert But when you ask him what time it is, he says, “It’s three, three o’clock
now.” And you wait ten seconds, “What time is it?” And he must look again to see what time it is. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary That is my problem. Gernot Bronsert He is handicapped. Torsten Schmidt Which brings us back to couples therapy, I guess. I will be the shrink. So how
does that make you feel? Gernot Bronsert First, you should tell the story you told us this morning for everybody. Torsten Schmidt Which one, exactly? Gernot Bronsert The one you mother likes to tell. Torsten Schmidt That one. That’s a absolutely lovely one. But we’ll do that later. So how does it make
you feel when you have to wait for Charlie? Gernot Bronsert It is a process. When you ask me how I felt two years ago, I needed to learn
to handle that problem. Last year I bought a book. It was a sketchbook, and
the sketchbook was there to write down every minute I am waiting for him. After two weeks it was full. Torsten Schmidt Who of my colleagues actually prescribed that? Gernot Bronsert Was? [speaking German] He is like Charlie. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary But I remember that sketchbook was a gift from me to him. It was yellow. Gernot Bronsert I think after the year I was waiting two days, I’d just write down 30 minutes
on Tuesday, 15 minutes Wednesday, and so on, and I think it was in total two days waiting for Charlie. Torsten Schmidt That is not bad, come on. There are 365 days in a year. Gernot Bronsert When you are on tour you need to wait for other things as well, you need to
wait for planes, drivers, sound check… Sebastian “Charlie” Szary That is addition. In the end you have 150 days for waiting. Gernot Bronsert I would say two weeks. Torsten Schmidt It’s like being a supermodel. Gernot Bronsert Yes, that’s nice. Torsten Schmidt Just try and think of it that way. Gernot Bronsert I like that idea. Geisha. Torsten Schmidt Now what would your wife say about that? About you being supermodels? Gernot Bronsert I don’t know. I don’t know. Torsten Schmidt Obviously, you both do lead a family life. Now with all that waiting, how do you run a
family? Especially when you’re on tour all the time? Gernot Bronsert I don’t know. Now we have a tour manager and she is taking care of us. She has
been doing our booking since the beginning, and after a while we have fucked so
many things up. We lose flights, took the wrong trains, then the
booking agency decided to hire a babysitter for us, and since then we have a
tight schedule. Having a family, a little baby, or now a kid at home, it’s not easy
when you are on tour. And it means to me, that we pay the biggest bill. That
means that we don’t sleep that much, so we take always the last plane we
can get to the gig and take the first plane back home. That means we
arrive very late and then we leave very early. That means totally wasted to the
airport, no sleep sometimes. I remember one time we played at a festival in
France together with T. Raumschmiere, and we drank a lot. We went
together with him to the airport and the ground staff didn’t want to let us in
because we were smelling so much and we said, “No, we’re not drunk any more,
we stopped drinking two hours ago.” And T. Raumschmiere was just wearing
sunglasses like this, with his passport, and they didn’t want to let us in.
And that is because we took the first plane. And T. Raumschmiere has a little
baby, two little babies at home, and he is doing the same thing. Latest plane,
first plane. Torsten Schmidt Are there actual kindergartens and primary schools in Berlin for techno
producers? Gernot Bronsert It’s a good idea. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary We should do that. Opens very late. Two, four until one. Skpping Monday. Gernot Bronsert Little Ricardo is coming, hello! Little Modeselektor, hello! Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Black painted walls. Gernot Bronsert Strobe light. Little small customized Funktion One system. Our kids, they grow up with our music, with beats. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary They really love beats, bass drums. Gernot Bronsert Bass drums, they love bass drums. Torsten Schmidt Does that make the whole production process easier? Gernot Bronsert Which process? Producing babies or…? Torsten Schmidt That is kind of hard I hear, yeah. Gernot Bronsert They changed our rhythm totally. We used to work by night, always, so we would
just wake up at four usually. We started drinking at six and then we went at eight
to the studio, and we got out of the studio at seven in the morning, and since
the last two records we are not able to do that anymore. We have a studio day
job. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Like normal boring workers. We go to work at ten, we get a coffee, lunch break… Torsten Schmidt It is almost like an old socialist ideal, every artist works in the same way
as everyone in the factory. Do you find your health has improved? Gernot Bronsert I am tired. I’m just tired always. I feel always like jetlagged. I hope it
stops soon. Maybe in ten years. I feel always pretty tired, just because I
never get enough sleep. Never. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Too much traveling. Gernot Bronsert Too much children. Waiting for Charlie. Torsten Schmidt It’s getting really sad here, and on this note maybe we should go back to
the production process, but maybe we will leave the babies aside for a second
and talk about the music. What is it that you set up over there, is this only
for live circumstances? Would you use something similar when you are in the
studio? Gernot Bronsert No, this is just a live set. And that is a surprise today because he forgot
the records. We wanted to play some of our music and records, black discs, you
know them? That is why we wanted to bring them, you know? Yeah, we forgot them at home this morning, then we asked for a cab driver who was bringing the records from my
house, but it was already too late so I sent him back halfway. He was already
almost at the airport, but I needed to check in so I called him and told him to go back, we need to check in. We didn’t have
any records and then we had a great idea, let’s buy all our records on iTunes
and play them, but because we don’t have records on the computer and we have
all the live tracks, we can play the tracks live. We need to perform them live. That’s no fake, that’s true. Torsten Schmidt Shall we get into it straight away and leave a bit of the talk for a minute? Gernot Bronsert What should we play? Torsten Schmidt Are you taking requests like a wedding DJ? Gernot Bronsert OK, the first request. Let’s make it easier. One for girls or one for boys? Girls? Shit. OK, for girls. Which one? Sebastian “Charlie” Szary I have an option but I think it is too early? Gernot Bronsert I think we will play one of the tracks we did with our friend
Apparat together from the Moderat project. We can also play it
with the visuals, maybe that is a good idea and then after we play some stuff.
Do it like this? OK, can we turn the lights down? We want to see the
projection. So this was actually the first track we did for the Moderat
project, it is called “A New Error.” OK. Can you see it? Just have a look. (video: Moderat – “A New Error” / applause) Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Thank you. Gernot Bronsert This is the project we have with Sascha
Ring, the artist name is
Apparat and this is Moderat. The idea of this project is an audiovisual idea.
Charlie and me as Modeselektor, we work with an artist collective from
Berlin since the beginning called de Pfadfinderei. They are a pretty
famous VJ crew and agency and they are in charge of our artwork and our
corporate identity, whatever you want to call it, and they come with us on the
live shows usually. When we decided to make this Moderat thing happen, we just
added them to the bill and made an audiovisual record, and this was one of the
tracks with a clip made by them. Torsten Schmidt But if they are that much of a big part of the whole show, why is it not Moderat and
Pfadfinderei in the end? Gernot Bronsert That is always the question the Pfadfinderei are asking me. We put the emphasis on the
music first and the Moderat project was already existing since… Sebastian “Charlie” Szary …2003. Gernot Bronsert When, exactly? What day? Sebastian “Charlie” Szary It was 2002 during the soccer championship in Japan. Then we played with Apparat
some shows, some synchronized shows with our very amazing equipment, three laptops,
three boys. Then we tried to find a name. Then we found it. Gernot Bronsert The first thing that was existing was Moderat and that was one of the main
reasons we continued. We really liked the name. Apparat, Modeselektor,
Moderat. Torsten Schmidt But to some extent what is great about the project is that it somehow rather
accentuates things that are interesting in your separate work. It is almost
like it brings it out a little more. It is almost like euphoric music for
manic-depressive people. Gernot Bronsert You think so? It is not manic-depressive, it is more the mood we like when we
are in Berlin. Berlin is pretty depressive when you live there, when you grow
up there. Now it’s full of people from all over the world who are so
excited always, but they are there usually for one or two years and then they leave.
We grew up there and we saw the big changes and we still see the big changes.
It’s not a nice town, it’s not beautiful, not at all, I mean it got destroyed 90% in the World War. This record, it’s a little homage to this town, because we wanted to show the world that Berlin is not minimal techno and
having a party for three days. That is not the reality. Since the wall it is a
rave town. It is all about techno and electronic music. Torsten Schmidt What do you reckon is the percentage of people who actually grew up in Berlin
and are actively doing music, not everybody in Berlin who claims to be a DJ,
but is actively doing something and getting gigs with more than 20 people? Gernot Bronsert I don’t know. Torsten Schmidt Any ideas? How many people that you went to school with ended up in music? Gernot Bronsert None really, just me and Charlie. One of the funny things is that normal
people now, they have families like us but we are not normal. They have a house and garage, two
cars, all that shit, but they know Jeff Mills. That’s maybe some of the effects from Berlin. Torsten Schmidt As a visitor it almost seems a bit like New York in the 19th century condensed
in five or ten years. You always have these waves, and in the same way that you
have the Irish there and the Italians and the Germans and the Polish coming
into New York, it’s like, “OK, first of all everyone from
Schwaben comes there, then all the
other counties of West Germany, then...” Gernot Bronsert Then New York. In 2003, 2004, it was full of New York guys. That is where we
met all of our friends from New York. They are all back in New York, they just
spent two or three years. Fantastic
nobodies. We have a few friends we met
in Berlin that are from New York. Torsten Schmidt Then all the Latin Americans and Spanish came. Gernot Bronsert Yeah but they come just for the weekend. We call them EasyJet ravers. They arrive on
Friday, then they go straight to Berghain and they leave on Monday morning
almost dead. That’s why we have so many wheelchairs at the airport. On
Mondays. Some of them cannot walk any more. It’s over. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary It’s so sad. Gernot Bronsert I think I was 14 or something, 15 years old, I went every Wednesday to
Tresor club, which has closed now. It
is open but it is different, a different location, it is not run by the same
people. I went there every Wednesday because the entrance was just five marks
and I was able to afford it. Torsten Schmidt Who was playing Tresor on Wednesdays? Gernot Bronsert It was called Headquarters, new faces and residents. From time to time you had
the luck to see Mad Mike with a hockey
mask and Jeff Mills on a 909 and Rob Hood playing and I didn’t know what
was going on. Mad Mike was rapping. Underground Resistance with a hockey mask
and Rob Hood with a 909 and Jeff Mills and I was like, “Oh. What’s that?” And it
was on a Wednesday and the next day I went to school. “How was it yesterday?”
“It was nice.” Things like this are not possible any more. Torsten Schmidt Were you still part of the same school? You were years apart, but you were in
the same school? Gernot Bronsert I was a little shitty guy and he was the big dog. Torsten Schmidt Did you have any other rave buddies from school? Gernot Bronsert I have one who lives in New York now. He used to live in London so he
followed the music when he lived in London. Now he lives in New York and he is
still on the ball, he knows everything. “Hey, have you checked out this new UK
funky guy. Do you like UK funky? Hey, do you know this aqua-step guy from West
Brighton? Ah yeah, yeah.” I don’t know. What’s that music called from Argentina? Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Cumbia. You have ten
different styles of cumbia. That electronic part. It’s like a tree, you have the cumbia tree. Gangster, high speed. Gernot Bronsert Country, ambient tree. Whatever. Torsten Schmidt Why did you to stop working in the record shop then? Gernot Bronsert My problem was I had Monday. That was one of the main reasons I had to stop,
because we started playing at weekends and then the Monday was a bad day when
you play Friday, Saturday, Sunday, a typical Sunday thing. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Was somebody there on Monday? Customers? Gernot Bronsert Yeah, yeah. I couldn’t change the date, and then it was time to say goodbye and
Marcel Dettmann replaced me so I needed to work him in. Marcel came after me and he got the Monday and I said, “Heh.” [raises middle finger] Sebastian “Charlie” Szary And now you’ve got a Tuesday? Gernot Bronsert He is not in the store anymore, he is in the distribution, and he is ordering
the techno stuff, Euro stuff and US, so he is in charge. Torsten Schmidt Is there anyone working there that did not go on to make records? Gernot Bronsert Yes. Michael. He is one of the very, very long members. He is the only
friendly guy in the store. You will recognize him because he has glasses. They
are all friendly but you need your time to break the barriers. Every new face
they check, so when you go to Hardwax and you ask if they have some pumping stuff, then you can go. Just turn around and go. They will never serve you
properly. You need to read a book about Detroit and dubstep before and then go
and you need to drop some skills, you need to show you know what is going on. Torsten Schmidt So what are the ten best things stop a dubstep or Detroit techno imposter?
Someone who’s just read the book but not know what they’re talking about?
There must be a very delicate Hardwax way of finding out, “Do you know or are
you just pretending?” Gernot Bronsert No. I think the Hardwax communication is a very special way of communication.
It depends on who’s working. I had a few situations. So I think they asked me to
work in the store to bring some freshness again. Because you had, for example,
Pete, a.k.a. Substance], he is
working there since a long, long time and he specialized in one very special
type of music. Then you have other artists like René, who is
Vainqueur. I don’t know if you know
this. Everyone who was working there specialized in one thing. You have Marcel
for the techno stuff,
Sleeparchive is working at
Hardwax as well at the moment, it is a family thing. That is pretty weird. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary And you have Manel. Ask for Manel, next time you go to Berlin. Gernot Bronsert We forced him three years to make a record. We want to make a label for Manel,
Manel 001, we are waiting for the record. Torsten Schmidt Obviously, when you are in the store at least once a week, it’s relatively easy to keep
up with what’s going on. How do you manage that? Because you seem to be relatively
well-informed on what is going on. Gernot Bronsert There are two different sides. You have the internet thing. I get a lot of
postings every day and links to new stuff. Torsten Schmidt Of which you listen to how many percent? Gernot Bronsert I try to check everything. When I get the new Powerhouse promo from DJ Nobody then I don’t listen to it, but now I have a well-working system from people all
over the world. Jake is one of them, he sends me for the third time the same
link. “Hey! New record, totally amazing!” I know it. At Hardwax we have our own
little folder, where they are putting stuff we like. So I have one guy at the
store who totally knows what I like and what I am interested in, he’s putting
promos and all that stuff and I go once a week there and take my records and
check them. Torsten Schmidt Do you find that old-school system of someone in the store actually deciding
that’s something he could like, that’s something he could like and putting
them aside works better than these algorithms on Web stores where they go,
like, “If you bought this then you might want that”? Gernot Bronsert Of course. Because it’s a different way to bring people into music. The personal
thing is very important because after a while you have a relationship. I can just talk for myself, but... Sebastian “Charlie” Szary The feeling when you go in the store and you have a real person with a real
record who is showing you, OK that is a record and there is a story behind, linking to another project and you play it on a system, a very good system in a
record store — that’s the best promotion you can have to buy a record. For
example, when you go on the internet... Gernot Bronsert On the internet it is different... Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Every file is short. Bad quality. And it’s not a feeling. Gernot Bronsert I really like the idea to have a label which doesn’t want to have any
promotion, doesn’t want to have digital sales, just a stamp, white label, doing
it for fun, for the music. Sometimes you have a record which has success. For
example, last year there was a record from Hardwax, Equalized 03, and it was one of
the guys working there and he wants to be an anonymous. Torsten Schmidt Which one was it again? Sebastian “Charlie” Szary It’s not Manel. Gernot Bronsert [laughs] It’s not Manel. And this record had a really amazing success. Like the Sleeparchive phenomena, the
person behind Sleeparchive is producing music since ages, but he did totally
different stuff under different names, so I think they have different
pseudonyms, three or four names sometimes. But we are totally different. We
are kind of the ambassadors between the realities. We are there and on the
Friday we play in Spain with Richie Hawtin, and on the Saturday we
play on a dubstep party in Kenya, and on Sunday and we play in Scotland, a UK
funky garage house ambient country party. We are everywhere. First, it is fun to
discover everything and see what is going to happen. We really like pop and
bands. I would die for Blonde Redhead. When we play in the summer, the festivals, and I see Blonde Redhead is playing, then I
force the crew to stay two hours longer so that I can see them. They are
waiting on a bus totally pissed. Torsten Schmidt Finally you get your revenge and Charlie is waiting for you. Gernot Bronsert Yes. So it’s a good thing to be interested in everything but it has a bad
side on the same moment because you have so much input the whole time. You
have inputs from everywhere. Torsten Schmidt But I mean having too much input is probably the curse of our times, and that is
something we all have to deal with every single day, making decisions on what
we focus on. If you are open enough to be just tickled and interested in so
many different things… Gernot Bronsert Yes, but it’s a question of discipline, you know? Torsten Schmidt Natürlich! Gernot Bronsert I don’t have discipline. For example, I get addicted very fast and very quick
from several things. For example, I have a new app for my iPhone, a game or
something, or a little synthesizer, and I’m non-stop playing with that. I don’t
get bored of it, I get addicted. I need to delete this app to stop it. I just
recently gave all my passwords for all accounts from MySpace, Twitter,
Facebook to someone who is taking care of it now because I just realized that
I never read a book for months. I didn’t read a book in three months or
something and I just wasted too much time on the internet. That scared me a
little bit. I think everyone has this problem but I need to make cuts. Torsten Schmidt That is obviously a bit of life advice there that if you go back to the
studio and the production side of it, it is really like how do you actually
come up with a record that sounds like me or us in your case? Gernot Bronsert I don’t know. The thing is, when you asked me how I make the Moderat record, I
don’t remember. I remember situations when, for example, Charlie was
sleeping behind Sasha and me for hours and we were thinking about painting his
face black or something. But I don’t remember how I made this melody. It’s
like being on a rush. I just need the situation to get into. I need to get into a flow,
it doesn’t matter what I use. In the studio we use everything. We use software, we use
hardware, we use toys. I don’t know, microphones, instruments, everything. Sometimes
we create some sounds or melodies or beats and then we forget to record that
or to save the preset or whatever. There is one funny story. We set up one of
our studio rooms two years ago with analog equipment, so we have a lot of
analog equipment which is just lying in a corner and getting dusty. But this
time we said, “OK, now we make a proper MIDI studio like in the old days,” and
everything is fine and then it took us three days to set up the equipment. We were
thinking about, should we bring the Atari back? We really want to make it old-school. Then it was running and we made sessions and there was one session which was amazing. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary We switched the lights off to see the LEDs. It was like an airport, to see the runway, everything was red. Gernot Bronsert We were both wearing UR T-shirts and then we made it a session and we recorded
the session and we switched it off and after two weeks we wanted to listen to
the recording and Sebastian? We recorded it… Sebastian “Charlie” Szary …but with the microphone in the room and the phone was ringing in the middle
and there was no quality at all and we were just thinking, “OK, I was
barfing...” Gernot Bronsert He is the best barfer in the world, by the way. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary We still have it and it is a nice session. We tried to recreate it but it
wasn’t possible. Torsten Schmidt Win some, lose some. OK, so obviously, you can’t always recreate that when you go
live, but nevertheless you have to deal with all these punters that come there, pay good money to come and see you and they have certain expectations. How do you make sure you can give them the
experience that they want? Gernot Bronsert As I told you, the live thing and the studio thing are totally different
worlds. You cannot bring them together. When we are in the studio, we don’t
want to have people around us, so it’s like being naked. I don’t feel good. For
example, we have a friend from Japan and he’s a really nice guy. We have a
really nice friendship with him and he’s interested in electronic music and gear,
and it was just a couple of years ago, and he came to our studio every day and he
thought he was doing us a favor to show his respect. I was getting more and more into, I was feeling like
Big Brother because
I was sitting there and then, is he still there? I can’t do it now… Sebastian “Charlie” Szary He’s behind you… Gernot Bronsert I don’t like this, having people around us. For example, we change rooms
often. We used to have a caravan with a studio inside. It sounds pretty pimp
but it was shit. It was smelling inside like a dead cat or something. It was
not nice inside, but the sound was good and we just wanted to have the situation that
you can go everywhere you want and make music, record music and have fun. Torsten Schmidt How many times did you actually really use it, honest? Sebastian “Charlie” Szary A half time. Gernot Bronsert The problem is when you are in a caravan and you say, “OK, let’s go to a lake
and make a track,” then you don’t make music, you end up on the lake. It was
fun. It was an idea we had. We wanted to record the full-length record in this
caravan, but no. Torsten Schmidt But you had a nice sunburn. Now, when you say it is really personal when you are in the studio and you
can’t really deal with any visitors, and it is hard enough that you are two
already, so there is someone outside of your own brain and emotions there
while you are trying to come up with the idea. Gernot Bronsert We are one person in the studio, it is crazy, we don’t need to talk. We’re an
old couple. He is the technique geek and he’s to explain to me always all
these things. I have sometimes no idea what is going on with the computer and
then Charlies comes in and says, “Son, let me explain.” I say, “OK, now I got it, because of this…” He got me into music production a long, long
time ago, long time. He had a little studio at home and I came one day to him
and he had this E-MU sampler, an EMX-1, an Atari
and the Space Echo and I came
just by coincidence to him. I think I wanted to buy some weed, I don’t
remember. [laughs] Torsten Schmidt That is something every Berlin musician needs to drop. Is that how you got the
money for the Space Echo? Gernot Bronsert I’m just kidding, he never smoked. He tried sometimes, PCP or stuff like this. [laughter] Anyway, I came into his room and he had a loop running. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Sending it through the Space Echo. Gernot Bronsert And there was one button, the mode selector button, and I think we spent four or five hours with one loop playing with the button
going [mimes playing live] and since then we are a band called Modeselektor,
that is a story by the way. Should we play a track? Which one? Let’s play
“Sucker Pin.” (music: Modeselektor – “Sucker Pin” / live performance) (music: Modeselektor – unknown / live performance) Torsten Schmidt As far as live techniques go, laptop posing, a very difficult, right? Gernot Bronsert We’re so busy always, I think we don’t look like we’re checking emails. Torsten Schmidt That’s the main concern, right? Gernot Bronsert Yeah, I know. But I don’t care. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary When we started as Modeselektor we played with real electronic instruments, with
drum machines. We played only in Germany and Berlin shows. We did a little
Berlin tour, because it was impossible to carry all that stuff. One time we
played in Berlin, you have a little island on the river
Spree, there’s a club, it’s called Insel der Jugend, the Island of Youth, and we put all the gear on a stand over the bridge to the island. Torsten Schmidt The glamorous life of being a techno live act. [goes into the audience to figure out where a noise is coming from] So, about the whole being live,
how much of that is actually planned? Especially, with the Moderat shows, I mean, most
of the tracks stop when Carl Craig would start introducing the bassline. Gernot Bronsert You are talking about Moderat? Torsten Schmidt You know there’s the build-up, the build-up, the build-up and then, Oh! What happened? Gernot Bronsert That’s the way, that is the Moderat way. There is a very nice term for it. I
will remember later. When we play as Modeselektor then there is not really a
big plan behind. So we talk about which tracks we want to play and in which
order, but we change it anyway. When we play with Moderat we need to follow
the track-listing because we have a pretty massive visual set-up going on onstage and the VJ who is playing the Moderat clips live. It’s like playing in a
band, but we don’t have a bass player, we have a VJ and then we need to hold eye
contact on special songs, like, “OK… now!” There is one song called “Les Grand Marches” with Moderat, and there is a
concrete block in the middle, which is exploding in one special moment and he
needs to play it live. And they are always so nervous because of this song,
they’re just like this [mimes intense stare]. They are not musicians, they
are so into their visual thing and I told them always, “You just need to
count, just count the fucking song!” Maybe we can have a look at it? Torsten Schmidt Maybe, while it is warming up, you want to take a question? Audience Member So my question is, I saw that you were choosing tracks on the live PA, I wanted to know when you are performing you have to continuously play songs, right? So how do you go from one track to another? Gernot Bronsert What you saw is one song. So bassline, beat, vocals, hi-hats, snares, cymbal, and you
can save this up as a preset, so when you play the next song you go to the
next preset, push the button, pop. We customize this patch to play under every
circumstance you can imagine – rain, snow, drunken, without sleep, sleeping,
dead, everything. This patch Jihad Live is made from the people who use it. We
use it non-stop so, for example, when we buy a new MIDI controller we change
the whole patch for the MIDI controller. I buy a MIDI controller for just one
or two buttons. So I have more things to play. It is pretty intense to get
into this Max/MSP thing but Sasha, Apparat, is helping us a lot with that. For
example, Robert Henke, Monolake, he
is helping from time to time. We can change little things. But when I want to
change global things I need to call Professor Henke, Monolake. He is a professor
at the moment, at a university in Berlin. He replaced one of the Kraftwerk guys who was teaching there. Anyway. Torsten Schmidt When you go and buy MIDI controllers doesn’t it feel like, compared to buying a
synth, isn’t it a bit like going to buy condoms or something? Gernot Bronsert For example, we use these blue things, they are not available in the stores
any more, so I need to buy them on eBay because I really like the handling of
this controller. I think this is number eight already and the last one I
bought in the US so it took four or five weeks to get one. Then we sometimes use
this KORG thing and it’s too heavy, like seven kilo. Our Modeselektor rule is hand
luggage. I cannot wait on the belt for my luggage, I just need my luggage
straight. As I told you, I’m just tired of waiting. And anyway, when you play
a lot and tour a lot on aeroplanes then it is better to have everything. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary The hand luggage rule is only for Modeselektor, for Moderat we had 19 cases.
Four hundred kilograms. We paid extra luggage every time on every airline in the world. Torsten Schmidt Wouldn’t it make sense in that case to have an airline sponsoring you? Gernot Bronsert They don’t sponsor. Just soccer teams or championships. We are little
piece of shit for them. Lufthansa, hello. There is just one airline I want to
have as my sponsor and this is Lufthansa. Not British Airways. Audience Member So when you guys are performing live, as you were doing just then, and you
have sections when you are building up to a big drop and you take the bass out
for a while, and you bring in the drums or whatever else you’re doing, do you
guys have a set regiment sort of thing, or do you just feel it and go for it as
you please? Gernot Bronsert Just feel it. Sometimes we see it makes no sense to make a big rave deal here.
For example, we can play totally quiet. We can play a quiet set if you want to, or a totally J Dilla-esque set, or a trance set, in fact. We can do everything, you know? Mostly, we play all the genres in one
set so we have different parts always. Usually, we think in tempi, so we have
blocks, 100 BPM is the hip-hop block so we know we have a few tracks on 100
BPM. Then we have 140, my favorite… Sebastian “Charlie” Szary …and we can change the tracklists in the next ten seconds or five seconds. Gernot Bronsert Sometimes, we have a super friendly DJ before the show and he is playing two
or three Modeselektor tracks and you need to switch anyway and change your
set. It is all about feeling. Sometimes, we are totally tired and the show is amazing
and sometimes we are totally into it and it is medium. It’s random. There is no
concept, it’s not Chemical Brothers. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Which is not easy for the video guys. Gernot Bronsert They have the hardest job by the way, because they don’t know what’s going
on, they need to change everything. Torsten Schmidt So you’re having these intercom things like on the Tour de France? Sebastian “Charlie” Szary We Twitter it. We tweet it. Next song? Torsten Schmidt There’s another question over there. Audience Member I have got a question about the sound because I think you have a very
typically Modeselektor sound. Every track, every production when you hear it,
it must be Modeseleckor and nothing else because I think every part or every
track, it sounds very thick and punchy and it sounds like you didn’t use very many
tracks. One track, very minimalistic from the construction, but very punchy. Everything is very... I just wanted to ask about the equipment you use. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary I will show you, there is a secret. That’s the secret. Gernot Bronsert We don’t use soundcards. We recorded Thom
Yorke with that so you don’t need
soundcards. You don’t need big equipment. We have not really a nice monitor
situation at all. We just work a long time and test the tracks on sound systems. The good thing is when you tour, you can test your sketches and then you know exactly, “Oh, that’s too much bass.” Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Another thing is also to take the computer in the car, we have a mini jack
adapter, put it in the radio. That is the best listening you can have. Gernot Bronsert We are checking the tracks on a lot of things, his old ghetto blaster with his
first 100 Deutschmarks. Audience Member I just thought you have one regular way to do this. Gernot Bronsert No, we change speakers always. We worked a long time with Atom speakers, then we
switched to Mackie, then we switched to Genelec, now we are working with Genelec. In the end it’s just a speaker. We don’t care. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary The first speakers we used for the first records in 2000, 2001. Gernot Bronsert He found them on the street. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Old JBL speakers for a hi-fi. They looked like ’80s... Gernot Bronsert They were white, but they were yellow. They looked pretty fucked up. Yeah, but in the
end, there are just a few things you should take care. When you buy speakers, just read a little bit about how and where is the best situation and in the end
don’t spend too much time with the perfect situation to listen to music or to produce music. A friend of mine, Mark Ernestus, he owns Hardwax record store and makes music as well,
he spent two years building up his studio and it’s absolutely over on the
next level what this guy is doing. But I don’t need that. It’s really nice to
go into a studio like this and to have a mixdown, or master your stuff, or
listen to your stuff and have a reference. But I think we will never have a
studio like this, never. Gernot Bronsert Which is okay. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary It’s okay. Audience Member I just wanted to ask, you were saying it is like a rule not having a soundcard? Is it for any particular reason? Gernot Bronsert No. We bought sometimes soundcards and we checked them out and we tried to work
with them but in the end, no. We just don’t use them. If we want to have a
proper studio, we go to Apparat and his studio. He has a nice studio mixing
desk, same speakers. [looking at speakers in the room] Sebastian “Charlie” Szary These are really cool. Gernot Bronsert But they are lying to you. They sound too good. Audience member Don’t you ever get any latency on the MIDI control? Sebastian “Charlie” Szary We have a little offset regulation somewhere with the time sync. Gernot Bronsert I have a little delay because I’m a little faster than him. When we play live. Audience Member Hi, I’m Adam from San Francisco. Gernot Bronsert Hey Adam, what’s up? Audience Member How are you doing? What’s happenin’? Gernot Bronsert Hyphy! Audience Member Uh, yeah... Gernot Bronsert Where are your stunna shades? Audience Member That was five years ago, man. Gernot Bronsert I know. [laughs] Audience Member I was wondering, how do you guys control the mix of the different instruments?
Obviously, you have the mixer there but to know what the bounce is going to be
between the kick and the bass and all the different elements. Is somebody else
mixing the actual things? Gernot Bronsert We prepare the presets in the studio and then we check them on the soundsystems and after every soundcheck, I make new presets. For example, I have some presets which is two years old and I never touch it because I know it’s sounding perfect. And I have presets which I know, “OK, on this
soundsystem, it is better to make the hi-hat louder.” Sebastian “Charlie” Szary That is what we do during the soundcheck. Listen to every track to find a new
balance. Gernot Bronsert …to check it for the soundsystem so it works on the soundsystem. Which is not always possible, say,
at a festival where we don’t have a soundcheck. But usually, at a festival
there is a nice soundsystem. Audience Member Little question about your sound. Sometimes, it’s easy to forget that you
guys are from Berlin. I think you have more in common with London sound in a
way. A lot of vocals, multi-genre, a lot of big drops. When I think of Berlin
I think of longer sets that run on. What’s your thought about that? Is your
sound a backlash to that? Do you like that, are you not too into it? Gernot Bronsert That is what I wanted to try to explain when I talked about the Moderat
record. You cannot say the sound of Berlin is like this, you know? We are influenced by British rave music since the beginning. Dubstep is rave. Even Digital Mystikz, it’s rave because there is one idea behind it. Torsten Schmidt Who, by the way, are some of your biggest fans, actually. Gernot Bronsert Mala? Cool! I mean, we DJ and we’re
friends and the last time that somebody blew me away with minimal music… in
the end it’s minimal music. It’s not much, it’s dub, and dub is minimal. Very minimal.
Not the genre, I don’t like to think in genres. Genres are so old-fashioned. It makes not really sense in the end, it’s about the tune. If a track on
M-nus, Richie Hawtin’s label, is good, then it
is about the track and not about the cube or the black
dress, it’s about the tune. If you have a trance track, which is good, then
the track is good, you can’t change it. It is not here, it is in your ass and
in your heart. Audience Member I don’t really mean the track itself, I just more mean your entire set. You are not
the sort of guys to do a six-hour, slow build-up kind of set. Gernot Bronsert I am tired of it, because I grew up with that. That was the music, that was my first
music experience and I had that long enough so I don’t need that anymore. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary And when we talk about a short set, like Moderat is a short set, we want to
show a set like a movie. A movie is about one hour and one hour and a half
with no encore, no extras in the end. That was the plan from Moderat, and that is
the reason the set is kind of short, but it is intense. Gernot Bronsert And it is the difference between DJ and live. I cannot imagine to play a song
which is 12 minutes long. What should I do on stage? What should I do?
Waiting. Eight bars, 16 bars, hi-hats, effect. Eight bars, 16 bars, snare. Long break, C-part, end,
next track. Then you play one track for five hours over. I grew up with that. I
can’t do it. For example, when I’m listening to, say, a Digital Mystikz track, OK,
Mala, six minutes long, I could never make a track like this, because it’s deep. I just bought an
acid record from DJ Sneak yesterday, acid
tracks, an old one from ‘94, eight minutes long. It’s great to listen to and great to
dance to, but I could never do this. Audience Member Do you feel closer to the UK scene in that sense than the Berlin one? Torsten Schmidt You really want to claim him, don’t you? Audience member It’s just interesting to me because the kind of sound that you are doing is
all around me all the time. Gernot Bronsert Why not? Sebastian “Charlie” Szary We are feeling very close to you. Torsten Schmidt Speaking of which, is there any place on earth where you’re bigger than Glasgow? Gernot Bronsert Maybe Berlin, but I think, no. It is the same level, I think. I have no idea.
Last time we played there was Moderat and then I went with Jackmaster to the afterparty. He was playing there with Untold and in the end they needed to protect me because I think everybody in this club wanted to take a picture with me. I needed to sign everything, like arms, faces, hand. Cell phones. I don’t know why it happened. I think these guys were the first
guys who booked us in the UK. They were the day before in London at Plastic
People, but it was with
Martin from Rubadub, so the Glasgow connection. Then we
played with Numbers and since then we have played one or
two times a year with them. This year, we stopped playing Modeselektor, so we
have a break now and we continue touring with Moderat in the summer. And Jack
forced us to play Numbers so he is the exception this year that we play, and
tonight. Usually, we wanted to DJ tonight but I couldn’t find my record bag.
I’m not kidding, it’s true. So we play live tonight, Jack. No DJ set. Audience Member Getting a little back to the technical side of things. I was just wondering
what do you guys use to sync up your computers? Gernot Bronsert An ethernet cable. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary OUC. Audience Member Slightly less technical question, you have had a lot of really amazing
producers do remixes for you. Do you approach these people purely because
you’re into their music, or because of profile, or both? And which is your
favorite remix that you have had done for you? And another one quickly, is
there anyone who is obviously alive that you would love to remix your stuff and hasn’t yet? Gernot Bronsert I cannot tell you which is my favorite, maybe you have a favorite? [turning to Sebastian] It
wouldn’t be fair to say, “OK, the remix producer X did is the best.” Audience member Not the best because they all tend to be pretty good but maybe a personal
[favorite]? Gernot Bronsert I am pretty much into this Siriusmo stuff. I don’t know if you have heard of this guy. I’m pretty impressed by him
because I don’t get him, I don’t get what he is doing. He’s actually mastering
his new record for our Monkeytown label. We
started a label just a year ago called Monkeytown. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Don’t send demos to us, please. Gernot Bronsert We started the label just because of Siriusmo, because of this guy. He gave me
tracks and I was so depressed because it was too good, it was just too good. I
think the stuff and the remixes he did they were amazing, but I was so
impressed by the remix that Marcel Dettmann did for us, which is totally the
way you are talking about, but this is next-level quality. For us, it is a new thing to
get remixes because before we dropped the last record we just did remixes for
other people. And then we got these amazing remixes from all these amazing
musicians from this planet. Torsten Schmidt On that note, knowing all you guys’ applications and knowing you have a
certain love for a band from this country, how did your perception change
when, all of a sudden, people like Thom Yorke were name-checking you all the
time and asking for remixes and stuff? Gernot Bronsert We couldn’t believe it. It’s still pretty unreal. When someone asks me, “How
is Thom? How is Colin? How is
Björk?” I cannot tell you. It’s
like being on a rush. There was one crazy moment. We played in New York at
Studio B and we had a good time, and
backstage was a lot of friends, and then the club promoter came in, like, “Björk is coming. Björk! Whoa. Björk is coming.” Then Björk came in and we ended up
singing “Jump” from Kriss
Kross. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary And the moment that she came in,
it was so quiet. Thirty people. Gernot Bronsert Just boys, talking about beats and cars, YouPorn, and then everything changed. For me, when we toured with
Radiohead, that was for me the experience of
how big it is possible to be. The whole production was just amazing, how they work,
and very interesting. I think we released the first record called “In
Loving Memory” in 2002 on BPitch Control. We just did a one-off thing, just release it and that was it. Thom Yorke was on a German MTV show and he
talked about us, this record, and I think this is one of the reasons why we
said, “OK, it’s not that bad. Let’s continue.” Sebastian “Charlie” Szary We were very nervous in that moment. Can you imagine that? You receive 50
short messages on your phone. Gernot Bronsert All your friends are like, “Thom Yorke!” He is cooking his tea with water anyway, so... like everybody. Torsten Schmidt Do we have another question? Do you want to send us off with either a video or
something live or both? Gernot Bronsert [turning to Sebastian] Techno or electro or hip-hop or grime? It’s a little bit old-fashioned, I know. Sebastian “Charlie” Szary Let’s make a surprise. Gernot Bronsert UK funky is too new. [asking audience] Live or video? OK. Torsten Schmidt I guess this would be the official end of everything involving a mic so
please get up and thank the boys. [applause]

Morton Subotnick
Morton Subotnick grew up a brilliant but reluctant clarinet player. However, it was with a crowd of like-minded avant-garde composers and musicians in San Francisco that he hit his stride. With Don Buchla, he devised the first synthesizer, the Buchla, and was soon hitting the top of the classical music charts with Silver Apples Of The Moon. As artistic director of New York club Electric Circus he became a cult figure for the art-rock crowd. But Morton’s main concern was peering 100 years into the future, developing a new kind of music, based on freely available technology.
In this lecture at the 2011 Red Bull Music Academy, he reflects on the role of easy credit, his problem with military authority and why he had to leave San Francisco.
Hosted by Todd L. Burns Thank you for coming out this morning. There’s really no introduction that’s going to do it justice: Synth pioneer Morton Subotnick. (applause) I wanted to begin with something people may not know so much about, which is
synths certainly didn’t come first for you. It was a pretty normal instrument, the clarinet, which you started out with. Morton Subotnick Yeah, I started with the clarinet, it must have been 1939. Before most people
here were born here. (laughs) Todd L. Burns Why did you choose the clarinet? Morton Subotnick I was living in Los Angeles in an area that was mostly immigrants. Eastern European Jews, African-Americans, Mexican immigrants. We were on the east side of the Los Angeles River, which never had any water. It wasn’t like living in Los Angeles, it was like living in little countries. They determined that I had some kind of bronchial condition, a lung condition, as a kid and I should play some kind of wind instrument to help my lungs. My mother asked me what instrument I wanted and I said, “I want the instrument that goes like that...” (mimes playing the trombone) I had seen Tommy Dorsey. Todd L. Burns But you didn’t know the name of it. Morton Subotnick I didn’t know the name of the instrument, and she didn’t know one instrument
from another. So she went to the library – and this is almost a metaphor for growing up in a Jewish family – and she brought me a book without any pictures in it, only words. So I had no way to know. I went through the descriptions of all the instruments in the orchestra, but none described what it looked
like. So I picked the clarinet thinking the name somehow sounded like something you’d do this with. (mimes playing the trombone) When the instrument came it was not only not a trombone, but it was not even a clarinet. For anyone who knows, it’s a middle instrument. I looked at it and I guess I must
have looked disappointed because my mother asked me and I said, “No, this is exactly what I wanted.” I was too proud to say I’d made a mistake. I ended up playing the clarinet and within three years I was playing concertos. It was such an amazing experience because I didn’t know what everyone was talking about. Someone showed me how to play it and I played it. That was it. They gave me music and I read it. It was no issue. One of the reasons why I finally
got involved later with electronics is because the clarinet just seemed like my thumb; it didn’t seem like it was a challenge. Todd L. Burns I was reading an interview and it seemed like you didn’t really love the clarinet. It was just this thing that you could do really, really well. Morton Subotnick I may have actually hated the clarinet. In fact, I was drafted into the Korean
War with the army in the early ’50s. I didn’t go anywhere or shoot anyone or do anything, but I was drafted into the army. Just before I went – I’d never even touched a gun in my life – I had these dreams where I was standing up with a gun and a big bullet was spinning around and would hit me in my right arm. And as it hit I could feel the pain, it would knock my right arm off, it hit me in the
shoulder and my arm would fly away. I’d wake up in this euphoric state and
say, “Gee, I’ll never have to play the clarinet again.” (laughter) Todd L. Burns And I think when you were in the army you couldn’t salute. Morton Subotnick Oh, yeah. Where do you learn all this stuff? Todd L. Burns It’s the internet. Morton Subotnick I tried not to go into the army. One of the problems with the clarinet was it was very easy for me to do and I was very, very good, so I could make a living. I got out of high school and I wasn’t going to go to college. I was just going to do music, I was writing music. I got a job with the Denver Symphony Orchestra right out of high school. So I went and I met Stan Brakhage, the filmmaker, and Jim Tenney, various people who were just getting started, were just out of high school. What was the question? Todd L. Burns Your being unable to salute? Morton Subotnick I was gonna be drafted into the army and tried to get out of it. I went to school while I was in the Symphony to try to stay out, but I couldn’t stay out, the army finally got me. I went and thought, “Oh well, I’ll figure out a
way to get through this thing for two years.” The Musicians Union fixed it so that Herbie Alpert, myself and a bunch of musicians who were all the same age and were being drafted and were gonna get into the Sixth Army Band so we wouldn’t have to get killed and the world would have music later in life. I don’t know what that was. I figured, I could do this. I could do it. So I got in and the first thing I realized was that I can’t shoot a rifle. It’s not that I
didn’t know how, just that I passed out every time I pulled the trigger. The impact was so foreign to me, the noise, the whole thing. I never managed to hit a target in the whole eight weeks of basic training. The second eight weeks of basic training, I’m walking down to get there. It wasn’t Oklahoma,
but it was some place I’d never been before, and I’m walking and this general, he had things all over him (brushes shoulders), and I walked up to him and I know you’re supposed to stop and salute, but I’d never been face-to-face with an officer before. I realized that just as in the dream where I had my right
arm knocked off, I had no right arm, I can’t feel it. It wasn’t paralysed, it just disappeared. I’ve never had an experience like that since, I had no right arm. No part of my brain would make contact with my right arm. So I just kept walking and he stopped me and said, “Soldier, how long have you been here?” I said I’d just arrived. He said, “I thought so. Well, when you see an officer what do you do?” “You salute. Yes, sir.” And he said, “OK, dismissed.” And he walked away and I know you’re supposed to salute when they walk off but I couldn’t, I had no right arm. I read somewhere that if you salute with your
left arm that was very bad, it was like you’re making fun of the officer. So I didn’t try to salute with my left arm. And he stopped me again and we went through this whole thing, back and forth. “Salute.” “I can’t.” “Salute.” “I can’t. I can’t.” To him “I can’t” meant that I won’t. I don’t know how long it went on, it seemed like a lifetime, perspiration pouring down on me. I had no right arm. Finally, he takes me into the commanding officer of my company. I was assigned to a band at that point, because I was going to play in an army band. So he comes in and whoever he was, this officer tells them
to put me in jail and start court martial proceedings. Nine weeks in and I’m gonna spend the rest of my life in an army jail. So the guy leaves and they look at my records and say, “Hey, you played in the Denver Symphony.” I said, “Yeah.” He said, “Go get this guy a clarinet and some music.” So they brought the music in and I played it for them. They said, “Great, we’ll get you out of
this jail thing if you’ll volunteer to play all the solos for us for the next four weeks. We have all these television shows and the only guy who can play it is sick in the hospital.” I said, “Sure, but I really have this problem.” He said, “No problem, if you’re not in uniform you don’t have to salute. And
if you’re in a formation you don’t have to salute. So you get yourself an apartment off base and some civilian clothes, come in, change into your uniform, sit down. It’ll just be a job. At the end of the day you get back into your civilian clothes and you go.” What was interesting about it was that he actually believed me, he didn’t ask any questions. I don’t know if that ever happened to anyone else. So I got through that eight weeks and the rest of the time in the army, every time I saw an officer I’d hide behind a tree. Or if I was driving in a car and I saw the flag coming down, I’d hide under the dashboard because you had to get out and salute. I spent a year and a half hiding from officers. It was horrible. It’s a funny story, but it wasn’t funny at the time. Todd L. Burns So the army didn’t go so well. It wasn’t your thing. Morton Subotnick No, it wasn’t my thing. It was really not my thing, no. Todd L. Burns After you got out you went back to Denver? Morton Subotnick No. Well, for a little bit. Because I was in the Sixth Army Band, I was in Presidio in San Francisco. While I was in the army it was like a day job, basically. It was not hard. The only hard part was staying away from officers. The band was made up of fabulous musicians. Herb Alpert is the one that comes to mind, but many of them stayed on. They were all good musicians. I got involved in the avant-garde scene in San Francisco, so when I got out of the army I decided to stay. But I’d never studied composition; I’d learned music on my own. I had a good education, but it was not a traditional education. I went back to Denver to finish a degree one summer. I had a few things I could do that would get me a degree. And I came back and studied with Darius Milhaud, a French composer at Mills College. I stayed on, they gave me a fellowship to go there. That’s where I met my friends, Terry Riley and the whole group. Todd L. Burns Before we get to that, I remember one story of your first public performance in Aspen. Morton Subotnick That was when I was with Darius Milhaud. I was writing avant-garde music at the time and at that time – 1956, maybe – avant-garde music was a thing. It wasn’t like 100 different things, it was a thing and I was doing that thing, that avant-garde music. Darius Milhaud had done that thing, but it was a different
thing from 1920, so he didn’t like my thing but he liked me. Todd L. Burns He was from France. Morton Subotnick He was part of Les Six, the group that
turned Paris upside down in the ’20s. Todd L. Burns What was so different about what he was doing compared to what you were doing that he was turned off by it? Morton Subotnick They were writing music in three different keys at the same time – G and C and F-sharp, all at the same time. They did various things. It was part of the surreal movement, the Dada movement, all of those things were happening in the ’20s in Paris. I was doing post-Webernian music, a lot of grammaticism, noise. I was already starting to experiment with
technology and things like that. The story, that will also reflect back on Milhaud, is he hated my music but he loved me and he loved the fact I was sort of like him when he was young. So when I finished my degree he offered me a fellowship to come to
Aspen. At that time I had a wife who was very ill and a child and my expenses were huge. I had no money. He knew I was working night and day, I was playing with the San Francisco Symphony, everything I could do to make money. He said, “Why don’t you take the summer off and just write music and we’ll pay money for you able to do that?” And so I did, and I was so thrilled and happy with him. I was conducting concerts of his music and other people at that time. So I was thrilled to have the equivalent of three months to do nothing but write music. That was just unbelievable. I don’t know how old I was, 25, 26. The first thing I did was write a piece in the style of Darius Milhaud, a quintet for clarinet and string quartet. He loved it; it took me 48 hours. I had a great facility to write in any style, so I could do that. He loved it, put me on in concert in the tent at Aspen, Colorado. This is a huge festival. That and Tanglewood were the two main festivals in the United States and at that time, that was practically it
for festivals. And here I am, I was going to have this piece played, my first major public performance. Then I started to write my music and I wrote this piece for four-hand piano, which I thought was without question one of the freshest [ideas]. If anyone heard this piece they’d hear something they’d
never heard the like of before. So I took my quintet off the concert and put
my four-hand piano piece on. About two weeks before the performance I was rehearsing with the pianists and I thought, “Maybe I better tell Milhaud that I took the quintet off.” So I told him and he was really upset. I said, “No, Milhaud, wait until you hear it, you’ll love it, you’ll really love it.” He said, “My dear, I won’t love it, but you do it anyway.” So I put the piece on and there was no question that this audience was going to say, “My God, I’ve never heard anything like this before. This is fantastic, a brand new way of hearing music.” And I thought they would stand up and cheer and I thought, “What a way
to start my career!” There were four sections and by the end of the second section – there were pauses; there weren’t really movements but there was empty space, some silence – people started laughing and making noises. By the end of the third section they were making so much noise the pianist had to
stare the audience down to be able to go on to the fourth section. By the end of the fourth section, I was absolutely right, they were standing up – but
they didn’t applaud, they were screaming, pounding on the pianos, the woman in front of me said, “Did some kind of monkey write that piece of music?” I went out ready to spill my lunch. Milhaud was there in a wheelchair – he’d been in a wheelchair for years – and was sitting next to the exit as I was going out.
I was in a terrible state, I’d never been in so much pain in my life, except maybe the saluting. But it was something awful, so unexpected for me. I was going out and Milhaud pulled me down, with tears running down his face, and said, “Thank you, my dear, it reminds me of the old days.” That was my first
performance. (applause) Todd L. Burns So you get back to San Francisco and you say you were immediately already
knowing some people there? Morton Subotnick I was in the army there and while I was in the army I played, I had performances, but they were all small performances with the avant-garde. I met a lot of people at that point, while I was in the army. So I went to study
with Milhaud, and at that time Pauline Oliveros was studying at the San Francisco Conservatory and Terry Riley was studying at the San Francisco Ramon Sender was
studying at Mills – they don’t know Ramon, but he was part of the group. La Monte Young was at Berkeley and we were all part of a young group. We did concerts together and we were all close friends. Todd L. Burns And you eventually decided to get a space together, to pool all the equipment
that you’d accumulated. Morton Subotnick Actually, I was the only one working with technology at the time. Todd L. Burns What were you working with? Morton Subotnick (laughs) What was I working with? Well, I was working with a Dujour tape recorder. You could set it at five different speeds. It wasn’t synched, so it wouldn’t run at the same speeds. From the beginning to the end of the tape it would get faster, or slower I guess, whatever happens as you get more tape at
the other end, the machine would go slower. It would go the equivalent of a whole step slower. And a microphone. And I had taken a Wurlitzer electric piano apart. Basically it
was musique concrète, though. There was no equipment. I had a garage for a studio and I got parts from automobiles, trolleys. Pauline helped me push a broken piano down a whole flight of stairs so we could break it apart and I could get the parts I wanted out of it, so I could make sound, which I hung in there. So I had a hammer, a couple of mallets, and I turned the Dujour tape recorder and I choreographed as I moved through the room, hitting things as I went. I’d have about two minutes of performance – they were called action pieces. Todd L. Burns Seems like a big step, though, for you guys to buy or rent a space together. Morton Subotnick We were giving concerts, Ramon, Pauline and I, at the San Francisco Conservatory. Stockhausen had just done his first really big tape pieces. The Gesang had just come out
and also other music. Some was technological tape music, but most of it was instrumental music of some sort. We did this for a period of two years. It was called Sonics, the series, and we gave this concert, which turned out to be our last concert, but it wasn’t intended to be. I found a tape in an alley and I sealed it. It was obviously something someone had thrown away. I was working with the Ann Halprin Dance Company, I have some pictures here, I can show you those, so let’s leave time for that. The
work I did with them was not traditional dance at all. Some perfume company had just invented a kit where you could make your own perfume by mixing different odors together. The dance company was going to go through the
audience and interview people in the audience and decide what kind of smell they should have and make the perfume that would do that. We called the piece, which was the bulk
of the evening, Smell Opera with Found Tape. I was gonna open the case of the
tape and play it for the first time in public. We didn’t know what was on it,
and the group was gonna come and give everyone the odor that their personality deserved. Tony Martin was doing visual projections and Ramon found an old metal washing machine and used different kinds of pieces of metal and
rocks and ran the old washing machine, which played percussion. We put all of this together and did the performance. We also did a tropical fish opera, which I actually have some movies of too, on that concert. When it was over, the next day the newspapers had a big headline in the arts section saying,
“Concert Literally Stinks.” And the San Francisco Conservatory decided we should never enter the premises again. So that was our last concert. Ramon and I were really the only two working with technology. He said, “We can’t work
here any more, so why don’t we pool our stuff and get a place?” So we did and we found this old Victorian house that was gonna be torn down on Russian Hill near Chinatown in San Francisco and they gave us the entire house to take care of until they were gonna tear it down. They didn’t know when they would do that. So we had a free place and we brought our stuff together. We knew there were other pieces of equipment in the world than what we had. Todd L. Burns What did you have? Morton Subotnick We had nothing. He had two Hewlett Packard oscillators and my tape recorder and the parts of automobiles; that’s all we had. Ampex had loaned us some equipment but that was after we got in there. They loaned us a professional tape recorder. We went to this woman who ran the Wells Fargo bank, a very, very wealthy woman who’d just bought a Stradivarius for a string quartet. We asked her if she could give us some money to help us develop what we were gonna do and she said, “Sure, but you’ll have to become non-profit.” That’s how we got started, we paid $125 and became a non-profit corporation. We didn’t know what to call it, but at the time the European world was divided between musique concrète and electronic music. Cologne had the electronic music and Paris had musique concrète and you couldn’t mix the two. It was like oil and water; they wouldn’t mix. Stockhausen I’d met that year, I think. I don’t know if it’s a true story, but he’d said he had to put a microphone in his pocket in order to take it into the electronic studio
because they didn’t want microphones in the electronic music studio in Cologne. I don’t know if that’s true but that’s what he told me. Anyway, we decided not to call it either electronic music or musique concrète, we called it the San Francisco Tape Music Center. Anything you ended up on tape with was music, so that’s why it was called that. We called her on the phone and said, “Now we’re non-profit. Can you send us some money?” She did – she sent us a cheque for $25, which we then put on the wall and never used. But that’s how we pooled our equipment, that was the reason. Todd L. Burns Tell me about meeting Stockhausen. What were the circumstances? Morton Subotnick I’d met him a number of times, I can’t remember the first time. We were going
to festivals. Stockhausen was just another guy. It wasn’t like I remember, “Oh my God, that’s Stockhausen!” This was just a guy. Todd L. Burns Was there someone who was that guy in the early electronic music world that
you looked up to? Morton Subotnick There were none; there was nobody to look up to. We were all struggling to get
started. There were no synthesizers and even at that time I thought the studios were pretty stupid. The idea of having to cut tape... One thing Stockhausen said – not when I first met him, but he was touring the United
States giving lectures – he gave a lecture saying, “Now that we have this electronic music, we won’t need musicians anymore.” I remember saying, “Come on!” To go from C to D (sings scales) you’d take a tape and measure it and then (sings) and measure that. You’d lay them over, but it doesn’t go. (sings) It goes... (sings) You have
to make a diagonal cut of four inches across the tape and I said, “You can’t tell me that’s gonna replace musicians.” But there was nobody to look up to at that point. There was nothing. It’s hard to imagine, but there was just nothing. It was great. We were making things out of nothing. Todd L. Burns At what point did you conceive the idea that you wanted some sort of machine that became what the Buchla was? What was the idea that you wanted to be able to get out of it? Morton Subotnick What’s up there (points to timetable on TV screen) is the timetable of the period we’re
talking about and if you look you’ll see the transistor, the tape recorder and the credit card all came into being at the same time, right at the time I’m talking about, when we were beginning to pool equipment, up to the end of the ’50s. I realized – this was before we pooled the equipment, and probably before I met Stockhausen or anybody else, because I think those all were ’61, ’62, ’63, so we’re talking about the late ’50s here, up to 1960. I was completely aware – as were many other people, not a large number of people,
but enough – that the world was about to change radically because electronics
were gonna be cheap. It was clear we were moving into a moment in time in
history that was equivalent with music to the printing press with words. That was startling to me. I thought, “My God, what a time to be alive and to be my age.” I could’ve stayed on being a musician; I had no problem with that. I was doing pretty well writing music for instruments. My music was beginning to being played, in spite of those people who booed me at Aspen. I knew nothing
about electronics. I had this tape recorder, I was experimenting, but I knew nothing about electronics. But I knew enough to know to what was about to happen. I thought, “I’m going to try to make a piece. If I feel I have the aptitude for the technology I’m going to throw the clarinet away finally and not write music for instruments anymore and dedicate myself to this point in history, because I’m at a pivotal point.” And I didn’t think it was because I could write great music, but I could be part of that change. And who
wouldn’t like to have been there at the beginning of the printing press and to
have been a part of it? And who would like to be the person who says, “Who
needs this? We don’t wanna do that,” and so forth. I really felt this was an important thing that I had an opportunity to be a part of. Todd L. Burns Where do credit cards come into it? Morton Subotnick Thank you! The reason it was going to become important was because up until that moment in time, to play music you had to learn to read music, to take music lessons, you had to have the money to do it. This was an upper-class,
very stratified thing, from the time of
Aristotle at least, at this point we’re talking about recorded music was fine art music and it was only that for
the elite. Not for any reason other than economics. You couldn’t afford it, you didn’t have the time, you didn’t have the money to train your kid in music. In Italy it was different because they trained orphans to do music from the time of the Renaissance. But for most of the world it was part of the aristocratic thing. But what the printing press did – the same thing happened there – the word was part of the church, it was part of the authority. Once the printing press came, everybody
could read. You started having many religions, many ideas. The demography of ideas wasn’t there before. This was going to happen in music, but for it to happen it had to be cheap. And transistors were very cheap and a credit card meant you didn’t even need money. It was so cheap that it was clear in 1959 that
everybody in the world would have an iPhone. (laughs) Something. That’s the reason the
credit card became important. That was the tip-off for me that there was going to
be a change, not just people who knew electronics. A Hewlett Packard oscillator cost $400 in 1959. That’s the equivalent probably to $10,000 for one oscillator that did nothing but go... (makes oscillating noise) We
couldn’t even afford that. We happened to be given a Hewlett Packard oscillator; we didn’t have $400 to buy it. So suddenly that was all gonna change, that was the reason. Todd L. Burns I can’t imagine what Ableton would have cost back then. At a certain point you called in engineers and interviewed them, because you had an idea you wanted to build something but didn’t know exactly how to build it. Morton Subotnick That was ’61 or ’62. I’m talking about this period here. I made a piece that was performed in 1961 in San Francisco that had two Dejour tape recorders, so I could get sound all around the room, two two-track tape recorders, I had four musicians, I had lighting flats and a person who spoke. It was a big multimedia piece that was about 45 minutes long and when it was over, unlike my performance three or four years before in Aspen, the audience went crazy. The critics said a new artform had been born and we performed it three times in three weeks. People called me and wanted to tour the thing; it was amazing. I put it away,
I didn’t tour with it but I decided, yes, I must have the aptitude to do this. So I’m gonna start. I’m giving up the clarinet as soon as I can afford to do it. I’m not going to write any more instrumental music. I’m going to dedicate myself to whatever this new thing is going to be. I said to myself, “The first thing we’ve got to do is to get rid of cutting tape. We need something.” And I was thinking that 100 years in the future – which it almost is, well, 50 years – and what would be the kind of thing that would progress at that point? I was thinking of something I called an electronic music easel, something you’d have in your home and you could make any sound you wanted, you could paint sound. You’d be able to create new
things. I didn’t know what that was going to be. One thing I need to get across, I didn’t want to go to a new technology and make music that could’ve been made with a black and white keyboard on a piano. It wasn’t just sound; it was an entire new music that would come about. What was going to happen once the demography of economics that meant it was going to be cheap – everyone was going to have this – meant that over a period of time a new art would evolve from people who didn’t study at a conservatory but just liked to do things on their own. Maybe people who did would do different things and a new art would evolve and I wanted to be part of it. But the only way I could be part of it was to get the object, one similar to what they’d be using in 100 years. I had an idea of how it would work, what it would do, not how it would be made, and put an ad in the paper once we had the Tape Center to invite an
engineer to help me make it. Todd L. Burns What did the ad say? “We want to make the future of music”? Morton Subotnick You know, I don’t know, I have no idea. I wish I could get hold of it, but I have no idea what it said. I didn’t think I was doing something historic at the time so I never kept a copy of it. It was a want ad, probably cost $20 for one week. Looking for an engineer to make... well, I think I probably called it an
electronic music easel. Easel is a nice metaphor for it; you can paint music. Three guys came by. This was 1961 or ’2. The
LSD movement, the psychedelic movement started in 1964-’65, so this was about two years before that. I had no idea that one-third of San Francisco was on drugs. I really did not know that. None of us did. The first engineer came. I thought he had an eye problem because his eyes were looking in two directions at
the same time. He was incoherent, he couldn’t talk. So he left. The second one came and he was pretty much in the same condition, so I began to figure out what was going on. Then the third, Buchla came, Donald Buchla, and he was someone you could talk to, he was good. Todd L. Burns So the only one not on drugs was the one you picked? Morton Subotnick He was probably on drugs, I don’t know, but he was coherent. I don’t know if he was on drugs. Not only that, but he had already had a similar idea, so he was completely prepared to move forward on the idea. Todd L. Burns It seems like a large break to say, “We don’t want it to have keys, we don’t want it to look like what came before.” Morton Subotnick Try to put yourself in the position... I need pictures to do this. (fiddles with
computer) Can we have pictures over here? Todd L. Burns Is there someone who can come up, please? Morton Subotnick This is what the Buchla looked like when it first got done. (pictures) It seems like a big break. Remember at the time what I imagined we’d be involved with wouldn’t come into being for 100 years. I had no idea what it was going to be, but the notion was I didn’t want to continue the Columbia Princeton, the big RCA synthesizer that
had existed, that came in the late ’50s. What they made there was the same old music, but it sounded worse because it was just (makes bleeps), no nuance or anything. The idea prevalent at the time was, now that we’ve got the beginnings of computers and this technology, we’ll be able to make music better than it was before. You’ll be able to play
low notes faster and you can write anything. That was sort of what Stockhausen
was referring to. I thought that’s really dumb. I was a fine musician, I can
already do that. I remember when it turned 2000, a German keyboard magazine interviewed me and asked me, “Now, in the future can we make a perfect piano?” I said, “The piano already is perfect; it does everything it was supposed to do.” The whole notion seems odd
– still does today – to think we’ve got all this technology, so now we can play music again that we can already play. When I did Silver Apples of the Moon on the Moog, they did Switched on Bach. People thought that was electronic music. No, it’s Bach, played on an electronic instrument. It’s not electronic music, it’s not a new artform. It’s not something the technology
demands. I was a trained musician, so I thought the way to go about this is
to start without anything that resembles the tradition. So you get rid of the
black and white keyboard immediately. I don’t know what the music is going to
be, but it should come from the object itself, like the grand piano of
Liszt and Chopin made music you could never play. It took a while, because most
of the music on the keyboard was harpsichord music played louder and softer.
Finally you find a genre of music that’s not a whole new music, but a genre
that fits that piano and nothing else. You couldn’t get it any other way. And now we’re looking at something much bigger than that, a new metaphor for music
itself. Because now it’s going to be made by people who didn’t necessarily grow
up learning music; it’s going to be a whole different thing. The first person
who hit two sticks together, two stones together, the first person who hummed
the same thing one time after another until it caught on and other people
hummed it. That’s what I was looking for. I didn’t know what it was gonna be. Even today it’s hard to imagine that one could imagine what that music would be. So I did not want the keyboard – that would be too easy to go back to traditional music. Todd L. Burns That’s a great lead-up to listening to Silver Apples of the Moon, to
describe what it is you did with this synthesizer. Morton Subotnick Yeah, listen to the very beginning of that. (music: Morton Subotnick – “Silver Apples of the Moon”) The first thing you notice is that the (imitates) is not anything you could
have done on the piano. The second thing you notice is there’s little plucks that
you could’ve done. When I finally got this, four or five years later, I realized that I didn’t know what it was going to be. Even without a keyboard I was brought back into the musical world. It wasn’t exactly a piano but it was the “boops” and “beeps” from my avant-garde musical background. I didn’t think that was a problem, because people in the future wouldn’t have had my background. But I wanted to get rid of it and it took me a while to get to that point. Can you play a bit of the second side? Second side! It’s a CD, I mean, the second part around the middle point. (music: Morton Subotnick – “Silver Apples of the Moon” (continued)) Not there, further down. About halfway in. That’s it. (music: Morton Subotnick – “Silver Apples of the Moon” continued) That was totally forbidden at that time. Todd L. Burns Why? Morton Subotnick Because you tapped your foot to it, you liked it, it made you move. We didn’t have hip-hop yet. We had rock & roll, but this wasn’t really rock & roll. The fine art world was devastated by this. I have to tell you, in 1966 I was helping to create the Electric Circus, which was a big discothèque in New York, upstairs from the Andy Warhol, Velvet Underground, and I was really dedicated to the idea of the demographic equalization of things, that everybody could get their hands on it. I was creating the beginnings of multimedia discothèques and the opening of Electric Circus was coming up so I was working on the music for it. This was originally before I started making Silver Apples of the Moon. I was already working on that as part of the
opening for the discothèque. It started with a heartbeat. It was a fancy occasion, everybody was in tuxedos, they had Seiji Ozawa from the Boston Symphony. The Kennedy family were all there. It was a big thing because the people who had the money for the Electric Circus brought all these people down to make a big deal. We started in the dark with a heartbeat that ran at the tempo of this. Buchla designed the electronics of the place. The subwoofer was attached to the floor of the dancehall so the whole floor shook, literally shook. You were
inside the speakers, so to speak. All light bulbs were controlled by the Buchla synthesizer. This had not been done before. People had tried it but not in any kind of public situation, the beginnings of strobe lights and so on. We had people who were hired from circuses on tightropes, dressed in white and black lights
so they would shine blue as they walked across. One was eating a banana as he
walked across. He would appear again and again in different spaces and it would keep building and building and building until you get to this music. You can play a little bit of it again right there. (music: Morton Subotnick – “Silver Apples of the Moon” continued) You kept moving with this until it reaches this frenzy. Lo and behold, when the lights got big enough you could see that actually everybody was dancing to it, which never occurred to me anyone would do. I was thinking of this frenzy sort of primitive experience with technology of growing to this thing. I had no idea anyone would groove to it. Now I’ve lost the question, you probably lost it too. Todd L. Burns I guess I was going to ask you why you moved to New York from San Francisco. But I guess given the chance to have this... Morton Subotnick San Francisco was great, I loved San Francisco and thought I could stay there my whole life. We were a major avant-garde entity in San Francisco. By the time I was 30 years old I was really well known in San Francisco. I still didn’t know what I was doing – I still don’t, but I think I’m getting there.
But I was concerned with my aptitude to be able to deal with this. I knew I had some aptitude but I didn’t know how far I could go with this thing. I began to feel, like the clarinet when I was a kid and I’d play the “Flight of the Bumblebee” all staccato, 11 years old and people would go, “Oh my God! This is incredible, put him on the radio.” I thought, “I don’t get it.” I was looking 100 years down the line, and I wasn’t sure where it was going. I wanted to stay with it if I could, but I didn’t know if it was meaningful enough. San Francisco became like my mother. My mother would go, “Oh, you’re so smart.” “Of course, I’m smart. You’re my mother.” San Francisco was like a small town and we were
really great in San Francisco but I didn’t care about that. I wanted to really have an impact. I wanted to do something or not do it. So I was offered an opportunity to go to New York and be artist in residence at the new school of arts at NYU. That was gonna give me enough money to live on; I could give up the clarinet. I didn’t go to New York for any other reason, except I thought to myself, “This is the chance for me to really find out. This is the big time stuff.” New York, as we all know, is so tight, so public-oriented, everything generates from that place.
If I feel I’m really doing something in New York that makes sense, then I’ll
stay with it. If not, then I’m gonna go to Lawrence, Kansas – a little town in the middle of the United States and be a schoolteacher, because I knew I could talk and lecture – and forget about trying to do something if I find I’m
incapable of doing it. I was there a year when Silver Apples of the Moon came out and suddenly I’m on top of the charts and a public figure and I thought, “Damn, I’ll never get to Lawrence, Kansas.” (laughs) Todd L. Burns Were you surprised that it made a dent in the charts? Morton Subotnick Oh, yeah. In hindsight it makes sense, but at that moment... Todd L. Burns I don’t think it makes a ton of sense. Morton Subotnick Well, it does because I was right. The world was moving towards a new paradigm, the record player was taking place of the piano in the home as something to hear music with. These were all things I predicted back in 1961,
this was this machine that wasn’t supposed to be bought by anyone, but was a model for what the world would be like in the future. This was a world in which people would walk around with buds in their ears – I didn’t see that in
particular – but it would be personal and everybody could be doing it. The fact that I made music that was electronic and visceral. It wasn’t heady music, it was music that I really felt got to me and got to these other people as well. It was the kind of music I could pick off a record shelf and think, “I’d like to listen to that.” Most of the music you were listening to then was
so you could go to a concert and understand it. But this was visceral music. The reason Switched on Bach was so good, they bought more Switched on Bach
than they bought Bach because it was switched on. That was the moment, and I happened to hit that moment. I had no idea I was going to hit that moment. Todd L. Burns What doors opened up after this became this more mainstream thing? Morton Subotnick The synth became mainstream, but the synth, not this synth. (points to
laptop) The Moog. I knew Bob [Moog] quite well, but before he died we were doing lectures together and panels and things and we were both going through the history. I didn’t know what was
going on in the rest of the world, but Bob probably built a synthesizer
before we did. And he said, “Oh no, you guys did the very first one as far as
I know. I had a couple of modules and I was getting ready, but then someone
said, ‘Why don’t you build a synthesizer like this one over here?’” It wasn’t
called a synthesizer, but a whole system. And he said, “I looked at your system and I
loved the idea of the touch-plate keyboards and everything.” He didn’t know
anything about music. He said, “All my musical advisors tell me I have to use a black and white keyboard.” Nobody would know the name Moog if you hadn’t, because what happened from that point on is exactly what I was trying to avoid. Everybody started making the same old music, but with electronics. Some of it was a little new music, but it wasn’t a different music. With a keyboard. That caught on. In terms of mass media that’s what really took off. Synthesizers took off, but not my
concept of the synthesizer. My world that I saw 100 years in the future, as far as I can tell, is just barely beginning right now in terms of the demography. I’ve been travelling a lot, going to concerts and festivals and being brought to perform, and I’m seeing it a lot. People are beginning to understand what I’m talking about – beginning to, anyway – and seeing that there is another world out there. That world isn’t out there, that world is in here, that we have to find for ourselves. But it’s not easy. It’s a hard one to discover what you would do if you didn’t have a black and white keyboard. It’s like traveling in a new city without an iPhone. Todd L. Burns It seems strange, though, that this has popular success if people hadn’t caught on to
what you were doing. Morton Subotnick You mean being on the top of the charts? Yes, that’s true and that I can’t figure out to this day. But the top of the charts, when it came out it hit the top almost immediately, the classical music charts, not the pop charts. So it was at the top of the classical music charts and at that point I was going a
lot to Washington DC, about a 90-minute train ride, and I thought, “God, maybe
later this year I’ll be able to buy an automobile, I’m on the top of the
charts.” I got my first royalty check and it was for $2,000, which even in those days wasn’t going to buy me a car. I could just about have bought a car, but not the gas to go. And I thought that can’t be right. I was on top of the charts the whole time. I found out with popular music – we’re talking 1967 at
this point – it was how many records were sold per week or month. With classical music it was how many reorders in five record stores across the United States. The original order was for three – they’d get three in and when the three went, then they’d reorder them. So I had the most reordered of any classical, including the Boston Pops. It amounted to 10,000 records, which was huge for classical music. Even years later, the most the Boston Pops sold was 4,000 or something like that in a year. This was huge for
that, but nothing like the millions of records that were going out. So when you talk about popular success, it wasn’t really popular success. It was headlines, but it wasn’t popular success in the same sense. Switched on Bach sold 40,000 or 50,000. Todd L. Burns Nonesuch seems like a strange label to have invested in this. At this time they were a budget label and had
never done anything like this before. Morton Subotnick Did you read the story? Todd L. Burns No. Morton Subotnick Good, then I can tell you something you don’t know. This is my studio on Bleecker Street. (shows picture) Todd L. Burns And this is where you recorded Silver Apples? Morton Subotnick I didn’t record Silver Apples, I created it with the computer and all this stuff. It wasn’t done and then recorded. This is the studio there. You see the Bleecker Street cinema and the doorway there. You’d go up a flight of stairs and right above the cinema is where my studio was. Down the street, if you
look at the Bleecker Street cinema sign and you go straight down there’s the
Village Gate where all the rock bands were playing. I’d work all night and, 2 AM when the bands stopped,
members of Grateful Dead or Mothers of Invention would pop into my studio. People from Andy Warhol’s group would pop in and
they’d just sit around. I had a couple of sofas, they’d sit around talking and
watching me. Word had got around that there was this mad scientist with wires making
crazy sounds. We rarely had a real conversation, but they were
watching me, they would come in. Meantime, as I’ve said, from 1961 forward I’d
been talking and doing public lectures about this new thing that was going to happen and that the record player would take the place of the piano as chamber music for the large percentage of people in the world. Record companies would
see and people would eventually say that it was immoral and unethical to take Beethoven string quartet that was intended to be played by four people in front of an audience and replace them with a record and that the record, in fact, would become a new medium. People would make
music especially for the record. All other recordings would be left to the 78 category, which would be a black and white snapshot where every few minutes you’d have to turn it over to get the rest of the piece because you’re only studying the music or remembering it as it was meant to be. Of course, I never believed that would happen, and it didn’t happen. We may get to that at some
point but we’re not there now. So in the middle of all of this, I’m working
and these guys are sitting around. Where those buttons are there’s a door and the door was never locked because it didn’t have a lock. You go up the stairs
and there’s a big notice that says “Beware: You’re being watched!” There was a camera that had nothing inside of it. That was the only thing we had to keep people from coming and stealing everything in any of the studios there. So in walks this guy around 2-3 o’clock in the morning dressed in a suit and he says, “I’m the president of Nonesuch Records.” And he gives me my speech, “We think this is blah, blah
blah... unethical,” almost word for word. “And we met today and we have $500 set
aside if you’ll make the first one.”
So I kicked him out. I thought he was making
fun of me. First of all, I’d never heard of Nonesuch Records. It sounded like an unlikely name for a record company. And I just didn’t like being made fun of, so I kicked him out. I get home and it turns out that I had Nonesuch Records
and I didn’t think of it because they cost 80 cents. I’d get my kids off to school and before they got up I’d listen to a particular Brandenburg Concerto on Nonesuch
Records. I thought, “Oh my God, this is a real record company.” So I tried calling all day long. They didn’t have a phone number, they were part of Elektra/Asylum. I didn’t know that. The next morning, middle of the night, the guy comes in again and this time I’m going to go on my knees and say, “I’ll do it for nothing.” He says, “Don’t come near me.” He thought I was gonna hit him or something, I guess. “Just listen to me, just stay there and listen to me,” he said. “We met again today and we’ve upped the ante, we will offer you $1,000.” And I said, “I’ll take it.” And that became Silver Apples. (applause) Todd L. Burns So he thought it was just a negotiating tactic. Morton Subotnick It was for me. (laughs) Todd L. Burns Silver Apples and Wild Bull both have an influence from poetry. There’s a Sumerian poem
called Wild Bull. How did that influence the stuff you made? Morton Subotnick It didn’t. Todd L. Burns Not at all? Morton Subotnick The Wild Bull did to some extent. You’ve got to have a name for a piece. Silver Apples, I was just looking for a name. I had become quite literate over the years because when I went to college in Denver to stay out of the Army I majored in English literature. Because I already knew music, I was playing
professionally, I had not done any reading at all outside of music. I became quite literate and I had poets for friends and so forth. I knew literature very well. I remembered the Yeats and the
opening does sound like Silver Apples, so I gave it that name. The Wild Bull was a little different. It’s a beautiful poem. When you consider writing
started in Sumeria – the earliest writing we know about is in Sumeria about
7,000 years ago – so this was the seed of what I felt, the seed of what
happens, the poetry that could happen as the result of language being written, the written
language, let alone the printing press as this is before that. And I thought I was doing something – not that my work was similar – but I was engaged in something similar in terms of historic change. We now have technology we can make music with; now they have words you can manipulate, we just didn’t speak them. The poem is about a woman whose husband goes off to war and doesn’t come
back. I had this thing about trying to make the record… the form of the record
was side one and side two. The side one is the female side, and side two is the male
side. It’s the music through his body and the other one is through her body. So in that sense it was influenced, but it doesn’t tell a story of any sort. Todd L. Burns Let’s listen briefly to a little snippet. Morton Subotnick Let’s listen to the very opening. (music: Morton Subotnick – “Wild Bull”) That’s the sound of my baby son at the time, slowed down 100 times and
manipulated. We’ll go on and listen a bit more, but because I was at the
Electric Circus we were doing multimedia avant-garde concerts on Monday nights.The rest of it was dancing and became very well known at the time. Salvatore Martirano and I – I don’t
know if you know him, but he did a synthesizer called the Sal-Mar later – but he and I were very good friends and we were invited to do a concert of our music at some place in Massachusetts. The woman who organized it said Sal
Martirano and Morton Subotnick from the Electric Circus, so they all thought
this was rock & roll. We had four concerts sold out before we got there.
When I found out there were bumper stickers and everything I said to the
woman, “You’ve made a terrible mistake. They’re going to think we’re rock & roll.” “No, no, they all know what you do, it’s fine.” The concert starts with these two sounds. We did the Wild Bull semi-live – some was live, some was
recorded. There’s a guy on the stage who was smiling with black light on his teeth so he stands
there, sort of a shadow. Then gradually, after the first one, you see this
strange smile, these teeth and a silence. I think there’s a third one, and then people started yelling all kinds of insults and then ran out to get their
money back. That’s all I can remember about this. Now we’re going to the third one, I think. (music: Morton Subotnick – “Wild Bull” continued) Imagine this much silence at a rock & roll concert. The high one – and I’m
talking about black and white keyboards – is all made from a touch-plate
keyboard controlling various things, including pitch. So you go (makes slow noise) and you certainly could not do that on a piano. I think you could it on a violin if you could get the pitches, but you couldn’t get that quality. Todd L. Burns How long did it take you to get the hang of the instrument? When did you feel you could get exactly what you want out of this? Or have you? Morton Subotnick First of all, Don Buchla and I worked for well over a year before there was any equipment. Because we needed $500, which we didn’t have, so we did it all on paper. By the end of that year when he started to work, I had conceptualized the logistics of most of what the modules were gonna do. I even imagined doing what I just did, but didn’t have the equipment to do. So the first two or three years of the synthesizer was actually knowing I could do it and practicing until it
happened. The sequencer was originally designed to be able to make long takes of something. You had three voltages coming out per stage, they were eight and 16 position sequencers. I would take them and gang them so there was one that
would go 16, one that would go 15 and maybe one that would go seven. That
would mean I had nine voltages from each, if you take all the voltages out, and the nine voltages would be mixed in different ways. Pairs would be mixed,
so if you had a voltage of two and another one was 0.5, you have 2.5, but they don’t come back to the same exact configuration for 15 times, 16 times, seven
times. So you get this long, long sequence and you spend weeks tuning until
you get all the parameters of space and everything you want on it. When you’re performing over periods of two to three weeks, listening and fine-tuning and sculpting. So it was working with that sequencer, which I had imagined ahead of time, but I didn’t realize how absolutely engrossing it was to be able to
do that. The reason I used a smaller one, a seven – because that would be part of the rhythmic structure. Whereas the other ones would be controlling timbre and all kinds of things, the rhythmic structure was always on a smaller base and the actual rhythm was altered because the space between one and two would be altered slightly by a voltage from another place. So you’d get (makes jerky noises), this smaller group that you could recognize, but it was changing slightly. Or you could not change it. It didn’t always do the same thing. That’s what you’re hearing on Silver Apples and things. Todd L. Burns You used the word sculpting just now and that seems to be the word you use to describe what you do quite a bit. Why is that the one that’s stuck with you as accurately describing it? Morton Subotnick Because painting is two-dimensional and sculpting is three-dimensional and
music is four-dimensional. What I say on my next-to-last record jacket – that’s where I write this whole thing down – I feel like I’m a painter sculpting sound in a canvas of time and space. I’ve considered even from the beginning that the spatial element was not an adjective but really a noun. It tells you something directly like a pitch does. So if it’s a sound, you’ll hear it in some of the music I make – there are a couple of examples of that. (looks through laptop) This is the one that I’m talking about. I finally got to this point where I’d use a microphone where I’d record my voice and use the envelope of my voice rather than an envelope generator. But I was dealing with this sculptural space in which I could go (makes mad noise) and the energy
would be the way in which the sound would move in space and change. Todd L. Burns This is from 1975? Morton Subotnick 1975, yeah. (looks through laptop) (music: Morton Subotnick – “Until Spring”) Yeah, that’s the excerpt. What I did is I sang just now what I sang in my
studio. And you’re not hearing my voice up there, but what you’re hearing is the Buchla synthesizer with the energy and shape of my voice. So I can make a
coherent performance, a minute, two minutes long, and then cut it up into
little pieces with leader in between and then sculpt, sitting here for a long time, just listening, instead of a sequencer, hearing the result of my voice and
then mold it. I cut the first one out and… (makes mad noise) That’s a
week’s work. And then... (makes another noise) That’s two days’ work. Then you take the
leader out and you get a coherent performance from beginning to end, because I’d already made it.
It’s like sketching and filling it in; it has a very strong procedural, not end result, but a procedural result. I think of it as studio art. The composer
became a studio artist. It doesn’t mean anything anymore because everybody’s a
studio artist. You needed to write the music down for someone to play it, then
put it on audio for someone to hear it. Whereas a painter and sculptor were
sitting there with it, experiencing the changes, being the first viewer.
That’s what I was able to do in my studio. Todd L. Burns Until Spring seems like a breakthrough for you; you were finally able to do something
you hadn’t been able to do before. Morton Subotnick Yeah, by the time I got to this I felt that this is clearly not music from the tradition. Whereas both the_ Wild Bull_ and Silver Apples were. They had many traditional elements to them, melodies and so forth. I’ll play you a bit
of this. This is the dance from A Sky of Cloudless Sulphur, which is the final work of this group. This is with visuals by Sue Costabile. It’s on my new DVD
coming out. This uses pulsing and some of the energy shapes I do with my voice. This was 1976, I think. This is a new version. In fact, I’ll be performing parts of this tomorrow night. I end with this. Using the pulsing as
I described, but now using one single chord that covers an entire range and placing different pitches of that chord, it’s as if you had a string instrument and you never change the pitch of any of the strings, but you can
play lots of little tunes within that range. So it’s all constantly going. And
this is what that sounds like. (music: Morton Subotnick – “A Sky of Cloudless Sulphur” / applause) That uses the little rhythms with the things I described. They sound like they’re the same, but they’re not exactly the same, but it’s close enough. It’s like variations coming from the single sequencer. The overall pulse is like a click track – it is a click track. By this time I’d been given a 16-track tape recorder from Columbia. I put a click track on top, but the
click track was made from my tongue. My tongue was going (makes whirring
noise) and a loop from that. So you hear some slight… I can do it now with the Buchla and tomorrow night I’ll be doing some of that, where I actually
introduce that to a straight pulsing so I don’t have to use my tongue for 45
minutes. But what you get from a straight pulsing is this constant machine
click. But you get a random change of velocity, which makes (makes whirring
noise), not a machine, and when you hear it you hear slight dropouts. You
feel like you can put your hand through the pulse at some point because there are actually little holes in it, and I now do that live. I can do it without my tongue by building voltages on the velocity for the pulse. They vary from 100% to 90% to 70%,
back up, then putting a random voltage on one, then offsetting them with
another one, so they add two different things that never quite come back. They sound the same, but they have a live, human feeling to it. Todd L. Burns Has your voice been a source for your music for a long time now? You seem to keep talking about using your voice. Morton Subotnick Remember 100 years ago, when I was talking about 1961 and I said the first time you ever hit two rocks together? By 1971-’72, here I was hitting the charts – Wild Bull hit the top of the charts too. In fact, we’re in Spain, right? I was in Spain the summer after Silver Apples of the Moon, pondering this whole
issue. Someone had given me a house in Mijas and I stayed there almost four
months trying to deal with this thing. Here I was on top of the charts
and I felt like I could write an orchestra piece like Silver Apples of the Moon and in fact, that summer I wrote an orchestra piece. And now we’re getting my
family. (laughter) That’s okay. It wasn’t until 1975, 1976 that it finally came to a head. But by 1975 I realized I wasn’t getting back to the first rock, the hitting of two rocks together. I realized it was inside me and it wasn’t rocks, it was my voice. I began to use
my voice and I called Buchla, 1969 I think it was, and I said, “Don, I need something that will translate my vocal sound into straight voltage.” And as far as I know that was the first envelope follower that came. There may have been some others around, but I don’t know about them if there were. For me, it was certainly the first. I began to play with that and gradually each piece got more and more with that together until I really had it down as an artform. Todd L. Burns The last thing I want to touch on before opening it up for questions is video. Sue Costabile did this thing for your DVD and tomorrow night you’re going to be working with Lillevan. I saw you in Poland at Unsound just recently and I was struck by the fact you weren’t facing the audience. You were facing the screen, the visuals. I guess
that’s partly to show off this amazing instrument. Morton Subotnick I wasn’t facing the screen because I was looking at the screen. I was facing it because I wanted the Buchla to be seen, that actually something was playing. It
wasn’t just turning something on and having it go, I was actually playing it. I think that’s important, at least at this stage in the game, given laptops
and so on. I do use Ableton, but the Buchla goes to the Ableton so that an oscillator gets duplicated five or six times and I can do different things
with that oscillator. Having five oscillators, I have three oscillators and each one multiplies. I’m using some samples, but more and more it’s all getting to be live. Todd L. Burns To go back to the visuals very briefly, why Lillevan and what is that
collaborative process like for you? Morton Subotnick I started as I described way back in 1961, I used visuals for that first
performance. I had two visions… no, that’s too large. I had two thoughts about the future. One was the recording as a medium. The recording to me was pure music, something you listen to, you take it in and you do it personally. Each
individual is personal, even in an audience, but you do it now, of course,
with pods in your ears and in your living room and so forth. The other is what
happens to the public performance. The recording should be like a studio, it should be perfect for you when it comes out so that when you give it to someone else, it’s guaranteed that the person who gave it to you really likes it. This is as good as it could be for them, before they give it to you to listen to forever in your
living room. So what is live performance? It’s the opposite. Live performance is “this is the moment” and it has to be… it could fail and it has to have some kind of drama to it, a theatrical. I also felt from the beginning that
the dimensions of music on a record are four dimensions. You’ve got spatial dimensions, timbre, but they’re all in the world of sound. But a live performance is not. It’s in the world of being with other people, of doing what I’m doing with my hand right now (waves hand), which wouldn’t be there
if you were listening to the radio. And it means something. It means something that I lean my face forward as I said that. I didn’t intend to, but it has a different meaning than (leans back) “it means something” – (leans forward) “it means something” is different. For me, the live performance has to have a visual component and if you’re performing on a musical instrument it does – you see
the performer playing. But with electronics you don’t see the kinetic response, because I imagine that what I could get with a computer would be like having an entire orchestra trained that is at my beck and call, so you don’t play every note, but you mold it
like a conductor does. So I’m making decisions all the time, I’m being a
composer, and I’m performing in the sense that it’s spontaneous and this is now gonna come this way. I have files that I could I play very, very soft and they would mean one kind of thing. I don’t need to go into the details of that. So I felt from the very beginning that if we could have a kinetic visual component, which is a parallel piece, somebody I improvise with when I’m doing this stuff, who knows the music and is willing to listen to the way I do it
differently each time and go with it, if they have a visual kinetic vocabulary that is the counterpart to sticking my chin out or something. That’s been
there since 1961. I worked with Tony Martin for a long time and still do occasionally. I found Lillevan because he was brought in when I was commissioned to do my opera and he did the visuals. The idea of
all of this was to produce the real work from 1961 and I finally did that with “Jacob’s Room,” which got played at Bregenzer, Austria, and then Dresden, Berlin and Vienna last year. It’ll be at the Warsaw Autumn in September and Lillevan did the live video with it. That’s how we met. Then we began working together. Todd L. Burns What is it about his visuals that appeal to you so much? Morton Subotnick It wasn’t so much the content of the visuals, though I like them very much, but it’s the way he works, making kinetic decisions on the same basis that I make musical decisions. We’re dealing with something that is increasing in energy, that is fast, slow. You’ll see with Sue Costabile, she’s using bars that fluctuate. I like her work very much, but this isn’t what I had quite in mind. I did it at the Electric Circus, where you pulse something to the music. He interprets the kinetic energy of the music into a kinetic visual energy, and it’s parallel, it’s not direct. That’s what I was really looking for. I like what Sue does, I’m happy to work with her, but I’ve always tried to get her do a little more complex... now she does, we did a performance in New York together
and she’s expanded that vocabulary quite a bit now. It’s closer to what
Lillevan does at this point. But hers looks different from his. Todd L. Burns Well, let’s open it up to questions from the audience. If you could just wait for a microphone that’d be wonderful. Audience Member I’m interested in what you said earlier. You talked about a primitive
experience with technology and I was wondering what does that mean to you and how do you join those two worlds, the primitive and the electronic, and what
are the differences between the two of them? Morton Subotnick Let me take just the first part of that. What I meant by primitive... say that first part again. Audience Member You said primitive experience with technology. Morton Subotnick Yeah, I don’t remember saying that but I’m sure I did. (laughter) It depends where I was when I was saying that, but there are two forms of the primitive experience, but I think the ur-experience, the primal experience, you’re
starting from scratch, it’s very hard to do. We just have too much; nobody can really do it. If you think about the way people sing “Happy Birthday” together, they all go up and down together but they don’t sing the same notes.
But the shape of it is the same, the primitive (sings), it’s that gesture and shape. It doesn’t matter particularly whether you do it on C, D or E. We
understand that as human beings, as animals, but we give it up in music to be, “Oh, unless you sing the right notes you’re not musical.” That’s the keyboard thing. I’m trying to avoid that, when I go (sings) if it goes from C to G or
C to A or C-sharp, it’s going up and it’s got a register. This is the way I’d
like it to sound without worrying about what the pitches are. Now, my ears are trained in such a way that they do end up in C to G, but not because I meant them to be. With a keyboard you’re stuck with whatever tuning you’ve got at that point, so getting to the gesture and to the inside and finding a way to express it. That’s what I think I meant by the primitive. Now what was the other part of your other question? Audience Member I’m going to ask you another question. What does silence mean to you? Does it have an important role in the music you create? Morton Subotnick “Silence” you said, right? Not in the way it means to John Cage. He meant it in a different way, I think. We actually never had that conversation, but I
always assumed we meant it differently. Silence, for me, is part of the fabric of... if you ask how long does a note last, you’re actually asking when does it
begin and when does it end? But if you say what is the rhythm, the timing
of that note, it’s “ta-ta-ta-ta,” it’s actually a quarter note long, but it starts with a silence in between. The silence in between is the designator of
the anticipation of the next sound. And if there is no next sound, then it’s over. So if you go “dah-dah-dah” (groans) So it’s part of a dimension of
time, of sound in time. Because if I go “daa-daa-daa” that’s different from “dah-dah-dah,” you’re working with silence. But that’s not what John, I think,
was talking about that aspect. He was talking more about timbre and the world of sound. I’m talking more about the musical silence when I’m dealing with it. Todd L. Burns You use silence quite dramatically in the Wild Bull, for example. Morton Subotnick Yes, and there you have no pulse, so there it’s a matter of personal intention. The question I asked myself is how loud can I go before I give up
listening? And that’s how long those silences are. I’m a little more restless than most people. Audience Member I have a question regarding your music and its visual presentation. I watch a lot of horror movies and when I’m listening to the soundtrack, I hear a lot of borrowed textures and moods from some of your music. Especially in that first piece in Silver Apples, a lot of that prickly stuff. Did you ever think that
you wanted to create a sense of unease in the listener? And how do you feel about it being used to create that sense of unease? Morton Subotnick The answer is no, I did not think that. And I wasn’t aware that something in horror movies sounds like my music. Audience Member They definitely borrow. Morton Subotnick It could be. I know I used to get letters in the late ’60s, saying that they saw strange green creatures coming into their bedrooms when they listened to
Silver Apples and did I have that in mind. I’d answer that question with, “No, I didn’t have that in mind.” I mean, I don’t mind. The rest of it is I have no problem with it being used however it’s going to be used. If I remember correctly, there was a very wealthy
man in New York who was very proud of the fact that he played Silver Apples of the Moon every Halloween out of his house so that he would scare people. And at
one point Macy’s used it as a Halloween display, so it must have had that
effect on people. But I never had that and I didn’t intend it. It doesn’t have a message. Jean-Paul Sartre said once in an essay, “Music doesn’t mean anything – it’s meaningful.” So you
draw meanings out of the meaningfulness and everybody does it differently. That’s one of the nice things about it. Audience Member I’m interested in the more technological part of it. Like the controlling part was a big deal, to lose the black and white keyboard. How do you see technologies nowadays for controlling, for example, your Buchla? How do you see opportunities and are you using newer technology other than the touch response of it? Morton Subotnick No, I’m using my voice through the envelope followers. I’m using his touch-plate keyboards. They’re better now, but they’re all designed from the 1962, ’63 period so I’m very used to them. The reason I use the touch, we have so much control, our fingertips are very much an extension of our emotion, we can do lots of things with them. And our voice too. Can’t do so much with your nose, your toes. I experimented a lot, I used things in space, but even if you did something very gentle with your hand like that (flutters hands slightly)
it’s really coming at your fingertip when you can touch something that you get the real extension. I have a picture somewhere on my website where I have a sensor on my glasses and that’s a heat sensor looking at when I close my eyes.
When anyone closes their eyes there’s less heat than the reflection of light off the white of your eyeball. So I could actually measure the relative movement and use that as a controller at one point. But none of it has the kind of control you can get, or I can get, with my voice and my fingertips. It’s not like it’s wide open. You can put sensors on your body and have your brain do it but I can’t control my brain. I could have my heart rate do it, but I don’t want my heart to move as fast as I can use my tongue. It depends on what you wanna do with it, but what I want to do is it to be an extension –
just like I was answering her – of an ur-quality. From inside, the energy
behind the music and then turn it into sound from that. So far the only two
things I’ve found that are meaningful are finger pressure and placement of the finger – which a black and white keyboard doesn’t do – and my voice. Audience Member I was just curious about coming from San Francisco, where everyone’s high and
lazy and kind of casual, and going to New York, where it’s a little more
aggressive. How did your music change? Did it influence it? Morton Subotnick Probably. I didn’t intend it to but it probably did. I don’t know the answer to that. I don’t know. I sometimes wonder what would have happened had I stayed in San Francisco and I wonder what would’ve happened had I been a flop
and gone to Lawrence, Kansas. I probably wouldn’t be here right now. Audience Member Is there any new music you’re excited about? Morton Subotnick My recent music? Audience Member No, other people’s music, something modern. Morton Subotnick To listen to? That’s asked a lot and I have to say I don’t think about it that way. I don’t
categorize them. I categorize things after the fact. One thing I’ve learned is that I can’t judge what I’m hearing for the first time. If I don’t like it I’m destined to go back and listen to it some more to see if I don’t like it more or like it less. But I can tell you that some of the more recent music that I’ve liked very much was Messiaen. I developed my aesthetic that I discovered
I had – I didn’t know I had one, but I have an aesthetic – and in the late ’60s I began to give it a name and it’s the ecstatic moment. So music that has that tends to attract me more. Audience Member Your live performance tomorrow, what are you going to use? Are you gonna prepare a set or are you gonna do freestyle things? Morton Subotnick It’s a combination. I’m using the Buchla live and I’m moving it through
Ableton. I have samples. Everything is spontaneous in the decision of when it happens and how it happens, but I have a set of resources in the patch, both with the analog synthesizer and in the computer. It’s limited to what I’ve
got in there that I’ve chosen for this performance. Some of it are samples, so although I can change both the pitch and time and bring them in whenever I want,
even pulse them, I have some that I can send through, if I’m getting a pulsing thing going with oscillators, I can
take one of the samples that I was going to play and pass it through the
oscillator into the Buchla, so it gets pulsed instead of played in its normal form. So there’s this array, this set of available materials that I’ve been
playing a lot lately: 14-15 performances in the last four weeks in that many cities. So I have a bag of tricks, but I try very much to have new stuff each time as I go. Audience Member I’m just wondering, do you practice and if so how do you practice? Do you practice technique the way a traditional instrumentalist does? Morton Subotnick No. I do practice, but not the way an instrumentalist does. I
develop a new technique to do a particular kind of thing and I get really good at it. I don’t know how I’m gonna use it and then it gradually moves itself into a performance. But I never play for 45 minutes from beginning to end. I
never know how long a show is going to go, but I practice and try out little parts of it and go back and build a new technique if I don’t like what I’m
doing. You don’t get rid of everything you’ve learned but you’re gonna have
to, for me, come up with a new procedure. If I’m going to practice as I used to on the clarinet, I’m gonna end up doing the same performance over and over again. It might well be a recording at that point. Audience Member You have a very well-developed philosophy about your sound and music. You use
the words “awe” and “ecstatic” and some of your peers, La Monte Young and Terry Riley, Pauline Oliveros, have developed a spiritual philosophy to go with their sound and music. Have you also? Morton Subotnick No. Audience Member (laughs) Thank you. Morton Subotnick I have an allergy to saluting officers and to religion. When I go to a
restaurant, I cannot stop marvelling how we were in trees hanging by our tails and now we’re actually sitting at tables. Howling at the moon or screaming or
cooing, and somehow made the Eroica Symphony down the line. The awe I have for the human being is through the natural evolution, which is for me a
much more... if there is a spirituality, that to me is the awe experience, is that we got where we are. And to tell you the truth, that we’re still here with all the crazy people running the world, that we manage to be sitting here talking like this is really amazing. Let’s hope it keeps going. Audience Member You mentioned earlier you use samples and you talked about the visual element. If you assign a certain visual to a certain sound you can use samplers in conjunction with visual processors. What do you think about the concept of one
sound being associated to one image or one clip, or should audio and visual
always be two separately developed ideas? Morton Subotnick You’re thinking of something like the color organ with Scriabin and that kind of stuff. Personally, I’m opposed to that kind of locked-in – that’s for
myself, I’m perfectly happy when someone else does it – but for myself I think gesturally and I think of timbre as the result of gesture, not as a pure thing. So (makes mad sound) all this dimensional stuff, it’s not “aah” or
“ooh,” it’s the combination of these things. Color has this, but it’s not the object of a particular sound. If the sound is producing what you want it to
produce, you don’t need a color with it. But if I say (grunts) and I do this (holds hand up), that’s not doing the same thing my voice is. It’s responding emotionally the same way. I could go (grunts and groans) and all that means something different but the voice was almost the same. That’s where
I think the color can amplify or give more dimensions to the experience. That’s how I use color. Audience Member But at the root of it you want sound to be the color, you want sound to be the visual. Morton Subotnick I want sound to be sound. And the expression underneath can also be done with the visual
visual, that’s the parallel aspect. You can hear it and you should get something. But what happens when you add something to a musical experience, whether it’s dance or whatever, you begin to develop a large context in which people can build more context than they can with the sound. It’s particular with theatrical situations. If I only want the music to communicate, I don’t use anything in addition to the music. If you want to go beyond that in the more public arena, that’s where I use visuals, where you want a more composite experience that will bring more context to each individual, then you need to bring in more
things. I can tell you exactly what I’m saying and you can just listen to it. But when you watch me say it you get more context to it. You understand more about what it is. It is necessary to get the message to it. I don’t know if that makes
sense. Todd L. Burns Well, thank you very much, Morton.

Peaches
Controversial, talented and iconic, Peaches is an artist who comes around once in a while and shakes up the ground beneath them. Her avant-garde electronica and sexual fearlessness have made her a musical icon. Canadian born, her infamous live shows have become a thing of music industry legend. With an early music career in folk, she later joined forces with Chilly Gonzales, relocated from Toronto to Berlin, played one spontaneous over-the-top gig and got a record deal with independent label Kitty-Yo. The teaches of Peaches continue to influence pop culture, as her cult following has grown.
In her 2011 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, she reflects on her performance art beginnings, how she thought she was doing theater, not music, and why things still seem different for girls.
Hosted by Nick Dwyer It’s an absolute pleasure to welcome our next guest at the Red Bull Music Academy. I don’t know where to begin. She’s a singer, she’s a songwriter, she’s a performance artist, she’s a conceptual artist, she’s a theater writer, she’s a theater director, she’s released four albums, toured all over the world and created a storm of awesomeness and controversy along the way. But most importantly, she’s an inspiration. Ladies and gentleman, give it up for Peaches. (applause) How are you? Peaches Better. Nick Dwyer I’ve got to say that it must be noted that you arrived in Madrid the night before last, you found yourself very ill yesterday, couldn’t make it here yesterday and missed out on Tony Visconti. Peaches Ah! It breaks my heart. Nick Dwyer I guess that kind of begs the question, I mean you tour a lot, and some people
in this room are going to find themselves on that tour bus, on that brutal
Australian tour. What happens when you have a massive tour, performing support
for Marilyn Manson or whatever,
and you can’t afford to get sick – what do you do to keep yourself well? Peaches Well, when you get a virus or something, there’s nothing you can do but sweat
it out. Wendy O. Williams from the Plasmatics said that, “I won’t miss a
show unless I’m in jail, or dead.” So I kind of adopted that as my philosophy
too. Nick Dwyer Peaches, what we normally like to do, I'm sure a large proportion of
people in this room are familiar with your music, but for those that aren’t
we’re going to play something right now, and I think we’re going to begin with
this, which is suitably apt, it’s just a short, sharp piece of what you’re all
about, I guess. (music: Peaches – “Fuck or Kill”) Nick Dwyer So there you go. I guess over the course of the last ten years a lot of the
world has gotten to know this woman called Peaches fairly well. But I would like to know a little bit more about this wonderful woman, Merrill Nisker, from Toronto. For you, growing up in Toronto, what were some of your earliest musical inspirations? Peaches Well, I have no musical training and I had no musical guidance as a small child and as a young adult, actually. I have a wonderful family but beside my brother listening to punk music and my sister listening to a lot of disco and funk music I just picked it up. I look back to see some of the music that was popular on the radio when I was seven, and I can still sing along to them, but I didn’t know it was music. The only creative outlet I had was that I understood theater. My parents took me to see a lot of theater productions because we had a lot of family in New York, so we saw a lot of stuff like that. So I thought theater was what I wanted to do. I always sang, even when I was seven, embarrassigly enough, at family bar mitzvahs and stuff. I would be like, “Can I sing with that band?” And my parents were like, “Can you sing?” And I was like, “Yeah I think so!” And I’d have to audition with the bar mitzvah band while they were eating and I would be singing – this is completely embarrassing – Barbra Streisand songs, and they’d be
like, “Yeah, yeah, you can sing.” I’d have to sing at every family function from there on. And then when I was older, I was like, “Give me that electric guitar!” And I’d be singing Janis Joplin songs on my guitar and screaming, and stuff like that. But I didn’t really get that it was music, I thought that it
was theater. I actually went to university to study theater, I wanted to be a
theater director. And then I quickly learnt that I didn’t want to work with
actors, I didn’t want to work with so many people, it was very stressful, and
it all evolved from there. I started to play acoustic guitar and at the same
time I had just graduated university. I never finished the directorial
program, I dropped acid and dropped out of the progra. But I still finished
university and I started to take fine arts courses and quickly learned that
everything was in little boxes, even creatively. Like, I took this course, which was multimedia, where it had visual artists and musicians and theater people, whatever you want to call them, and dancers, and we would all be put into groups and have to do creative projects. The teacher was a musician, he had an amazing glass orchestra where he would play glass with different levels
of water. But he always favored the music students, and I wasn’t a music student and he would always say, “OK, if you’re a drama student you can dance, or you can draw a picture if you’re a dancer.” But then he’d always give musical parts for musicians or whatever, and I was so mad at him. I’d be like, “Excuse me, but I want to play all things.” It’s like, “Yes, I don’t know how
to play music but I’d like to try that piano.” And I’d go inside the piano – I didn’t know anything about John Cage
or anything like that – and I started plucking inside or moving the piano around, stuff like that. Even though he was supposed to be an experimental kind of
teacher, it was funny because I just wanted to make music in the same way that
he thought that a visual artist should dance, or something like that. And whenever I’m in those situations I always question them, not just for the sake
of questioning but because I really believe that if you have creativity you
can transfer it to other things. Nick Dwyer I think one of the earliest stories which kind of gives people an idea of this
incredibly creative Peaches to come was that you were doing work at daycare, and also started teaching in schools, and you were bored with the program that four- or five-year-old kids were learning so you reinvented it. Peaches Yeah, I needed a job. I’m sort of a late bloomer on everything. I was still living at home when I was in university, and then I had a relationship with a woman and then my mom was like, “Oh my god! You’re gay!” Or whatever. And then
that’s how I left home, kind of, “Oh! I’m gay!” And my girlfriend played – and
this is really more typical things from the Barbra Streisand, moving on to the
early ’90s where the Indigo Girls
had just come out and Melissa Etheridge, and you’re
listening and you’re going, “They’re gay. They’re totally gay, but they don’t say it.” And I was playing acoustic guitar with my girlfriend and stuff like that. But first I was working in a daycare because I needed a job. The teachers were so apathetic, and the kids were just jumping on each other, and I just took about 20 of them and was like, “Let's go into another room,” and started playing acoustic guitar and telling them stories, and having them move around and having them be creative. Sort of letting them be whatever they wanted to be, but with a structure of music kind of lulling them into this
hypnotic state. The teachers walked in and were like, “Did you give these kids drugs? Why are they listening to you? What is going on?” And then the head of the department came by and she was like, “Wow, this is really cool, what are you doing?” I said, “I don’t really know! I’m just trying to make some sort of creative outlet for these kids.” I was basing it on a lack of creative outlets
for myself growing up, when I would be in a music class, which turned me off of music totally, and they would be like, “Sing that note.” And I’d go, “Ah…” And they’d say, “No, wrong. Next person!” And that would be that last time I got to sing a note. Or I would be in a theater play and they’d look at me and say, “OK,
you’re going to be the bat, and you’re an ant.” And I’d say, “I don’t wanna be an ant. I want to be a lion.” So I made sure that these kids had their own outlet and this became really popular and I developed a program. I became my own boss, and I’ve never actually worked for anybody since that little period. And for ten years I taught kids music and drama, and at the same time I was teaching myself music. So in the day I was seeing how kids were really being excited about having their own creativity and then I would work that out at night in my own sort of adult form. Nick Dwyer So you kind of mentioned it before, this time of the early ’90s, and I’m not
going to embarrass you by making you show the photos... Peaches Horrible photos! Nick Dwyer Mermaid Café was the name of the band. So what was this first foray of you being part of a band? Peaches Well, like I said, I had a girlfriend who played acoustic guitar, and I did. We got this one gig at this place in Toronto called the Cabana Room, which was quite popular on weekdays for folk-rock musicians. And the last band who had a sort of residency on a Wednesday night there were the Barenaked Ladies. So we played there as Mermaid Café and all of a sudden a lot of people showed up, and we ended up having a weekly gig there. People would come to our shows, and there would be
14 year old girls in the front crying because we’d be singing these songs, and it was
really like, “Oh, I’m a musician. Oh, I’m playing folk music, I don’t want to
play folk music, what am I doing?” So I quit that band and I knew two other musicians – one was an avant-garde jazz musician, and a conga player, a funky bass player, and we formed Fancypants with them, which was just my vehicle to do whatever I wanted. They were quite good musicians. I didn’t know what I was doing, but I would make up songs anyway. Usually in my bed with a ukulele and a dictaphones
and stuff like that, just sort of developing what I wanted to do. At the same time I was listening to PJ Harvey, who was just coming out, and I was getting into Sonic Youth and all that kind
of music. And it would just develop on and on. I didn’t really know a lot of musicians back then, even though I went to see a lot of shows, it was more like, “Wow! That band, cool!” And I made friends with another band called Spin the Susan who, I don’t know if you’ve ever seen that movie, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, but they
were in that movie. It was a girl band and we got to be friends, and to one of
the girls, whose name was Sticky, I said, “Oh, I’d love to make a girl band
with you.” And she was like, “Well, my next door neighbor is a musician and he’s really cool, and I have a crush on this guy and he’s a really good musician too.” And I was like, “No, I want a girl band, a GIRL band! Girls! Girls!” And she said, “You know, let’s just jam with them.” So she called over her next-door neighbour, who was Mocky
– I don’t know if you know about him but he helped produce Feist albums, he’s quite an accomplished and incredible musician. And the friend that she had a crush on was Chilly Gonzales. So the first time that I’d ever talked to either of those guys was never, we just started jamming. What was pretty amazing, and I love this, was that we sort of all had secret crushes on each other, all of us, and instead of telling each other, we just started singing about it. We were all singing, “I wanna fuck you!” I think that was one of our songs, it was like (sings), “Hey, I wanna fuck you!” It was really fun and it was also that little bit of not really telling each other but having crushes on each other. And also our idea was to be completely improvisational, or whatever we sang there, was what we were gonna do. I remember after the first jam, one of the first things Chilly Gonzales said to me was, “Wow, you play guitar like Joey Santiago from The Pixies.” And I was like, “First of all, oh my god, someone actually called me a guitarist, and then secondly, I loved Joey Santiago.” And then we started playing, and we were smoking a lot of pot, and they were like, “Yeah, hey, why don’t you play drums now, why don’t you play keyboards!” And at that time I was like, “Keyboards are not cool for a rock
band. Keyboards? No! Once you have keyboards in a band, you’re not a rock
band.” That was my opinion, until I got into it. Then we called ourselves the Shit because we thought it would be really cool to be on stage and be like, “Yeah, we’re the Shit!” And then we all gave ourselves names. We were all not completely satisfied with the music we were making at the time. Mocky had more of a hip-hop jazz band, and I had my Fancypants Hoodlum, and Sticky had Spin the Susan. So this was a really good way to break out of what we were doing. I became Peaches because I really loved that Nina Simone song where she says, “My name is Peaches,” and I wanted her to sing that to me. Nick Dwyer It was kind of interesting because for me, growing up in New Zealand in the
’90s, the most incredible music show I’d ever seen in my life was The New Music Show, which was around ’94-’95. It was a show from Toronto, and for some random reason they played in New Zealand, and it would be religious viewing. It really painted this picture of Toronto at the time as this really incredible, happening scene. Do you remember that show? Peaches That show saved my life. It started before MTV, that’s for sure. What year did MTV start, 1982? So this was the first time I found out about the Ramones, it was the first time I found out about Nina Hagen. I found out
about everybody through that show. It was an incredible show, for sure. And then they also had something like Rage, like they did in Australia at that time, where they’d play videos all night long, but before MTV. So I feel like Toronto had an advantage of getting influence from both the UK and America, because in America you really didn’t get that as much, especially before MTV and things like that. Nick Dwyer I guess the other thing to note with Toronto is that as a city its always had this incredible multicultural melting pot, with the Afro-Caribbean culture, the African culture, the Indian culture, did that melting pot play an influence for you? Peaches Well yeah, it did. It’s funny because there was all of that but it was always underground. It was still the mainstream Canadian folk-rock, and that was God in Canada. I’m 45 now, and I remember being in grade seven and it just being all early hip-hop and disco. So I feel really lucky, because when you’re 12 and
listening to that music, it’s really an amazing time. All the assisted living and the assisted housing around the neighborhood were the African and Caribbean housing, and I was part of the Jewish community, and they would all be at the dances, all the African-Canadian and the Caribbean and they would all be booty dancing (laughs). The Freak had just come out, and they would all do the Freak. Do you know how to do the Freak? Should I show you? Do you want to do it with me? Nick Dwyer No, I can’t! Peaches Well, you need a partner for it. Alright, well I‘ll just explain. So your legs are here and their legs are there, and it’s all about how close you can get. (enacts dance move) That kind of dance has been banned in America in the ’90s, but this was the late ’70s, and all us Jewish girls would stand around, like, “How do you do that?” And we would start freaking with all of them and that’s how we would interact, and you knew you were doing good if you were freaking with the real freakers. It was pretty amazing. Nick Dwyer So at this time, you had this band called the Shit happening with Mocky, with Chilly Gonzales, and you mentioned that in this band you called yourself Peaches. When would you say that this solo artist known as Peaches really started to develop and you had this inkling that you wanted to do something alone? Peaches I think it started there. The name started there. And even “Offering,” a song
from my second album, was written with Sticky, even before the Shit. So you
know, there were the seedlings of that – and I think out of the four of us, I
continued on with that sort of, “DIY-I’m-going-to-continue” feeling. People started to move away, and I didn’t have anyone else to play with, and there was this new equipment that had been coming out. I had been getting into keyboards, and I went to the music store and I saw this machine and it was called the Roland MC-505. I was like, “Oh, what’s this machine?” And some awesome geek was like, “Oh, you
can do this, and you can do this, blah blah,” and totally sold me on it. I was like, “Wow, so you can be the drummer, you can be the bass player, you can be the keyboard player? OK, cool.” So I just bought it and it wasn’t an incredibly difficult machine, but it was great for me. It had like 700 Roland sounds and it was all new for me and I just started to make songs like I was a band. Nick Dwyer In terms of lyrical content, did you have an idea way back then of what you wanted to do with this project, of what you wanted Peaches to be saying? Peaches Well, I never actually thought that I would have a career in music, I never thought that I would be teaching kids, and I never thought that I would be doing anything that I’m doing. I would just do it and it kind of worked out for me. In terms of the lyrical content, I started to play on this machine, and I was thinking about the riot grrrl movement and how it wasn’t around anymore and I didn’t understand why it was something that was just a trend and wasn’t there anymore. I started to think about all these old rock lyrics that I loved, that were completely from a man’s perspective, like even old blues songs. I always give this example, “Squeeze my lemon till the juice runs down my leg.” I don’t have a lemon, I have Peaches, so I didn’t know why I was singing that – I wanted to build lyrics that related to me, that I
thought, “If I just twist this stiff a little bit around, it would relate to me.” And that should be normal. So hip-hop lyrics, I don’t even need to explain hip-hop lyrics and how they were. So I just spun it around a bit and came up with new sort of clichés, saying things like, “Diddle my skittle,” or, “Sucking on my titties.” I had this idea that everybody, guys and girls, straight, gay, would want to sing, “Sucking my titties!” I think I thought that that would have been a big breakthrough, in my head. But I never really thought that anybody would really hear it. Nick Dwyer Shall we listen to that track now? Peaches Sure. Nick Dwyer So tell us about this track that we’re about to hear. Peaches Well, actually I have a little story for you, because the first time I ever played this track in its entirety was in a small club in Toronto, the Rivoli. I was opening for a friend of mine called Howie Beck, who plays kind of Elliott Smith-type music, so already it was quite different. When I was using the MC-505, I had things programmed, but I could always change it around and filter things or bring sounds in and out, and I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to say, “Fuck the pain away,” or if I wanted to say this or that. But at that particular gig I just sang the whole thing in an order. Then, at the end of my whole gig, the sound girl came up to me and was like, “Yeah, I recorded your whole set, I have it on cassette, if you give me five bucks I’ll give you the cassette.” I was like, “OK, cool! Cassette, yeah!” I went home and listened to it and I was like, “Oh my God! The vocal is so loud, the beat is way off. OK, I’ll put it on a demo with a bunch of other songs.” I played it to some people and they were like, “Wow! This is the shit, this is awesome, this is great.” I was like, “OK, I’ll just leave it.” So, the actual recording is from the Rivoli desk on a cassette from 1999, and you’ll hear in the background someone go “Woo!” I’ve often got emails from people asking where that sample is from, but this is just a live recording. So that’s why it’s all hissy and stuff. But you know, if it ain't broke, don’t fix it. (music: Peaches – “Fuck the Pain Away”/ applause) I wanted to mention that something that’s really awesome about this song is, the chorus doesn’t come in until almost three minutes, which is the thing that they say in a pop song is the worst thing you can do. You know, a chorus should come in right away; somehow the other hooks hook you in, but it’s funny, the chorus doesn’t come in for a while and then when it does it’s extremely long. Also, if you notice, after every eighth clap it’s completely phased, because I played it over the other one, but I didn’t know how to erase it. And it doesn’t start on the one. Nothing on The Teaches of Peaches starts on the one because I just didn’t really get where the one was, actually. It’s funny because I’ve met so many producers who are like, “Oh,
it’s so cool that you didn’t start on that one!” I remember that too many DJs were really upset because they really wanted to put
“Lovertits” in their set but they were like, “We can’t mix it in, it’s not on the one, it’s like the timing’s wrong. We love that, but we can’t mix it in.” It’s really cool though, because all those mistakes have really made a mark. Nick Dwyer Is it crazy to you, to think just what a life of its own that track took? Peaches Oh my god, it’s incredible. Nick Dwyer Lost In Translation, South Park... Peaches I don’t know if you know about South Park, but last year I got a request to
use it in South Park, and I was like, “Yes, yes!” right away – it’s my favorite show. It’s an incredible scene, it’s an episode called Butters’ Bottom Bitch and it’s about Butters, who is this incredibly naive character who becomes a pimp. He doesn’t even realize, he’s like, (mimics the voice) “I heard it’s called a pimp.” And so at the same time there’s this police officer who’s trying to figure out who this pimp is, and where the prostitution ring is coming from. So he dresses as a woman and he becomes this tranny-prostitute who totally goes overboard. He’s like having sex with men and then arresting them. So, then of course, the pinnacle moment is when the tranny-cop is like, “I’m going to find out where this ring is. I’m going to go to this fraternity house and get samples from all the students and they’re going to hire me as a prostitute.” So the tranny-cop goes to this frat-house, and he’s in a cake, and he jumps out of the cake to “Fuck the Pain Away” and I’m like... (blows a kiss) Any moment on TV that went overboard in terms of gender or sexuality, they used my music, and “Fuck the Pain Away” and “Boys Wanna Be Her” were used so many times to represent this. I was watching 30 Rock. I love Tina Fey and I remember getting a request for it, and I totally forgot, and I’m watching on my computer and Tina Fey’s in this dentist office, and she’s trying to pick up this guy. So she calls herself on the phone so that the phone will ring because her ringtone is “Fuck the Pain Away” and I forgot and I was like, “Oh, shit, I think my iTunes just went on!” I didn’t even believe it, so it’s pretty cool. Nick Dwyer For you, there’s a certain amount of irony – I mean, you tell the story before about how it was recorded. You’ve worked in some of the biggest studios in the world, with some of the top producers, and yet this thing recorded to cassette is your biggest song. Peaches Also, “Boys Wanna Be Her,” which was the first time I was like, “No! I’m going
to write a girl anthem.” I love “Cherry Bomb” by the Runaways and I love Bikini Kill and I wanted my own but I want it to sound like AC/DC. So I had “Boys Wanna Be Her,” which was used in Ugly Betty when there was a tranny who
had a photoshoot, and in The L Word when Shane was modeling boys’ underwear. It’s cool. Nick Dwyer Can I ask you a little bit about the origins of the song in terms of the writing? Where did it come from? Peaches Which one? Nick Dwyer “Fuck the Pain Away.” Peaches A lot of silly rapping with friends. It’s funny, this is really so random, but I was on an airplane and I was thinking about the Pat Benatar song when she says, “Breaking little hearts like you wanted me.” And I was like, “Sucking on my titties like you wanted me?” And that’s really how I came up with that, through a Pat Benatar song. Then I started referencing who I thought were really cool women, like Chrissie Hynde, so I said, “Check out my Chrissie behind.” Chrissie Hynde from the Pretenders who I thought had the coolest voice and really got me into dirty lyrics. There was this song
called “Tattooed Love Boys” on the first album, and she has this line where she says, “I shot my mouth off and you showed me what that hole was for.” I was like, “What?! That’s amazing. Wow!” And then, of course, Debbie Harry from Blondie. So I said, “Call me
all the time like Blondie.” Nick Dwyer In terms of those earlier female inspirations, who were some of your other ones? Peaches Wendy O. Williams, she had a band called the Plasmatics and she to me is the number one most incredible performer to have ever lived. Like I mentioned before, the only time she would ever miss a gig is if she was dead or in jail. Nick Dwyer She used to blow up TVs on stage and chainsaw guitars really early on, right? Peaches Yeah. There’s an incredible video of hers. Here it is. And I mean the music is quite wild, she’s quite rock but I’m just going to let that load up, maybe we can watch. Nick Dwyer Shall we come back to it? Peaches Yeah. Nick Dwyer You mentioned before that you had a point where all your friends left you in Toronto, and there kind of seemed a point in time about 10 or 11 years ago where most of the notable Canadian musicians in the electronic world, all of a sudden, moved to Berlin. Peaches Well, yeah. It was before this sort of rush to Berlin, and it wasn’t like Berlin was a Mecca for me, or I even thought like, “Oh, you should go there, the ’20s and all the burlesque, and the sexual innuendos and the electronic music.” No, I didn’t even think about that. So I took a summer vacation, and
Gonzales’ father had a place in Paris, so he was like, “I’m gonna be in Paris.” So I was like, “Oh OK, I’ll meet you there, let’s go to Berlin.” And he was like, “No, I want to go to Amsterdam, I wanna smoke tons of weed.” So I was like, “OK, we’ll go to Amsterdam, then we’ll go to Berlin.” So I had to convince him to go to Berlin, and I took my MC-505 and he had – I don’t think they make it any more – it was like these two CDJs, but it was one piece of equipment. It was really funny. We’d do improvisational ambient music together and just plug in where we could. This is before anyone had laptops, so it was like, “Yeah, we can plug it into your stereo system, it’s really cool.” And they were like, “Yeah, wow! Cool, play in our bar, or play in our makeshift club.” And we played in Berlin and there was a record label called Kitty-Yo who saw us doing this and wanted to invite us to a festival, which I was like, “Wow, how does that happen?” Chilly was like, “I’m staying.” And I was like, “I would love to stay but I have to go and teach kids for one more year, and then I’m gonna join you.” So I went home, and I was like, “Oh, I wanted to stay.” But I took my experience of Berlin and how it was so open, you could do what you wanted in these spaces that people had just been building up, and I started to write The Teaches of Peaches in Toronto. Nick Dwyer So Kitty-Yo not just invited you to play at a festival, but they ended up signing you? Peaches Yeah. Nick Dwyer Can you tell us a little about Kitty-Yo? Peaches Kitty-Yo was probably like, an eighth the size of this room, and they had a
small label, were signing indie bands and doing small little indie runs, and
they signed Gonzales. Then I, again with my cassette, sent them six songs, and
they had listened to it and they really liked it. They passed it around to people and I had already been gaining popularity with other musicians there that I didn’t know yet. And then I went and did a show and it went quite well, and they signed me. Actually, I called them the next day and I was like, “What are you guys doing?” And they were like, “We’re drinking champagne.” I was like, “Really, why?” And they were like, “We just signed you.” And I was like, “Oh OK, save me a glass I’m coming over!” I think they
signed me for 4,000 DM. That was my big deal! Nick Dwyer (laughs) So at the time, did you ever think that you’d get a deal back in Canada or America? Or did that not even occur to you? Peaches Well, actually I did have an offer from a small label in Canada, but I was like, “Oh, I don’t really wanna do that.” Because I just knew the routine and I knew how Canadians saw me. I remember I had played a singer-songwriter night and everybody else was playing guitar and singing and I bought my 505, and I was playing and singing and being overtly sexual and everyone else was crying. And then this reviewer, who I thought always tells it like it is, wrote a review about the night and said that, “After Merrill Nisker’s hair-raising one-woman throw down, we got back to what music is.” And I was like, “Yes! I’ve made it!” (laughs) And I used that quote everywhere. Nick Dwyer That’s a good example, but what were people’s reactions to you, initially? Peaches They would sit in the back and they would be like... (motions confusion and disgust) They wouldn’t leave, but they definitely didn’t have happy faces. But they weren’t leaving, so it was like this weird, “I think I like it, this is cool but eeeeugh.” I was really influenced at that time, after the Shit and Peaches, by Pan Sonic. I don’t know if you know them at all, they’re a Finnish band, and they made music that sounded like this… (music: Pan Sonic – unknown) Nick Dwyer At that time, did you feel like you were being controversial, or was it just normal for you, were you just telling it how it was? Peaches I did not feel controversial at all because I just wanted to say what I wanted to say, and I wanted to say it directly. It started to really polarize peopl. Like, people really hating me or people really like, “Yeah, respect, we need to hear this.” And then people were telling me how much I sounded like a band called
Suicide and ESG, and I didn’t know either of those bands. Suicide, M.I.A. uses a sample from them in that song “Born Free.” So it was funny because I didn’t really know what I was
doing, I was just trying to sound like Pan Sonic with Bikini Kill in it, or
take something like Iggy Pop and put
it with Salt-n-Pepa. And after I had made Teaches of Peaches,
2manyDJs had come out with a song that
was those two in particular. Nick Dwyer In terms of the timeline, where you packed up and you said no more to the schoolteaching, you decided to move to Berlin. You’re now living in Berlin, you’ve released a record on Kitty-Yo… Peaches Yes, I had sent them the record so even by the time I had got there, the record came out two weeks later and I had done a show that was packed, and somehow it had just caught on. There was no radio play, there was no video, there was no internet, there was nothing. It was literally word of mouth. I got to Kitty-Yo and they were just like, “Oh my God, we’re getting calls from
Madonna’s Maverick label, Beastie Boys’ label called, Arthur Baker wants to know what’s up.” Elastica was calling, just by getting this little mail outs from this small little
label. So there was no mass blast, nothing, it was just literally word of mouth. Nick Dwyer Did it feel overwhelming at the time? Peaches It was just exciting. It was cool. Yeah. I really didn’t care because I was on Kitty-Yo. I was just gonna do my thing. Nick Dwyer One video that you did load up, I think is one of your Berlin shows? Peaches Yeah, one of my first Berlin shows coming up. Nick Dwyer And for you, I guess, aside from the music scene, what was it about Berlin that all of a sudden was a really appealing place to create music? Peaches It was just really open. OK, so this is one of my earlier shows. (video: Peaches live in Berlin) Nick Dwyer ... the next ten years of my life here,” which you did? Peaches I didn’t even know. Now I have spent 11 years there. I think it’s just a good place to create because it’s not Paris or London or New York where it’s completely competitive or overwhelming all the time. Like I said, when I moved there, after two weeks I was already doing interviews and shows and touring constantly. And I’ve been touring ever since. It seemed like a good calm place to be. Nick Dwyer What happened off the back of that was, as you mentioned, all this touring, and still to this day. What was the point for you, aside from all these calls from, like, the Beastie Boys were calling, where you were like, “Wow, something is happening here?” I guess, the question here is that you mentioned earlier on that you never thought of yourself as a musician, it was more of a performance artist. What was the moment for you when you went, “You know what, maybe I am a musician? Peaches I felt like I had to tell myself I was a musician because it was important at that time that people saw me as a musician, or heard it from me that I’m a musician, so that I could become a musician and become a part of musical
circles. Instead of going, “Oh, I’m a performance artist,” and them going, “Oh, alright. Well…” (motions a dismissive hand signal) So now I couldn’t give a fuck if people see me as a musician or performance artist or whatever. I feel so lucky to be able to be whatever I want, because I’ve taken it much further. I’ve taken it much further than music. Like, this looks totally normal (gestures to screen), one person on stage with a machine. At that time it was very weird. There’s my machine and people were wondering if I was really playing it. They didn’t understand what was going on. That night actually, my machine got very drunk and died and I had to get a new one. That was the night before
I went on tour with Elastica. But yeah, it was really strange. And for TV, they were like, “No, no, we can’t put you on American TV. We can’t just have somebody and a machine.” But you know, they constantly have that with hip-hop 1artists. I think it was also a gender thing, I think they didn’t really know what to do with this 33-year-old white Jewish suburban girl, with a machine. “I don’t know what to do with that.” Nick Dwyer One of the main points here is that the music industry has always lent itself to the notion that if you are a female and you are over 30, there is no hope in hell of you having a career. Yet your career didn’t start until after you were 30. Peaches Yeah, and it didn’t start with the help of any sort of media other than my own word of mouth. Funny thing, that. Nick Dwyer The other thing to note is that after going on tour with Elastica, you became
really good friends with
Justine from Elastica, and
famously, Justine’s roommate was a very young M.I.A., or they were friends. Peaches Yeah, yeah, M.I.A. was on tour on tour also as a videographer, and she was
like, “Oh, that’s a really cool machine. What is that machine?” And I was
like, “It’s so easy, if you wanna make music, use this machine.” And she got one. Nick Dwyer And she started making some music. Peaches Yeah. Nick Dwyer The other thing is that at this time in Berlin, a musical box that a lot of journalists started to put people like yourself and Chicks on Speed into was this whole thing called electroclash. And I guess,
without even realizing it, you were right at the epicenter of it. How did that kind of feel, all of a sudden, being part of a musical movement? Peaches Well, I don’t think anybody that is in a movement likes to be part of a movement. Bob Dylan and Joan Baez did not like to be called
protest songs and the Ramones did not like to be called punk rock, so at the
time you just go, “I’m not that, I’m just me.” So that’s how I felt about that. Though, then I did go on a tour that was called the Electroclash Tour with Chicks On Speed and Tracy + the Plastics and things like that. It was an all-girl group and that was important for me, that it was all women and it wasn’t a “women’s tour,” but an electroclash tour. It wasn’t like “women on tour.” Nick Dwyer Shall we listen to something else from Teaches of Peaches? Peaches Sure, what you wanna hear? Nick Dwyer What would you like to play to everyone? Peaches I would like to play this song. (music: Peaches – “Diddle My Skittle”) Peaches ...all the songs on the first two albums are produced by me, and the first album, there’s only eight tracks to use. As I mentioned I did not have a Mac or any other computer
– I was not an early computer geek or anything. I had an
ADAT machine, you know, video tape, and a Mackie 16-channel mixer and I had them on a keyboard stand. My friends were always like, “That’s gonna fall, that’s gonna fall!” And I had them set up in my bedroom by my bed so I could record from my bed. And that was a big deal, like, “Yeah, I can
record from my bed.” Now, of course you can record from your bed but back then it was a big concept to me. So yeah, that’s all from an ADAT machine’s recordings. And the only time I had somebody else singing back-ups was on this
song, and that was Feist, going, “Little dittle.” I was like, “I need an extra
voice,” because I couldn't do overdubs. Nick Dwyer So did you find yourself becoming a little geekier with your tech stuff and your studio stuff? Peaches Yeah, I try but I’m a really bad geek. As much as I want to be a geek I don’t have the attention span and I’m extroverted, stuff like that. I have managed to set up a few studios, actually. Grayson graced one of my studios when he was in Berlin and needed a place to record before it was treated or anything, and I was like, “Yeah, I got a studio.” This cold room, I shoved him in with a bad PA. But I’ve managed to set up a lot of equipment, I have a lot of gear now. I actually took over Jamie Liddell’s old studio and I
inherited his Jupiter, and I
bought his MS-10 and I bought his format modulating system and I have them all set up, all at once so that I can just play. And with Ableton now I can use it and play whatever and it’s constantly going. If I have jam sessions, people can play but it will always be in their own tracks. I also have an electronic drum kit, but the big one, so all the drums will be separate with all the MIDI’s so you can change whatever sounds and stuff like that. Nick Dwyer Going back to what we were talking about before about the lyrical side of
things, when the album came out globally, and the first thing that would be
documented was the lyrical content and the nature of the lyrics. We were
talking earlier over lunch about how a lot of the music from the ’70s and ’80s
wasn’t even very metaphorical. It was really filthy! Peaches No, no, we were talking about Rod Stewart, where he was like, “Don’t say a word, my virgin child / Upstairs by the nightstand / Spread your wings
and let me come inside.” It was like, “Really? OK!” Nick Dwyer And the other one is Lynyrd Skynyrd in “Sweet Home Alabama” when he’s talking about
a grown man meeting a girl who’s just turned 16, and like, “jailbait.” Peaches But also, I said that they probably don’t even realize, but they were one of the first bands who had ever sampled. They go, “You can hear Mr. Young sing
about it…” And then you hear, “Southern man.” And I’m like, “Wow! They don’t even know that they’re sample geniuses.” (laughs) Nick Dwyer So I guess the question is, like, things of a sexual nature well, of a filthy sexual nature… Peaches Have always been around. And are completely at the top of pop music. Nick Dwyer I mean, you went for a straightforward approach, but were you surprised at everyone getting so shocked about it? Peaches Of course! Yeah, and I was shocked at them being shocked. I just wanted to say things directly and I think something that I always mention is that the mainstream does not include everybody, which is really ridiculous. It just includes a mainstream, kind of traditional path. We all need to find out who we are and find that path, and if you look to the mainstream, then you’re going to have a lot of problems understanding who you are.
Because 99% of the time you’re not really going to be included in your own sort of way
that you want to express yourself. Also, popular music has always been linked to sexuality. I mean, rock & roll means, like, “rock” and “roll” – it’s about
having sex in the back seat in the car, you know, “rock and roll.” So this whole, “Peaches – sexually explicit lyrics!” is just ridiculous. I couldn’t believe it. There’s a band that I also found out about after, when I was reading this book called She’s A Rebel about women in rock music, and
there’s this band from the ’80s called Bitches with Problems and people didn’t like
them, but they were probably the most progressive girl hip-hop and this is why. This is going to be really bass-y. Nick Dwyer What is this song called? Peaches I call it “Eat My Pussy Right.” I don’t even think it’s called that! (music: Bytches With Problems – “Teach Em” / applause) So that’s some ’80s girl hip-hop that all the other girls though, “Oh no no no, that's going backwards.” There’s this idea that comes from late or early feminists, kind of, “Say no to everything.” Which brings me to my second album, because I was like, “No, say yes to everything, including say yes to
calling people ‘fatherfuckers,’ if people are going to call people
‘motherfuckers.’” So, to bring attention to things in the mainstream I wanted to go more hardcore, so that’s what I did with my Fatherfucker album. Nick Dwyer We were talking before about notions of lyrics of a sexual nature. What would you say is your take on themes of a sexual nature? Like, in what way does sex influence your writing? Peaches Well, I think that you need to be inspired and I think that sexual feelings can inspire you too. Nick Dwyer So Fatherfucker, all of a sudden a lot rockier… Peaches I don’t know if people like to call it rockier, because there were a couple of live songs on there, and I did a duet with Iggy Pop. So that was the main single because Iggy Pop was in it. So yeah, there are rockier songs, but there are also way more hardcore songs like “Shake Your Dicks”, because
there’s a million songs like “Shake your booty” or “Shake your tits.” And I was like, “Why are there no songs about shake your dick? I mean, it’s hanging, you know?” (laughter) I remember being in Brazil and that album had just come out and I was invited by DJ Marlboro, who does booty music there, to be on his radio show. And I was in the studio with five guys just being like, “Yeah, DJ Marlboro, and there’s like, booty dancers and they’re
slapping their ass.” So I call my dancers over and I’m like, “OK, when I play
my songs, dance for me.” And they’re like, “Yeah, yes!” And they were so
excited. So then I made all the guys line up and I was performing “Shake Your Dicks” and I was like, “I’m not going to play anything and I’m going to stop radio right now unless you guys shake your dicks. Enough of these booty dancers, I want to see you shaking your dicks.” And part of it was that they didn’t really understand English, and they were all looking at each other, like, what’s this woman doing? And then one guy just starts going, (motions
shaking) and I was like, “Yeah! That’s what I’m talking about!” Nick Dwyer So the Fatherfucker album came out on
XL, right? You went from being on this very small German label to all of a sudden being on a very cool label. How did that XL thing come about? Peaches I was in Australia on the Big Day Out tour, and Prodigy were on this tour and the White Stripes and Basement Jaxx, and they had all gone back to XL in the UK and said, “You gotta know about Peaches.” And it was cool because it was on a rock side and on a dance side, so they sent an A&R guy over, and I was playing in Paris in a restaurant where they moved the tables and they decided to have a little party. And the sound was so goddamn awful that I had stage-dived into the audience and was like, “Take me to the sound booth.” And I got there and I was like, “Turn the bass down,” etc., etc., and telling them how to do my sound while people were holding me up. So XL said, “Oh, that’s cool, we’re gonna sign you.” Nick Dwyer And then also Sony Music came knocking as well… Peaches Ah, that was before… Nick Dwyer But that didn’t last too long, did it? Peaches No. OK, so Kitty-Yo had decided to sign a deal for a remix for the song “Set It Off” and there were some remixes made and one of the remixes was by Tobi Neumann. And there was going to be a video, and I thought that this was a really good chance for me to do this video that I had always wanted to do about me growing hair, because when I first started playing I was wearing these little pink shorts. Like, my pants would come off and I would be wearing these little shorts and people would be pointing and taking pictures, and I was like, “What?” And it was because they saw little hairs and people were really shocked by that. I also thought that was really ridiculous, like, “Hair grows there, what do you want? I’m sorry I didn’t have time to shave, I don’t really care, blah blah blah.” So then I started thinking about hair and also how if it’s on your eyelashes or long on your head as a woman, then it’s beautiful, but if it’s under your arms or on your legs then it’s ugly. Anyway, I wanted to make this video of me dancing and growing hair and with eyelashes so that everybody would be like, “Oh, she’s getting prettier.” And then, all of a sudden, there would be hair growing everywhere, and then it gets really like, ill. So then I picked a director who made beautiful pictures but he was definitely cheesy. I knew he was cheesy, and I was like, “Great! My vision with a cheesy guy, that will be really cool.” And it was also before everybody had their own little video cameras and
stuff like that, so I was like, “Great, I’ll have it high quality.” I mean, now you can do it yourself with a Canon 70, or whatever. But then I realized that their aesthetic was so different from mine, and also the people who had signed me at Sony had switched to different departments, so nobody really cared about me. They didn’t understand, they didn’t know what to do with me. So then the day comes when I’m with the director. Well, there were two directors, and one of them was gay, and they had all these models at my shoot, and I was like, “I want my friends.” So I had my rough friends there, and they had models. The models were doing ecstasy, my friends were drinking whatever they could find in the bar that we were filming in, and they had one girl who worked at the label as a kind of “representative lesbian,” like, attacking some girls. Ao they would have these lesbian scenes, because you know, that’s always good for dance tracks. (rolls eyes) I was like, “OK, well, if you’re gonna have that then I want to have two guys kissing and making out.” And the director, who was gay, was like, “No, no, no, TV doesn’t have that.” I was really like, “I can’t believe this.” And then, six months later that Christina Aguilera video came out, “Beautiful,” and there was two
guys kissing and it was this whole big huge thing, and I was like, “Idiot, this could have been you!” But yeah, that was the only time I actually did a video that wasn’t under my control, or worked with Sony, and I wanted it to work with Sony, because then I thought, “Yeah, I can sell more Teaches of Peaches.” But I didn’t know that actually what they do is bury the album while they try to do the single. So they buried my album for eight months, and actually when I signed to XL, the condition was, “Bring back the Teaches of Peaches.”
So it had a re-release in 2002 because I wanted to bring that album back that was buried away. Nick Dwyer And the relationship you have now with XL is where have you ever had to do anything that you didn’t want to do? Peaches No, they were quite excited about Fatherfucker, the album title and all that. But the US office was quite horrified, they were like, “We can’t do anything with this. What are we supposed to do?” I remember I presented the album to them, and I was saying, “And the name of the album is…
Fatherfucker!” And they were all like... (motions faces dropping) Nick Dwyer Shall we listen to something off the album now? Peaches Sure, what do you want to listen to? Nick Dwyer I think maybe the track with Iggy? Peaches I wanna mention that if you want to watch that video, I had so many crap treatments for this video, and I was like, “There’s no way I’m taking a crap treatment. I want it to be me and Iggy, we’re this crime-fighting duo that are so sick of each other but so good at our job that we’re just fighting zombies and we’re just like, yelling at each other, and we kill a zombie and get back to yelling.” (music: Peaches feat. Iggy Pop – “Kick It” / applause) Thank you. This is one of those moments in my musical career that blew my mind, when Iggy Pop called me on my phone and I didn’t answer. And there was a message on my machine, like, “Hey, it’s Iggy.” I still have it recorded. And he was making an album and he wanted to cover one of my songs called “Rock Show,” which he did, and he finally got me on the phone and he said, “I want to cover your song ‘Rock Show.’” And I said, “Awesome. Actually I’m making a new album, can you be on my album?” And he was like, “Yeah, yeah, sure, why don’t you just write it and I’ll do it.” And I was like, “Okaaay.” So I wrote this song, sort of tongue-in-cheek about making fun of myself, and being excited about his lyrics, and making fun of each other through our lyrics, and stuff like that. I went to Miami where he lives and recorded him and it was quite an insane experience to have Iggy Pop in the vocal booth asking me how he should do these vocals. It was so cool. “Just try it a little more like this.” It was really amazing. Nick Dwyer Was the studio in his house? Peaches No, it was at Hit Factory, and I remember Missy Elliott’s green
Lamborghini was outside. I didn’t get to meet her, but I was like, “Oh my god, that’s it! She’s the only one with that kind of Lamborghini.” Nick Dwyer You had a pretty interesting way of recreating that song on stage. Peaches Yeah, I couldn’t have Iggy Pop there, and again, I have so many stories of pre-technology. I started my show with Super 8, and I had seven videos from my first album all made on Super 8, and they would all project at the same time and stuff like that. Before you had this easy way of using technology, like you have now, I would bring out a screen and then I videoed Iggy Pop doing his part, and then I’d sing to that. That later on became an art project where it was a live karaoke / videoke thing, where you could either be me or Iggy Pop, and either one would appear and you could sing along to it. We did that in galleries and things like that. Nick Dwyer Around this sort of time as well, the shows started getting bigger and you started touring the world doing support slots for really massive stadium-size rock acts like Queens of the Stone Age, Marilyn Manson. How crazy was that experience? Peaches It was pretty crazy because nobody likes an opening band. Especially Marilyn Manson fans. I want to show you this one little clip, I hope you can understand what’s going on here, it’s very small. There was this crazy time in Madrid, when the whole time the crowd was chanting, “Man-son! Man-son!” around whatever I was doing. (video: Peaches live in Madrid) Yeah, I really had a good time, saying things like, “You’re not black sheep, you’re sheep in black,” things like that. The point for me is, like I played in Paris, and there were 10,000 people and they are hawking loogies on me. And it’s not for the love, it’s not on a punk version. Nick Dwyer Was it kind of like, the more anger you get the more it makes you want to do
bigger kinds of things? Peaches Yeah, with that, when they were hawking loogies at me and stuff like that, I was like, “I’m not leaving the stage.” It was just important for me to win, I was like, “I’m gonna win this. If I leave now, they win. If I stay, I totally win.” So I remember in London, they were throwing bottles at me. They were plastic bottles, but they were throwing them at me. I started it, I knew they wanted to throw bottles me, so I threw a bottle. Tons of bottles kept being thrown at me. My dad was a professional pitcher, so I’m like, pegging people off with bottles and telling them, “You throw like girls!” You know, saying all this stuff. And then at the end of the show I had taken the empty water-cooler bottle from the catering, and I was like, “Oh yeah? I got the biggest bottle!” And I just went like this (motions swinging bottle around her head) and threw it into the audience. It’s funny, because there was 10,000 people everywhere we went, and even if 10%, 20% of them liked me, it made my audience larger than it was at the time. I have so many people all around Europe that have seen those shows and they’re like, “You came onstage, and we thought maybe it was the beginning, Manson had a little midget on stage and that’s how the show started.” I started my set with my Joan Jett sample, “I don’t give a fuck.” I came out there like, “I don’t give a fuck!” Screaming at them and they were like, “Oh yeah, this must be the beginning of the Manson show.” And then it would go on and they would be like, “Oh my god, who is this bitch? I hate her.” Or you would see some people who were like, “Yeah! Yeah!” So I think I really polarized the night. I learned a lot, that you just have to keep going, and it was really hard. I remember Queens of the Stone Age got guys in middle America who would turn their backs – it was really 90% guys – they would turn their backs to me, and then I would jump in the audience and go like, “I’m over here!” Things like that. Then Queens of the Stone Age would come out, and Nick Oliveri, who was still in
the band then, would be wearing my things that said, “Fuck the pain away,” and would be like, “Yeah, shake your dicks,” and confuse the audience totally. So a lot of the bands liked to have to sort of shake up their audience, too. Nick Dwyer Did it ever go wrong, though? In terms of yourself or people on stage getting injured? Peaches Oh, I injured people! At Manson shows I had no problem injuring people. I’m sure if I was more famous I would have got in a lot of lawsuits. But I would go into the audience and you’d just hear “bmph, bmph”! It would be the sound of me hitting people with my microphone over the head, like, “Fuck off!” And
then Manson would be, “Good job.” Pat me on the head. Nick Dwyer Let’s talk a bit about your live show because one thing that’s always been a constant as you’ve evolved as an artist, is embracing technology with your live show. To give people an idea, we have some great videos here, but you know, laser harps… Peaches Yeah, I mean from that video screen, it seems so normal now, so many people use it now when they can’t get the vocalist, and you see them in the video. But this was really before all that. Three years ago I decided to have this blinking pussy light that I wanted to be 120 BPM, or whatever, and I remember Christina Aguilera came to one of my shows and was like, “Can you do a guest rap on one of my songs?” And I was like, “Yeah, great, yeah!” And then when her album comes out, she’s on the Grammys, all the lights go out, and
she’s got a god damn pussy light blinking! Nick Dwyer This is the history of your life! Peaches Yeah, the history of my life is doing it for 1,000 people and then everybody else doing it for a million. (laughs) Yeah. Nick Dwyer So right now we’re going to watch something from this live show? Peaches Yeah, so the last band I worked with was a Berlin band that I really love, they’re really good friends of mine and they are called Sweet Machine and one of the members of
Sweet Machine, Connor Rapp, he is my geek savior. So this is a song we did... (video: Peaches & Sweet Machine) Nick Dwyer We’re going to open up to questions very soon, but another couple of things we should talk about is furthering your performance art, over the last year or so… Peaches I gave myself a few presents because I had a 10-year anniversary, so one of the them was the complete, ultimate, live show experience. And since I live in Berlin, and there was a festival called the Berlin Festival that I was involved in, I could. And all the heavy tech wizards I knew lived in Berlin, plus my band and I had been touring for two years so we wanted to do the ultimate show, so that’s what we did. And the other present I gave myself is that I reworked 28 of my songs into an opera. I say an opera because I wanted it to tell a story through my songs and not through a jukebox musical, where you have a bunch of music that you really like from Queen, or whatever, and you have a really crap story that has nothing to do with the music. So I developed a story. Nick Dwyer What is the story about? Peaches It’s a mythical history of me and it was also taking into account all of the things that people have said about me and all the myths, like, “Oh, I think she’s hermaphrodite” / “I think she has a dick” / “I think she’s a guy.” You know, all that sort of stuff. And there’s other people who do that now. So I wanted to do a mythical history using my songs to tell the story of me, but on an augmented level. So this is a scene where my fans want me to be more than I am, so they give me a dick and tits. Ao then I meet a real tranny and I fall in love with a tranny. We’ve done it in a sort of ’50s musical style for this track, where I’m singing my song, “I Feel Cream.” And we use the half-man, half-woman. And there’s some real full-frontal nudity here, kids, and this is my take on a romantic love scene. So this is what I’m into right now, doing that. Also, I’ll just show you some of the beginning when I become Peaches. At the very beginning I’m actually with my 505 there, singing with my old hair and I got this big pussy bed behind me and all these dancers come out of the pussy bed and then I turn into Peaches. And they all end up looking like me, and then my ex-lover comes in singing “Lovertits” and it’s all my own songs. It all uses the imagery which relates to me and instruments that I’ve used. Nick Dwyer So you performed in Berlin, and also America? Peaches This? No, this we only performed in Berlin because it’s a huge production. Nick Dwyer Will you tour it, though? Peaches I would love to tour it – maybe Red Bull Music Academy would like to sponsor this fantastic production, because it’s quite expensive. Nick Dwyer For you, it seems like this side of things is kind of going back to your roots a little bit. Peaches Yeah, it was really funny because now here I am doing a complete theater piece. But it was amazing to use all my music experiences to bring it back to that. Nick Dwyer Also was that last year, Peaches Christ Superstar? Peaches That was before this. This is more like the rock part, this is the more theory
part. Peaches Christ Superstar was when I took the whole Jesus Christ Superstar, and I
performed the whole thing myself, every single part. With no sets or anything, just Chilly Gonzales on piano playing the whole orchestration. Nick Dwyer Were there a few controversies with that? Peaches Yeah, Andrew Lloyd Webber didn’t like the art idea of that because it wasn’t, like, making ten million dollars a show. Basically, it was about money. Nick Dwyer Did you get a letter from his lawyers? Peaches Yes, we got a “cease and desist” so I’m not allowed to do that for two years, but I have a feeling that they’re never going to let us. But, if you happen to be in Paris at a club called Silencio, where it’s a private club, you might see it there sometime. Nick Dwyer One of the questions I was gonna ask you in terms of the production side of things was, for someone who’s produced your own music for the bulk of your life, tell me about your last album. Peaches Yeah, that last album, I decided that I didn’t want to produce, I wanna collaborate with people. Nick Dwyer Why was that? Peaches Well, you know, it’s time to learn more about production, and also to just expand. I’ve always said that you have to do the opposite of what you are, and for me it was giving up a little bit and collaborating and singing some
vulnerable songs and things like that. I’m really happy with the results. Some of it was a really big challenge. A lot of different producers. I ended up producing some tracks myself. I really like the album. Nick Dwyer From that experience, what was one of the greatest things that you learnt?
Like, what were your wow!, eureka moments? Peaches Well, the MS-20 is God, that’s my answer. Nick Dwyer And I guess the last thing that I wanted to ask you before we throw it over to
the audience is that, well, you’ve been on this crazy roller-coaster ride for
nearly two decades now. What are the greatest lessons that you’ve learned yourself which you could share with a bunch of people who are, quite possibly, about to be on their own roller-coaster? Peaches Just go with it, and don’t get off. Even if you’re sick and green and puking, keep on it. And keep your vision. You never know when it’s going to hit or something like that, but
the thing is, you’re always going to make music, and that’s what you love and that’s why you do it, hopefully. So whatever crazy ideas you have, do them. Keep doing them. (applause) Nick Dwyer Has anybody got any questions? Audience Member I was just wondering, with all the conflict that you talked about, coming up against audiences and people viewing your work as controversial, and so on, were there ever points for you where you felt like it was too much to handle? Or did you have things that helped you continue to work, like support from friends and family or whatever? Peaches Yeah, and even from fans. Also, I’m putting myself out there in what I’m
saying and also I like to have moments where there’s no more audience and no more stage. So there was a time actually when I played All Tomorrow’s Parties, and I was riding on someone’s shoulders, eating a hot dog, singing, as you do. And someone tried to put their hand in a place where it shouldn’t go, and I tried to grab him, and he ran. It was the only time I got on stage and I was like, “That is wrong, that’s not what I’m about.” And then I got on stage and Genesis P-Orridge was there and just gave me such good advice and support, and it really helped, because I was just like, “What?!” I mean, I can take a lot, I can take Manson-fan alcoholic spit on me, but that was a lot more. You have to really let it roll off your back, even if it’s not really rolling off your back. Sometimes, you’ll be on stage and you really don’t want to be there at all. But to me
it’s harder not to give the energy, not to give the full force – it’s much harder for me to give half. Audience Member You were talking earlier about how you translated your being a woman into the lyrics. I’m curious about the musical part of your songs, because it’s not the typical femininity. But I think your music is very feminine. How do you translate you being a woman into music? Peaches Because I make it. (laughs) Audience Member Yeah, but I mean the beat, and the harmonies, etc… Peaches Well, I think for me, I don’t know if it was being a woman, but especially when I started there was a lot of over-produced house, and deep house and all that kind of music, and I didn’t relate to it at all. I was like, a punk-rock kid making electro music, and I was like, “I’m going to find the bass sound
that I like, I don’t need to try and find like, five bass sounds to try and make it a good bass sound. If that’s not a good bass sound, then I’m not going to use it. And I’m going to play a riff on a keyboard, and if that riff makes me go ‘Fuck yeah!,’ then that’s my riff, and if not, then move on.” So it was more like, I don’t know if it’s me being a woman or my punk aesthetic, or my lack of musical skills. I was just like, if it’s getting me off, or I love it, then I’ll
keep it; if not, then move on. It’s actually something that Iggy Pop said to
me, when we were recording. He said, “Listen, I’m going to try and do that track, and if I don’t get it in, like, half an hour, then I don’t get it, alright?” But he got it, so it’s alright. But it’s true, and I was like, “Yeah, yeah, that’s how I feel about stuff.” If it doesn’t happen, then move on. Audience Member I think sometimes there’s a tendency for female producers who also sing to be caught in such a way that they end up just singing for another producer to make the music, and I wonder if that’s something you’ve seen as well? And if using the 505 is not just an aesthetic musical decision, but some sort of decision to retain control, because it was your thing that you could make music on? Peaches Definitely control was a huge issue. Like I said, before my last album, I Feel Cream, I wanted to always have control, even if it wasn’t the best decision sometimes. And I just finished producing a band called Go Chic – they are a Taiwanese girl band. And I saw that, especially the girl in the band
that makes the beats, that I wanted to reach a new level of production. For instance, she’d bring a demo, and I’d be like, “I know the perfect person who can make those sounds really punch out at you if you want it to be produced. If you don’t, you can do it yourself, and that’s fine.” I don’t know if you know Siriusmo? We just gave him the
tracks, and we were like, “Just make these fatter.” He didn’t change the
arrangement, he didn’t change anything, he just took those sounds and made
them with his magic, because that’s what he does, he spends 24 hours a day in the studio. And I brought them back to her, and Sonya, the girl who makes the beats, was like, “I don’t know if it’s mine anymore!” I was like, “Well, these are your songs, and you wrote them. Is this what you want?” I remember having
that feeling of not knowing whether I wanted to give up control, and it’s more of a decision, because she was like, “Is that even my sound anymore?” It’s more of a decision if you want it to sound like you or you want it to sound a certain way and you wanna get there, or if you feel like, “No, I’m a woman,
I’m a producer, it needs to be like sounding this way.” I don’t know, it’s an
aesthetic decision that you have to come up with. I don’t think I really answered the question. Audience Member Have you noticed in your music career, or the whole time of your music practice, have you noticed an increase in women participating in electronic music? Peaches It’s nice to see that there are a lot of women here – I don’t know how many of
you make electronic music or that kind of music – but I think it’s still a boys’ club, isn’t it? It’s still a boys’ club. Like, this year there was that DJ magazine, it’s like the most prominent DJ magazine in America and the readers choose the top 100 “best DJs of the year,” and there was not one female on there. I scanned it, thinking like, “Oh, that could be a girl,” and checked on Wikipedia to see if it was. Then I wrote the Twitter that said, “DJ Mag can eat a dick with their list.” And they tweeted back like, “It’s not us, it’s the readers.” Well, what are you feeding the readers? Who are you highlighting? There are so many women DJs, and DJ culture is so
big right now. That’s what I’m doing right now, I’m DJing a lot, and again, I find it really funny that DJs feel like they have to stay behind the decks, like it’s some kind of rocket science. Like, mixing is really… once you get it you get it, and if you know it you’re doing it, you’re doing it and it’s fine. You can also have a good time and perform, so I’m not just trying to be a DJ, I’m trying to go the extra mile, and DJ and MC, all myself, again. Aort of like bringing back the roots of what I did with Peaches and the 505. Audience Member Then to expand upon that idea, do you think that the ratio of male to female in the music industry has to do with media? Peaches I don’t have the answers, I’m just going to do what I do and say what I say and try and change it any way I can. By being a producer or by being a DJ. Nick Dwyer How much do you feel like the landscape’s changed from when Teaches of
Peaches came out, and people were shocked by this and that? Peaches It was amazing how it turned up everywhere. That’s amazing to me, how I was so influential, and it was funny because major record labels would not touch me, but people would go in for meetings, and they’d be like, “Be more like this girl Peaches.” And then they’d play my tracks, “…but not too much, just be a little bit like that.” So even though they wouldn’t touch me, they wanted people to be more like that. There are major stars that came to my shows and before they were who they were, would say that, “Oh yeah, I’m really into what you’re doing, and you’re really influential.” A lot of the time it was the pop stars, like Avril Lavigne and Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears and Kelis, like, when they were going from their “girl-pop” to sexual power, they always cite Peaches as an influence and it always amazes me. Nick Dwyer And Christina got you on a record in the end? Peaches Yeah, she got me rapping on a Le Tigre-produced track. Audience Member That’s kind of funny that you brought it up, because that’s what I wanted to
talk about, actually. You mentioned that you’re an influencer and an
innovator, and I definitely agree. I wanted to know about how you felt about
what you were just talking about. You influenced all these artists that are there, or wherever they are in their career, and how they influence American culture, and probably even Canadian culture. How do you feel about not being acknowledged in your country, and in Toronto for all the great things that you’ve accomplished? Peaches It’s hard to say. I mean, I have read Toronto Life magazine, and they were like, “Five top people for Mayor of Toronto,” and I was included. I was actually in Toronto last year and found out from a reader’s board that I
actually won electronic musician of the year. They didn’t even invite me. I was told, “Last night you were given an award!” So I don’t know, it’s kind of there and not there. But I know who I am. It’s fine. To be invited here and to share this with you guys is awesome and to be able to do whatever I want and take it beyond music, like I say. I don’t know. Audience Member Well, I think you should put a movie out next. Peaches (laughs) Hear, hear. Audience Member You were talking earlier about how shocked people were about your lyrics, especially early on, and I found it interesting that you mentioned that you were in Brazil with DJ Marlboro. Peaches Are you from Brazil? Audience Member Yeah. I don’t know if you’re too familiar with Brazilian funk, but the lyrics that we heard here today are actually pretty soft compared to Brazilian funk at its finest. Peaches I know that! And I don’t think that my lyrics are completely shocking. Audience Member I agree, I agree. Definitely. I guess my question is, when you’re writing obscene lyrics do you feel like you have to have a point? Because I feel like much of this
that we heard today had a point. Whereas in Brazilian funk I feel like it doesn’t have one most of the time. Peaches Yes, I do, but if I was in an interview, sometimes I would say, “Nah, I don’t have a point,” because I want people to be able to dance and sing along with it
first, and then go like: “Oh! Wow, what am I singing along with? That’s cool.” I mean, I think it should be music first, and catchy first and then people think about it after, but I definitely have a point. I remember hearing that Busta Rhymes song where he says something like, “Your ass is so big we’re gonna put the club in your ass.” So
I was like, “Alright, I’m gonna write a song called ‘Tent in Your Pants,’” you know? “The tent’s so big in your pants / Can I bring my friends for a dance? / Gonna sell those tickets advance / An immense gig up in your pants.’” So you know, stuff like that. It always has a point but I always wanted to be fun. Some people find me really angry, which I find really funny, and some people find me to be too jokey. So it’s amazing how polarized everything is with what I do, which to me makes it art. Nick Dwyer Ladies and gentleman, let’s give it up for Peaches.

Mario Caldato Jr.
Mario Caldato Jr. is a producer and studio engineer best known for wiling away many a long hour (or week, or month, or year) with the Beastie Boys. Born in Brazil, he developed his recording techniques with the variety of early ’80s acts and attitudes that made up Delicious Vinyl before going on to work with some of the biggest names in the business.
Get set for a rip-roaring collection of music industry excesses, strong alliances, classic tracks and tales from the control room in his lecture at the 2008 Red Bull Music Academy.
Hosted by Jeff “Chairman” Mao We are very fortunate to have a gentleman, a producer, who has done quite a
bit of work with everybody from Beck to
John Lee Hooker to a host of
Brazilian artists as well. He has come all the way from Rio to be here and
speak with us today, so please join me in welcoming Mario Caldato Jr. Mario Caldato Jr. Thank you, thank you, glad to be invited to the Red Bull Academy here, it is
really incredible. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You’ve been having a good time these last few days or so, checking on things? Mario Caldato Jr. It’s incredible to see the gathering of people from all over the world and be
able to participate together. Share the knowledge that everybody has. Take it
on to the next generations, it is a really wonderful thing for everyone. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I neglected to mention one group you have actually done quite a bit of work
with, but maybe you can just play something from that group and give everybody
an idea what Mario is known for? (music: Beastie Boys – “So What’cha Want” / applause) OK, so for those that may be unaware, that was a group called the Beastie Boys
and before the Beastie Boys you did quite a lot of other stuff. There seems to
be a routine with a lot of these lectures, let’s go back a little way and
find out how it started with what you do. So Mario, how did it begin for you? Mario Caldato Jr. Probably when my dad took me to Sears buying stuff and whatnot and he decided
to purchase an electric organ, a
Silvertone. Sears is a classic “find-
everything-in-one-spot” kind of place. He’s actually a mechanic, buys tools and my
mom buys clothes and vacuum cleaners and whatnot, and he decided one day to
get something cool. He asked me if I liked it and we went and checked them
out and they were on display. In the ‘60s, it was kind of a cool home
entertainment piece. They had these presets and it was just funky, just cool.
This guy would be playing it in the store so you get a demo as you’re walking
by, and if you purchase it, you get free lessons. So I got a few lessons and
they put a little chart with numbers and I played the chart with the numbers
and that was the beginning of my musical introduction. Jeff “Chairman” Mao And beyond that Sears organ, what was the next step? Mario Caldato Jr. It escalated. A few years later my parents moved to a house and they decided
they wanted to buy a piano, so I got a piano at the house and they put me in
some lessons. I took some classical lessons, did that for a few years and it
was fun and interesting for a bit and then it got a little serious. I had a
really strict teacher. Jeff “Chairman” Mao How strict? Mario Caldato Jr. The worst part was that I had my lessons before I went to school. So school
started at eight in the morning and my lesson was at seven, which meant I had to get
up at 6:15 or something and leave the house at 6.30. Jeff “Chairman” Mao That’s like downright abusive. Mario Caldato Jr. It was kind of cruel, but it was the only time available and my dad told me she was a really
expensive and really good teacher. So I was told, “You are lucky to have this
and you should appreciate it,” and whatever. I did for a while when it got to
the point I wasn’t having fun so I stopped practicing. I would rather play and
do stuff like that than have my lesson. In the end I had my lesson and I was
supposed to play something and I didn’t play it and my teacher slapped me in
the face. Back and in the ‘60s you could do that. [laughs] She said, “You’re
not practicing, you’re wasting your parents’ money,” and all of that. My mom
was breaking down, “We’re giving you this money and you should really be
practicing,” and then I decided to quit. It wasn’t for me. I thought I’d
rather not play and so I backed out of the classical music. But I still had
the organ at the house and I enjoyed messing around with that, turning it on and playing it. The same one, Sears organ.
Back then, things were built to last, those things still work. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What about the teacher, has the statute of limitations run out? Can we go back
and prosecute? Mario Caldato Jr. I think she has probably gone by now, but I can’t be mad because I did learn
how to read and do some basic things, which were important later on in life. I
appreciated it definitely, but at the time I wasn’t interested so much in the
classical music. I was listening to the radio, and radio in the ‘60s, AM
radio, was playing really, really good and high-quality music. The pop music
was really high quality, the Beatles and the Stones, everything else was going
on, Motown, wonderful music that was happening, I would be listening to it all
the time. Jeff “Chairman” Mao This is in Los Angeles? Mario Caldato Jr. That’s correct. I was born in Brazil, São Paulo. My folks moved when I was two
years old to LA, not knowing how to speak the language or anything. They
took a big chance, and I got thrown into the whole American system of
schooling and all that. But I was exposed to all this music, which was
obviously around and really, really good. That was a big influence listening
to AM radio, there were only a few stations back then and everybody was
listening to the same things and it was really cool. I was fortunate to catch
that time, I think it was very inspirational. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So just absorbing all the music you were listening to and having some lessons,
some keyboard lessons, when did you make the transformation to create your own
music? Mario Caldato Jr. Well, it started off a few years later when I was about 12 or 13. My neighborhood
where I lived was a pretty mixed neighborhood but it changed quite a bit
after the LA riots. Most of the
white people, and there was lots of Asian people, actually, they had moved
away after the riots, so we had more black people moving in and Latinos and
stuff. That changed the neighborhood. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Which riots are you referring to? Mario Caldato Jr. The LA riots in ‘68, not the ‘92
ones. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Not the sequel. Mario Caldato Jr. The original ones. That was pretty serious back then, actually.
Obviously, in the ’60s all of the protests and things like that going on,
Martin Luther King and whatnot, it was an interesting time to be raised in
LA and the music definitely reflected it. My neighbors, I had several
friends and would hang out at their house and we would be listening to their
folks music, a lot of Al Green and Motown. My best friend was this black guy
Dwayne Allen, whose mom was a schoolteacher and she was really hip and she let
her son play music at home and whatnot, and for some reason he was really into
the Beatles. He went to Sears and his mom got him a guitar and we started
jamming along with the Beatles and doing covers. We started a little band
called the Soul Sticks, he played guitar and I played percussion, maracas and
tambourine and backing vocals and that is kind of where it started, hanging
out. Then it escalated to a drummer, this kid Calvin, who was really funky and
he had an older brother who was a jazz musician, who happened to have a
Ludwig drum kit, Beatles style. Jeff “Chairman” Mao That wasn’t from Sears, though. Mario Caldato Jr. That
wasn’t from Sears, it was a real Ludwig. Now we had drums and it just all
slowly started, just jamming around and doing covers and playing for our
parents at little events on the weekend. That went on for a bit and when it
escalated, I switched schools from the one I was going to, from a public
school to a Catholic school, and started hanging out in Gardena and then I got introduced to a whole new crew of
friends. Same thing, I hooked up with some friends who had a little band and
they had a bunch of guitar players and a bass player and a drummer, but they
didn’t have anyone with a keyboard. I told them I had an organ, an electric
organ, and they were like, “Whoa, shit. You’ve gotta join the band.” So they had me come
down and they started showing me the playlist. Back then we were into Deep
Purple, Free and Led Zeppelin and started getting into a whole ’nother rock and
stuff and it just escalated from that band. We played at the school festivals
and then in the following year we went to junior high school and it escalated
to where we started another band and we just kept playing. Jeff “Chairman” Mao When did you meet Mark
Nishita? Mario Caldato Jr. In high school. He was actually in the second formation of my high school
band. He was in the phase two part, he came in as a keyboardist and a singer.
I was playing keyboards, I started off on the organ and eventually bought an
electric piano and a synthesizer. I was really fascinated when I went to the
music store and I saw these mid-’70s electric synthesizers, portable ones, they had all these knobs, making all of these crazy sound effects and stuff and that really
caught my interest. I was more into the sound effects and things and less into
the playing and so I ventured off into making sound effects and things. Jeff “Chairman” Mao OK, so that’s when you became more interested in that aspect of it. You
mentioned Mark, who went on to become known as Money
Mark, who
played on all of the Beastie Boys records that you produced. Describe then
going from the early beginnings of recording and how you got into that aspect
of it and what followed. Mario Caldato Jr. Mark was definitely my main guy for getting me into recording. He wrote songs,
original songs. We had cover songs in the band, but he actually had original
songs. He was into acting and whatnot, and he did a play where he actually made his own
music for the play and to do that he went and bought himself a four-track, a reel-
to-reel Teac, which
was a really amazing machine. He figured it out himself, how to use it and
record, and he was doing that at home. He lived in a little house with two
other brothers and he didn’t really have a lot of room, so they had to set it
up in the living room and tear it down afterwards. I had just moved out of my
parents’ house and was on my own. I had this little job and I quit school and
had moved into a little back house and he said, “Hey, can I set up my gear
here?” And I was like, “Yeah, of course,” and he basically brought over his four-track
and we set it up in my little back house. We were hanging out, him playing
songs and you know, you hit record and watch the needle and keep it close
to zero. And I started engineering basically his sessions and that is really
where the recording started. Through his guidance and his will to just figure
things out himself and do it, he didn’t take any classes or anything and he
was very talented. We did that for a few years, four-track demos. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Then you started doing engineering things a little bit on your own. You
said you were DJing as well? Mario Caldato Jr. The recording stuff escalated. I slowly started buying gear, find a reverb
here… Actually, Mark, he would show up with stuff all the time in the studio. He would hear about stuff or run across it and one day he came in with a little
mixer that had reverb on it and an EQ and we thought, “Wow, this is
interesting.” Obviously, we’re hanging out just a lot of time just messing
around, taking a channel and panning it and adding reverb and just really
educating myself and finding out about it, and then plugging in an effect like
a phaser and making a bunch
of recordings. We made some mixes, we made some acetates we sent to the radio
station at the time. The college radio station was a big step, so we did that and
it got to the point where he played all the instruments and you couldn’t
really perform so he decided to start a band. By now, it was early ‘80s, ‘80,
‘81, something like that. He said, “Well, let’s start a band. You play bass.”
OK that was an easy thing for me to do. I got into that, and he made his brother
play drums. His brother was a punk rocker, he said, “You play drums,” and he
made him play drums and we got this other cat to play guitar, our friend
Bill from one of the old bands that we had. Then Mark started playing
keyboards and singing and we created the Jungle Bugs. And we were more
serious about that. Jeff “Chairman” Mao That was the first time you really took it seriously and it wasn’t just
messing around? Mario Caldato Jr. Exactly. My first production was a 7" of the Jungle Bugs, which was a big deal.
We all had bands, but none of us had a record, and we decided to go ahead and
do it. I had a job, so I had some money so I put that in to fund the recording
and we were fortunate enough to make a little record and have fun with it. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So what was the style of music you were doing? Mario Caldato Jr. The ‘80s ska was really big, like the Specials, Elvis Costello, the
Clash and we were kind
of into a psychedelic ska, reggae vibe with a little bit of pop. Mark was very
Elton John and Billy Joel background, keyboards and all. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Was that like Fishbone back then as well? Mario Caldato Jr. They were around that time, that was definitely happening. But we were
definitely weird, just different. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So how long did you do that for before you got into the next phase? Mario Caldato Jr. That was a year or two of horsing around and playing and we worked our way
from little house parties and whatnot to play in Hollywood. We played at a club in
Hollywood and that was a big deal, we were like, “Oh, we made it,” although we
had to pay to play. We got a friend to sell tickets, but we played at a club
and thought, “Wow, now what do we do?” We had our little 7" and things kind of
went their own way and we kind of got bored with the music that we were doing
at the time. Then I started just being a music listener and going out and
absorbing live music a lot and hanging out at clubs and really getting into
the scenes, different scenes. I really got into reggae music when Bob Marley
died. I’d be listening to the public radio stations and they had a lot of
reggae programs and they were playing all this reggae music and I thought,
“Oh, what is this? This is really cool stuff.” I really found a connection, a calling there, and
I started listening to it a lot, got deep into it. I even took a trip to
Jamaica in ‘83 to go to the
Sunsplash and then I couldn’t
get any of my friends or anybody to go. I was like, “Does anybody want to come
with me?” And everyone was like, “What you’re listening to that for?” No one
was into it and I said, “No, I’m really into this music and it’s great and I’m
going to go.” And I went and had fun with a bunch of people and met some
people, bought some 7"s, some records. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So that was your pilgrimage to pay homage to Jamaican music? Mario Caldato Jr. The music was just a big motivation at that time for me. An inspiration, I should say. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Was it Jamaican music that styled or influenced what you did later, do you
think as far as a sound or sonic landscape? Mario Caldato Jr. Definitely. I didn’t really know much about it. I went to a record store once I
started listening to it on the radio to find out about it. I went
to my local record store on Cranshaw in the ’hood, where I lived. The
reggae section was literally like ten records or something. It wasn’t a lot.
And one of the first records I found was Lee
Perry. “Who is this guy here with the trench coat in the woods, with a
suitcase? This looks crazy.” I looked at the back and there was all these
crazy titles, “Acid Test” and whatnot, and I was like, “I’ve got to get
this record,” and I bought that and I think one other record by
LKJ, but I
took those records home and played them and was totally amazed at how crazy
and how different this stuff was. This is deep, you know. Jeff “Chairman” Mao At that point, is this when you began your DJing portion? Mario Caldato Jr. The band stuff died down and I ended up owning most of the equipment from the
band. Everybody would go broke and the guitar player, he would sell me his amp and
Mark would sell me the microphones and I ended up owning the PA and building a
PA. So I had a PA system and I started renting it out on the weekends, little
parties just from cassette tapes and turntables and it just escalated. I was
amazed, there was always someone calling up for something and I did a lot of
music researching, listening and learning. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So you had a little PA rental business going? Mario Caldato Jr. And eventually, I ended up collecting records and thought, Well, I might as
well play music while people are waiting for the bands to come on. I DJed
before, using mix tapes or with records if I had the turntables on hand and I
got to meet a lot of cool people. I did sound for a few clubs… Jeff “Chairman” Mao OK, there is one club night that might have been a very profound experience
for you. Do you want to describe when that happened and how that connected
with all the other things that you wind up doing? Mario Caldato Jr. There was one spot, a club that we frequented regularly called Power Tools,
which had a very arty New York vibe. A club with go-go dancers and live
musicians playing and weird art installations and people dressed up very
dramatic and stuff and it was at a very interesting place. We had all kinds of
celebrities coming down. This was ‘86. The club started in ‘85, but I
discovered it in almost ‘86, and I was just hanging out there every weekend
and the DJ was really incredible because he would play all genres and keep the
dancefloor moving. He had a musical knowledge and he knew how to mix stuff
from everything. Dance stuff, soul stuff, funk stuff, rock stuff, and make it
all work. He’d play even Sergio Mendes, Brazilian or Latin boogaloo stuff,
which no one was really playing and making it work like he was doing it. He
was friends with Andy Warhol and Basquiat and all these people would hang out
at his club and it was a really cool scene and he was very influential on a
lot of people who went there to hear his music and hang out. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Where was this in LA, what was the venue? Mario Caldato Jr. This was at the Park Plaza hotel across from MacArthur Park, which is a really
interesting area of downtown. The building itself had a staircase with two
ballrooms on each side, one on one side, one on the other, sometimes we used
both, and it was really incredible. At one time it was actually a Masonic
temple with all these crazy figures on the walls. It was just the perfect
atmosphere for a groovy club like that and I happened to be there one night in
particular where there was a vibe that something was going on, these rappers
were in town and were going to do something. Nobody knew, they were just
walking around and next thing you know, the DJ, he didn’t really talk, he
would just play music, but the music stops and these three rappers get up on
stage and it was the Beastie Boys. They didn’t have a record out, they just
had a single out, “Hold It Now, Hit
It” or something, and they were
in town, and the DJ was friends with them or had invited them up to do
something and they got up on stage and said, “We’re going to do a song.” And
people were like, “Wow, OK, this is cool,” and they grabbed the mics, and
tested the mics, and the DJs up there, DJ
Hurricane, testing out the
turntables, and they’re getting ready to drop the first record. He’s like
[makes scratching noise] and there’s the intro to the song and the roll, and
the first 808 that comes
on, boom, it just shuts down the whole PA and the guy’s like... [muffled voice] “Hello? Hello?”
The whole show gets sabotaged, literally. They didn’t have a sufficient
soundsystem and all this excitement, it was like, “What a bummer!” And
everybody was let down because they were really getting excited, like, “This
is going to be cool,” and they were let down and I was really bummed out about
it. So I was like, “OK, who is the owner here? I’ll go and talk to the guy.” I
went to a security guard and said, “Who’s the owner?” And he said, “That guy
over there.” I went over there and I spoke to the guy and said, “You need a
sound man,” and he said, “Tell me about it, I know.” He goes, “What do you
do?” I said, “I’m a soundman,” and I told him about it and he said, “Great,
can you come down next week?” So I said yes, ended up coming down the
following week and had a look at their equipment. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What did they have? Mario Caldato Jr. Or what they didn’t have. They had a little home stereo, a Marantz 50w amp powering four Cerwin Vegas in a club with like a thousand
people and it’s like, you can’t really do that. They were just barely making it,
and obviously with the band, where the dynamics are so loud, it just shut the
amp off. And I thought you need some power amps. So I showed up the following
week with some power amps and some crossovers and then got some sub woofers for
them. I got to meet the DJ, whose name was Matt
Dike, he was the head guy
there who really is responsible for a lot of things. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What was his reaction when you showed up? Mario Caldato Jr. He was thrilled. He was very embarrassed about the situation, about what had
happened with the soundsystem. He was cursing out the guy who had set it up,
but it wasn’t his fault. They were just under-equipped. And he was happy the
next week when he heard the soundsystem and everybody was like, “Wow, what did
you do? It’s amazing!” But I really brought it up to the next level of sound.
I had raised the speakers and taken them off the ground, you have to get
speakers up because everyone was dancing and it cuts off all the high
frequencies. I brought in some subwoofers, which was great because the go-go
dancers could dance on the subwoofers and they really loved it because they
were on top and everyone could check them out and they had bass on their feet
rattling. Jeff “Chairman” Mao A multiple use, really. Mario Caldato Jr. It escalated and from then on it went cool and my association with Matt
started and I would hang out with him in the DJ booth, which was a privilege
because nobody really got to hang out there. He had all his records there and
he was very particular of what was happening. Fab Five
Freddy was a good friend and these
guys would sleep at his house, Warhol and Basquiat and Fab Five Freddy,
because he is actually from New York originally. After a while, he was getting
a little tired of the DJ thing, he’d been doing it for years. He could move
the crowd and knew what records work and what breaks, he was really into the
breaks. Obviously, rap music was really developing and there was a lot of
sampling going on and he started to understand what was going on. He was like,
“Man, I gotta to do this. I really want to be a producer and make some
records and I can do it,” you know? And he made an attempt to record
his friend Kevin Dolan playing drums, have him play “Funky
Drummer” for like ten minutes on
this four-track cassette, just so that he can have a long break. One night he
brought the four-track to the club and said, “Can we hook this up to the mixer so
we can play it?” And I said, “Yeah, of course.” I rigged it for him and EQed it
a bit and gave it a little quick mix because he didn’t really have it mixed
right and then we cued it up. When the time was right we started it and played
it and he had the crowd moving, and nobody noticed that the record switched to
a cassette of the drummer, his friend playing drums. It was working, and he got
so happy he was like, “Wow, this is great! We’re making it.” I said, “Yeah. We could do
a lot more. I know how to record.” He was like, “Dude, I gotta do a record.” I was
like, “I already made a record, a 7".” He was like, “Man, really? I want to
start a label.” I was like, “OK,” and the next week he said, “I got a budget
of about five thousand dollars, what can we get?” He goes, “I need a sampler, I know what I
want to get.” At the time the
SP-12 was out, one of the first
sampling drum machines that all the hip-hop kids were using at the time. We
knew he wanted that and then I told him we could probably get an eight-track and
so we bought an eight-track Tascam 388, a mixer and recorder all in one, which was convenient and
practical for what we were using it for and it was within the budget. So we went and
got that and I set up the studio in his living room. I told him I had some
microphones and reverbs and delays and compressors and cabling and all that
stuff, and I hooked it up like a studio. He didn’t know what it was, he had a speaker here and a speaker
there and didn’t have the right cables. I laid it out and that was the
beginning of Delicious Vinyl,
his living room. Jeff “Chairman” Mao But he had a partner also, is that correct? Mario Caldato Jr. He did have a friend, Mike Ross, who was also a kind of DJ guy, who worked at
MCA, and was an assistant to an A&R guy. He would sit around and listen to
demo tapes all day and filter them out and give them to his boss. He would see
his boss and listen to stuff and he’d say, “This is crap.” There was a big
pile of stuff, he would go through the piles they didn’t use and would be
like, “Wow, this guy here…” They would have their name on what was back then a
cassette. They would write their name and phone number on it, their contacts,
and it was just right there, like Tone
Loc? Like, OK. Young
MC? Whoever their names were. “This
sounds pretty cool to me.” The guy had a deep voice, his demos were a cappella,
and the guys were like, “Maybe we can use these guys for something,” and he
showed them to Matt. And then Matt, within the first week he got a
drum machine, just locked himself away just pulling out all his break beats,
“Scorpio” and everything you can
imagine, he started looping up all the best parts that worked on the
dancefloor and started creating some grooves. He didn’t play, so his tools
were his turntables and his records and he would go and match the pitch and
figure stuff out and started mapping out songs every day, one or two songs.
After about a week or two, he had ten songs and it was like, “This is cool.” And his
friend showed up with the demo tapes, like, “Let’s try calling this guy up here and have
them maybe rap over one or two of these songs,” or something, and it basically
started off like that. Guys would show up and be like, “Hey, how about this
track?” We would play the track and would figure out a theme or something. One
of the first tracks we did with Loc was “Cheeba
Cheeba.” He liked to get his weed
on so that was an obvious first track for him to go off the dome, “Cheeba
Cheeba ya’ll,” and it went on from there. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Do you want to play something from then? You are engineering these records
while they are being recorded in Matt’s place, right? Mario Caldato Jr. This is Delicious Vinyl in the living room and it is basically stuff that was
done on an SP-12 at the beginning. There was a closet that I turned into a
vocal booth when it started, like, “This is perfect right here.” Pull out
everything and carpet it up and set up a mic and that is all we had, a
vocal booth and the living room and Matt’s musical ideas. It was literally a factory of stuff and this is, I guess, one of the big songs. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You want to play something from the Delicious Vinyl years? Mario Caldato Jr. This is one that kinda set it off for everyone. (music: Tone Loc – “Wild Thing”) Jeff “Chairman” Mao Tone Loc, ”Wild Thing.” You were describing how that little track was put together? Mario Caldato Jr. Yeah, Matt was figuring out the drum machine and on that one there, he just took
some beats from Bizzy B I think it was, the kicks and snares, and he found a Van
Halen riff. He was really inspired by
the whole Rick Rubin rap/rock kind of thing and I think he was trying to do that, emulate that kind
of vibe. And he brought a West Coast vibe to it, the Van Halen thing, like nobody would do
something like that, but he just used the intro and the little guitar hits. He
actually came up with the concept of the theme “Wild Thing.” He came up with
the concept, like, “We got to come up with something that is catchy.” He’d
seen Spike Lee’s movie She’s Gotta Have It, and they say
the “wild thing” in there, and he’s like, “That’s the hook right there, we got to do
that.” And we asked Young MC, who was a good lyrical writer, he could write
rhymes, he actually wrote the rhymes for “Wild Thing” and we told him the
concept. He went and wrote all these rhymes, and Loc didn’t really write any
of the rhymes on that one, but he was the perfect voice for it. It was just
finding the right combination to put things together. I didn’t think much of it
after we did it. I thought this is all right, and I wasn’t thinking it was
that great. But when you put it all together and you see the video that is what
set it off, and the timing of it too. And it does work on the dancefloor, I’ve
got to say. I still hear it nowadays, even though I live in Brazil now, I
hear it in the favelas, they sample that roll and the intro and his voice and
it still rocks. Who would imagine we mixed it in a little living room on a
minimal set up in a closet? Jeff “Chairman” Mao Did you want to play something else from the Delicious Vinyl years? Mario Caldato Jr. We worked on a lot of stuff. I guess I’ll move to Young MC, who was another
cat who happened to fall into the same category. We called him up and had him
sing. This guy had lyrics. I had to go and pick him up from USC
to bring him to the studio in my car and whatnot and he was always prepared.
He had a book of rhymes but didn’t really have any music, which is good, and
Matt and I provided all the music. This right here is just a mix of a bunch of
stuff. (music: Young MC – “Bust a
Move”) Young MC won a Grammy for that record. I guess, it was probably the second
year that they had a rap category. Jeff “Chairman” Mao These records were huge pop hits. I remember being in New York at the time, we
heard this sort of stuff and thought, “What the hell is this, man?” When you
were creating it and it was taking off, and I’m sure the perspective is quite
different in LA. I guess describe the feelings of seeing all this stuff take off. Was it like, this is great, this is exciting? Or were you thinking in terms of hip-hop
and different regions and perhaps backlash from people as well? Mario Caldato Jr. At that moment, we had no idea what was happening because when I started
working at Delicious Vinyl we were working on a bunch of things at the same
time, a bunch of different artists. We never knew what was going to take off. Obviously Loc was one of those first guys and Young and it happened really quick, within
six months, eight months, there was already a movement. Then, as soon as the
video came out, that was literally overnight. They started playing it on MTV
and started getting requests. Then, a week later all the national radios
picked it up, and when the national radios pick it up, it just blows up. He wasn’t even charting and then, all of a sudden, he enters the top 200. And after I think about a month or two, I think it went to No. 1 for one week.
It knocked off Paula Abdul, who was real hot at the time, and we knocked her
off for one week and it happened really quick. We were really excited and we
didn’t know what to expect and we thought the music was cool and different.
Obviously, it wasn’t as hard as the Beastie Boys and Public Enemy and LL Cool J and stuff like that, but that wasn’t the intention. Matt was really into a
dance vibe with obviously rap being the medium, but the music was groovier and
funkier and it worked. It got respect from the East Coast, eventually, when
they started listening to it and it was pretty cool and it got some crossover,
which really brought it into the mainstream. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So do you want to get into the Dust Brothers? Mario Caldato Jr. When we were making the records we were getting introduced to a lot of people.
Obviously, people started sending in demo tapes and whatnot, and we had, one of
the guys… They were promoting the stuff, sending it to radio stations, and they sent it to a college station, Claremont radio station, and two of these guys
E.Z. Mike and King Gizmo had a rap radio show and they were huge fans of Tone
Loc. Especially the very first single, the “Cheeba Cheeba” one that couldn’t be
played on regular radio because it was talking about weed. But they would play
it on their program. They had “The Dusted Hour” or something, and these guys
were very creative and they actually had their own demos and they passed that
on to the guy who was servicing them and bringing them records. This guy,
Orlando, he goes, “Here’s their demos, they sent it to you guys, you guys
should check them out,” and Matt heard the demo, we listened to it at the
studio and we were like, “Oh my God, these guys are on another level.” They
were really inspired by the Bomb
Squad and the whole Public Enemy
layers of samples and they had eight or ten samples going at the same time,
all synced up. Back then, we didn’t know how to do that, really. We were basically just
sampling on the fly and programming everything in a drum machine and hitting
play and starting it and letting it go. I already had the arrangement worked
out in the sequence. They had complex stuff playing, a bunch of things at the
same time, and we were like, “How can you do that?” We wanted to meet them. And their musical selection was really, really cool and we had the guys come down
to the studio and they explained to us, “This is how we do it. We use a
four-track cassette, we have a little box, a PPS-1 that lays
SMTPE on a track, it reads it
back so you can sync it up, you get a start tone…” We were like, “This is
crazy science.” We didn’t know about this stuff. And it really was because it
allowed you to go back, sync up to the same BPM at the same point. And then we
were like, “God, this is like a new invention.” Now you have endless
opportunities to go back and add stuff. And it was really science and the
broadest technology to us and we incorporated it and start using it in the
studio, and in return we let them use the studio to redo their songs and save
them bouncing everything down to three tracks because they only had a four-track
at their own studio. At this point we had upgraded the eight-track to the
16-track. I had made an investment and bought a 16-track so we had more tracks
to work with and they came and laid down 15 tracks of loops, everything
separate. We would listen to this and think, “This is incredible.” But we
didn’t know how to arrange it. So what we did, we would have continuous loops
and then we just did everything with the mutes, turning stuff on and off, that
was the old school way of arranging it. So we would just lay all these loops,
turn stuff on and off and make an arrangement and we made a couple of mixes
and the tracks turned out really, really cool. We didn’t know what to do with
them. None of the Delicious Vinyl rappers were really right for it. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Their vocals wouldn’t have sounded right on the Dust Brothers’ productions,
because there was too much going on in them? Mario Caldato Jr. On those particular tracks. But what we ended up doing was asking them to
finish off the Loc record. We had like eight tracks ready and we thought we needed
a couple more, so we asked them to produce three tracks. They came up with
three tracks for Loc, because they had Loc in mind, and they ended up doing “Cutting
Rhythms” and “Next Episode” and another one I can’t
remember. So they produced three songs on that record, which was their
introduction into working with Delicious Vinyl. And then they did a couple for
Young MC, they did two songs, they did “Know How” with the Shaft thing. They are actually
standout songs on those records because of their production on it. They taught
us a lot and it was a really good collaboration. Jeff “Chairman” Mao But it would become a situation where they wouldn’t just get an album track on
a Tone Loc or a Young MC album, but they got to do something pretty big
after that, wanna talk about taht? Mario Caldato Jr. The two tracks, the first two demo tracks they sent to us, the really hot ones
we didn’t know what to do with. Matt had the master plan. Well, he had heard
Beastie Boys had just got off their label, they were suing their manager, they
were suing their producer, they were leaving Def
Jam and going somewhere else.
And he was like, “We’ve got to do their record.” He wanted to do it and he needed help doing it, and so he
said, “We’ve got to do it, let’s send them these two songs.” So we get our
little contact, this skater kid Max Perlich, who was an actor and knew Ad-
Rock, something like that, he was
going to New York and we slipped him the tape. He went and got it to the guys
directly and they heard it, they heard these instrumental tracks and were
like, “What is this stuff?” They obviously loved Public Enemy, that was their label
mates, and they wanted to go to the next level and this was the next level to
them. “We want to come and meet you guys.” They planned to come out and they
came out to meet us at our studio at Delicious Vinyl. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Alright, so do you want to play one of the things that you guys wind up doing?
This is one of the instrumentals that were sent over? (music: Beastie Boys – “Shake Your
Rump”) Mario Caldato Jr. That’s a Dust Brothers production there. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So you are recording all this stuff? Mario Caldato Jr. I am engineering at this point on that track, yeah. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You guys are hearing this stuff and pretty much losing your minds, I imagine. Mario Caldato Jr. Everybody was just bugging,
like, “What in the heck is that?” There are so many things going on and it’s
madness, and that's what the Beasties were into. They liked the chaos of it
because it wasn’t predictable, it was funky and Latin beats and timbales and
crazy Moogs, the “Car Wash”
keyboard and
scratching and a lot of stuff put together. Jeff “Chairman” Mao They ran into sample clearance issues on their first record. So what happened
with this one because these had more samples, even on this one record alone? Mario Caldato Jr. This one here they went completely legit. They signed to Capitol and it was a
whole different thing. Obviously, they were popular, people were after them
and whatnot and they knew they had to cover their asses, so they cleared it and put all the
samples down and they literally spent between two, three-hundred thousand dollars just on sample
clearances, which is actually cheap because back then they were still
negotiating. People were like, “What? You want to give me five thousand dollars to use a
little bit of my record?” Nowadays people want a lot more. It was a lot, it
was huge. There were a few things they didn’t get cleared. They couldn’t find
the people they were just so obscure and hidden, it was impossible. People
still wonder about a couple things, but I’d say 95 percent, which is a lot, [was cleared]. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You were saying there was one particular session that was particularly
amusing? Mario Caldato Jr. The whole process of recording Paul’s
Boutique was an amazing ride because we were
still getting over the Loc and Young MC high and we were getting all this
attention and whatnot. Then the Beastie Boys come into town and were obviously very excited about
the songs. They did the two songs first and then said, “We have to make a
record immediately. We’re going to New York and will be back in a month. Get a
studio, get the best studio, get everything you need.” They spared no
expenses. So we went to the top studio, the Record Plant, spend
three thousand dollars a day. Since there was no instruments, we just had a huge room where they recorded drums and whatnot, and we
rented a ping-pong table, a pool table, air hockey, pinball and just filled it
up with junk that wasn’t music. Just so we could hang out and have fun, and
that was the environment, was to have fun. And all they had to do was do vocals, and
the Dust Brothers provided all the music. It was like two teams, we would be
there in the daytime laying down the tracks, they would show up at night and
be like, “OK, we got some lyrics,” and they would divvy up their lyrics and
decide what to do and work on a quick arrangement and laid it down. But there
was a lot of hanging out and playing ping-pong and whatnot. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Who was the best ping-pong player in the Beastie Boys? Mario Caldato Jr. Actually, no one was really good. The best guy was E.Z. Mike, he was the Dust
Brothers. The Beastie Boys, they didn’t have no game. They thought they could play
basketball, too, but the West Coast guys took them out. We would take them
out. Matt Dike could shoot. Mike D couldn’t dribble,
it was pretty funny back then. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Why could I guess that Mike D couldn’t dribble? Mario Caldato Jr. They got better. So it was a nine month process of hanging out in this big
expensive studio, ordering prime rib to go, crazy expensive dinners. We had a
dealer that made deliveries directly to the studio with ounces of weed, just
the most ridiculous things we could think of. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Capitol was like, “Yo, we got the Beastie Boys, they just sold millions and millions of
records, this is going to be amazing, a huge hit.” Mario Caldato Jr. They thought they had it for sure because the Beasties sold four or five million. It
was the first, biggest rap record, so Capitol gave them a budget and signed
them for a few millions. They had everything they wanted and they abused it.
They totally took it to the limit, ordering the runner to go out and buy dumb
things, shopping, everything, shoes, whatnot. It was all about fun and how ridiculous
and extravagant we can be with the music and with our time and what we were
doing. It got to the point towards the end, and we were getting down to the
last song and we saved this one song for last, and they told us we had to move
to this other studio because they were going to remodel one room. So we were
in a Neve room and we went to this other
SSL room, just a whole
different vibe, and we thought, “Well, let’s do that to this crazy song,” and
we thought this would be a cool one to do there. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So this is the product of that environment? Mario Caldato Jr. “Car Thief.” (music: Beastie Boys – “Car Thief” / applause) It was a night to remember. Jeff “Chairman” Mao OK, so how long was that night? Mario Caldato Jr. That night was just crazy and we couldn’t believe it. The next day we listened
to the track and were like, “Oh, I guess this is alright, it’s going to work.” We
were pretty faded. It was an experience, we were open, it was cool. Nobody got
addicted, nobody became a crackhead afterwards. It was a total experience. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So, you know, it’s totally cool to try it yourself, that’s the lesson we
learned. [laughter] Mario Caldato Jr. As long as you’re in the studio, a safe environment. Just don’t stand on the
console. Jeff “Chairman” Mao And do a bong hit before you try the crack. So you said that was nine months? Mario Caldato Jr. Nine months in the studio and then we finally had the baby. They had a big launch
on top of Capitol Records, on the roof, they had a release party and they even had
airplanes going by, write “Beastie Boys” in the sky. They took down the
Capitol flag and put up a Beastie Boys flag on top of the Capitol building.
That is how excited they were about it, and they had a New Orleans marching
band playing. Everything was just ridiculous, you couldn’t believe what was
going on. They really milked it and we had fun. It was an incredible moment.
And then the party kind of died a bit after the record came out. Well, two weeks
before the record came out, the Capitol president got fired and they moved the
whole staff and everybody. It was one of those big corporate moves and
everything changed, they didn’t know what to do, they didn’t want to work the
record. They did one single, “Hey Ladies,” and one video and it didn’t quite come off or have
the impact at the time. Everybody was expecting a... Jeff “Chairman” Mao Multi-million seller. Mario Caldato Jr. Well, expecting more
than the first record, Licensed To
Ill. It was only later that
people listened to the record and really appreciated it. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I guess it was a big disappointment for the company then? Mario Caldato Jr. Yes, it was big. They told us it had gone gold and they gave us gold records, but
it only sold three hundred thousand or something at the time. They didn’t really work it and
the guys didn’t tour. They had another deal to do another record, that was
guaranteed, so after that moment we all took a little time off and then
we kinda decided, “Let’s do something completely different on the next record. No
samples.” That was the intent at first, let’s do something completely different. Our
friendship was really strong at the time, after working for so long. We hung
out a lot and I go over to their house and Ad-Rock was always into messing
around and jamming, and he had a drum kit. He liked to play beats in his
apartment, the neighbors loved him, but he would be playing drums at home. We would be hanging out and those guys started to get the itch to make music and whatnot. I was like, “Instead of going into the studio and spending all that
money, why don’t we just make a little space?” I love home studios, I have
always had a home studio and feel comfortable and I think that’s a good
environment to work in as opposed to being in an expensive studio. And the
guys were like, “Yeah, that’s a good idea, we should do that.” At first we
just did some more jamming and we got inspired. My friend Money Mark would
show up once in a while. He always travels with a portable keyboard and
guitar, whatever he had on hand, and Ad-Rock and he would jam a little bit.
Then Yauch, who used to play bass in a band, he got into his Bad
Brains punk bass, fuzz bass and whatnot, and he would bring an amp over. Then Mike D, actually Mike D was
also a drummer, a drummer in a band, and he worked his way back into drums and
Ad-Rock switched over to guitar, although he is a better drummer to me. He
took the guitar spot and we were just kind of like jamming in an apartment and
the next thing you know the neighbors are like, “Shut up!” And we’re like,
“Oh fuck, this is cool. You know what? Let’s just go to a rehearsal place.” They rented
out a little rehearsal spot where 10 bands go and rehearse and you can hear
everybody jamming and we rented out one of those little rooms for a week and
we just went in there and start just jamming. I said, “Well, let me just bring a
DAT player, just for the hell of it, and record what these guys are doing. No
big deal, no pressure, let’s just capture the moment.” Laid down two mics,
just put them on the ground, a little portable DAT off to the side, hit record
and nobody knows what’s going on. Those guys just started jamming, just having
fun. Mark was leader, the musical guy because he was the most proficient on
his instrument and he would start a little groove. “OK, play in this key here,
G or A or whatever,” and the guys were like “OK,” and would just try to
groove. There was no pressure or nothing. Jeff “Chairman” Mao That is definitely reflected in the nature of the recording that followed. So
what happened with the studio, because you eventually got out of the rehearsal
space? Mario Caldato Jr. The rehearsal space served the purpose because it set the seed for a few songs
that ended up being on Check Your Head. There were a couple of grooves that turned out
pretty cool, like, “Whoa, this is kind of funky,” and for some reason a friend of
theirs, the son of Donovan Leitch, the
son of Donovan, the famous singer, had a club in Hollywood and said, “Would you guys come down and
jam at the club?” Asked the Beasties to come down and jam but not called the
Beasties, just come down and jam, and they were like, “Yeah, that would be
fun.” And this was the first time they would play together at this club and
they just showed up. Mike had a van, everybody just packed everything in just
like an old school band. Everybody just carried their equipment and they set up and they would
play instrumentals at the club and everyone was just ecstatic about it, the
vibe. “This is kind of cool,” you know? They got a little response from people
and thought, “Hey, we can do this.” So we really needed to find a space so we
can build a studio. And Mike D had just moved into this area with his
girlfriend. He was looking around his area and he found this place in Atwater Village, which is a perfect
place, it was an old community center, a place that somebody had turned into a
rehearsal space for bands. Jeff “Chairman” Mao This is the outer edge of Los Angeles. Mario Caldato Jr. Correct, by Los Feliz, heading into Glendale. It’s called Atwater Village, just a little town
vibe, just a main strip and this was the tallest building there. There was a
ballroom in the back and the guy rented it to us, and we said this is
perfect. There was one huge room, which is about like this [gestures to room he is in] with wood floor and it was half cylinder. It
had really crazy acoustics when you’re in the middle, you clapped your hands
and got multiple reverbs, which we thought was cool and funky, and we built a
small stage. There was two little rooms, so we tore out the wall and created a
big room for a control room. Mark was the carpenter so he had tools and just
cut a door and put in a window and a week later we had a studio. I told them
we just needed a 24-track machine and a board and we went out and purchased a two-inch tape machine and a console. I had everything else, the outboard and compressors. I
just set it all up so everything worked and the band equipment was set up on
the stage. Then we had this huge basketball area where we played basketball... in
the recording room. MCA decided to
build some skateboard ramps, as he got into skateboarding. It was like, “OK, why
not?” He took up half the court. And it was like a playhouse. It was kind of a school basically and we hung out. It kind of reminds me of the Academy
a bit and we had a bunch of people with ideas, and everyone brought in their ideas, and it was a clubhouse. We could only work at night because downstairs was
a drugstore, and they closed at six so we would start at six and could make
noise. We’d come in and play basketball and just hang out, sit till
everybody arrives and listen to music. We had turntables and we’d be DJing. We
were all record collectors and everybody was just digging back then. It was a
competition on who had the funkiest and rarest shit. We would be like, “Check
this out, check this out.” It was a good environment, everyone was turning everyone onto
different things. But the idea was to play. They would go and listen to the
Meters and would then
go and try and play the track. I had everything set up to record either on the
two-inch machine, all I had to do was hit play, and if they were just jamming around
and it didn’t sound that hot, I would just roll the DAT. That happened a lot.
Just capture the moments, and then they would come in and have a listen every
once in a while. “Hey, this is pretty neat.” And we just did that for three
years. We took a long time, and a lot of things happened in three years. One
guy made a movie, MCA went to India and Nepal and discovered Buddhism and
whatnot. Slowly everybody changes. We would come back after a few weeks of
taking a break and other ideas would come up. We were slowly collecting stuff.
Next thing you know, I had one hundred two-hour DATs of them jamming and ten
reels of songs, just jamming and ideas. We would go through and pick the best elements and keep narrowing it down. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So was it an editing process? Mario Caldato Jr. Editing out songs and picking out grooves. Obviously, some of the grooves were like
ten minutes long and we would go and just pick out a couple of bars sometimes
and create some songs out of looping or replaying them or adding on to the loops.
But it really started off musically, like the first half of the record, ten songs, were
playing. Then it got to the point where we had all these instrumental tracks
and we were like, “Well, you should maybe do a rap on something.” But nobody
wanted to do a rap. The first guy who stepped up to bat was MCA. He pulled me
aside and said, “I’ve got this idea, this Hendrix stuff that I really like.”
He put it together with a beat, and it was the “Jimmy
James” track. He was actually too
embarrassed to do it at the studio. So he called me up to come over to my
house — I had a little studio — and we demoed it up at the house. We both
had the samplers. We all had the same samplers, actually, and he brought the
discs over and I looped it up and timed it out for him and got it to work. We
came up with the instrumental and then he did a rough vocal over it and we
brought it back the next day to the studio and played it for the guys. The guys
were really excited and were like, “Man, I want to get on that.” And that
started up their enthusiasm of wanting to rap again because they really didn’t want to
rap after Paul’s Boutique. They were like, “Let’s just make an instrumental
record or something.” It slowly developed, like I said over three years.
Slowly, a track would show up, a month later another one and another one.
There was no hurry, no time [restrictions], the label never had a limit and
they never came down to listen to anything, which was great. I had no
pressure, it was a very fortunate situation. And I have never been in that
situation and probably never will, three years on payroll to produce
something. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Do you want to play something from Check Your Head that might be reflective
of that whole? Mario Caldato Jr. This is one of the songs from that actual first rehearsal place with the two
mics on the ground, where we took some elements and created a song out of it.
But the backing track, where there is drums, a keyboard, bass and another
keyboard and some live percussion and a little bit of guitar, is everybody
playing at the same time and it turned out to be a song on the record. And
this is how it turned out. (music: Beastie Boys – demo) That song was patched up from a two-track live and then we added a bunch of elements and
ran the voice through the
Leslies. They were embarrassed
to do vocals and stuff so Mark actually started off singing the vocals on there.
The only way those guys were singing, they were like, “If we sing on it, put
some effects.” So we ran it through the Leslie and they kinda sang together.
Then Ad-Rock decided to sing something and I actually sang the high part,
which was me mimicking Lee Perry on something that I had listened to at home.
I was like, “We need a high voice like this.” We actually had two studios. We
had the main studio and the B studio, which was a four-track. We would take a
cassette mix of the song so that we could work in there with a little bullshit
mic plugged in and we would work on the lyrics while somebody else was working
on something else. And I grabbed the mic and did, “You could go like this” [sings high note]
with some reverb and stuff. And the guys were like, “That’s great, that’s perfect, we’ll use it.” I was like, “Should I do it
again?” They said, “No, we’ll take it right off the cassette,” and we just
flew it in. It was all just duct taped together, all these little elements,
the laugh box. The part I really liked was the scratching that comes in and
that was a total accident. I had echoes on that channel the scratching was on
and it went to the echo and it was feeding back to itself, Jamaican-style. It
sounds like a helicopter coming in and it was just a wicked effect. We were
like, “Oh, man!” We couldn’t believe it. Those are happy things that come
together that are just cool. We were just impressed with that. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So you got a co-production credit? Mario Caldato Jr. That is correct. They put me down as a co-producer on the record and we had
stepped up from just engineering to throwing in elements and elements and helping to write
songs and helping to put the rap songs together. Jeff “Chairman” Mao And how long was the studio functioning? How many records did you guys do
there after Check Your Head? Mario Caldato Jr. After Check Your Head we did one other one, Ill
Communication.
After this record, it took so long we went on tour. We had some ideas together
when we came back and did the next record in six months, that was quick.
Everyone was excited and we were all confident and there were no issues and so we
focused and did it in six months. We spent one month in New York, the very
first month, we tracked some stuff like
“Sabotage” and a few other ones. It went really quick, and with the high of the first record, the second was
received a lot bigger and better and it went really well. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Do you want to play a taste of next record? So it took three years to do
Check Your Head but this one you knocked it out in six months. So the energy is slightly
different, I guess. Mario Caldato Jr. Very different, everyone was amped and ready and confident and had ideas and
was like, “Let’s just do it.” We really put together a good team and had a
percussionist, Eric
Bobo, who was introduced
to the group at the time and he contributed. We had this one track, which was the only one
that was different to all the other ones, kind of a rock track. And they
weren’t really trying to do rock. That was the furthest thing they wanted to
do. They wanted to stick to the funkier stuff. And this song stayed an
instrumental for a long time. Then towards the end of the record, we were just
about finishing, the last two weeks. We had attempted a couple of times to put
vocals on it and it didn’t sound right. And then Ad-Rock was like, “Let me try
it one more time to do it,” and two weeks before we finish the record and the song together and
put the vocals on it. But it almost didn’t make the record. But here it is. (music: Beastie Boys – “Sabotage” / applause) Jeff “Chairman” Mao So, this has a pretty heavy impact on the opening, just the way it comes in,
what was the difference? Mario Caldato Jr. Yauch was always loved that fuzz bass thing and they were horsing around and
try to play in a Bad Brains style. He got this riff on the bass and Bobo, our
percussionist, was very alert and was listening to it and he totally accented
it. And that marked the song right there. And as soon as we heard that, that
was it. Mark heard it and was like, “Mike, Mike, hurry up, get in there, just follow him,
just copy Bobo.” And he started doing it on the drums and it just kept
building the intensity of it. And when it finally drops they’re just droning
on one note, but it’s the intensity of it. And the vocals obviously really set it off.
Ad-Rock really gets into his high pitch and it works. It took a while to get
though, we tried it a few times, literally. That was a song I mixed it
instrumental because they didn’t have any vocals. So I went ahead and mixed it
and got it sounding as good as I could. When Ad wanted to do the vocals he
actually came to my house and I threw it on the DAT machine, on two tracks and then
added the two tracks for the vocals. Then, after he did the vocals, we did a
little scratch and some terminating scratching and sealed it up from the pre-mix that was made. It was just flying and we knocked it out. And obviously,
they made a video, which is really hilarious. Our friend Spike
Jonze did it, and it was just
perfect timing. When you hear the music and see the video they work really good. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Correct me if I’m wrong, I was smoking crack before I got here, but I heard
this story about somebody had heard “Sabotage”… Mario Caldato Jr. Oh, the owner of the studio from New York was this big rocker guy, this real
rocker dude. We were there for a month recording all this stuff and the moment
he heard that song he walked in and he goes, “That’s a record right there.” He
called it right there. I was into it. He was like, “That’s
what I’m talking about.” Everyone was like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah,” they didn’t
want to do the rock thing. But the owner of the studio, he called it and said, “That’s the shit right there.” And we knew this guy was Middle America and he
was right. It did work. They just didn’t know how to approach the vocal at the
time and was left it aside until the very end. His name was Chris and we
actually called the song “Chris Rock” until it became “Sabotage” in dedication
to the guy. Jeff “Chairman” Mao And at this point the guys started to take a little bit longer to do their records? Mario Caldato Jr. After this record had huge success and the other records, all the other
records became multi-platinum. The tour was going really well. They were
playing small places and ended up playing arenas by this tour. I toured with
them doing sound front-of-house, which is also really fun: Getting to hear the
songs in studios and playing it out live. We had a quad system. We rented the
Pink Floyd rig with the joystick and we just went off and took it to the
limits. And after all the touring and everything they took a little bit of a
break. One guy got married, another guy got married, they were taking some
time off and they could relax because it was a good couple of years run we had with
Check Your Head and Ill Communication. So it took us like four years before
we got back to do the next record and I started having to branch off. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So what did you do to occupy yourself then at that point? Mario Caldato Jr. By then, luckily these records did very well, and a lot of people read
the back of the records and saw my name. I was on the back of a couple of
million records. People were like, “Oh, I love that record, we love that sound.”
Check Your Head inspired a lot of bands and they wanted that sound and
wanted me to work on their record. I started getting calls. The first calls,
the hook-ups were through the management. The Beastie Boys’ manager, he also
managed Beck, so he sent Beck down to the studio and Beck wanted to do
something. He said, “Just go down to the Beasties’ studios. Mario, he’ll take
care of you.” He showed up at the studio and was like, “Someone said that I can
record some stuff here.” Oh, great, and we worked on a few tracks,
seven tracks. He ended up using one track on the
Odelay record and a few
others on B-sides. So I got to work with him and on the road we worked with
Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. They really liked the sound and the guys were
like, “We’re going to roll through town,” and they came in and wanted to use
the studio. I was like the chief engineer and they asked me to work on their
stuff with them. Then bands from Japan loved the sound, wanted to come by and
use our studio. I started getting calls luckily from the
Beasties. So it was a big thing, you know. Most people found me, looked me up through
the management and I started to work with a lot of different artists. Money
Mark also went ahead and did his first solo record and I helped him a little
bit on that, on the first one. Then he made a second one and I helped him a
lot more on the second one. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Was there any kind of adjustment for yourself, working in a pretty unique
situation with the Beasties, where you guys really knew each other well, to
sort of freelancing, essentially? Doing stuff for people you don’t have the
same relationship with? Mario Caldato Jr. Like I said, it started off gradually within the family with Beck and also DJ
Hurricane. The Beastie Boys at that point decided they wanted to start their own label. The Grand
Royal label thinking they
could do Delicious Vinyl and make their own things. It was a good idea on
paper, but it didn’t actually pan out that well. They had a few interesting
acts, the first record that was on there was actually Hurricane. That came because Hurricane wasn’t really
part of the recording process of the Beastie Boys and they said, “Well, we’ll
give you a deal. We’ll get your record and put out your record.” So I produced
the first record with Hurricane and we went in and knocked it out within a
month. We weren’t messing around, we knew he had ideas and I had ideas and it
was just me and him. That came out pretty good. It was well received and did
well, and then there was a couple of other punk rock things. Ad-Rock wanted to
do a punk rock band, and we were just utilising the studio. So I did the punk
rock band and members of a rock band called me to work with them and I liked
the band. I went and heard Mother Tongue and produced them, slowly escalating. Also, Mark ended up making a track with Los
Lobos. We did a funky track
for some compilation and they loved it and wanted to play on it. So I got to
meet them and it turned out so well that they invited me like, “Hey, we’re
going to do a song with John Lee Hooker, do you want to produce it?” “Yes, of course.” I got to do a session with John Lee Hooker and Los
Lobos, which is obviously amazing, a thrill to work with a blues legend. He is
the man, you know, literally. It was these opportunities that I had that were
definitely great to be a part of and I’m really thankful for that. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Do you want to play something that you feel particularly good about from some
of this extra work that you did? Mario Caldato Jr. I’ll play one song from Mark’s record. Mark is a very eclectic person and does
a lot of recordings himself starting from home. He is a genius. We had a lot
of fun making his record, the second record, “Push the
Button.” With
this one song it was really cool, which is on a whole different tip: it is
live, everybody playing at the same time in my living room at my house, my old
house. It’s a piano, vibes, Al McKibbon on acoustic bass, an amazing guy who played with Cal Tjader, Bobo on
percussion and I had a friend Rocco on drums and I think that’s it. But here
it is. I just really like the way it sounded and I recorded it on an 8-track,
an A-DAT in fact with
Telefunken preamps. It was just
pretty simple but everyone playing together. It just sounded really nice and
we overdubbed the synthesizers. (music: Money Mark, Al McKibben, Eric Bobo, Rocco, Mario Caldato Jr. – live jam / applause) Not bad for live. Jeff “Chairman” Mao All the way live. Mario Caldato Jr. Which is at that point, bringing it back to the home recording is my favorite
thing to do, really. They were really good musicians there and I really
enjoyed that aspect. The Beasties was fun in a different way because it was
just the innocence of the playing. They weren’t really great musicians, but
the ideas were good behind it and the feeling. But it is definitely nice when
you have musicians who really know what they are doing and have fun. The
environment is cool, everybody enjoys it and that is something that I continue
doing, working in a small environment as much as possible. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So you live in Brazil now, when did you move to Brazil? Mario Caldato Jr. About four years ago. My wife convinced me to go back and spend some time
there and we decided it was a good thing for our family. We’ve got a couple
girls. Just to live there and hang out and check out the country which I was
born in. I don’t know much about it and I’ve started to understand it a bit
and appreciate all the good things it has to offer. But it is very
interesting, very cool, very beautiful place, good people. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You’ve also been able to record some stuff while you’re there? Mario Caldato Jr. My studio is still in Los Angeles. My studio equipment is all in my living
room, and I go there every few months to work but I have been pretty busy in
Brazil doing lots of stuff. The last tour I worked with the Beasties they
ended in South America, first-time they ever played in Brazil, and that was
what brought me back the first time. Back in, I think 1996, and I hadn’t been there
since I was ten or something. One of the bands that opened up for us asked me
to produce them and I came back later that year and produced them. And it kind
of started my relationship with Brazil and Brazilian artists and it just grew
from there. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Do you want to play something from your Brazilian recordings? Mario Caldato Jr. Sure. I’ll play a track from a good friend of mine, Marcelo
D2, he was in this band called
Planet Hemp, which is kind of a
very Beastie-inspired kind of band. They did rock, rap and funky jams and everything else in between. I did a few records with them and then he went
solo and worked more on the hip-hop, Brazilian hip-hop. This is from his
second record and it was really a cool mix. (music: Marcelo D2 – unknown / applause) Jeff “Chairman” Mao Is your approach different at all doing stuff down there as opposed to what you were doing before? Mario Caldato Jr. Hip-hop stuff is inspired from records and grooves, so the beats are kind of
the same. It’s just the samples instead of being funk and soul records are
bossa nova records and groovy Brazilian music, samba and whatnot. It’s great,
hip-hop is universal and is everywhere you go. You have Japanese hip-hop,
Brazilian hip-hop and Irish hip-hop, just whatever, it works. It’s the beat
that keeps it together and you can bring whatever elements, bagpipes, and it’s all good. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Do you feel like a hip-hop guy? Mario Caldato Jr. I do. I happen to fit in the groovy hip-hop category, not the hardcore
category. I think it is a cool thing to be a part of and I’m really happy that
the artists I have worked with have crossed over a lot of different ways,
which is what music is all about: Crossing over and bridging stuff and
different generations. Taking old elements, and new elements, the best of both
and putting them together in a musical way. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Just a couple of other folks you want to mention that you’ve also worked with, so people get an idea of the range of it? Mario Caldato Jr. The Brazilian stuff. I was fortunate to work with a whole bunch of bands:
Molotov of Mexico, Day
One from the UK, which I
really like. I also hooked up with Jack Johnson, which was a very wonderful
experience. He was a guy who did a record, that, when it first came out didn’t get very much
response, and then after 9/11 or something, people kind of got conscious. Someone
on a record label heard his lyrics and stuff and thought this guy is pretty
cool and they put him out on a major and he had some success. His manager
called me to do a remix of a song and I was like, “Yeah, sure.” And I heard
this song and the guy sent me the tracks and it was all live, playing live. I
thought it was a little tricky to do the remix as I would have to have a
musician come in and play, so I said, “Why don’t you guys just come down and
do a remake of the song?” So we recorded at the house and he came over and we
set it up in a living room and the bedroom, the vocals and guitar. He was really
comfortable and he really enjoyed it and liked it and the remix is cool. I
added some vibes and stuff and it was pretty cool. And he asked me, he goes, “You know, I
want to do my next record. I want you to do it.” And I said, “Sure, that would
be great.” He said, “I want to record it like this, though. I like this vibe.”
He was going to buy a house and he said, “I want to buy a house, build a studio.”
He said, “If I go and buy a house, will you have a look at it and tell me if
we can build a studio?” I said, “Sure.” He said, “It’s in Hawaii though,” and I said, “I’m going to Hawaii next month.” So I went to Hawaii and went to go check out the garage and said,
“This is it right here, this is perfect.” His brother was a contractor so
he drew up the plans and my friend helped me design the control room. He built
a control room, and it’s a total homely vibe with a garage and a little studio.
We did his record, the second record On and
On and his
third record there. And
those records did really incredibly well. They had incredible exposure, people
were listening to organic music, acoustic guitar, bass and drums. He was
getting mainstream attention, which was really, really great and it was very successful. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Do you want to share a little taste of something from that and then we will
open things up a little bit for questions? (music: Jack Johnson – “Traffic In the Sky”) Mario Caldato Jr. Jack has an amazing voice. He played that song for me on just an acoustic
guitar before we started recording. He was just like, “Check out this song,
see what you think of it.” He just played and sang it and it was so deep, I
said, “That is amazing.” The lyrics and everything, and he explained what the
song is about and I said, “That is the real deal right there.” The guitar and
the voice and he laid it down. It was the easiest project to work on. It was so simple, the elements, the song, the simplicity and his voice, it was incredible, a pleasure to work with him. He’s a great guy. Audience Member How did the collaboration with
Q-Tip on “Get It
Together” come about? Mario Caldato Jr. He was a friend of the band, a New York cat, and whenever the New York cats rolled
into town they would call up the Beasties and hang out. They knew we had a
studio, Biz Markie was also always
around and rolled by the studio, and Q-Tip, we were trying to play him some stuff,
like, “We’ve got these tracks here and they’ve got no vocals. What do you
think?” He heard that one track, the “Get It Together” one, which was actually
the only one that Mike D had put together. He had found that one and sampled
the beat and put a beat and loop together, and he said, “This one here is
good, this one’s dope.” We put him in the control room, everything was
handheld… That is another thing on Check Your Head, all the vocals were
handheld, most of them were SM-58s
with the guys cupping the mic. A lot of times I had a bullshit mic that we called a
karaoke mic. A Sony variety karaoke mic, $29, that I bought in Little Tokyo that is amazing. It has pitch and you can octave to high and low and all these
effects, and it had perfect distortion on it. So “What’Cha Want” is an example
of that microphone. That’s no preamp, just the microphone directly into the
console. We would plug it in, Q-Tip grabbed the mic and he just, “One-two,
one-two…,” went off the top of his head. It was all off the top of his head.
He ad-libbed it, and in three minutes did a take and then another track. We
did another take and then out of the two tracks we muted out all the parts
that we didn’t like and we only kept the parts we liked. Then we mapped out the
song and the guys did the lyrics in between. They took whatever his rhyme was,
and then Ad-Rock would respond, and we knew what the next rhyme was already so
he would end a rhyme and connect them. Then Mike D would come in, and it was a
puzzle. We put it together and fill in the blanks basically. Audience Member How did he feel about the muting of Q-Tip’s voice? Mario Caldato Jr. That is how we worked. It was all about turning stuff on and off. I had a
little MIDI mute that remembered all the mutes and the automation so that was
helpful. And we would just turn it on and off and it would just play it back that
way. Audience Member That’s a crazy track, man. Audience Member I got a few questions, actually. You said that “Wild Thing” was recorded in a
closet. What kind of mic did you use to get Tone to sound like that in the
closet? Mario Caldato Jr. A Sennheiser 421, the black dynamic
microphone. It was the best mic I had at the time and I just mounted it inside
the vocal thing with one of those arms, because there was no room. It was literally a chair
and he had to sit there with their headphones and that was it. It was a
dynamic mic, so it took a lot of sound pressure and it worked. It’s a good
rap mic, actually we used for the Beasties on Hello
Nasty. Russell Elevado You have been a big influence for me. I was listening to the Beasties when I was
doing stuff with Voodoo and the Roots and I just wanted to thank
you for paving the way. I’m going to pick your brain later on as well, I am
not done with you yet. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Well, let’s all, in addition to Russ, thank Mr. Mario Caldato for being here.

Title: Martyn Ware

Martyn Ware
Martyn Ware has long been at the razor-sharp edge of electronic music, both as a founder and member of seminal bands like The Human League and, more lately, through his eye-widening, ear-enlivening explorations into sound design and sonic art. This is a man who helped shape the careers of numerous artists and is responsible for plenty of tracks you can place at their first beat, from Tina Turner to Terence Trent D’Arby.
In this lecture at the 2007 Red Bull Music Academy, Ware recalled sneaking into gigs, discovering synths and the importance of making mistakes.
Hosted by Emma Warren We’re very lucky today to have Martyn Ware on the couch. [applause] Martyn Ware Thank you. Emma Warren As you all probably know, Martyn was a founding member of Human
League, did the first two
albums, then went on to form Heaven 17 and B.E.F., AKA the British Electronic Foundation... Martyn Ware …Electric Foundation. Emma Warren …Electric Foundation, producing whole swathes of artists from Tina Turner to
Terence Trent D’Arby via… Martyn Ware Chaka Kahn, Billy Preston Emma Warren Mavis Staples, a whole heap of people. So I thought an interesting starting
point would just be the observation that your whole career has been about, or
seems to be, about avoiding nostalgia. Do you think that’s a good starting
point for an artist? Martyn Ware I started out as a futurist, I suppose, is the way to put it. And in those
days that used to be a fashion statement in Sheffield, where I grew up. There
wasn’t much about the present that was worth having, to be honest, so the
future was always where we wanted to be. And, as I kept saying in another
interview yesterday, the whole point being that I was stuck in a town of half
a million people, where all the industry had been destroyed by Thatcher’s
Britain, basically. There used to be 80.000 people working in the steelworks
and it dropped to 10.000 in five years. And there’s all these people
unemployed in quite a miserable place, but there’s quite a resilient attitude
in Sheffield people. So there was lots of spare capacity in terms of
warehouses and small factories that they couldn’t give away, so there were
lots of bands going: “Go on, I’ll give you a fiver a month to rehearse there.”
So everybody, rather than going out and seeing great things like you can do in
London if you live there now, everybody had to make their own entertainment. Emma Warren So when you say everybody, who else are you talking about? Martyn Ware At that time, there was a scene with Cabaret Voltaire, who were our mentors,
really. Bands like Clock DVA,
obviously I formed the Human League around that time, there were also bands
like Def Leppard, believe it or not. Their first ever gig and our first ever
gig were at this small club in Sheffield. We just laughed at them because we
thought they were ludicrous and very old-fashioned and they went on to sell 25
million albums, so what do I know? Emma Warren I think your figure’s quite high as well, though? How many albums have you sold? Martyn Ware Only as a producer, though. Heaven 17 never sold anything like that. Human League now do, or did, with Dare. But the thing is
there’s a resilience about that environment, that working class urban environment, that makes you want to go out and do shit rather than just go to concerts and watch people and kind of go: “Oh well, you know, I can’t be
bothered sitting in a rehearsal room all week.” Actually, that’s the only
thing there was to do in Sheffield at that time. Emma Warren A lot of people are aware of post-punk, a lot of the band’s that came out of
the North of England at that time in the post-punk explosion, but there was
also a really important avantgarde element to what people were doing, but what
about the influence of Northern soul? Martyn Ware Sheffield’s a very soul city, really. The two major driving forces in
Sheffield, musically, were soul, and by that I mean Northern soul, which for
you people who don’t understand is a different kind of soul, it’s more dance-
orientated. To be honest, the original all-nighters were all Northern soul
events. People used to take a giant amount of amphetamines and take a box of
7” singles and go and swap singles, rare soul singles from America, in these
grimey Northern towns. It’s quite interesting, really. America symbolized glamour and escapism from this reality we were stuck in. So soul was an
important thing and glam generally, Sheffield was always a big town for bands
like Roxy Music, David Bowie and
even things like the American influence in terms of glam, things like the New York
Dolls, bands like Suicide, that kind of grimey
glam. I can’t really describe it but it was always very kind of appealing to the soul of Sheffield’s young people, you know? Emma Warren One of the bands you were talking about there, Roxy Music specifically, you went to see them quite a few times live, didn’t you? Martyn Ware Me and my friends were kind of cheats, really. We forged students union cards,
we weren’t students. We actually had to go and work because our families were very poor. But we forged these students union cards and got into all these free gigs that were at Sheffield University. Sheffield’s got 40.000 students, it’s a big student town. So before Roxy Music actually released their first
single, we saw Roxy Music with Brian Eno three times in Sheffield for free, it was fantastic. In fact, I remember going to one free gig, where on the same gig, it was a daylong festival, there was Roxy Music who were the
kind of headline act, there was Gary Glitter, believe it or not, there was Ian Dury & The Blockheads before anybody had released any singles of theirs or anything. There was Dire
Straits who were appalling and very boring and people like Doctors Of Madness, I don’t know if you remember them? Before your time, everybody’s time. The interesting thing was it was all for free so the young people of Sheffield could dig this kind of eclecticism. In fact, my career is all about eclecticism and trying to merge together lots of unexpected counterpoints in
terms of creativity. Emma Warren Had you seen or experienced or been exposed to synthesizers in music before you saw Roxy Music? Martyn Ware I was kind of obsessed with synthesizers since “Good Vibrations”, to be honest. When
I was about eight or nine years old, I suppose, when that record came out and
like every other teenager at that time. In Europe we used to listen to Radio
Luxembourg. It was the only radio station that played interesting music and kind of brand new ideas and that was the peak time of Motown as well. So all those Motown records that incorporated synthesis, very early synthesis,
theremins, stuff like that, it was always stuff that made my ears kind of prick up and I
never thought in a thousand years that I’d make a career out of it, to be honest. I had no musical training, it was just something that appealed to me a great deal. Then I always followed bands that had synthesizers in them, it was just always something that interested me. Then it got to the point of, I was a computer operator, actually. I had a spare bit of money for the first time in my life and it was either learn to drive or buy a synthesizer because they
were just cheap enough to buy at that point. So I went to the local guitar store that had just got the first entry-level synthesizer in there. They were all rock dudes, they didn’t know anything about synthesizers, they thought we were gay because we wanted to buy a synthesizer and not want to play “Stairway
To Heaven” interminably in the store. So we overrode that indifference and bought synthesizers. Ian Marsh, who was also in Heaven 17, bought a synthesizer and we just started messing around really with – and this is the important thing – it wasn’t like: “Let’s get rich and be a pop
star,” which is the primary impetus nowadays for a lot of kids because they see the American Idol or whatever. We had no idea that it was possible. It’s very hard to comprehend, that wasn’t in the air. Basically, in those days, again, we used to blag our way into the City Hall for free in Sheffield, pretend we were part of security, then disappear off into the crowd and watch T-Rex and all the big progressive acts, like King Crimson. Emma Warren So you had a number of good blagging techniques? Martyn Ware We had no money so it makes you quite creative, yeah. Emma Warren This first synth that you bought, what was it? Martyn Ware It was a Korg 700S, which will mean nothing to most of you whatsoever, but it was quite funny, really. It was like a three-and-a-half octave keyboard, monophonic so you could only
play one note at a time, no MIDI, some very severe filters on the front. Resonated filters, which were really cool so you could make sounds like cats dying and things like that. Very little in terms of presets, there were no presets, digital presets. Every button had one function, that was it. So basically, whenever we started doing some kind of performance we had to write down every setting for every knob on everything and change it between every number. You know, the interesting thing is that the mistakes make it
interesting. I know this isn’t something we’d decided to talk about but I should give you an insight into the creative process at that time, because the only recording equipment we had was a reel-to-reel recorder, two track. We
didn’t have a mixing desk, no equalisation, no effects, apart from the ones built in to the synthesizers. And yet, we managed to... By bouncing from track to track and adding a new instrument each time, create our first single, what turned out to be our first single, “Being Boiled”. Literally, all we had was two synthesizers, a tape recorder and a microphone and that was it. I think about two months later we managed to blag some guitar pedals to try and
distort the sound a bit, change it but that was it. And we did “Being Boiled”, which I’ll play for you in a second, actually. I think this is a good time to do it. That was very smooth, wasn’t it? I should be on television. I am! That cost about £3 to make that record. We made it in one of these disused small factories where they used to make cutlery. It was absolutely filthy, had a partially working toilet, it was the filthiest place you could imagine. To soundproof it, you know the trays that apples come in we just got them from
the local greengrocers and put them all over the walls to dampen it down a bit. So we made this record, somebody from Fast Records, which was an independent record label at the time, post-punk, and all the rest of their bands were like punk bands, and the guy who sent it up there for us was also in a band, 2.3 from Sheffield, he said: “I said to Bob Lester he might like it, you know?” And I’m going: “Yeah, sure.” So this very bad copy we copied onto an even worse cassette, sent it up there, he loved it, we made the single cover artwork ourself. We were always intent on keeping control of all aspects of the production and released it, thinking, “Maybe 20 members of our immediate
family would buy it and some friends,” and within three months I think it had sold 5.000 by word of mouth. During that time John Peel, anybody who knows London, right, Britain, [John Peel] very influential in terms of what he played
in terms of the new stuff that came out, and he fell in love with it, played it two or three times a week. And I can honestly say, god rest his soul, our career probably wouldn’t have happened had it not been for John Peel. And I think probably 50 or 60 other bands could say the same thing. Emma Warren More like probably 500? Martyn Ware Yeah. I do think what he did in particular was give people the confidence that they could actually be one of these superstar bands, like Emerson, Lake and Palmer. We couldn’t afford to trash a B3 every night in a gig, we had no money and we weren’t classically trained. I
mean, to this day I’m an appalling keyboard player, but I’ve got it up there, I can contextualize melodies and counterpoint and chord sequences, but I get somebody else to play them. I’m being a bit naughty, I do play them, but really I’m not a good musician in that respect. Emma Warren It’d be great to actually hear it now you’ve talked it through and heard how
you made it and we can talk about the really minimal equipment that you used… Martyn Ware I’m cheating a little bit here because we did a slightly improved version for
the second Human League album, but it’s not that far different from the
original. (music: The Human League - “Being Boiled” / applause) The interesting thing about that is, I’ve just told you that I can’t really play keyboards and all that brass work there I had to play at half speed. Actually, I learnt an awful lot from Frank Zappa because he used to do that a lot, “Peaches en Regalia” is one of my favourite tunes of all time. ”I’ll stay in this same key and it’ll be fine and I’ll just move around really fast and we’ll see what it sounds like when you speed it
up.“ I do a lot of lecturing in different places and I’m always telling people, younger than you: “Accidents are important. Mistakes are important because that’s how you get interesting stuff out.” The problem with
contemporary sequencing programmes is that they actually work it all out for you pretty much. Everything’s quantised, everything’s nice and smooth, it all locks together, yadda yadda yadda. And what you end up with is something less exciting than if you’d played it for real a lot of the time, however crap you are, like I am. So keep experimenting every day, keep pushing yourself every day in interesting ways. And actually, what happened for us, we ended up sounding like we came from Mars at that time, to be honest. It still sounds
pretty strange to me now, but we were very influenced by diverse influences. Obviously, things like Kraftwerk were important to us, a lot of German bands like
Can and Neu!, Faust, but also
Funkadelic-Parliament, Bernie Worrell. The biggest compliment that my manager ever said to me when we signed was that I sounded like Bernie Worrell. And I’m going: “Yeah, I’ve made it, that’s it. I can stop now.” The important lesson from this period is that I’m a big believer in limited canvas. And
therefore, an unlimited canvas when you’re creating stuff nowadays, I switch on Logic Pro at home and I’ve got a gazillion samples to pick from. Even if I only use the built-in synthesizers, they’ve all got three hundred presets each and you’re never encouraged to make stuff up yourself. On that record, every single item was handmade, the kickdrum, the snare, it was all made from raw electronic materials from scratch. There were no samples, there were no samplers at that point. The baby had been thrown out with the bathwater to a large extent, and I’m as guilty as anyone. Nowadays, the time pressure and the cost pressure is such that you just want to get some shit happening as quickly as possible and you end up with something that’s not as good because you don’t spend as much time on it. So spend some time, experiment. All the time, keep that in the front of your mind. Emma Warren What do you think about the electro pop revival in the last couple of years? Martyn Ware There’s not a lot of it I like, to be honest. Things like Fischerspooner, hmm, you know? Maybe live, I don’t know I’ve not seen them live. Ladytron, rubbish, in my opinion. I often think if Heaven 17 and the Human League were their own tribute band, we’d make more money nowadays. It’s a very strange world we’re in, we’re in the “pop-will-eat-itself” phase of popular music now at the
moment. I’m all for acknowledging your influences but you have to keep pushing it forward. A lot of these are from a brand new generation, who really genuinely love the original source material so I’m not knocking it, but they
don’t seem to make much of an effort to me, like they’ve just taken the top
20% veneer of what its about and not really looked at a what the content’s about. Emma Warren It’d be interesting now to listen to something else that kind of comes from the early period of you making music? What about “Almost Medieval”? Can we have a listen
to that and then you can talk a bit about the record? Martyn Ware I’ll tell you a little bit before, actually. When we made Reproduction, which was our first album for Virgin, we were still really raw kids. We did most of it in our studio in Sheffield and then came to mix it and overdub in London and we couldn’t believe it, people paid for us to stay in this studio.We could have as many BLTs as we wanted at any time day or night and like, “Oh
my god.” And we were kind of overawed by the whole thing but the thing is we were very influenced by punk. The energy of punk, not necessarily “rock & roll,” because, to be honest, I thought we’d been through it in Sheffield in
particular, we were very into people like New York Dolls. Sorry, punk was just was of New York Dolls as far as I’m concerned but from a more English perspective. So we wanted to make lots of punky sounding electronic music as well as a tribute to that so this is our attempt. And we just remastered this last year. It sounded pretty unlike how we wanted on the original CD and we got the chance to remaster it last year and it actually sounds pretty good now, I think. So have a quick listen to this. Starts with a ticking clock. Very strange subject matter this track, actually. It was inspired by a Phillip K. Dick book called Counter Clock World at that time, about moving backwards. I’ll talk to you about it afterwards. (music: The Human League - “Almost Medieval” / applause_) I don’t know why they’re swapping all the mics round. It’s quite good though,
maybe every ten minutes you have to change them? That was influenced by two
things. One is science fiction. Everything we did at that time was about a
kind of narrative sense and using the literature as an inspiration for lyrics.
And I think that’s another thing that’s kind of dropped off the radar a little
bit on contemporary composition. There are some exceptions, of course, but I
think it’s quite interesting to come into your compositional world with a bit of an idea. It might be a magazine article, it might be a book that you’re reading, it might be a central premise from an Outer Limits episode. That’s where we were at that point and it’s only when the ideas run out after a few years that you start writing songs about love. That’s what everybody does now, it’s like: “Oh god, personal experience. OK, naval gazing, what a terrible time I’ve got because I’m a student and I’ve got no money.” I hate those
bands, to be honest. I can’t bear that kind of lyrical laziness. Find something that’s going to interest your audience and try and keep them on their toes a bit. That’s the way I think about it. Emma Warren You’ve always been connected with art and literature and almost intellectual
ideas. But there’s such a strong anti-intellectual idea in popular music that
at time that must have required you to kind of stand up for what you believe. Martyn Ware The thing is, there’s always a bit of a cheeky monkey thing going on as well so we’d line it up with a little bit of humour as well, so it’s playful. It’s a continual theme in the work that I’ve done throughout the years. Also, I didn’t go to university, Philip [Oakey] didn’t go to university, Ian [Craig Marsh] didn’t. In fact, none of us finished our A Levels, to be honest,
which is like, I don’t know what the equivalent is in America but we didn’t
finish college. Emma Warren So what age did you finish school? Martyn Ware 16, really. Phillip’s parents weren’t poor but Ian’s and mine were very poor so we had to go out and earn money for the family. So consequently we didn’t have that kind of, “Oh, aren’t we Percy Bysshe Shelly, we just read these latest books and all that stuff.” To us, learning is a continual process while
we’re doing other stuff and we were fascinated with dada and stuff as well, that was all part of our everyday existence because it seemed to relate more to living in Sheffield than the kind of romantic notions of literature. Emma Warren So would you say you were almost politically interested in art? Martyn Ware Yeah. Derrida and all that stuff. It’s funny because I met Scritti Politti, Green [Gartside], and made a record with him, several records actually, and he started out as a big fan of politics at university and turned into being a musician. So your influence for being creative can be very different from just, “Yeah, I want to be a DJ,” you know? Because, to be honest with you, so does everybody else. So it’s quite good to find something that’s in addition
to that. I was a DJ as well, by the way. Emma Warren Early days? Martyn Ware I had a mobile discothèque. A proper mobile party. I did weddings as well as trendy parties. It was called Blitz Queen. Emma Warren Did you have flashing lights as well? Martyn Ware Yep, flashing lights on the front of my rig. 50 quid from Maplins. Emma Warren When was that? Martyn Ware That was in 1972. I’ve not told anybody that, actually. I feel exposed now. Emma Warren It’s great. I’ve always been quite fascinated by people who do that because you learn a lot about pop music? Martyn Ware I’m telling you. It’s another point we were discussing yesterday, another thing that runs through everything, because I’m a socialist, I believe in social values. Sheffield is regarded as the Socialist Republic of South
Yorkshire, big Labour-voting leftwing area of town. I believe in socialist values, I believe that you shouldn’t speak directly just to your particular niche and it’s something that has accompanied me on my journey throughout my
career, really. I like populist stuff. I like really good pop music in every
sense. Emma Warren So who else do you think makes really good pop music? Martyn Ware I like hip-hop and R&B quite a lot. At least there’s a sense of daring about it. There’s a bit of an excitement about what new ideas are going to come out next and I really like that. In terms of more ersatz pop music
we’ve got nowadays, the Gnarls Barkley record was fantastic. I think it was one of the best songs written for a long time,
“Crazy.” There are a few great bands knocking about but in terms of solo artists, I’m still in love with David Bowie so you’re asking the wrong person. Emma Warren So in terms of the Human League, you did the first two albums and then left
and started Heaven 17, did you very much want to make pop music? Martyn Ware When we left the Human League it was an acrimonious split. They tried to throw
me out of my own band, it was a bit like the School Of Rock with me as Jack Black. I
said: “You can’t throw me out of my own band, I’m going to prove you all
wrong.” And one of the things that Philip very cruelly said to me was: “You’re
the unaesthetic part of the band.” Ouch! And I was pretty unaesthetic at the
time, I had a beard. So I went: “Right, we’re going to be ultra-stylish, we’re going to be sharp as a pin with our composition,” and within the day of the split we’d already written “Fascist Groove Thang”, which I don’t know if anybody, but it’s quite a weird record because it’s full of manic energy.
Maybe we should play a little of that. Emma Warren I tell you what, you always had a really wicked line in trench coats. Those
coats were sharp. Martyn Ware We looked like kind of '40s, I don’t know what we looked like really, Cary Grant or something. But we were determined to kind of look as pin sharp as possible. Just let me play a little bit of “Fascist Groove Thang” because that’s such a cool track, I think. [music plays] That’s not “Fasicst Groove Thang”, sorry. Emma Warren Your iTunes is lying to you? Martyn Ware It’s actually a soundscape of some description. (music: Heaven 17 – “(We Don’t Need This) Fascist Groove Thang” / applause) I’ve got a great story about this. We were editing this in our studio in the
days when you had to cut tape and we were desperately trying to get it down to
single length. We were cutting bits out here and bits out there because it was
all new to us this stuff. We eventually got it into the shape we wanted but just couldn’t make this one edit work, we just couldn’t get it in time and I’m
going: “What is going on?” We’d tried everything. And after about three hours,
Phil turned ‘round to me and said: “What’s that on the sole of your shoe?” And
it was actually a piece of editing tape with a bit of the actual mix on it and
we edited it back in and it worked fine and that’s actually on the finished
record. You can’t do that on a Logic Pro rig, can you? Emma Warren So next time your record’s not running right, check your shoes. Martyn Ware Anyway, that shows the influence of kind of
Chic on what we were doing
and all that stuff and the fantastic John Wilson, who was 17-years old
at the time, happened to be working with
Glenn at the Crucible Theatre in
Sheffield, he went into the Green Room and said: “Can anybody play bass
because we’ve got an idea to put a bass track on there?” And this very shy
black guy put his hand up and said: “I’ve just bought this bass for 30 quid from a jumble sale ’cause I normally play rhythm guitar.” And he’d never played it before and was playing it like a rhythm guitar. So it just shows, accidents, serendipity, whatever you call it, it’s so important when you’re
making records. Emma Warren So you just mentioned the influence of Chic but how aware were you of the post-disco things that were happening in New York at this time? Martyn Ware I thought it was ludicrous because it’s all music. I never understood this
antipathy towards, “Let’s create this big bonfire of big disco records,” what
was all that about? The Bee Gees are fantastic songwriters, the double album
of Saturday Night Fever is still one of the greatest soundtrack albums of
all time, what was it all about again? I think it might have been an anti-gay thing, to be honest. Emma Warren I think there was just a crazy mayor in Chicago at that time? Martyn Ware Well, I’m still to this day... you know, disco music is cool. Some of it was
shit but we thought it was cool and it gave us more of a maverick attitude
because everybody was going: “Disco is finished!” So we would go: “Fine, we
love it.” We continued using it as in influence and still do to this day and
now it’s cool again and won’t be again and so on and so forth. Who gives a
fuck? Emma Warren Correct. So it might be interesting to just know a little bit about... With Heaven 17, how
your creation process worked. What did you do? How did you create? Martyn Ware I know why you are asking this question. She was on Youtube last night looking
at appalling videos that people have put up of shows in 1982 on television in England. We used to have this thing where for lyric writing the three of us –
myself, Glenn Gregory, and Ian Craig Marsh were very close, we were like
brothers. Not brothers in the black sense, although maybe, I dunno, but brothers, three heads on one body. So we all, and to this day, still write all the lyrics together at all times. So what happens is when we have a lyric
writing session, we always write the backing tracks first and then we have a lyric writing session. Everybody for about a month beforehand writes down little phrases from the everyday world, things we see in newspapers, magazines, posters, advertisements, movies. It can be nonsensical, just something that tickles your fancy. And we have lists and lists and lists and lists of this shit. We spread them all out on the floor and it’s a bit like the William Boroughs cut-up technique that Bowie used to use, except modulated with a sense of humour. It’s not literally cutting things up. For instance, “Fascist Groove Thang”, I just remembered this, there was a top 75 dance
records in Record Mirror and we actually looked down them and used them as the
source for the lyrics in combination with a kind of political theme. So we were going, there’s lines in there like: “Hot you as I feel your power,” you
know? What the hell does that mean? Doesn’t mean anything, does it? “Groove
Thang” was a very Parliament/Funkadelic thang, and we deliberately modulated
and changed all these different lyrics until it fitted together and changed
and made sense. And we’d have these ridiculous arguments, like stand up arguments about what particular lines meant. This is opposed to the kind of
notion of the artist in the garret, the kind of tortured artist bearing his soul to the audience. This is more like, you haven’t got a soul to bear at that age, it’s just pure energy and creative ideas and chucking stuff
together. Emma Warren Production-wise, what were you using at this point? Martyn Ware Because we’d done it all electronically with the Human League, now all bets were off, we just wanted to make the best records we could. To the eternal credit of Virgin Records at the time, it’s hard to imagine a record company that would support this idea. They just let us do what we want and so one day we’d go: “Oh, we want some brass, we want to do a brass thing,” and they’d find the best brass section in Britain. “We want to make a record that sounds like a funk record with brass.“ One section from them guys came in and did some brass and we did an instrumental called “He-La-Hu” with just like a chant on it, it was just bizarre and then onwards and upwards we went. For the second album we had to get even more popular. The first album was in the charts for 75
weeks in the Top 40, which is pretty amazing, and was ‘Album Of The Year’ in 1981. And then the second album came along and we had to do something even more spectacular, so we just started chucking loads of money at it, ridiculous amounts. We rehearsed in the most expensive studio in London, with Paul McCartney and Elton John in the other studios and borrowing Marc Bolan’s guitar to play stuff and it really went to our heads, big time. And then one day we said: “Oh, I know, let’s do an orchestra.” So we rang up our friend
Gemma, who was the production co-coordinator, and said: “We’d like to book an orchestra next week, please.” And she said: “How many people do you want?” And I turned ‘round to Glenn and said: “Let’s have a word with an arranger friend of ours, we’ll get back to you in an hour.” Got back: “Oh, we want 50.” The list includes four double basses, brass sections, drums, harp. You name it, we
got it, basically, and that’s how we made
“Temptation” because had it not been for the sound and the collaboration with the string
arranger John Wesley Barker, that record would never have sounded anything like that. It would have been a good record but I don’t think it would have had the longevity that it did. Shall I play it? This was a massive hit in Britain, twice actually, funnily enough. It
got re-released. It never quite made it in America, “Let Me Go” was more
popular in America. (music: Heaven 17 – “Temptation”) Emma Warren And generations of mobile disco DJs salute you. Martyn Ware I tell you, it doesn’t matter what audience you play that for, they get it.
Just so you know from a technical point of view, this is how nuts we were at
that time, that thing where it goes, “Ahhh!” That’s 128 tracks of vocals! 128
tracks overlaid and I think 15 different inversions. Four octaves with
versions, weird chords. It only last quarter of a second or half a second, so
that was drug-fuelled, I’m afraid. I make no apologies for it, it was. Emma Warren But how did you come up with the idea to do 128 tracks of vocals for quarter
of a second? Martyn Ware I won’t go there. Just the backing vocals on that track took three days and we
were good singers, it wasn’t like we were doing different takes for technical
reasons. It’s actually pretty straightforward now on Logic and stuff like that
it just loops ‘round and ‘round, but in those days, believe me, it wasn’t easy
because you had to bounce from 24 tracks onto 2 tracks onto another multi-
track and synchronizing stuff would take 15 seconds at a time. For the mix of this we were running three multi-tracks synchronized, we were mixing it in 5, 10 second sections. We also had loops going around the room on two different
two-track players with giant loops going ‘round the room that we faded in and
out of the mix. Just mad stuff, really. The guy who helped us produce that,
Greg Walsh, used to produce
Heatwave. I don’t know if anyone
remembers Heatwave, but they had this very dense vocal texture thing going on
we just pushed it to the next level, really. Emma Warren That’s the next level and some. Martyn Ware Slightly, yeah. Emma Warren How did you move from Heaven 17 to doing B.E.F.? Martyn Ware Well, funnily enough B.E.F. started before Heaven 17 because Heaven 17 was the first project of B.E.F. as the umbrella company as it were. But B.E.F., for those who don’t know, is a production company where, it’s a kind of a megalomaniac thing, really. Imagine picking your favourite songs and then
picking your favourite singers and mixing them up in a big bag and going:
“Right, we’re going to do an electronic soul version of this.” That’s kind of
where we came from. It’s a completely mad idea but people liked it. And I should play you the first time I met Tina Turner. It was the last song on the
album, I’d already got all the other various singers to do tracks that I liked and I’d got James Brown lined up to do “Ball Of Confusion” by The Temptations
and then his lawyer rang up the day before we were due to fly to Atlanta and
said: “Right, we want five points on the whole album or we’re not going to do
it.” And I said: “You’d better cancel the flights then because that’s not
going to happen. We’d love to work with you but we can’t do it on that basis.” And it’s the last track on the album and we’re wondering who can we get to do
it. And this is fate for you, walked into Virgin Records and one of the guys
who is in charge of Virgin is friends with Tina Turner, who was just flying
out to L.A. and said: “Do you like Tina Turner?” And I’d seen Tina perform her
kind of ’chicken in a basket’ thing “Proud Mary” and all that in London and
I was absolutely blown away and said: “Yeah!” I mean, [sings] “When I was a
little girl…,” you know? All that stuff, loved all that stuff, so I said:
“Yeah, would she be interested in doing it?” Well, she had a new manager,
Roger Davies, and maybe he’d be interested in doing it. A bit more like
forward looking. I said: “I’d like to do this cover version of “Ball Of
Confusion”,” so she came into the studio and said: “Where’s the band?” And I
pointed at the Fairlight and
said: “That’s it,” and she said: “Wow, that’s cool.” And so we played the
backing track, she did it first take, it was fantastic. [She] just read it perfectly and afterwards she came up to me and said: “That was kind of
difficult to sing, it sounded like there were three or four male voices on it in different ranges,” and it was The Temptations. She said: “Who are The Temptations?” Yep! On my children’s lifes! I think she turned her back on soul music after Ike slightly, if she
didn’t know who The Temptations were. That’s absolutely true. So anyway, I’ll play you our version, I really like this, this is our apogee of electronic
soul efforts at that point. (music: B.E.F. – “Ball Of Confusion” / applause) That was John McGill, actually, from
many bands, Magazine and
Siouxie & The Banshees and P.I.L.. And that was Paul Jones playing harmonica
from Manfred Mann. That’s pretty cool. Emma Warren So how did you get the beef, the boost, in there? Martyn Ware What? What does that mean? Emma Warren Well, what did you do sonically to make that record? Martyn Ware That was just like chucking everything in there. The thing about the original
“Ball Of Confusion” is that it’s a very daring record. I’ve always been a big
fan of Norman Whitfield anyway, many things he’s done. But that was just a very daring
record, so I thought, “Take something interesting and re-interpret it in a
different way, is the way that you get interesting stuff out at the other
end.” It always helps loving your source subject. And it takes a bit of daring, I think, to take a record that you really love and want to improve on it. It’s a bit arrogant, frankly. That doesn’t necessarily improve on the
original but I think it’s just as interesting. Emma Warren And how did your relationship with Tina Turner continue? Martyn Ware They kind of liked that, even although we released it and it wasn’t a hit at
that time. Roger Davies asked me to do
a track for the Private Dancer album. And I’ve always said or always thought, my view on Tina was that she, and I still believe this
to this day, is that she is one of the world’s greatest soul singers and she
kind of turned her back on soul. I said: “Look, one of my favourite songs is
“Let’s Stay Together” by Al Green.” Me and a million other people. But you could just tell the sensitivity of her voice and her innate knowledge of soul would just make a spectacular version of that. And everything I’ve done in production has always
been about the voice. Although we’re really keen on this unique instrumentation and combinations of instrumentation, really, it’s all about the voice and backing vocal arrangements and stuff like that. So we went on to do “Let’s Stay Together,” which at that point was the biggest selling 12” single in American history. Shall I play that? Emma Warren Yes, please. (music: Tina Turner – “Let’s Stay Together”) Martyn Ware She came in and did that one take, straight off. That entire vocal not a
single syllable was changed. Unbelievable. Any of you who are vocalists out
there, do your homework, to go into the studio with an idea of what you
want to do. I think it’s a very rare thing. I’ve worked with lots of the great
vocalists and she’s the only one that’s come close. For instance, I did a track with Chaka Kahn and it took 15 takes, she was going through various drug problems at the time. She knew exactly how she wanted to interpret that song when she came. I think an opera singer wouldn’t turn up and expect to do a big opera performance and not rehearse it and I think there’s an awful lot of laziness from a lot of vocalists. They think they can just turn up and somehow it’ll all be alright in the mix, they’re not feeling too well that day, “Oh dear, I’ve got a bit of a sore throat,” etc., etc. It’s a bit like being a top sportsman: you’ve got
to put the work in to get to that level. She’s brilliant and a nice person as well, not arrogant, not coming into the studio going… She offered to do as many takes as I want. I said: “Well, we’ll do another take but no need to, really.” And [she’s] just an incredible woman. Emma Warren So, I guess, your work with Tina Turner opened up some interesting doors for
you? Martyn Ware It did, actually. Suddenly, I was hot property as you tend to be when you’ve
done something like that. In the space of a week I got offered Rod Stewart’s
new album, Bette Midler’s new album, and I turned both of those down because I
didn’t want to be known for doing older artists. I wish that I’d done them
now, I could have done with the money, I was young and arrogant and stupid at
the time. Emma Warren So who did you say yes to? Martyn Ware Quite a few people and I always worked with different, new artists as well. I
tended to want to work with solo artists because I did a lot of work with
bands and working with bands is a nightmare. Because everyone’s got their own
agenda, generally, and however much you’re meant to be mates, there’s always
cliques. So I made a golden rule for myself after some bad experiences that I would never work with units of more than three people. Four, you can have two cliques of two, three is kind of difficult because if one’s on the outside,
you have to go with the majority, so you just ally yourself with the right people and you’re okay. Big bands don’t work for me at all. But anyway, I was just about to do another weird project, soul project, and then this tape landed on my desk from a new A&R man at Sony and it was this tacky tape and it said Terence Trent D’Arby on it and I put it on. I’m literally about to sign the contract on doing this other artist and I put it on and went: “This is absolutely fantastic!” It was a bit rough, but the songs were incredible and the voice is incredible. So I went down there and managed to persuade them
that I should do his first album, The Hardline According To..., and we got on like a house on fire. At that point he was completely straight, didn’t take any drugs, didn’t drink, he looked like a god. I used to walk down
the street with him in London and the girls would look straight through me at him, which pissed me off. Literally, it was one of those things where he was just a god at that time, a young god, he performed live and he could do everything, you name it. Every move you’ve ever seen Prince do, every move you’ve ever seen the original soul artists do, even James, he could dance like James. Anyway, that didn’t last long because suddenly on the second album decided he could do it himself without a producer, or an engineer, or anybody else helping him write the songs and it all went downhill from there,
unfortunately. But for that brief moment in time he was a god. And I’d like to play a bit of “Wishing Well” if that’s alright, because that was number one over here, or it certainly was in America anyway. (music: Terence Trent D’Arby – “Wishing Well” / applause) That is one funky tune there. Emma Warren You can’t beat a bit of Terence. Martyn Ware Wow! I was just going to say, there’s one story that’s really important, I
think, in terms of a teaching thing. He used to come in at least three or four
days a week and we used to work six days a week into the studio for an hour
before I got in. And he used to play Sam Cooke tunes and Otis Redding, and he
used to sit there like studying, as though he was studying a university
subject. He used to study them in darkness, in the studio, listening to them,
sing along to them, and saying: “This might be my only chance, this album, to
try and get out what I’ve got inside me.” And he really wanted to know his subject thoroughly. And it relates back to the Tina Turner thing, you can’t be lazy about this shit. If you want to be the top 5%, 2%, got to put the work
in, put the research in. And if you don’t remember anything else from this
lecture, remember that because if you stick that in your head and keep it in
your career, you’ll be successful, I think, if you’ve got the talent. Emma Warren I guess some of it is about craft, isn’t it? About really working at your art. Martyn Ware DJ Premier, the other
day, he was pretty much reading from the same hymn sheet, wasn’t he? It’s
about being able to incrementally build on your reputation over a period of
time, but it’s about really grinding it out a lot of the time. Sometimes you
don’t feel inspired, sometimes a lot of the time you don’t. It’s a cliche but
it’s 90% perspiration, 10% inspiration. It’s pretty much true. Number of times
I’ve gone into the studio and I’ve not got a single idea in my head at all and
you’re starting to write a song. That’s when you refer back to the half-formed
ideas that you’ve made earlier and you go: “Actually, maybe I can get over
this little hurdle with this one,” and you start the thread going again. Emma Warren That’s quite an interesting point. What is your process when you’re stuck? I
remember reading something about Japanese author Haruki Murakami, before he
starts writing he’ll put his fingers on the keyboard, close his eyes and then
he’s ready to write. Do you have something you do to get yourself in the zone
for writing? Martyn Ware No, not really. I do think most of my most interesting ideas come to me at
about five in the morning, and I try to write them down, I always try to have a
notebook by the side of the bed or a digital recorder just to hum arrangement
ideas. I think that kind of lucent dreaming thing is kind of interesting,
always has been for me before I knew what the posh word was for it. But actually, when you’re in the studio it always helps being in the studio with
people your friendly with. I find it difficult to do it on my own. I always
think collaboration’s the key, being with people you like really helps. Emma Warren Obviously, you did all this production stuff and then later on you moved into
sound design, was there an incremental change from production to sound design? Martyn Ware When I first started with the Human League, we used to write experimental
electronic pieces and that kind of got forgotten when we became more au fait
with the pop world and fell in love with being on television and all the girls
falling at us. You tend to put the art a bit to the back because you’re earning lots of money going: “This is fantastic!” You’re on every TV show,
etc., so it’s hard to keep a grasp on everything as you go along, something
has to give way. But in the year 2000 or 1999, actually, the production work was gradually starting to dry up and I think it was for most producers, apart from the very very top level. Primarily because record companies just didn’t
want to spend the money, actually. And also because of the proliferation of
home studios people could make their own records or make their own good demos
and then bring them to the record companies. The record company listens to 50
of them, maybe one of them is something they want to put out and they haven’t
had to pay for it. So all the money that used to be put into developing artists, suddenly was being put into marketing records. So you ended up with this ridiculous mechanism where record companies stopped investing in
developing artists and that, had that happened, I wouldn’t have had a career. The first two Human League albums were good but they didn’t sell very well. I’d have been dropped after the first single, let alone the first album. Likewise with U2, likewise with just about every other band you like from your
past or any other band currently successful. Even Rolling Stones, probably The
Beatles. So they’ve just thrown out the mechanism that made great music, which
is actually the idea of just giving people enough money to live for a bit
until they get good. So I was getting more disillusioned at this point and getting bitter and twisted about it. I turned around to Vince Clarke, my friend
from Erasure. I did an album with them in 1992 and we became very good friends, and said: “Look, why don’t we try and get back to what made us excited about this shit in the first place and do some stuff for purely
artistic reasons.” So we formed a company called Illustrious, which was initially to exploit our film and TV writing work, but quickly evolved into us
discovering this new technology, which enabled us to move sounds around in three dimensions in mid-air using software and enabled us to create sonic architecture in mid-air. So from that day until now, I do less conventional
production and more installation work around the world. I’m off to Long Beach, for instance, at the beginning of next week to do a 100 meter square by 20 meter high three-dimensional sound installation on the campus there based on the sounds of Mexico City, it’s eleven hours long. You can’t fit that on an
album, you know? So I’ve moved back into, it’s not just artistic, there is a point to it, the point is: it’s about a collaborative process, about creating new works with other disciplines. The world is becoming multi-disciplinary, but if I asked all of you in this room, if you are just musicians or you do stuff like messing around with Sketch Up, for instance, or drawing or messing about with game design, a lot of people have multiple disciplines now and we’re moving into a totally different world now. What we’re doing we want to encourage a new reality by immersing people in this new world. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the budget to bring the 3-D soundsystem here this year, but if they are very nice to me and they invite me back next year, I’ll try and bring the 3-D soundsystem next year and you can all hear it for real. Also, people who come to London or who live in London, if they want to contact me they can come to my studio in Brixton and hear it, this new alternative sound reality. There are some CDs here for everybody to take, they’re not in 3-D but some of
them are in bi-aural so if you wear headphones it’ll sound kind of 3-D so just
to give you examples of the kind of music that we’ve been creating and have
been creating for the last six years. Most of it is unreleased so please don’t
put it up on the internet. At the end you can come and get one of those. Emma Warren Can I leave you to play something? Obviously, we are going to carry on, but I
need to go and cough my head off and get a drink. Just for a minute, can you
play something that represents what you’ve been doing? Martyn Ware Can we switch the projector on? What I’ll do is, I might start my
presentation, if that’s alright? This all sounds very formal, but actually
it’s a bit of fun. This is how I regard the future and how it’s developing, and it’s not just aimed at you guys who want to go and make dance records or
different kinds of records, this is a much broader kind of attitude. This is one of my companies, Future Of Sound, we do a lecture tour in 3-D sound and invite young artists to come and collaborate with us. I’ll move on, that was just a posh opening. I don’t know if you can all see, that’s a
pain in the ass. I’ll keep this brief anyway. You know who I am, you know who Vince [Clarke] is, he looks more like a member of The Sopranos there but he’s from Erasure, one of the greatest pop songwriters and sold a lot of records, too, currently touring. He’s coming to America soon again, I think. What do we do? I’ve kind of described to you what we do: we work with everybody from the Royal Ballet to museums, we’ve got permanent installations in various museums around the world, we do big open air exhibitions, we do big live events, we work with architects, we work with young interactive designers, anybody who has got an idea for three-dimensional sound. If you’re working in a three-
dimensional world that’s virtual and digital we can combine our technology. If
you move something in a virtual world we can make sound move for the audience
in the same way and that incorporates height as well. So anybody that’s
interested in that stuff I’m going to be around until six o’clock this
evening, just come and talk to me about it. It’s a big subject, I won’t go
into it here. We use a piece of technology called 3-D Audioscape. We’ve been kind of
working in a beta version of it for years but it’s now finished and it’s now
ready for sale, and I might be able to get a special deal for anybody that’s
interested. It runs on a Mac platform, a dualcore platform, and this is kind
of what it looks like in action [cuts to projector screen]. All the different coloured balls symbolise locations of sounds in mid-air, so the grid
is kind of halfway up a given space and that’s me wobbling a camera around. You can also place sounds below half way up a room. You can have 16 different sounds moving around at 25 frames per second all controlled by MIDI controller values, X, Y and Z coordinates. So anything that you use that issues MIDI
controller values, we use a 40 dollar 3-D joystick with height control but you can use Data Gloves, you can use MoCap, you can use sensors of any description, you can use a Wii controller - think about that. I’m just
going to zip through some projects that we’ve done that might give you an idea
about the applications. We did a thing in Britain called The Dark, which is an experience in a room about fifteen
meters square by about five meters high, clad in black velvet, no lights, no
seats. You walk around, bump into people, touch them in inappropriate places,
get over it and, actually, there’s a 15 minute narrative in this particular
space. I didn’t select the subject matter, but it’s about a slave ship in the
1700s. Basically, it had four different stories: the cabin boy, a slave and
this guy who was a lieutenant who went on to become a big anti-slavery
campaigner in Britain. In the corners of the room you can basically move
towards which story you want to hear and there’s a big sound design thing
going on giving this sense of immersion. You know, you’re on a ship, you can
hear the sails flapping above you, you can hear the birds flying around you
can hear the sea crashing over the side of the ship, but all in the right
compass points, height, etc. This was a very deeply affecting piece, I’d like
to bring it over to Britain, actually. Sorry, to the USA, I think it would be
a really exciting thing for people to witness it, it was terrifying. So that’s
how three-dimensional sound can be used in that respect. Last year we did the world’s first ever 3-D sonic imaging sound field, ‘sonic imaging system’ is the name we use for this. In the gardens that you see there, which is about
125 meters wide by a 100 meters in the other direction and on top of the
flagpoles that you see we had speakers everywhere, basically full range PA
speakers. We created 24 hours of content, 12 different artists did two hours
each, three-dimensional creating soundscapes based on the sounds of Mexico City or inspired by
Mexico City. We had some really famous sound artists like
Fennesz, Maryanne Amercher, who won the Arts
Electronica Prize for the work that she did. Never gave me a credit, bitch. I
can say that, she really is a bitch, actually. Sue me. [laughter] It was an amazing experience and in this particular interest we had two hour slots for
each artist and you had to come at a particular time of day to hear each one.
We had things like invisible protest marches walking through the square and
people looking round going: “Where’s the protest march?” Helicopters flying
over your head that weren’t there, giant out of scale motorbikes, Harley
Davidsons driving across the square at impossible speeds. Myself and Vince designed a piece that, in this square there are barrel organ players that have been around for many years, they’ve been around a hundred years or more. Not
the same ones, obviously, but you get the idea. And we recorded them when we
did our research, we recorded the tunes that they came out with, deconstructed
them in our studio at home and came up with this kind of slow, very elegant
piece using chords that were related to the tunes on the barrel organs. So
when it was played back in the square it sounded like the barrel organ players
in the square were improvising to our piece, which is pretty cool, actually,
and it worked. And then we had people like Chris Watson, who used to be in
Cabaret Voltaire, an old friend of mine, who did a piece based on the last
ever train journey on a now defunct railway line going across Mexico City to
Tijuana, etc. Just beautiful, all in surround sound, three-dimensional
surround sound. He actually recorded a ghostly scream, which people reckon is
a ghost and he’s one of the straightest, most normal people you’re ever likely
to meet. He’s not fooling me. He left a microphone in this particular
marshalling yards in Tijuana, came back an hour later, listened to the
recording afterwards and there was a scream and there were no people there at
all. He played it back to a series of locals who said there was a series of
murders in this particular place 20 years ago and this is actually part of the
soundscape, you can actually hear it. And the woman was crying a particular
name and it’s the name of the guy who killed them. Don’t ask me how, I don’t
believe that shit normally. Moving on swiftly, we’re re-staging this at
California University Long Beach State Campus in two weeks time, the 8th it
starts. I assume not many of you live near there, but if you do, you’re more
than welcome to come along, the launch date is the Saturday, the 6th. I will
shake your hand. We did the Venice Architecural Biennale at the British
Pavillon, which has got five rooms, we were asked to represent Britain by the British Council who deal with all that
shit. It was all about architecture being about spaces, and sound, and human
occupancy, rather than this thing that architects have that they’re the
greatest people on earth because they can build bigger and nicer shaped
buildings and make them work. We’re very much of the opinion that it’s about
people, it comes back to the whole kind of socialist viewpoint that I have. It just went down like a brick in a swimming pool, as a you can imagine, with
most of the architects. They hated it. But the members of the public who came
along really liked it because it was about creating a sense of being there. This is an infomatic piece that we did with my designer friend Malcolm Garrett, who did a lot of our
album covers in the ’80s, about the effect that Sheffield, which is my
hometown, has on the world and how it attracts people. I won’t play it all,
it’s 15 minutes long, but I’ll play you a little bit of it anyway. There are 27 Sheffields in the world you’ll be glad to hear and this map shows you
where they are. There are two in Canada. All this composition was going around
the room in 3-D and a lot of the sounds for this we recorded from
manufacturing processes in Sheffield, drop forging steel, sounds a bit like
the early Human League. I didn’t realise this at the time. I’ll just flip
forward a little to show you some of this shit. That shows you the main
buildings in the world that were made with Sheffield steel, that’s right, and
the main consumers of cutlery in world. This took three months to research,
you may say: “What a waste of time,” but I quite like it. Scalpels all around
the world, they use one and a half million in the USA, Canada’s not on there. These are the main steel producing towns in the world, and this is the
constituent parts and we actually had pirate radio stations going on all
around the room, all different stations, all from Sheffield. And then moving along, my favourite football club Sheffield Wednesday, had to get in there
somewhere. You’ll like this. The Vatican City, there’s a mad Sheffield Wednesday fan in the Vatican City somewhere we discovered, we analysed the Sheffield Wednesday website, which is my football club, where all the hits
come from and there must be a Sheffield Wednesday priest or someone in the
Vatican City, which is pretty wild. You might go: “What the hell has this got
to do with the Red Bull Music Academy?” And you’d be absolutely right, but I’m
just going to show it to you anyway [laughter]. It’s about an abstracted
version of doing soundtracks basically is what I’m talking about, and when
you’ve got three dimensions to work with it makes sense. A lot of the software that’s used
in Formula 1 comes from Sheffield, they make Jelly Babies in Sheffield and
these are the main countries that like them, Afghanistan, Canada, and wine
gums, etc. Anyway, that’s enough of that shit. We did a project, I don’t know if you know the Victoria and Albert museum in London, they asked 12 artists to take a shed and do something with it and we did one in sound, where we played 14 and a half minutes of beautiful sounds of the countryside in Britain: streams running past your feet, birds flying around your head, the rustle of
the trees, the little stream running down there. And then, after 14 and a half
minutes without any warning, 30db louder, without any warning, there’s the
sound of urban cacophony, pneumatic drills, “blah, blah, blah.” To try and
point out what the difference is in sound between those two areas, at which
point the people you see in the shed there would run out, well, jump up in the
air first, then run out. That’s why the warning sounds were on the outside so we
didn’t get sued. At which point, all the children run in again and say: “Can
you put the loud part on again, please, Mister?” And it was such a big success
that we were asked to do it again at the Regent Street Festival, which is a
tiny little thing at the bottom there, 400.000 people came past it that day,
which is pretty cool. But this is pretty exciting and this is an indication of
where the future’s going for sound, I think. We’re working currently with the
University of Virginia, they have created in recent years the whole of ancient Rome in 3-D that you can navigate around with a joystick. It’s completely bonkers, I don’t know why they did it, but it’s fantastic. To the level that
some of the individual buildings you can see the individual tiles on the walls at quarter of an inch wide, the tessaria, stuff like that. We’re going to populate that world with how it would have sounded at that time in history,
obviously in Latin of course, but things like the Colosseum as well. And as a kind of follow on from that I had a kind of epiphany. I was there with my children and my wife, and I thought, “I know the guy who runs the
interpretation centre at the Colosseum. Why don’t we persuade them and raise
the money to populate the whole of the Colosseum with three-dimensional sound
and create the sound of how the Colosseum would have sounded at that time,
with 50.000 people in there, with the emperor, with sea battles, with beasts
fighting human beings, with water organs playing, with drums, with people
chanting the names of their favourite gladiators?” Can you imagine that in 3-D? Walking in there if you were blind it would sound real. I just think it would be awe-inspiring, literally. So we’re talking to them at the moment. If
we get this one off the ground, I think, everyone will want that shit. Why
wouldn’t they? It depends on money, always. We did a similar thing with the
British Film Institute, which is the biggest film organisation in Britain.
They opened a new building, which is this. We did a 120 meter long three-
dimensional sound field with 120 meter long projections on the opposite wall
with our friends D-Fuse, all about the new digital archiving of London films
fundamentally and that was pretty cool too. There’s a little bit I can show
you. Imagine this 120 meters wide with the sounds following the effects. This
is actually on Youtube. We’re looking at a blending of stuff that’s developed
from the dance scene, using VJing techniques, using three-dimensional sound and
creating new kinds of experiences for people in big, open spaces. It’s not like going to an art gallery. You may just happen to cycle through this space
or be walking through it and you come across something and suddenly something
attacks the old medulla part of your brain and goes, “This sounds kind of
real,” or, “This looks exciting.” I think it’s a new exciting form of public
art that I think will become even more popular in the future. I mean, we’re used to the random stuff obviously, you know, Times Square, where it’s all adverts, adverts, adverts, commercial purposes. But imagine changing urban spaces using really well-curated sound and vision. I think there’s a lot in that. We just recently did Greenwich with a Planetarium show as well all in
surround sound. The first place in the world, as far as I can tell, the first
museum in the world - [looks at video screen] why’s it going grey, this is
shit – the first place in the world to link lots of galleries using immersive
sound, it connects all the galleries, all sonification from dates from
space. So the radiation that’s coming from the sun, for instance, would be
turned into sound and drifted through the gallery. And I got the chance to meet the Queen actually, that was pretty cool. She was the first person to hear it, I shook her hand, she was really frail, she said: “How are you, Martyn?” I said, “I’m fine, Queenie. Will you sign my 50 pound note?” Anyway, we’re working with disabled children and autistic children to create immersive environments using immersive projections two sensory grade projections, also
3-D sound and new LED lighting to try and engage these poor children who maybe
can only move a finger or blink. They can change things like maybe they can
move their finger a little bit and make animated leaves fall off trees or they
can go for a walk in the woods or go running over the moon or fly over the
Grand Canyon, etc. We’re working on that, hoping that’s going to open not in September, but
later this year. And we’re going to do a similar thing to the Mexico thing in
the centre of London next year, so look out for that if you’re in London. We did a tour, over the last few years we’ve done several of these, actually: a
Future of Sound tour where we installed big three-dimensional soundsystem in a
large theatre and ask artists in advance to do a 15 minute piece each. And some of them are just students like yourselves and some of them are more experienced to see how sound can be combined with their disciplines in the
future, and these are some of the people we are hoping to bring. Well, we are going to bring, to the USA hopefully in spring next year on the West Coast, but I’d like to do something on this coast as well, so any ideas, if anybody
knows anywhere in Toronto that’d be interested, let me know. We’re also going to
Brazil - yes! We’re going to Rio in March. They’ll not see my arse for
dust, though, I’m telling you. South Korea, we’re going to do something for
the South Korean government. Just a couple of things, I’m not going to bore you any longer with this but some interesting things that might spark some ideas for you. We found out that this guy called Paul Deveraux, and he’s a very well-known professor in Cambridge in England, and he styles himself as an archeoacoustician. He goes ‘round ancient burial sites and temples, pyramids, etc., and analyses
them from a sound point of view. And he’s discovered that in Ireland there are
a series of burial mounds called Cairns, and despite the fact they’re dotted
all around the country and they’re made of different things, are different
sizes, the linings of them are different, they all resonate at one particular
frequency. The predominant resonant frequency is under 111 Hz, which is [mimics sound], Koyaanisqatsi that kind of thing. Now this is interesting enough, it suggest that
these things were built to enhance sound rituals for burials and combined with
taking psychoactive drugs to interpret the rooms that were carved on the
inside etc. But he had this notion, he had an idea about it, so he asked one
of his friends, a bunch of students, to be analyzed and fed different
frequencies to see what would happen to their brains on an MRI scan. And guess what? At exactly 111hz it switches off the prefrontal cortex in your brain
completely so you go into a trance. So they obviously knew 5.000 years ago
that this particular frequency was like free drugs, would put you into this
space where you are in a trance, and therefore in a social trance with
everybody else in this space. So that’s pretty wild when you think about it
and the corollary of this, a friend of mine, Oliver Rothschild, who runs various huge companies around the world, particularly the Curzon group, he’s a good man, he’s interested in the healing power of sound. I don’t know if anybody’s done any sound therapy, I haven’t. There’s lots of views on it, it’s not really an accepted best practice. But he’s actually established and is currently going through the patent process of
establishing sound as medicine using different frequencies, seeing how you can
maybe heal different illnesses using different frequencies. Can you imagine how the drug companies feel about this, by the way? They are going to be
thrilled because it’s free and there’s no way you can charge for it. I’d like to charge for it, but you can’t, all you need is a tone generator and that’s it. I find this stuff very interesting and it just shows a lot of stuff happened in the past that we have forgotten and that we will re-discover as time goes on. On a lighter note, this is my friend Brian Duffy, he’s got a thing called
the Modified Toy Orchestra. He picks up
toys that – sorry, it’s yellow but that’s life, it’s not normally yellow,
shit, OK – he basically picks up toys from car boot sales for 50p or something
and examines their guts. He gets into the chip and examines how the chip is constructed and modifies the chip, attaches new controllers to them and enables them to be connected to PAs and he actually plays them live. So, for instance, you see the Hula Barbie there, which actually does shake its hips
and the eyes light up. It’s pretty cool, these things sticking out from her head are actually capacitance controllers, which make the most bizarre sounds. It plays back like [mimics Barbie doll singing], all that stuff. That’s pretty cool just by different capacitance and can make it make incredibly grany 8-bit sounds. So here’s another lesson, basically. That’s what I’m saying. Recycling? Hey,
you can do musical recycling using different things. For instance, he was telling me that Mattel made these chips and they had the information for every toy on every chip, even although for the Barbie doll it would only unlock a certain part of it. So he found all these other toys that were built on this chip and it had Action Man on it and Spiderman, whatever. And then, of course,there’s Speak-and-Spells and whatever and there’s five people when he plays
live. It’s like Kraftwerk for the 21st century. So let’s have a whip ’round and get these guys over here because they are absolutely fantastic. Have you seen them? Emma Warren No, I haven’t but I’ve got a friend I work with who is completely obsessed by
them. Martyn Ware They are unbelievably good and very musical. Getting near the end now. This is
some more friends of mine called Sancho Plan. They have a narrative that they designed in Flash and then they controlled the animated characters in the screen behind them using the percussion pads in a live performance. So, not
only does it trigger sounds, it triggers movement in the actual. In this case
it’s called Space Quatica, it’s actually like cartoon sea creatures. In 3-D sound as
well. It’s pretty wild stuff and we’re talking to various people in Las Vegas
at the moment about using this technology to create a new type of show. This should interest some people, I don’t know who. But you can actually place a
sound field microphone, which is a 3-D microphone, place it in the centre of
Times Square, or Dundas Square, and transmit that information to anywhere else
in the world via the internet, except if you’re in this building because the
internet doesn’t work [laughs]. Anywhere else on earth and reproduce it,
reproduce it. Anywhere, at any scale, which is wild I think. We could reproduce the sound of Times Square in Trafalgar Square, for instance, or in an art gallery in Ulan Bator. That kind of blows my mind. It’s a translocation of
reality, and if you take away the visual elements, it’s a bit like time travel
or something for me, it’s completely wild. We’re also talking to people about
different interfaces because obviously we’re dealing in a new three-dimensional world so this is a new interface. We’ve been talking to these guys for two years now, I don’t know if you remember Minority Report and the way
they move is very common, moving all that shit around, well, these guys G-Speak actually designed the look of that and now they’ve gone
and done it for real. So you can do it for real but not just move things
around on a screen, they go one further: you can actually go into the screen,
so this membrane between reality and the virtual world is now being broken
down. You can actually create three-dimensional worlds where you can actually navigate through the screen just by using your hands. No mice, nothing, no transmitters, just cameras read these spots on these special gloves. This is
pretty wild stuff and is the future. It’s like a touch screen space but in three dimensions. Wow! And we’re working with them. So what does the future hold? Well, artistic and educational installations, theatrical stuff, you know, imagine new forms of theatre and musicals, theme parks. We’re already
talking to Disney and Dreamworks. World premieres, if you want to make a big
splash with people and you’ve got a few bob, you know, come to us because we
can really do that. It works even better outdoors than it does indoors. And
more importantly, collaboration with other digital, visual and interactive
technologies because everything’s getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.
Webcams, the software to control this shit is getting cheaper, and ultimately,
what we’re aiming for, is really like the
holodeck, I suppose, in the Star Trek
Enterprise and we’re not very far away, which is kind of exciting. That’s shut everybody up, hasn’t it? Are there any questions? Emma Warren I think definitely now is the time to put it out to the floor. Audience Member Hi. My question is, I guess, maybe I’m assuming too much but is your approach
to synthesis more emulative or do you respect them as sort of their own instrument? I know that’s what Stevie Wonder says. Martyn Ware No, I’m totally different to Stevie Wonder, as you may have noticed. I think
as a starting point, there’s a reason why instruments have evolved to where
they are over the last few thousand years and not just western instruments,
world instruments. There’s a reason why. They are normally based on natural
harmonic occurrences, etc. The shape of instruments you will hear certain
sounds that don’t require any human intervention at all. I’m more interested in those more basic building blocks rather than trying to make something sound more and more and more like a cor anglais. I’m just not interested in that
shit. In fact, I wasn’t that interested in Walter Carlos, for instance, until he
started to get more abstract. I know he did more experimental stuff form the
start but I didn’t know about it. The Switched On Bach I thought was pretty
but kind of pointless. Because if all you are doing is emulating, what you can do with real instruments, that’s not what it’s about at all. The exciting bit
is what you can’t do with normal instruments that don’t have any analogue
equivalent. That’s not the right word. No analogous equivalent. Actually,
Stevie Wonder is quite interesting as an example. There used to be a band
called Tonto’s Expanding Head Band and I’ve been trying to find it if anybody knows where it is. I’ve looked all over the
Limewire and everything. They were two guys who were kind of academic... Participant It’s on youtube. There’s footage on youtube. Martyn Ware Is it? Yeah, I don’t need footage, I just need the actual albums that they put out and if anybody knows them anyway. They were the guys who went on to work with Stevie Wonder and their instrumental stuff was a thousand times more interesting than the kind of more musically-orientated that they did with
Stevie in my view. Participant When monitoring 3-D sounds, I just wanted to know the positioning of speakers or
how you mix it, how many you use... Martyn Ware I didn’t really explain that, I do apologise. The software can cope with any
speaker locations. The minimum you need is like a cube really, a flattened
cube, so you need eight speakers minimum. You need four as low as you can in any
give space and four as high as you can. But you can go to any number you want,
you don’t have to be in two rings. All you tell the software is where they are
in relation to the centre of the space in X, Y and Z coordinates. So you go: it’s two meters to the right, three meters up, two meters back, but you do
that for every speaker, then you press “go” and it kind of creates... it convolves a virtual space. It creates a virtual space and then you actually can fly the stuff live
through the space, as it knows where all the speakers are. The great thing about it is, our studio in Brixton in London is six meters in diameter, it’s octagonal, it doesn’t have to be that shape, we’ve got two rings of eight speakers. When we created the stuff for the Mexico City installation, completely different
shape, 28 speakers. We just put in the new speaker locations and it
automatically sent the right amount of signal to every speaker. And also, you can play it live. That’s the other cool thing. Imagine sensors attached to dancers, for instance, or ballet dancers so you can interpret the movement of dance on stage for an audience. That’s wild. We’re working with the Royal Ballet to do this at the moment, we’re trying to get the sensors as small as
possible and as accurate as possible. It’s quite difficult, actually. You’d
think it would be easier than it is, because you have to have several... A lot
of them, if you lose the line of sight, you lose the signal. Say, for instance, one of the ballerinas gets hoisted up by her colleague, we can
attach a sound to her so the sound moves up for the audience who are in at the
same time. It’s pretty cool... Stuff like that. And actually we can work with any
size auditorium, indoor or out. To be honest, when we did the Mexico City piece it was the first time we’d done anything that big. So I’d been talking the talk and were we actually going to walk the walk now, and would it sound
as good as we thought because it builds in all the right delays and fade differences, everything, and it’s just mind-bendingly good. Emma Warren I was going to ask about the frequency cut off’s because are there, you know, with
certain speakers up in the air...? Martyn Ware We use full range speakers, but what we’ve found out just through using it,
rather than any kind of theory, is that low frequencies tend to sound physically lower in space and vice versa. I think historically, when we were all cave men and women, you had to use your ears a lot more for survival
purposes. So if there’s a bird of prey coming at you screeching, if you could
hear them from a difference, you had an evolutionary advantage over some other
dude who couldn’t hear anything. So what we found, for instance, is that if we
have a synthetic sound at quite a high pitch and we swoop it through people, through the back of their heads and out the front, they don’t know why but it gives them a thrill. So we just use a lot of these kind of tricks to
manipulate. It’s the wrong word. We were talking about this, there should be a
word for positive manipulation that isn’t so wrong. Manipulate sounds like
we’re mad scientists, we’re not like that. We’re just trying to give people an
interesting experience. Audience Member You started making me think of something I’d seen... I’m just curious to
know, I was listening to something and there’s a level of anxiety it creates,
a certain tone. So, as far as studies, have you found certain frequencies that
can affect certain things? I’m actually interested in finding what these
frequencies are and using them. Martyn Ware We are interested. It’s normally a result of harmony or incidental tones,
things that set your teeth on edge. In this particular case, this is even weirder, I was saying about 111hz having this physiological effect on you... Coincidentally, someone sent me this clip on from, I think it was an American publication, where - they didn’t
know anything about the 111 thing - and there’s these zoo workers have found
out there was some machinery that was in a zoo, a compressor or something, that was giving off a certain frequency. And they analyzed it and they discovered that this particular frequency was driving the crocodiles mad, it was driving the elephants mad, it was driving the animals insane and they realized it was down to this thing and as soon as they changed it it was fine.
It was at 110hz and that blew my mind, because the people who sent it to me didn’t know about the stuff that I’m doing. And also, another thing that blew my mind was they discovered a pulsar recently, the latest pulsar that they discovered is resonating at that particular frequency as well, which is pretty wild. I don’t know what it all means, I have no idea. I’m not saying this like
Erich von Däniken, you know, but
there’s some shit going on that we don’t fully understand. And we’re going to do more research into it as we go along, this Sonic Healing Foundation that I was talking about, we’re going to look into the effects. There are some people who are more into the negative side of it as well, like the infrasound dudes and that’s very macho, I think. I don’t like that stuff, using sound as a weapon and all that stuff. Audience Member I’ve just got a quick question about the spatialisation stuff? How do you get
past the problem of a
dopplereffekt - if you’ve got two speakers and listen in the middle. In order for them to think that it’s moving across it has to pan, the pitch has to go up and then down but if you’re over here then... Martyn Ware Yes, our software has doppler built in. If you want to create a completely realistic sound effect of a car coming across, we all know what that sounds like. We can do that but we found that for compositional purposes it makes
everything sound terrible, because as soon as you move everything towards thecentre it changes pitch. So whilst it’s there, if we wish to use it for certain applications, normally we have it switched off. So all we’re dealing with is the analogy, if it was in the physical world, is like invisible dancers moving around the room with invisible speakers and moving stuff around
a room, 16 of them. Also, it’s not like: “Hey, I’m here I can hear the sound,
I’m there I can’t hear it.” This is like a wish fulfillment thing, there are
some directional speakers but they all sound shit. I’ve tried them all, they
all sound very limited frequency, basically. If anyone knows any different,
please tell me. The point is we’re trying to create a sense of alternative sonic reality, anything that breaks the illusion and sounds kind of tinny
doesn’t work for us. Audience Member I just had a question as to whether the hardware you use is proprietary or you
utilize other peoples? Really quickly, how do you output 28 individual
different sounds discreetly or is that the process? Martyn Ware You can do it live if you’ve got enough soundcards and enough processing. When
we master it, instead of mastering it to stereo, we master it to however many
speakers there are. I like things locked down. I don’t like running things
live off computer because you know and I know they break down. If you’re leaving an installation running, we’ve got one in Paris at the moment in Galeries Lafayette, the biggest department store in Paris, I won’t get another job with them again if it breaks down. So normally, what we do is we put it
down onto a hard disc recorder with each speaker corresponding to a track. That’s the mastering process, but obviously the more speakers you have, the more processing power you need. We’ve just reached a cusp now. I ran the entire Future of Sound tour off this [referring to laptop] and most of the venues had 16 speakers. We were running it live with interaction, with projection running
off the same machine, and it’s not even one of the latest ones. So we’re now at that point where it’s possible to do, and the software is for sale, so what
we’re doing now is... it used to run on something worth 20.000 pounds, a piece
of hardware, now it runs on a laptop that costs 700 dollars and the software
essentially costs nothing though they have to charge for it, of course. The
commercial software costs 3.000 pounds, to educational, who knows? If it was
Red Bull Academy, they’d probably give you a free one. I could definitely give you a free one, I’ve got it right here. The other thing is that a lot of the stuff I do is sponsored by Bowers and Wilkins loudspeakers so all the installations that we do, not the outdoor ones because that’s PA level, but the kind of art galleries and shops
and stuff are all sponsored by Bowers and Wilkins loudspeakers. They could
well be interested in donating some kit to the Red Bull Music Academy actually
in return for a little credit. Emma Warren Do we have any other questions? Torsten Schmidt Well, first of all, thank you for sharing your insight there and there’s about
a million or maybe two million tangents I would love to get off now, but we
would be sitting here for the next three years and might be a bit boring. I
hate to get back to the more profane things, but on a sentimental note and
there’s no hidden message in here, we kind of skipped over the whole “Let Me Go” bit and could we probably get that as a send off. Could you share us a bit about the bassline in it, what was used for the nerds out there? Martyn Ware OK. Who’s got a TB-303? Anybody? Nobody? Anybody got a software version? Well, that was when they first came out. Torsten Schmidt Where did it stand in the debate of the first official use of it then? Martyn Ware It was one of the first, certainly on a dance record. I mean, literally we wrote it the week it came out, the TB-303 and 606. We didn’t like the drummachine so much, to be honest, but we could program slides in and stuff
like that, that was so cool! And actually, very basic sounding oscillators,
which sounded cool as well. Just give me a second, I’ll keep talking rubbish
while I... This is my favourite record we ever did, to be honest with you. And we actually programmed it on a piece of hardware sequencing, a Roland MC-4, was it? Anyway, you know it’s good because it’s got veneer on the sides, you
know? And everything was numbers that you had to programme into it, no interface, everything was numbers, so it’s all mathematics. And I was having this debate the other day, I’ll just share this before I play it. I do a lot of work with Vince Clarke, he has got every analogue synth on earth actually
pretty much, even the academic ones.
Buchla, who is coming in later on, he’s got everything he ever did and it’s all control voltage and gates and attached to a hardware sequencer. And we compared the timing of the hardware sequenced stuff, like Kraftwerk for instance, with Logic and Cubase, on an
oscilloscope. And the timing discrepancies were absolutely horrific,
unbelievable in fact. Every beat would move to bang on to 10 milliseconds late, 20 milliseconds, snap back, next beat was 15 milliseconds and it was kind of random within that range and I think it’s pretty much still like that to this day. So everytime, when you think about using samples, you are never, ever, ever - unless it’s coming off a dedicated piece of hardware, if you‘re doing it via Logic or anything by a computer - it’ll never sound as accurate or as tight or as funky as that shit ever. We’ve proved it, I’ve seen it. It won’t work. And that’s why those Kraftwerk records sound like “Oh, my god!” That’s why the hip-hop dudes love all that shit because it just sounds right on the money, every beat. And
there’s that indefinable shoddiness about it. I hope there’s nobody from Logic here or I’ll get sued, but they know it, it’s not a dedicated piece of kit. Let me play you this, this is “Let Me Go”, my favorite track we ever did. You can’t miss the start, that’s one of those 128 track jobs. (music: Heaven 17 - “Let Me Go” / applause) Another one of those crazy 128 track backing vocal sessions on that. Thank you very much, it was very kind of you to let me play that actually because it’s my favorite. Audience Member [inaudible] Martyn Ware: Yeah, yeah. Everything, yeah. There were no samplers at that time so things like the drums had to be thrown in by hand, all the samples, all that shit. It’s pretty wild stuff, it takes forever. Torsten Schmidt I hate to keep brave Emma there, who is really soldiering on with her cold for
another minute. But maybe, because you’ve been hinting at it a few times with
the background of Sheffield as working class city, and most of us growing up
with pop music as a dirty word, and if I remember correctly yesterday the gentleman
hinting at how everyone is trying to be so hip and so on and so on, how important is the working class ethos and the dreams and the inspirations of the common man for what we really do? Martyn Ware Well, it gives you a bigger audience - that’s for sure. I never thought it was about impressing your peers. I never thought about impressing musicians and I never hung out with them particularly. I always tended to hang out with graphic designers and photographers, I think they give you a different way of
looking at your creativity. I think it’s very important not to just narrow yourself down and say: “I’m a DJ and what I do is I make beats,” you know? And then: “I’ve got a very linear path and if I do well, I’ll make lots of money.” I just think that’s not going to be the way that it’s going to be in the future anyway, so you’re definitely better off if you accept you’re multi-disciplinary at
this point. And I know I’m always banging on about collaboration, but
collaboration, it’s so important, it’s been the joy of my life working with
the people I’ve worked with as a producer and as a band, actually, and I do
miss a lot of the people. And I do miss a lot of that... That’s the problem with this new kind of world where
you’re looking at a computer screen all the time but it makes it even more important that you should try and break down that acknowledged barrier and get back to jamming, yeah? I think that’s really important. Emma Warren OK, before we wrap up then is there one final question? No? Well, I think we
should thank the future face of Martyn Ware.

Matmos
Matmos is widely respected for their sonic adventures at the vanguard of electronic music. The Baltimore duo of Drew Daniel and Martin Schmidt have made a career out of sampling strange and corporeal sounds, including the sound of vacuum-cleaned body fat.
In their 2010 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, Daniel and Schmidt discuss everything from working with Björk and sampling to their 2008 album Supreme Balloon.
Hosted by Todd Burns OK, please welcome Matmos. Drew Daniel and Martin
Schmidt. I thought it would be best to start our discussion with a song, this is called “Lipostudio… and So On,” and if you look up on the screen there, you can see a very dark rendition of the video that they often play when they play it in concert. (music: Matmos – “Lipostudio… And So On”) Todd Burns So what was that sound that we just heard? Drew Daniel This is a record that we made in 2000 called A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure and it was a record based on a theme of medical technology. We tend to make work, which we regard as conceptual, in the sense that we make a conceptual
commitment to an idea, then we think about all the possible actions and events
or objects, which express or manifest that idea in a way which could be made
sonic. Then we have to do the research of getting into situations where we can
acquire the recordings of those actions or events or objects. Then we take it
home to our studio and build it into music. So one of the things we were thinking about in terms of the ways that medical technology makes sound, of course, that is recording the sound of surgery itself. And so we went to
plastic surgery clinics. For that track, that was also a recording made in Southern California of liposuction and we recorded these procedures. What you’re hearing in that breakdown, which is why Martin was like, “Wait for this
part,” is not the sound of our friend Stephen playing clarinet or somebody
playing drums. You heard lots of “real” instruments, but also the solo in that breakdown is a surgeon, who knew what I wanted was something musically
expressive, and so he selected a slightly larger cannula, which is the sucking needle that they use in liposuction. Martin Schmidt You know, the thing that I used to call the crevice device on vacuum cleaners,
to get into corners? It is sort of like that. Drew Daniel And he shoves it into the wound area [video on projector screen] and starts playing the incision in this woman’s
body. She is unconscious at the time. It’s very disturbing at the time,
actually, because they do the incisions all at once around the area and they all start to bleed. And so you’re sitting there in this room, it’s a sterile environment and you can’t compromise it and touch anything, and you are just
moving a microphone around as carefully as you can and trying to gather these
sounds. But what I didn’t expect is that the medical technicians would really
get into being musicians and started to kind of ham it up. Todd Burns So they did ham it up? Drew Daniel Yeah, like, “You want me to suck louder? Let’s do this!” Martin Schmidt “Suck louder,” how many of us have said that? Drew Daniel The nurse technician got kind of emo and she would fling down the scalpel on the tray and it would make noise. Martin Schmidt You actually had to tell them to settle down. Drew Daniel They had to chill down a little bit and I just needed the sounds of what was
happening in the room. It was an incredible experience for us to work on that record and kind of personally tricky because I am a total lightweight. I mean, I passed out giving blood. I’m not butch about blood and suffering at all. Knowing that I was there to capture sound was a way of avoiding thinking about the ethical problems with what we were doing. Todd Burns On this particular track, I remember reading an interview where you said that you had people playing instruments as well, doing things, and they would play things as though you
were trying to make people think, “Oh, well that’s the liposuction part.” Martin Schmidt Definitely. It ends up being a trio between the surgeon, the saxophonist and me playing a straw in a bowl of water. And I told the saxophonist and I was thinking myself, “I want to be the sound of the liposuction more than...”
There is hopefully this crossfade of what’s what here? Drew Daniel Where you can’t tell the difference between human fat and a saxophone and water. Because sonically, when you know there is liposuction noises and the clarinet player makes a squelchy sound, you’re going to hear that squelch as
if it was human fat. And hopefully, if you can manipulate the human fat
noises, you can manipulate the things that sound more saxophone-like. It is
like those Arcimboldo portraits, have you ever seen those? Those baroque paintings of a face that is made out of a load of rotting vegetables or oysters, it is like seeing two things at once, seeing saxophone and human fat as versions of each other. I think that’s our goal. If you do that, then it is working. Todd Burns So it’s important in your work, to bridge that gap between making sound the
issue, rather than, “This is the saxophone and you can hear the solo. You can hear this
thing. You can hear that thing.” It’s all just material for what you can create? Drew Daniel I think a song can do some powerful work to level down the difference between
what is valuable and what isn’t. What is a real musical instrument and what
isn’t? What takes talent and what is random? I like the way that you can level down the differences between those through the kind of control that production
gives you. But it might be an illusion. It has been weird to have people listen to that record and have them say, “I liked it until I found out what it was and I didn’t want to hear it any more.” And I kind of love the idea that you can love something sonically, but then you can be so disgusted by what’s contained
inside it that you just can’t enjoy it any more. To me, that is more interesting than even a record that somebody wants to hear a million times. As
a record, that is a version of a Pasolini movie, like Salò, which you see once and every time you think of it, it makes you think, “I never want
to see that again.” Todd Burns We will talk a bit more about the concepts, but I guess, I want to go back now, how did you get to the place where you are creating this music? Drew grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, and there was quite a big punk scene there growing
up. Was it mostly hardcore music at the beginning for you? Drew Daniel Yeah, I got incredibly into punk rock and hardcore and going to shows. I wasn’t musical. I had no training of any kind, no musical ability whatsoever. But I did a magazine and would cut up images and make standard punk rock collages and I was reading a lot of [William S.] Burroughs when I was 16 and reading his descriptions of using tape decks to cut up sound. He had cutouts of sound as ways to change environments or to change personality, so I got a bunch of tape decks and I started to make tape loop collages. I didn’t have a four-track, so I would get five tape decks playing sounds and recorded on a sixth and that would be my multi-tracking and you just layer that. I just made hours and
hours of endless garbage. Martin Schmidt Cute parallel lives because I did that exact same thing. I had a friend who was dyslexic and when I was in college – I am seven years older than Drew, so I was in college while he was in high school and sadly I was doing the same
things in college that he was doing in high school. But anyway, the university would give him free, cheesy black plastic tape recorders and so I was like, “Can you get another one? And another one? And another one?” And he
got six of them and that is how I would do multi-tracking as well. Record and then playback on one. All with Sparkletts plastic water bottles that make sort of awesome congas. You know like the water cooler at the office? In fact, there is one in the room. Todd Burns Were you also into rock music? Martin Schmidt Not like Drew, no. I was an extremely late music listener. I didn’t really even understand why people were interested in pop music until I got really tired of getting beat up. Then I realized, like – this is the late ’70s, mind you – “If I smoke Marlboro cigarettes and grow my hair long and listen to heavy metal
music, people will stop beating me up.” And I cynically did those things. I
bought a pack of cigarettes, I stopped cutting my hair. At the time you could smoke in school. Martin Schmidt Awesome. Martin Schmidt And I started hanging around the smoking section. What do you know? I never got beat up again. People are so lame. They weren’t beating me up. They didn’t know where to put me so they put me in the garbage can. Drew Daniel He lucked out because he got to see all the old school California hardcore
acts, like Dead Kennedys, Black Flag before
Henry [Rollins], all the classic hardcore that by the time I got to it was like studying something in a history class. Todd Burns When did it stop becoming a pose for you? Martin Schmidt You can imagine how great that makes you feel. Everybody does this to every generation. “You saw Jimi Hendrix? That’s awesome! You must be so old!” Drew Daniel The cool thing about hardcore in Kentucky in the ‘80s was that it was culture
that you made yourself. You would go to a basement, which had 20 people in the basement and everybody in the audience, they are all in bands too. There is less of a division between producer and consumer and, really, there is no
consumption. My ‘zine cost 10 cents, I made it on a photocopier at five cents
a page. This idea that you could make things and you could do it yourself, it
sounds really cliché now, and it has been totally appropriated by languages of
advertising and marketing and media, but at the time it really felt compellingly the case that you could just make things and instantly disseminate them and that there was no barriers, really. And in a place as sort of fucked up and right-wing and homophobic and heavily Republican and Christian as Kentucky in the mid-’80s, it was incredible. It was like joining the Army to be in a punk
band, we just totally drank the Kool-Aid and joined this tiny sect of intensely-felt commitment. Todd Burns Was that also constricting, in a way? Drew Daniel Sure, totally, because it was homophobic too. It was a straight-edge scene and it had formal limitations, which became pretty obvious that it was about rock & roll.
Basically, louder and faster and more distorted, but pretty much formulaic and not as compelling as the Merzbow and Nurse with Wound records I
was listening to. The limitations were there. Martin Schmidt Drew actually had someone throw a bone at him from a car. Drew Daniel Yeah, I got punk-bashed like crazy. These kids from the high school – have you ever had chewing tobacco in your mouth? It produces this warm orange-brown spit. I got chewing tobacco spat in my face and you feel this warm brown lump sliding down your
face, and the kids that spat chewing tobacco at me also threw a bone at me. They were like fucking cavemen in Kentucky. Todd Burns Drew, you wrote a book recently on Throbbing Gristle. Where does Throbbing Gristle come into it for you as a kid? Because I remember reading the first chapter and you heard this and your mind opened up, “Slug Bait” and these other songs. Drew Daniel I was basically into punk rock and rock & roll and then I bought this record by a band called Throbbing Gristle, and didn’t know anything about them, but I thought the name sounded cool. I thought they would be punk rock and put them on and instead it was just this intense, bass-y, throbbing sound that gave me
this horrible headache. I had never had music that did that to me, that affected me physically and wasn’t about feeling empowered or part of some community or some lonely set of fanatics, but instead seemed deeply inhuman and anti-
human. And there was something about the intensity of what Throbbing Gristle were doing aesthetically. It was very disturbing and not about belonging, but about sort of a total isolation. And I think that is compelling. Too many people bash electronic music for being inhuman and, “It’s so cold,” and they bring to bear
this sort of boring humanist idea about warmth. I think aesthetically it’s a
good modernist strategy sometimes to just pound the living shit out of whatever is supposedly human and see what’s left on the other side. I don’t think that is necessarily a bad thing. I don’t think that should be the only game in town. But certainly, when you’re 16 you can relate to that sensibility. Maybe not when I’m 39 now. Oops. [laughter] Todd Burns I wasn’t going to say anything. You spent a year in England as well when you
went to college, I suppose? Drew Daniel I did a junior year abroad and it was a good time because it was right when
the Castlemorton rave happened and a lot of ridiculous free soundsystem parties were happening in the UK, so I got exposed to a totally different aesthetic. It kind of reminded me of hardcore, in the sense that it was pretty ghetto and it wasn’t expensive and it wasn’t about money and it was sort of autonomous. Todd Burns Was it the first sort of introduction you had to dance music in a large way? Drew Daniel Pretty much. Aside from go-go dancing in gay bars. Todd Burns You were doing that before? And you met Martin before you went over to England? Martin Schmidt That’s how we met. I put a dollar in his underwear. Drew Daniel I was wearing a plastic fish jockstrap that I had made and there was a tail that came out of my ass and I would fit my junk in the fish’s mouth, I guess. I also knew that Martin made electronic music because I had seen his band play. He was is in this sort of occult industrial band called the IAO Core, which performed at this punk rock space, Gilman Street warehouse. Martin Schmidt The punk rock space that gave us Green Day. Drew Daniel Yay! No, boo. Can you believe that they’re a Broadway show now? Fuuuck. That must hurt so bad. Martin Schmidt How un-punk. Drew Daniel It’s really over. I
knew about Martin’s band because I had seen them play at this event that was
hosted by Ordo Templi Orientis, which is a cult dedicated to Aleister Crowley, the great early 20th century Satanist. They were all in leather and straps and looking like
dominatrixes and then there was this really square suburban guy who was really
cute and made all the rhythms, and I was like, “Damn, he’s hot!” So I liked it
when you put a dollar in my G-string. That was sort of how the band got started. Martin Schmidt And he taught me about techno because I didn’t know that it existed. I was floating at that point in a world of late ‘70s German electronic music, before Cluster and Faust and that sort of thing became something that everybody knew about. I don’t know, in like 1990. I swear I was kind of alone in that, but that’s what I was super into, this late ‘70s German electronic music, which he had never heard. I had never heard of... Drew Daniel I made a mixtape, like when you’re totally crushed out on somebody and you make a mixtape when you want them to absorb all the styles that you love, and they have to love it as much as you and love every song for the right reason.
I think you turned me on to Cluster and Roedelius and I made this mixtape that was Nurse With Wound, Meat Beat Manifesto, Public Enemy, My Bloody Valentine, a bunch of breakbeat techno and that is basically the template. You imprint really hard in your adolescence on certain records. Todd Burns And you were already doing stuff production-wise with samplers? Drew Daniel My boyfriend at the time had a house, and if you had a house, you could sign up for a layaway plan where you could pay for a sampler on an installment of 20 bucks a month. So I got a Roland
W-30, which is what MC Hammer used. It had 27 seconds of sample time per diskette that you put in, if you were doing stuff at, I think, 12 bit. And I would put
sounds that I wanted to sample onto cassette, speed it up to double time, sample it for 1.2 seconds, and then drop it an octave so it could be a 2.4
second loop. I would sequence by counting numerically the exact length of a sample and then I would have to chop every other samples into 8ths or 16ths or 32nds because there wasn’t really a way to quantize internally in its sequencer. You had to do all these funky math tricks in order to get the most out of that 27 seconds
of sample time. But it was an incredible lesson in the economy of information.
If you only get 27 seconds of sample time to make a song, then you better really fucking care about every single sound. It has to really belong for a reason, it has to be there. Now that we live in the days of hundreds and hundreds of gig drives and people can have a million tracks and can just keep piling on more and more information, I think there’s less of that gun to your head about what really matters to you. I think the severity of it was really helpful in certain ways. Todd Burns Obviously, you were trading music back and forth, but you were also teaching Martin about how you are doing sampling and stuff? Martin Schmidt He was really amazing with that sampler but actually my come-on line to him was like, “Have you ever used a computer?” Because I had a computer, which was a big deal in 1990 to have something that you could actually record audio onto and edit audio on. He was like, “Yeah, can I edit sound on your computer?” Drew Daniel Come up and look at my etchings. So we spent months making musique concrète, cut up sound edits. Martin Schmidt Our common interest was Pierre Henry. Anybody? Anybody? Alright, the late ‘50s pioneer of cutting tape up and trying to invent a new kind of classical music that didn’t involve pitches, that just involved the sounds
recorded from the world. There was this notion that this guy pretty much – not Pierre Henry, but Pierre Schaeffer – sold to the
French Music Academy, to the government of France, in a way that this will be the new music... and it will not
involve Germans! Which was a real positive thing, as you can imagine in the early ‘50s in France. It was like the most obscure fucking thing that you could possibly think of for 20 year olds in 1990 and we both loved it, “And
nobody knows about this.” Drew Daniel We got really obsessed with one piece in particular, Variations for a Door and a Sigh, which is probably his greatest work. It’s an
obsessive piece of tape composition built out of the sound of one creaking
hinge in the attic of a French country house. And he spent months analyzing the sound of just one creaking door and working over and over obsessively with manipulating and chopping. Martin Schmidt Mind you, this is someone who only has a reel-to-reel tape recorder to work with. Drew Daniel An intense kind of labor of love. Martin Schmidt It’s like a 45 minute piece, and it’s listenable. Drew Daniel It’s not bullshit. There was a lot of wanky crap from that period that is sort of modernist in its refusal to give pleasure but isn’t formally compelling on its own. Whereas Variations for a Door and a Sigh is powerful, there is
something alchemical that seemed to happen in the encounter with this object.
And for us that was really inspiring, the idea that you could commit yourself
totally to something that looks on paper like it would be so banal and so uninteresting, but in fact, if you just trust your materials and force yourself to be almost anorexically committed to one thing, and one thing only, then out of the other side comes this really interesting and rich experience and Henry inspired us. For years we’ve been ripping him off, basically. Todd Burns So perhaps it’s a bad example, but I want to play something from your first
record and just say, OK, this is the culmination of all the stuff that you were doing, one of them. (music: Matmos – “This Is...”) Todd Burns I think it’s interesting because on “Lipostudio…” and that song – “Lipostudio...” to a lesser extent – you talk a lot about all this stuff and make stuff that is exceptionally listenable. Drew Daniel That piece wasn’t. That was from our first record, which came out in ‘97, but we had made the tracks around ‘93, ‘94, ‘95 for a while, you know, just getting to know each other. I think when you’re making your first record you are really
letting your influences hang out and you’re trying to sound often like records that you love. I was listening to tons of things like Kaotic Chemistry, an incredible early drum & bass record called LSD EP, one of the most chopped up breakbeat techno records ever. But frankly, I do feel a little embarrassed to hear that track because it is just so strongly like “My first jungle,” it is strongly derivative of other music. We have been having a good time playing it live, we just played at this anniversary of SF MOMA, it was really fun to play that track live because in a way, playing a completely
traditional sounding drum & bass track in 2010 is hilariously anachronistic
and sort of awkward aesthetically. Because electronic music’s justifying
rationale for so long was that it was futuristic or about the future and there
is nothing less sexy than the recent past. If you watch a movie made in 2002,
that was incredibly trendy in 2002... I don’t know if you’ve seen Alex Cox’s adaptation of the Revengers Tragedy, but it’s this incredibly London stylish 2002 movie, and if you watch it now, your skin just
crawls. It’s worth thinking about if you make electronic music, because it’s so easy to participate in a scene and to get the sounds and the production tics and tricks that are cool right now, the last ten records you heard this month. It’s so easy to blend in, and you have to be aware what you are doing, especially when you put out a record because that record is going to last a
long time. In our case, I’m feeling like a weird trickle of cold sweat listening to something that I made in 1996. Todd Burns So in your work now, do you think about timelessness? Martin Schmidt It’s been a source of argument between us, always, since then, that I was
like, “You’re making something that is not going to last.” I say pretentious shit like that, but when you’re alone in the studio you figure no one is ever going to hear you. So you’re like, “This is not timeless! It doesn’t partake
of timeless woo!” But it is true, it is something to think about. Drew Daniel I don’t know, dude. That Goldie album was called Timeless, yo. You can’t be timeless, that’s impossible. You’re always a reflection of the
total set of forces in the room that is part of why you’re doing what you are
doing. Martin Schmidt But you can choose. There are choices there. Drew Daniel We’ve only had three hours of sleep. I don’t know if I have to point that out or if it’s already completely obvious. Todd Burns This goes to a question I had anyway. Clearly, you are a duo. Is it always arguments in the studio over every single track? Drew Daniel Pretty much. We have gotten into huge, “I will leave you” arguments about whether, do we put reverb on the snares? We’ve been together 18 years, we have made eight albums, we have done a lot of tours, we have put a lot of extra pages in
our passport and we still scream and yell about the most retarded trivial shit imaginable. It’s a function about caring over your details and sweating the details. I think it would be easier if we were intuitive people and we would just simply sit down and express. Martin Schmidt You mean, like I’m going to make a song about... my pain is real! Todd Burns With the recent album you even had different track listings for the vinyl and CD. Martin Schmidt There it is! There it was, Drew’s record and Martin’s version of the same
record. Drew Daniel We were still having horrible arguments while mastering the record. When you are mastering it’s like, “OK, you really need to know, is this song on the record or not?” And we couldn’t... Martin Schmidt Oh, I could! Drew Daniel And so could I! Martin Schmidt Except we’re supposed to take turns in who is in charge of these records and it was my turn and what ended up happening, Drew? Drew Daniel Martin did the CD and so the CD is Martin’s version of the album, and the vinyl is my version of the album. Martin Schmidt That is such fucking bullshit! I absolutely feel it right now. Fuck you! I can’t believe that I let you do that. It was your idea! To like, “Oh, we’ll take turns
being in charge of the records.” Your idea! Drew Daniel So now we have signs in the studio when we’re working on the record... Martin Schmidt I took them down and threw them away. Drew Daniel ...that would say, “Martin is in charge of the new Matmos record,” so when I’m about to argue with him, I’ll just look at the sign and be like... You need the vinyl because it has the
track we did with Terry Riley that’s really awesome. Martin Schmidt Which isn’t as awesome as Drew thinks it was. Terry Riley is great, the song just didn’t turn out that well. Drew Daniel You’re just wrong. Todd Burns I don’t even know where to begin from here. [laughter] Martin Schmidt By saying, “Martin, you’re right.” Todd Burns Martin, I like the CD version of the record. Drew, I haven’t heard the vinyl version of the record. [Martin laughs] Drew Daniel Collaboration is difficult. It’s difficult because production appeals to control freaks, it appears to solitary ego-driven people who want to create their own private worlds. I wish you could see the Venn diagram of electronic music production and autism. I wonder how much of the pie is similar. I think it’s
important that neither of us gets to be completely happy about these records and that is why they are more than what I could do by myself. I could make records by myself, and I do sometimes, but they are not as compelling to me as to what I make with Martin. Todd Burns So, let’s perhaps move on. You talk about being a control freak and having control and you’ve worked with a bunch of other people on their projects, Björk being the big example. Martin Schmidt She was in charge of that one. There were no arguments. She was right. Todd Burns I guess, putting yourself in that mode, how was that? Completely different?
You just try to do your best with the 80 percent of the track that she gave you? Martin Schmidt I found that experience creatively pretty frustrating, because for my entire life I
have been in charge of the art that I made, and I put a huge store in the back of my mind to knowing that I can do whatever I want. That, if in the middle of the show, I choose to pull my pants off and sing opera, it’s my fucking show and that’s OK because it’s my show. And it really, really bugged me that I couldn’t pull my pants down and sing opera. Drew Daniel I think you probably could and nobody would notice, right? Because it’s Björk and everybody’s watching her. Martin Schmidt OK, Drew. But that was also true, people weren’t looking at me. That was also
a big problem for me. Todd Burns Jealous, basically. Martin Schmidt It was also a problem. Todd Burns Let’s play a track off the record, Aurora is the record. Martin Schmidt It’s too bad we don’t have the video. (music: Björk – “Aurora”) Drew Daniel I get really stressed out every time I hear a Björk song because I have an instinct like, “God I am supposed to be on stage, the Björk song has started.” The first tour was a year long, where we were on tour for a year living out of a
suitcase and just being on tour for a year non-stop. I had never really done that before. It”s weird to be part of a big family and a big group and not be... Martin Schmidt The whole thousands and thousands and thousands of people looking at you was
very different from the shows that we play generally too. Drew Daniel The first show we played in Paris on that Vespertine tour, we were in the band with Björk, obviously, and Zeena Parkins
playing harp. And backstage afterwards Martin and Zeena and I were like, “Fuck! I thought people kind of liked our shows. They applaud when we”re done, but no, they don’t like our stuff. This is the real thing.” We just
walked out and people were screaming and screaming so loud, we had quad monitors, four huge monitors all around us and just the sound of people shrieking and freaking the fuck out because Björk is standing right there was just terrifying. It was really scary. Martin Schmidt What you are trying to say, it was louder than our monitors. Tven though there’s giant monitors were right next to us, I couldn’t hear them because of people’s
screaming. That is weird. Drew Daniel Stop loving Björk so much, you guys. Get over it, Jesus! Drew Daniel It was fun to have the opportunity, but fun is such a trivial word because it was really scary because we thought we were going to fuck up her music and we’re going to fuck up these shows because we are not very professional. I think Björk has always had a team of people who can make you kind of bulletproof, and she wants people that are a little bit sloppy and a little
bit rough and aren’t so used to that. And that wound up being the case when we were there working on programming for Vespertine. We had never been in a studio where you paid by the hour ever in our lives. I had never been in one. We had only made records at home in our bedroom until, all of a sudden, we are at Olympic Studios with Spike Stent and he’s
mixed Spice Girls, U2 and Madonna and we’re sitting there going, “Maybe you should have a breakdown here.” Martin Schmidt And everyone falls silent in the room and goes [turns his head dramatically and goes silent]. Drew Daniel “Who are you?” Martin Schmidt “ISpeaker: Martin Schmidt
m sorry that I said anything, I am so sorry! I was playing Sim City before, I’ll go back to it now!” And then they did it. It was cool. It was like a stupid MTV show. Like, Imposters
Go To Rocktown. And now that show is over. On the other hand, I am sort of glad that it’s over, too, because it wasn’t my band. Drew Daniel It was really to fun to work with Björk and I really enjoyed it and it gave us
opportunities to try things on a scale that we never would have done on our own. I mean, Martin walking rhythmically in a pile of rock salt in front of 60 thousand people would not happen at a Matmos show. But it does at Roskilde. He walks
rhythmically on rock salt all the time in Baltimore during the blizzard. Martin Schmidt I have to use kitty litter now. Drew Daniel But it’s true as well that I like to make all of a work of art and being part of a production team for a pop star. Even a pop star as experimental and open and
free as Björk — and she is incredibly unusual in that kind of climate in her
willingness to go to places aesthetically that other people on that scale won’t go — is still a part of a very different kind of ecology or ecosystem of how you contribute and what it means to contribute. I’ve got to say, I kind of like making Matmos records where I get to make all of it, even if only 10,000 people hear it or 15,000 people hear it versus millions of people hearing a
Björk record. It—s not like one is more authentic than the other or one is better. I think it has more to do with my particular skill set. There are people who would be incredible producers of pop music, who are making
incredibly cool sounding pop music all the time, but it—s just not me. And that is part of the humbling reality, I wasn’t a great producer for Bjork. I wasn’t very good at listening emotionally to where she wanted to take a particular track. Martin Schmidt We get lost in, “No, but what about this fucked up, weird detail?” Drew Daniel “Why do you want one snare? Why don’t you have ten different snare sounds?” Martin Schmidt Drew had to point out to me about a thousand times during that thing that people who
make pop music hopefully want to make pop music, and it—s not like people who make weird noisy music wish they were making pop music. Because I kept feeling like, “Why doesn’t she do something weirder?” Well, because... Drew Daniel From her point of view she had written those songs, Vespertine is Björk’s
album. She had written melodies, she had written lyrics, the music was constructed
and we were there to contribute production ideas and percussive patterns and
sequences. But essentially you are doing the equivalent of set design for a play that somebody else has written, where they have got the big story and you are there to assist them in telling that big story. And I think there’s better and worse, more and less egotistical ways, of serving the interests of a song. Whereas from our point of view, we are all about collage and all about sound
and chopping radically and avoiding belonging in a genre. And voices hog mid range. It’s just true. Martin Schmidt The human voice robs all the fun of music-making for me. Drew Daniel That’s a little extreme. Martin Schmidt I don’t know. As soon as someone is speaking or singing, it is over for the
rest of the sounds. The rest of the sounds now have become in a support role for the human voice. Come on, man, look at the EQ on a mixing board. If they’re going to put parametrics on it, where are they? They are right in the
human voice range. Why? Because fucking 99.9 percent of what we do is listen to human voices. It’s not even a matter of mixing. Drew Daniel Why don’t you stop talking in protest? Martin Schmidt You just want to stop me talking. You don’t want to stop human voices, you
just want to stop mine. And it worked. Drew Daniel When we were working with Björk, we had to go with a lot of ultra lows or ultra highs and that is why we go with lots of crispy bacon frying noises as hi-hats and things, or take the little spit sounds of her lip separating and amplify them massively up the high end and
then chop the lows, and do it again, and do it again, and do it again and step it up two octaves. Then you have got something high enough that it won’t interrupt Björk, so she can hog the mid-range and we can write basslines. It was just our way of solving a problem acoustically of, “How do you make space for a vocal that is that huge?” Todd Burns If you’re listening to Vespertine and listening to a track, perhaps not
“Aurora,” what can you pinpoint and say, “OK, that’s what Matmos added. That’s the set design?” Drew Daniel It’s tricky. The way she worked on that album was to get Marius De Vries to program rhythms, and we would program rhythms… Martin Schmidt She had like 125 tracks that she then was like, “This from here and this from here and this from here.” Drew Daniel She would wait until it was the day to mix a song and she would go down to mixing board and mute everything and just listen. Sometimes she would have a Matthew Herbert kick drum pattern and a Matmos snare, and these were patterns that were never made to go with each other, but she
was just listening to what actually works and what actually serves the song.
And it was highly collectivist in a weird way, even though it sounds like a total dictatorial thing on her part where she is the auteur in charge. It was not like there was any one person whose total vision was getting expressed, it was very much this collective model and she was in charge. I feel like when I hear Vespertine now – and I don’t listen to it very often just because it is maybe too nostalgic or something – it’s tricky. I can hear at the end of “Unison,” we did it all, the rhythms on “Unison.” We did a lot of the rhythms for “Aurora.” But the snow
crunching was, I think, Marius De Vries did that. It’s such a clusterfuck that it’s hard for me to put my finger on what’s us. Todd Burns Do you think that artists who work with you on your own records and add things
feel the same way at the end? Martin Schmidt We don’t give them long enough generally so they don’t get to feel good or bad or anything. Generally, it’s about an hour. Drew Daniel People come over and think that we are all going to jam and play together and
then it turns out being this weirdly cold thing that’s more like a photo shoot or something. Martin Schmidt Go like, wom... wom, wom... wom... wom. Along with nothing. Because then we just cut it, cut it, cut it, stretch it, do whatever we like to make it fit into the song. It’s barely like playing music. Drew Daniel There are so many ways to collaborate now with people. I can shoot an e-mail to this guy Rudolf Eb.er in
Japan and say, “Will you record kendo rehearsals?” And he'll record himself doing kendo, send it to us and that is one
type of collaboration. Another will be getting the Kronos Quartet to come to our house and record the string part, and it’s for a song that’s a tribute to Joe Meek. And because he would mic strings in this very ghetto lo-fi way, we are recording the Kronos Quartet and we’re
doing it with just two mics in one room and that is all there is to it, it’s not particularly hi-fi. Martin Schmidt That was an overwrought collaboration, where we had to send our fucked up cut-
up music to a transcriber, who listened to a tape and then wrote it out in staff form for the Kronos Quartet to then play and that was just amazing. Have you ever used Babel Fish translator where you type something and it comes back? You do it again a couple of times and it
comes out like this crazy poetry. That’s what this was like, only using this
human being as a filter for sound. “Like, OK, take our messed up thing that we made
with all these plug-ins and filters and stuff, and turn that into sheet music
that a string quartet will now play.” Including all this stuff that we sort of
assumed that he would ignore, like the sort of [makes electronic noises],
there they were, like [mimes playing violin]. Like, “Wow, is that on there?” That
was amazing. And then we ended up cutting out those things that he had laboriously transcribed onto paper, things that should have been cut out in the first
place. It was really expensive too. Drew Daniel It was a trade-off, remember? Kronos? Oh yeah, no. Arrangers are expensive. Martin Schmidt Not doing that again. Actually, we worked with an awesome arranger last time
we played in London. Drew Daniel Anna Meredith, a Scottish composer. Martin Schmidt Fucking amazing. Drew Daniel She did a version of “Supreme Balloon” for 20-piece strings and horns and that was really fun to get to play. Martin Schmidt The London Contemporary Orchestra. Drew Daniel It was weird to play modular synthesizer noodling jam and to treat that as something that you could notate and then have played by traditional instruments. It really exposes your boneheaded cave-person compositional retardedness on a scale that’s quite shaming. It reminds me of Deep Purple Live at the Albert Hall. Todd Burns You mentioned Supreme Balloon and it seems like that album was a departure
in terms of the way that you constructed it, in terms of from your past work.
Can you describe a little bit about why and what the difference was? Martin Schmidt That was my album. It was my turn. I was just like, “Let’s swing away. We are the band that does the goofy samples of things band…” Drew Daniel It was getting too much of a wackiness ghetto. If you’re in the wacky ghetto too long, it’s annoying. It’s like, “Oh my God they made a song with snails. There is a song made with burning human flesh, how kooky.” Martin Schmidt I thought, no microphones, at all. We will do all synthesis. Todd Burns Should we play a track? “Cloudhopper” or “Supreme Balloon”? (music: Matmos – “Cloudhoppers”) Martin Schmidt Did you want to ask something? Todd Burns I guess, I just wanted you to talk a little bit about the construction of the album. Because you went to a lot of interesting places to find these old modular synthesizers. Drew Daniel Once we’ve got an idea, we try to let the world tell us what the hell it is that we should be doing with this, to a certain extent. It was amazing that during the time that we were working on that record that we were asked to come
to the GRM in Paris, which is the home of musique concrète. It
is the foundation that that guy Pierre Schaeffer started as part of Radio France, that’s still going, god bless the French who so believe in experimental culture. It’s still receiving full-funding in an attempt to create a classical music without
pitches. Drew Daniel Try to imagine the British Ministry of Cubism. There’s a Ministry of Cubism that funds Cubist paintings. Martin Schmidt Still a million dollars a year since 1930. Drew Daniel At GRM they had this incredible Ali Baba’s cave of weird old gear in the basement that none of them were using because they’ve all gone digital and they have all gone software. We said, “Can we see and access some of this old
stuff?” They had this thing called the
Coupigny that was designed in the ’60s by this engineer Francis Coupigny. It’s a little bit like the EMS Synthi. It’s ten oscillators, no
ADSR, so there is no wave shaping. You connect and chain oscillators to other oscillators through a
matrix pin system. So there is a matrix, in which three different links can create three different kinds of connections. You can have signal model modulate
signal, signal modulate voltage, or voltage modulate voltage. So the different
densities construct these different relationships as you sort of cascade one
sound into another. It was ten oscillators. Martin Schmidt Ten oscill... Are there any modular synthesis people? It’s crazy, ten modular oscillators.
It’s really impractical. From a musical standpoint, this thing was not made to
make music. It was made to make insane noises. Nobody was ever going to be like [sings melody]. There was no keyboard on it and no way to hook up the keyboard to it. Beautiful. Drew Daniel I can play some examples of what it sounds like, if you want to hear it. We also made various pilgrimages to players of synthesizers, who were able to get performances that we are incapable of doing. OK, here is an example of the
Coupigny going off. (music: Coupigny synthesizer examples) Todd Burns Also, on your albums, of course, you guys always talk about, “OK, this album
is the medical album,” but you have people playing clarinet, guitars. The concept has never been the end-all, be-all. It has been a guide but you’re
willing to make exceptions. Martin Schmidt We’re trying to make listenable music. Purer art is like, “OK, here is the
concept, we executed the concept and these are the results and that’s that.”
Take it or leave it. Drew Daniel The Sol Lewitt idea that the
concept is the machine that creates the work. That’s from his Paragraphs on Conceptual Art, one of these important manifestos of conceptual art as
a technique. And it’s very disinterested in execution and craft, it’s all about
the concept is the work. We are whores. We want to make a record that you want to listen to, that you want to tap your toes to, that you want to hear
more than once, ideally... Martin Schmidt …and that also fulfills those conceptual ideals as well. Drew Daniel I want to have the conceptual cake and eat it as a pop desert too, I guess, is the
point. You want to have gone to all the trouble of getting snails to interrupt the path of a laser that’s aimed at a light sensitive Theremin, but you want the solo played by those snails to actually sound cool. Todd Burns I guess that goes into the performance aspect of what you do in terms of making it. Clearly, electronic music has had this bad rep, performatively, of people looking at a laptop. And you go out of your way to replicate what
you’re doing in the studio to make sure that people have at least something to look at, something to engage with. I guess, we will be seeing a video. (video: Matmos at San Francisco Art Institute) Drew Daniel It makes me laugh when I hear the little voices going, “OK, go for it, all right!” Because they’re all from these free CDs that you get when you buy
nicotine patches. And the CDs are about encouraging you that you can quit smoking, you really can, it’s going to work. And there’s all these sounds of co-workers sort of celebrating their freedom from tobacco. Martin Schmidt OK! Drew Daniel Congratulations on your decision to stop smoking! And Martin was on the patch for
15 years. You’re supposed to be on it for two weeks and then just get over it, but
we had this arrested development thing for like 15 years. So we had all these CDs laying around and I felt like I got to use this. It just sounds so square
and uncool when they are like, “Yeah, let’s party!” Martin Schmidt Let’s party by being not too excessive! Let’s be prudent! Drew Daniel That gets at the Soft Pink Truth, me trying to make dance music, but I’ve always had a
very weird and alienated relationship to dance music because being a closet fag in Kentucky that was into hardcore, I thought that I couldn’t be into dance music because that’s what would make me gay. When I was in the closet. There was this feeling that gay people like Erasure. And I like Black Flag, I don’t relate to queer people, so I must not be gay because I like this. Martin Schmidt Thank heavens the Japanese model of “your look and your lifestyle have no connection to the music that you listen to at all” is now taking over the entire world. Drew Daniel You look at Tokio Hotel and they look
badass and then you hear them and it’s the worst music you have ever heard in your life. Martin Schmidt It is a radical thing that has happened over the last 20 years. Drew Daniel The final death of authenticity. So anyway, Soft Pink Truth is my stupid issues of shame about queerness and dance music finally overcompensating through this very pleasure-orientated, fun, ridiculous project. Todd Burns You said you had been doing quite a few more shows in Baltimore? Drew Daniel We moved from San Francisco where everyone is cold and chilly and folds their
arms and is here because the blog said it might be good and they can’t wait to post the first message that, in fact, it’s not good. Whereas in Baltimore, people don’t give a fuck and they just want to have a good time and get sweaty
and dance because their lives are miserable because they live in an economic crater. Martin Schmidt It’s maybe not that dramatic. It’s not that extreme, but there is definitely a lot more of, people are not trying to get famous because they live in Baltimore, so they are quite sure that nothing is ever going to happen. They are, in fact, actually just making music to entertain and illuminate the people who came to the show who are their friends. And they aren’t looking beyond that. The
people go to the shows to be amused and illuminated by their friends making
music, and the whole thing ends there. It’s amazing. You remember, “That’s right,
that’s what we do.” There isn’t this third generation, cynical, “If I was really trying to make it, I’d move to Brooklyn or Berlin. I can’t really make music here.” Drew Daniel Who would I make it for? It is the ratio of discourse to presence, maybe Baltimore has like minimal discourse, maximum presence, and maybe San Francisco for us had turned into maximum discourse, minimal presence. Todd Burns Do you feel like it has changed or is going to change the way you make music
as Matmos? Martin Schmidt Drew is very busy being a professor, that is what he does now. But it totally
taught me a new way of thinking about playing. In the scene that we are more involved with, it seems to be more based on like improv jazz and these worlds have collided. The noise and rock and punk and this free jazz thing have all collided, and there are so many people who make their own gear and do free improv shows with it. There’s crazy people who make their own synthesizers playing with trombonists. Nobody has any money for a PA system so everything is through guitar amps and it’s all very much based on do-it-yourself, or
what-you-can-afford, aesthetics. We had to draw the line when we moved there
because I live by the PA. I cannot abide fucking guitar amplifiers. Ugh. So we bought a PA. Drew Daniel It is weird, I never felt bourgeois until I moved to Baltimore and we’re like,
“Can we have monitor speakers at the show?” And people are looking at us like we asked for a carriage and eight horses. “Who the hell do you think you are, princess?” “Well, I just want some monitor speakers.” It was inspiring. Going to shows for a year in Baltimore, I never saw someone play a laptop and I never
saw a rock band. People are not interested, and they can’t afford it, so instead they are playing fucked up, weird stuff that they built themselves and
cobbled together and it sounds kind of amazing. It’s been a real inspiration to be taken out of our comfort zone. I loved San Francisco but I really felt that, by the end of living there for 17 years, that it was coasting on a
reputation of countercultural bohemian otherness that had not been economically viable since about 1979. The reality of what the software industry did was to give us incredible tools that have made it possible for charlatans like myself to make music. So I am incredibly grateful to that
industry. But that industry also displaced a whole class of people from that city. And we were part of it. We got evicted at Christmas one year, right during the middle of the big boom. But it was just a reality, and moving to Baltimore, I mean people live there on $250 a month and that’s all they need, so it changes your priorities. Todd Burns OK, let’s open it up to questions. Does anyone have anything? Audience Member I have two questions because it seems like I can talk to you guys about anything. First thing, what’s your favorite body part? Drew Daniel I am going to make a guess about Martin’s favourite body part and I am going to guess that Martin’s favorite body part is the back of the neck. Martin Schmidt Wrong. [laughter] It depends, whose body? What are we doing with it? Definitely hand. I mean, useful. Handy. Drew Daniel I like the tongue. Martin Schmidt Sexy stuff, that’s different. What do I like looking at on other people? Drew Daniel No, language. And your other question? Audience Member I heard there is really common in Baltimore to call women “buckets,” is that true? Martin Schmidt [laughing] I have never heard that! Where did you hear that? How rude. Audience Member I just struggled to think of something to ask you because I don’t really have a question, but I think you guys are really funny. I think your laugh is really good. Have you recorded that? Drew Daniel I have that Ernie kind of sound
that I make. We made a cassette called “Matmos in Lo-Fidelity,” it is in mono,
8-bit cut ups, and there’s a lot of Martin laughing at me laughing and a lot of sounds that are very kind of domestic and private. It was when we started as a band and a couple and since then… we used it a little bit on The West, too, it’s the final breakdown at the end of that. There is a 22 minute collage, and at the
end there’s a lot of us laughing and fucking up each other’s voices. Audience Member I was really interested with your idea of how you are trying to do experimental or conceptual art in music, but you also said that you wanted to be listenable to an extent. Some of the work I do I struggle with that idea.
Do you think that sometimes by trying to make the music listenable, you are sacrificing a little bit from the idea or the whole concept? Martin Schmidt Certainly, like, it’s not pure. Drew Daniel I think it depends, listenability. If you think an Aphex Twin track like “Ventolin,” is that listenable or not? It’s like getting into a hot bath. The second your foot’s in it, you’re like, “Fuck, that’s hot.” But within a couple of minutes you are like, “Oh, OK!” Anyway, it is contextual and the frame of a given record might establish what is listenable or not for that record. But, yeah, I think there’s a huge risk in watering down what you are doing in order to please some
imaginary listener that you think is out there who is a little more scared than you. That’s not a great approach to making art, imagining that you have to kind of please some invisible demographic hallucination. Trusting yourself and trusting that other people are just as interested as you are is a better way to go, and honestly, the person that modeled that for us most is Björk. She is not somebody who is sitting in the studio and saying, “This is too
weird.” She doesn’t really have that attitude and that is weird because she is the one where there is a certain amount of pressure because if she’s too weird, it will sell this much or that much or whatever. Whereas for us, I don’t feel that these issues are really at
stake. I feel that in terms of the surgery record, we wanted to make it as poppy and in a weird way, toe-tapping as possible because it was made out skulls and fat and blood and it would be very easy to make an alienating industrial, Marilyn Manson-style “aren’t I
scaaaary record?” out of the sounds. But it wouldn’t be compelling, there would be
no dialectic. There would be no transformation of surgery by making surgery scary. Surgery is already scary, there is no magic trick in doing that. Whereas, if you can make it sound like something that could just play in a W Hotel lobby, and then you realize that it’s made out of the fat of rich people, then you are like, “Oh, whoa, eew!” So that’s kind of why that record was the way it was. Martin Schmidt There was a song we made where we were like, “We need a bassline,” and we could not get a satisfactory bassline sound but I can’t remember what song. We’re like, “OK, we’re going to make this song all out of balloons and whoopee cushions.” Go ahead and just roll it. [music plays] So this is all balloons and I was like, “It wants a funky bass
sound.” Not to sound like fucking Britney Spears or something. And balloons were just not doing it. I was like, “Why don’t we use a synthesizer?”
I don’t think we argued about it in a bad way, but it was like, “Because that’s not a balloon, that’s why we don’t use a synthesizer, Martin.” “Yeah, but the song wants a good bassline.” So we used a synthesizer and the song is no longer conceptually pure. I swear that bass is coming soon. Drew Daniel I mean, it’s about 90% balloon. There is a good example of being un-pure on purpose. And it must be said, discovering early Matthew Herbert records as Dr. Rockit was a huge touchstone of this approach, we cannot not pour one out for his technique and his skill because it’s a sort of a parallel evolution. Björk was at a party and played him our record then he e-mailed us and we have been friends ever since. It’s been kind of cool to see somebody else who’s also interested in this, but he comes from a jazz training and deeply musical awareness, whereas we come from a noise background where we are slowly getting more musical over the years. But we
started out feeling a fair amount of hostility towards “real” music. Audience Member Can I just ask you to kind of look back at your career, and if you were to think of one or two moments when you felt really satisfied and said, “OK, this is why we drive ourselves crazy, this feels really good. It’s OK.” What are those moments? Martin Schmidt I am definitely getting that satisfaction a lot out of doing all these shows that are just pure improv lately and I realize – I’m going to pleasure myself here, which I guess, is necessary to answer that question – but I’ve realized that I’ve trained myself to get great sounds out of whatever object I put my hands on. I feel like I can get, not the best, but I know how to play this can. Just
by looking at it and holding it. And that’s what I have been loving about these pure improv things lately. We start with nothing. I’ll play the room and it will get sampled or the other people and, man, I really get a good
deal of pleasure out of having worked on that particularly bizarre skill for a long time and having it generate stuff successfully. Drew Daniel There has been a lot of moments because 18 years is a long time. Records are
kind of a message in a bottle and you put it out there and just have no idea if it resonates for other people and it’s a little weird and alienating, and you’re caught up in the workflow of creating it, and then it’s done. But when
you get to perform something and it loops back to the context that it was about, then that’s powerful. We made a song on The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of a Beast, which is a record of queer portraits of people we admire, where
we learned their biography and we re-enacted events in the life, and then we make music out of the sounds generated during the re-enactments of events from their lives. We made a track about this guy James Bidgood, who made this incredible film, a kind of quasi-pornographic dreamy film called Pink Narcissus. We basically assumed that he was dead and almost everybody that the songs were about, they were all dead. Or almost all of them. And then we learned that, “Oh my god, James
Bidgood is actually alive.” Someone had found him living in a tenement hotel near suicide at a serious rock bottom with a lot of the prints of his photography sitting in shoe boxes in a closet. Just at the edge. We basically rescued him and brought back his art and career, and we got to perform live our song about him to him. Because Antony of Antony and the Johnsons did this benefit that was Antony, Cocorosie and Matmos, which was a
benefit for a queer homeless youth shelter in Brooklyn, and Antony sings the song of ours about James Bidgood. So we got to kind of do this serenade, where James Bidgood was sitting on stage and Anthony is singing to him and we’re
playing our samples. I contact-mic’d a sheet of paper and I watched Pink Narcissus and jerked off and I recorded the sound of my semen splashing onto a piece of paper as my heart was racing watching this movie. So I’m kind of transmitted these amplified sounds of my heart beating and my semen and I’m
sort of splashing it all over James Bidgood. It is the most ridiculously masturbatory thing possible, but if you want to look for what was the artistic money shot moment, that might be it. Martin Schmidt If you ever see him interviewed, he is the kind of guy who would appreciate
that. He’s just like a filthy old man. We were interviewed for this well-meaning gay documentary… Drew Daniel About, like, “Intergenerational respect between different eras of gay artists.” Martin Schmidt He looks at the camera and he’s like, “I don’t want to fucking talk about that!
I want to fucking talk about drugs!” We were like, “Yes! I love this guy.” Audience Member I have a question. You were talking about conceptual purity and you were talking
about respecting it to a certain degree and then breaking it. I think that is
really interesting; do you think that purity is something better than subverting? Drew Daniel I think they each travel towards different demographics. There is that
Japanese guy Aube, who made this record
called Pages of the Book, which is just Bibles being burned and it’s just an hour of the burning of a Bible. It’s a pure conceptual art kind of piece, and that’s what that is. We made a record where you can hear the pages of Bibles
turning, but there was also an acoustic guitar, which plays an empty, melancholic figure. Ours is more musical than Aube, I don’t think that makes
ours better. Martin Schmidt I think the sound of the page... the acoustic guitar is not doing all the work. I genuinely think the sound of that page, it’s a great recording. It is definitely doing some of the work of telegraphing the feeling that ends up being there. Drew Daniel If you put a right microphone and a left microphone on either side of a Bible and close-mic it and you get a nice stereo field, an old Bible with a sort of vellum-y print paper, which makes a good rustling sound as it strikes the air. There is a lot of material there, if you really want to work with it and caress it and
deal with it as an object that could make an interesting musical sound. I think as long as you are compelled by what you’re hearing, then there is purity whether there’s a guitar or not. Audience Member Sometimes it’s more about the thrill. Sometimes you seek concepts to seek bigger thrills, right? Drew Daniel You have to realize that when you are curating the information and telling
someone it’s a Bible rather than just a book, that is a huge artistic choice and it becomes very loaded. Sometimes we tell people stuff and sometimes we don’t. On the first record there is a collage that involves something that we just called “Polish Trains,” and we didn’t mention that they are the trains that go to Auschwitz, because we kind of felt that if we had done that, it
would be sort of clobbering people too hard and it is too loaded, and you’d better fucking bring it if you’re going to even reference that. We felt like dialing it back in terms of the information. The sound is there and we know
what it means, and I guess now you guys do. But it was an important decision I think to be kind of controlling about how much information is the right amount, and that’s an artistic decision. Todd Burns Isn’t there some kind of pleasure in keeping those mysteries to yourself? Drew Daniel Yeah, when we did our porno soundtrack work, because we made the soundtracks to
like six porn films. Martin Schmidt That would be for money, by the way. It wasn’t like, “Yeah, we did that for
art.” No, we were paying the rent. Drew Daniel They wanted like 100 minutes of music and they would give you $1,000, but you only had three days. Martin Schmidt That is right, 100 minutes. Those of you that have worked for weeks on a three-minute song. “Yeah, we need 100 minutes, we need it Friday. OK, thank you.” Drew Daniel You would just make ridiculous, fake
Portishead, fake Nine Inch Nails, but we would hide esoteric things that were pleasing ourselves. Things that were not erotic, but really disgusting that we would sort of hide inside the porno soundtrack because we are just
corny like that. Todd Burns You reversed voices on that, I think? The porno soundtracks are one thing I wanted to ask you about. They asked for a 100 minutes music, but then they
would take three minutes and just loop it. They didn’t really care about it. Martin Schmidt They were like, “Oh, these guys are good, we can get six films out of them.” And they would just take stuff and cut it and put it and paste it into other movies. It”s like they didn’t care that much about the art they were making! [laughter] When we originally started doing that we were doing these careful timed out by the scenes and the climaxes would occur… Drew Daniel “Do the cymbal crash when the poppers guy comes in.” Martin Schmidt And, they just so did not care and just slapped it on the movie wrong. Drew Daniel They had a great slogan about how to approach it. They were like, “Don’t be interesting.” Martin Schmidt “Guys, don’t make it too interesting.” What an awesome command for art! Todd Burns They probably don’t want the music to be getting in the way of the porno. Martin Schmidt If you are a painter, and someone asked you to make a painting not so interesting, are you then a designer? That was so the reaction that I wanted! Owwww! [laughs] What is the function? What is music? Is that what Muzak is? I think that was their slogan and they literally meant the opposite of that, and that is why
that slogan is so good, it is less than music. Drew Daniel Boring music makes boring work less boring is the sort of core idea there. Sadly, if you think about the ease with which you could buy Ableton and know nothing about what you wanted to do, but just kick around some plug-ins and some soft synths and some Impulse drum kits... [Matin starts to beatbox], the sort of de-skilling in electronic music is a
serious concern, I think it ought to be a concern to everybody in this room, right? It is precisely vastly too easy to make electronic music now of a certain sort. That doesn’t mean that therefore you have to rip your
ovaries out to make something good. But it does mean that you are your own worst enemy when you’re making electronic music, because it is too easy to take it about 30 percent of the way there. Audience Member I think you guys just answered my question with that little performance, but I would like to ask you, if there was no audience and you were just making an album just for you personally – not even for each other, just for you – how
different would that sound to what you make already? Drew Daniel People often, when they are defensive, say, “I make my records for myself, and
if other people like it that’s cool, but really, it’s for myself.” I have always felt very frustrated by that attitude because you are communicating to other people and it matters. You don’t want to pander to an imaginary version of other people when you’re making the art. You don’t want to cut corners and
be like [mimes licking]. Would you like it more if I went like that for a while? Don’t do that obviously, but the record is not completed until it is out there in the world and until it is part of the social network that you
can’t control. Audience Member Do you think music has to have an audience to have a purpose? Say, for some reason you’re making an album that is not going to be listened to, no one is soon going to open it until you die. Martin Schmidt That is hard to me to think about. To literally wrap my mind… “Make an album that no one will listen to. Go!” Audience Member But that you like, still. Drew Daniel I have seen the way that if you do put out a record and it does get this sort of reaction… Martin Schmidt We have made records that no one listened to. It’s all too easy! Drew Daniel It contaminates your process if you start to go, “Oh, well that last review said it was too mellow, so let’s make a harsh record.” The pendulum swing that you’re doing in reaction to discourse, I think that’s really worrying and damaging
and you have to find ways to insulate yourself from it. Maybe making a record that nobody will ever hear, there’s that Emily Dickinson model, My Letters to a World That Never Spoke to Me, you
just create in your lonely room and you create for the joy of creation. That
Henry Darger model of the outsider artist, painters like Henry Darger, they seem like sacred monsters of creativity because they don’t care
and they don’t sweat it. But I think it’s important to be able to test what you are doing in front of an audience and to experience that. Todd Burns You talk about discourse being damaging potentially but you reviewed records for Pitchfork and other sites? Drew Daniel I know, I feel like an asshole. Giving numeric ratings to records is something that really troubles me. That’s why, when I wrote for Pitchfork, I would
write, “This is a great song.” But I wouldn’t take someone’s album and go, “This is 7.2. It’s not really a 7.4 because it doesn’t have that certain
resonance that 7.4 would have.” I think that’s really annoying. On the other hand,
the opportunity to talk to a lot of people about something that I think is amazing that might get ignored is something that I don’t want to pass up. I don’t feel like journalists are the enemy. I was making a punk rock ‘zine before I was in a punk rock band. I don’t think the divisions are all that awful. But I think we are in a moment now, because of the blogs and because of the internet,
where a universal climate of canny, snarky, knowingness prevails and people’s egos are built up by being the first person having liked something, and if too many other people have liked it, too, that’s contaminating. The quest for
cultural capital keeps having these diminishing returns in the form of people not being able to have careers anymore. Because they are uncool by the time their album is actually out. By the time it is actually in a story, it is so antic it is banal and who needs to buy it and then it’s on to the next one. Jay-Z is
right again, “On to the Next One.” That is exactly the attitude that prevails in the way that music discourse has been accelerated
now. And now I just sound like an old person. Martin Schmidt I sometimes feel like no one could make another record and we could be pretty satisfied for five years on just listening to the records that no one bothered to listen to twice from the last hundred years. I swear, half of the Wire reviews section is reissues of records you’ve never even heard. You never heard these records that are pretty darn
good, records from the ‘60s and ‘70s, all this amazing electronic music. Who needs new records? Stop! Drew Daniel You know who you’re talking to, right? [laughs] I think that returns to the question of whether you want to get pleasure out of the process and whether you want to make things because they’re driving you crazy until you complete them. If you respect the force with which they are
nagging at you enough to really devote yourself to it, then you will probably make something that will be worth listening to, hopefully now, maybe ten years from now. But life is long. We were making songs together for four years before we put out a record, four or five years of just making tracks and sending them back and forth to each other and working on them again and again without any idea that anybody was going to listen. Martin Schmidt And we were perfectly happy. You had better be happy with it. God knows, you had better be happy with making songs and albums that no one listen to, because it’s unlikely that anyone is ever going to listen to them. I feel like we’ve been unconscionably lucky that other people listen to our stuff, But I swear that I would have been happy having no-one besides my friends ever
listen to this stuff, and I would continue making this stuff. Drew Daniel He made a vinyl record, Moods for Misty Evenings, and when we move we still have these giant cases of Moods for Misty Evenings. No one bought it, no one cared. When we started to make Matmos nobody was interested. We sent out demos to labels and we sent out letters and we tried to get people interested and we
got rejection letters, techno labels were like, “This is fucking noise, this is bullshit.” Noise people were like, “This is silly.” So we got thumbs down, thumbs down, thumbs down. So we put ourselves out on our own label, total vanity label, where we just think we are like pleasing ourselves and it is going to embarrass us. Every time we move we’re going to have thousands of copies of the CD that no one gives a shit about, and we put out our own record ourselves on our own vanity label and Rough Trade in London took ten, I guess, and one of the ten people that bought it was Björk. And she calls us and we do a remix and then
we’re in her band. It actually can happen. Martin Schmidt If you want to be in Björk’s band. Todd Burns Are there any other questions? Martin Schmidt Let’s eat lunch. Drew Daniel Thanks for your time.

Melvin van Peebles
It’s a wonder there aren’t statues in honor of Melvin van Peebles. He is a true pioneer in an extraordinary array of fields – the first black movie director of the modern age, one of the first people to talk over music and, thus, a progenitor of hip-hop – at one time, he even managed to become the only black trader on the American Stock Exchange.
In his lecture at the 2008 Red Bull Music Academy, he told us all about his incredible life in film and music, from sleeping on park benches to blowing up police cars, and why all he wants to do is tell stories.
Hosted by Torsten Schmidt People like Michelangelo, Da Vinci and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe would be jealous, because we have a true 20th- and 21st- century renaissance man sitting here; a man who, according to his son, didn’t just open the doors, he blew them off the hinges. Please welcome, Mr Melvin van Peebles [applause]. Melvin van Peebles Thank you. You know what’s very funny, I don’t usually get an opportunity to speak. I have Alzheimer’s – you know what that is? When you get old, you can’t remember shit. That’s me. So, I never bother preparing a speech because it’s very difficult to know the questions people will have. But I do know the answers to the questions, if they concern me. The way I normally do it, is you ask me anything you want to know. I was born in Chicago many years ago, I’ve been around the world, I’ve flown jet bombers, I’ve been a crime reporter in Paris. Mario, for example, was born in Mexico when I lived there. That’s pretty much it, except I had a very bad temper and decided I wasn’t going to take any shit. From that, I didn’t know a musical revolution was in the future, but it seems some of the things I did helped along that revolution. For me, to be here and see the music last night, and the other things you people are doing, wow, it’s a f---ing dream come true. This is what I imagined, and I’m very appreciative for Red Bull asking me and Eothen for putting me in contact. So, if you have any questions, just ask me, I don’t mind. Torsten Schmidt I’m sure we’ll take you up on that. You were talking about these revolutions, and yesterday Raul told us how the more advanced things over here happened with bored, rich kids. Going back to the way most of us would be getting in touch with your work, it was probably through the films of your son and his comrades and their cause, and then going back and realizing they were quoting films that were made before we were even born. Then you realize, hey, f--- it, you don’t need to go to the best film schools or know all the best producers. There were guys there back in the early ’70s who just did what they did because they felt like it. And if it took the money from the Actors Guild, hell, we’re just going to do it, as long as we can do it ourselves. And in a way, I guess, that was inspiration for the hip-hop generation – to do things with just whatever you have. Melvin van Peebles The actual trajectory of the music came out of what I did in the following manner. I’ll tell you my life story in five minutes. I was born in Chicago, I was a child prodigy, and I finished college when I was 20 years old. But to finish college, because my parents were poor, I took a course. I didn’t know what it was, but it meant I was an officer in the US Air Force, so when I was 20 I was flying jets. I did that for a number of years, then I lived in Mexico where Mario was born. Then I lived in San Francisco, and I fell in love – well, I’d always been in love – with cinema. I wrote a book and someone got on my cable car – he was a grip man, you know, who used to work the cable cars… And the guy said, “You know your book is just like a movie.” I said, “Shit, I’ll go into the movies.” But there was one little thing: I didn’t have any music. I couldn’t afford anyone, so I numbered all the keys on the piano, because I couldn’t read or write music, so I wrote the numbers, then I played the music. However, when I finished my films, Hollywood wouldn’t take a black person to work. So, I was discouraged and went to Holland, where I was getting a PhD – I’m an astronomer and mathematician also – and while I was there, the French Cinematheque saw my work and said I was a genius. “Finally,” I thought, “Somebody who understands me!” So, I went to Paris and made my first feature there after being, what we call a clochard – I used to beg in the streets and, little by little, I learned to speak French. Then I wrote the score and then I made another movie later called Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song, and I wrote the music for that, and that started taking off. At that time, what we call the black revolution was going on in America. But the music was not revolutionary. It was still blues or just straight jazz, none of it talked about what was really going on. Since I couldn’t sing I just talked about what was going on myself and this became hip-hop and rap, and that’s the story. Torsten Schmidt So, out of the maybe 25 professions you mastered – and I’m just guessing here, I may have missed two or three – the common thread going through all of these is storytelling, narratives. Were you a good storyteller at school? Melvin van Peebles Well, I was always full of shit if that’s what you mean [laughter]. We call that storytelling elsewhere. I’m very political and you have to keep your audience interested to tell the story, and when I won the festival in San Francisco with my first French feature, I had no money and so I went back to New York, where I was living on a park bench. The first night, I heard this noise and it was people singing up to their women in the Women’s House of Detention. Now, if I say something you don’t understand, don’t nod your head, just ask me. He’ll translate it or I’ll explain it. It’s quite interesting what I have to say, but it’s sometimes intricate. So, if you don’t understand what I’m saying, please stop me and I’ll make it clear. Anyway, I was a clochard, a bum, a tramp, and this was after I had success with my first feature film, I had no money but I heard people yelling. At this women’s prison, people couldn’t yell out, but their loved ones could yell up. There was this whole wonderful, wonderful world of people talking to their loved ones. I thought, “Wow, this would make a great song.” So, I composed this song, “Hey, fourth floor. Hey, sugar, that your light? Make some kind of sign so I know it’s you.” So, the women would blink some kind of light so their people would know it was them. They would open their hearts up to their loved ones. It was wonderful, it was poignant, but no one was capturing this. So, I started capturing these sorts of stories and I put them into an album, and that was the beginning of the lyrics to music, saying something once more. Vocals in the early ’60s were simply accompaniments to the music, sort of “Hey baby, bap-do-daa,” but they never said anything. And I wanted to tell a story, so I brought down the orchestrations and raised up the story. Another time, I was sitting in a little restaurant and someone went along, and everyone said, “Hey, look at that!” And I turned around too late to see the girl going past. But that gave me an idea for a story, which we called “Catch That on the Corner” from the 1968 album Brer Soul, the story of a blind guy who fell in love and he’s asking his buddy to explain the girl he’s in love with. Turns out his girl isn’t a girl at all, but his buddy doesn’t know how to tell him that. “Hey baby, what’s that on the corner?” He’s talking to his buddy. Somehow, A&M Records took my music and the Last Poets started doing it, Gil Scott-Heron started telling these stories again. Not just, “I’ll meet you at the bar in five minutes.” It was stories. Because I wanted to do political work, that’s how the music got politicized, then that evolved into rap and LL Cool J and the Last Poets, that’s how it all happened. Torsten Schmidt There’s an account of your time in France, that even after you’d just moved there, you’d be telling people that had lived there all their lives stories about the 14th Arrondissement. To tell a story you need first to learn what’s going on. Melvin van Peebles There’s a whole French tradition called le chanson réaliste, realistic songs. There’s a very famous guy called Aristide Bruant, who wrote... [sings in French] It’s about a hooker at the Bastille. There are all these stories, and I’m sure I was very strongly influenced by all this. Early on, in American music, especially black music, you’d get those songs. But then it got washed out. For instance, [sings] “Good night Irene… I’ll get you in my dreams.” When the song was taken for what they call public consumption, meaning the majority white consumption, it was changed from “I’ll get you in my dreams,” which, of course, means we’ll have sex in my dreams, to, “I’ll see you in my dreams.” Who gives a shit who you see in your dreams? But these little changes affect the political and the real meaning. So, that’s what I did. Can you imagine when the major part of the political riots began to happen, we still didn’t have music talking about the problems in America? But now, once I made money, that gave the possibility of us beginning to have rap and a whole load of other things. Hold on, maybe I’ve got something. [Rummages in bag] You can go ahead and talk while I look. Torsten Schmidt There are some pictures of you as a little boy on the south side of Chicago, and it might be worth talking about there, because there are a few characters who hail from there. When I picture all the characters, I picture a cross between Steve Urkel and Kanye West. Melvin van Peebles No, not at all, the south side was like the Old West. Just looking out the window I’d see nine people killed. But you didn’t think about it in that way at that time at all. There’s a difference between living a life that these people lived. Take Kanye West and these people, their bling is they are aware that the world is watching them. There’s a difference when you’re just doing things. There’s a song called “Keep a Knockin’” [sings]. So, what’s the song really saying? When the blacks left the South and would come north, many times the men couldn’t find work and the woman had to become a prostitute. She’s saying to her lover, the real man, that she’s got a customer. It makes a difference when you know things like that. Now, it’s chic to be that. There wasn’t nothing chic about it then, you get your brains blown out. Quite a different way of something being. Hold on, let me see if I can find this shit … I want to put on probably one of my favorite songs. Does this thing work? Torsten Schmidt I hope so. Melvin van Peebles OK, we’re in business then… Let’s talk about storytelling: I’m in a hotel in New York and there was a young lady with me. Can everybody hear me? She reminded me of someone, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. Finally, I did. There used to be a cartoon character called Tweety Bird. After we’d made love, she jumped up and started dancing, and I thought, “Oh shit, she looks like Tweety Bird.” Tweety Bird was quite a pretty bird, by the way [laughter]. But anyway, this evolved into a story, and I’ll tell you the story, then play this… A guy is in jail and he’s going to be executed and he’s explaining why he’s in jail just before they come to execute him. Now, music hadn’t been done like this in many years, but I re-started this stuff. OK, play it. The first one. Melvin van Peebles But you see, my public understood what this meant, that the guy is going to the electric chair. This became a very famous underground hit. I would like you to play just one more piece of another song, please. Number six. I was talking to you earlier about “10th and Greenwich.” These songs had been put in this form, because people didn’t know what a picaresque and colorful life they were living. They allowed people to start living this life. Melvin van Peebles What I tried to do, and what’s now happening, the events of everyday life of us in the ghetto... we had the everyday events of life on the farm, in the cotton field, etc, etc. But when we came north it was lost. It’s been taken on and the guys have done beautiful work with the rapping and other parts of the music, and that’s what happened. I’d be remiss if I didn’t play one more song. Here’s a piece of another thing. This is the end of this whole series of music I did on A&M Records. This is called “Put a Curse on You.” Nothing like this had been done like that. Now it seems ubiquitous, everybody is doing it albeit in a much smoother version. These songs eventually became a big Broadway hit. At the end of the show, everything is a finale and it’s all closed down. It suddenly stops, because it ends on a note of, “Well, this is how life is.” But that’s not my personality, I’m sort of a fighter. An old bag lady comes forward out of the audience and begins to tell her story, putting everything into a completely different perspective. Torsten Schmidt Can you explain what a bag lady is? Melvin van Peebles A bag lady is a clochard, a lady tramp. Throughout the play, she’s been wandering around, just watching everything and probably everyone thinks she’s insane. But that’s not it at all. She understands, and she sums up in this case the author’s point of view about racism at the time. (music: Melvin van Peebles – “Put a Curse on You”) Torsten Schmidt Just to get the context right for people who didn’t get it at first, this is the end of a Broadway show, a theater show, on one of the world’s most famous theater streets. At the end of a play that already talks about things that are not exactly classic Broadway material, that’s about as intense as audience interaction can go, if you’re not Bertolt Brecht or someone. Melvin van Peebles What happened, it changed everything. Not only was it about something, but it made money. At that juncture, the doors that were closed to [Big Daddy] Kane, LL Cool J and everyone else opened because the American dollar says if you can make money, then you can say what you want to say. Torsten Schmidt There’s a great quote of yours saying that whatever you do, whatever cause you’re fighting, it’s important that the big boys win if you win. Can you elaborate on that? Melvin van Peebles The trick is, you figure out a way to do something you want to do. But if it can make money, they will carry your message. The people were so hungry to hear themselves, to see their thoughts – ones that many times they didn’t even know they were thinking – projected until they bought it. Torsten Schmidt There’s something pretty intricate about what you just said, which is essential for anyone who ever tried to convey a message in any form of storytelling. You sit there with a blank piece of paper and think, “Whatever I have to say doesn’t mean anything to anyone else – I can just talk about everyday things because that’s my everyday life.” You’ve overcome that very notion, at least two or three times. Melvin van Peebles What you do is say, “How can I put it in a form that will get to, maybe not every audience, but your audience?” Now, we talk about Blaxploitation, all of that came from one of my films, Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. Now, I have to go to the Museum of Modern Art in New York – they’re giving me a big restoration of my film, which is a huge honor and all of that. But when that film came out, only two theaters in the entire United States, in the world, would show it. Not two cities, two theaters. But I knew my audience, and that was so successful, the film, until of course everyone else took the film. After that you had Shaft, etc. My work is a little ferocious, so they made theirs a little more acceptable to the mainstream, and the music a little more acceptable to the mainstream. But still that had to carry part of the message. I don’t know if everybody is aware of the music of Sweetback. Torsten Schmidt Before we go into the music of Sweetback, I guess, we could talk for days about the signifying moments of that film. But, according to the American ideal, it was the biggest grossing movie of 1972, which obviously gives you a lot of relevance in the American mainstream thinking in the first place. But you achieved it with pretty radical statements in visual form and musical form. I guess, your average Oklahoma audience would be disturbed by the opening credits alone. Melvin van Peebles It’s quite complicated. It makes common sense, but it’s still complicated. No, I take that back, it was only complicated if you’re a racist. The major American cities had large African-American populations, and the movie theaters were closing because they had nothing relevant that they wanted to see. So, I simply wrote a relevant movie. I probably made $8 million before three white people had even seen the f---ing movie. But then, once everybody starts seeing and starts understanding the relevance, then it could not be ignored anymore. The music, Quincy Jones he says to always leave a little room for luck, for God, or whatever. When I’d written and shot the movie, I hadn’t yet done the music. I was looking around for a group, because I didn’t have time to teach people how to play as a group. I needed people who already played together. My secretary was sleeping with this one guy, and they were all sleeping in this room in Hollywood, about 12 of them. And she said, “You must go see these guys.” And I went to see them and it was Earth, Wind & Fire. So, they’d never done an album before. I wrote the music, and since I can’t really read or write music, I hummed it to them, taught them my musical method. They took the method and they played it the way I asked them to and it became a huge hit. I’m going to play a little bit of “Sweetback’s Theme.” Before this, music, even in Hollywood, was not used as selling tool. Music came after the film. Even if Hollywood bought a Broadway musical, they’d bring it out as a movie, then maybe bring out the album. Since I had no money, I had this idea, “Boiinnnng – oh, shit!” It would cost you a lot of money for a 15-second commercial, but a song would run for three minutes. So, I wrote the song and gave it the same title as the film, so every time they played my song, they were plugging the movie. “Durr!” Nobody had thought of it. So, then, I was a little bit known by this time, all the DJs, the black DJs and the hip white DJs, were playing my music. It was being plugged all over. Then, because of the revolutionary aspect of the film, the Black Panthers made it required viewing for their members. That changed everything. That’s when films started putting music before the movie sometimes. The next one they tried that with was Shaft, and Shaft became a huge hit – music and film. So ever since then, every piece-of-shit film has got a soundtrack. Torsten Schmidt Do you think anyone in the Panthers at that time would’ve imagined the impact of it? You doing this movie, Panthers being inspired by it, this inspiring the generation of Public Enemy and Spike Lee, which in turn inspires people all over the world, which then feeds back into this system. So, it all came from this one decision of yours to say, “Yo, boys, go and see this film.” Melvin van Peebles The real answer is, “F---, yes!” I expected it. Often, when I’d get into fights, someone would say to me, “Melvin, how did you know you could beat that guy?” I didn’t know I could beat him, I just knew I wasn’t going to take it. It’s been like a rowboat in the fog. You know when you go hitchhiking, if you stand there long enough you know someone should pick you up. You can’t afford to ask yourself that question, because you could intimidate yourself with that question. “Oh, I’m not a success yet!” It’s not how many times you get knocked down that counts, it’s how many times you get up. I had hoped these things would come to pass. I did not know how they would come to pass. But you’ve got to be in it to win it. The first thing you learn as a hunter is you never back a dangerous animal into a hole, because he’s got nothing to lose. I had nothing to lose. After that, you’re a rich man. Torsten Schmidt When you say your politics is to win, who do you win against? Melvin van Peebles Whoever’s f---ing with me. Torsten Schmidt That’s pretty straightforward. Melvin van Peebles It’s not complicated [laughs]. I was on a bandstand once with Patti LaBelle, and someone in the audience was giving me a hard time. So, I jumped off the stage. They assume because you are who you are, they can say things they wouldn’t say in a bar or wherever, and you’ve got to take it. No, no. First rule is, don’t write a check with your mouth that your ass can’t cash. I had nothing to lose. I had nothing to lose. So, there you go. Torsten Schmidt We understand you take that approach literally everywhere. On a personal note, when I dropped out of college, it was because I was so fed up with a course on African-American movies. I was so fed up that they would talk and talk for four hours straight without ever mentioning the role of things like friendship and brotherhood. Somehow, I think, these things have a role in there. And this lady looked at me straight and said, “Well, how about the portrayal of the welfare queen?” Um, okay. I walked out because I figured that place wasn’t for me, but I understand you had similar incidents in academic discussions and took things a little bit further. Melvin van Peebles There were so many of them; give me a hint which one you’re talking about. I’m always in trouble [laughs]. Torsten Schmidt You were in a very highbrow discussion and you were not agreeing with something someone said. I think you took it back… Melvin van Peebles I threw them down the elevator, yes. The movie Sweetback, this guy owed me money because independent distributors would pay you if they wanted to. If you’re ever in New York walking down 57th Street, if you could flash back, you would see a guy dangling out the window [laughs]. But he paid me. If not, I would’ve dropped him. Torsten Schmidt And, I guess in similar incidents, professors in highbrow universities weren’t safe from you, either. Melvin van Peebles I won’t take it. What the hell? Life is short. As I said, I was in the military, and there’s nothing worse if your plane’s on fire than thinking afterwards, “I should’ve done this, or that.” Go ahead and do it, otherwise you’ll get an ulcer. Torsten Schmidt And being in the military, you’ll also learn there are ups and downs along your journey if you really want to get somewhere. Melvin van Peebles I don’t really have a lot of ups and downs. Once I decided that it’s all part of the trip, you don’t mind. It’s just, “Oh, OK.” In fact, with that philosophy, you get laid a lot too. “What if she says yes or no?” Durr! Ask! You’d be surprised guys, there are a lot of nice ladies out there. Torsten Schmidt I guess that’s what they call the art of the possible. Melvin van Peebles It’s just being nice and kind and gentle. Or pretending to [laughs]. Torsten Schmidt And if something doesn’t work out, just throw them down the elevator. Melvin van Peebles Exactly! Not very complicated [applause]. Torsten Schmidt Speaking of politics and winning, this summer and the last 12 months have been busy with a really interesting process in America. Do you think Obama has any chance of winning this? Melvin van Peebles I never discuss politics. I do politics. Torsten Schmidt What’s the difference? Melvin van Peebles Well, once somebody says, “Blah-blah-blah,” then someone else says, “Don’t do that, motherf---er.” I may help these people immensely or not immensely, but it would be foolish for someone of my renegade status to say one thing or another that could get used against that person. Torsten Schmidt You mean like the Ludacris incident? Melvin van Peebles Like any incident. I never say anything about anything. The only thing that catches a fish is a mouth. If he keeps his f---ing mouth shut, he wouldn’t get caught. Torsten Schmidt There’s another one for my calendar. Speaking of catchphrases, at the end of Sweetback there’s a quote from the Bible. This comes from the same man who says he wants to take movies, and especially that demographic, away from the lynch mob and the Bible and the hymn. And yet you make him say, “My feet don’t fail me now.” Melvin van Peebles Yes, that’s not the Bible. Torsten Schmidt That’s from the Bible. Melvin van Peebles But it’s also from this [sings]. We can put that one. What I did with the religious songs I do, because many of those beliefs were holding the people in bondage. So, I took the subtlety of those things and turned it on its head. I’m not very big, so I use judo, I use the strength of my opponent and turn it on him. If you flip it… hold on one second, let me look at that. [picks up CD] Put on number three. (music: Melvin van Peebles – “Come on Feet Do Your Thing”) Melvin van Peebles What I did was take – one of the reasons the Black Panthers liked this movie so much – I took all of the major cultural fears of the black community and debunked them, tore them down. That’s why he’s being chased by dogs at the end and kills them. And, also this belief in God and “the Lord will help,” etc, etc – that’s why he says, “Come on feet, cruise for me. Help me get away” – I took those requirements and stood them on their head. It was what it seemed to be at the moment, then you take it and say, “Hey, there is a way out of this.” Torsten Schmidt Modest as he is, he’s also been the [only] black trader [on the floor of the American Stock Exchange]. I find it interesting, because when you look at the documents and so on, if you were at a European university, you’d probably be called an “African-American trader.” Which one would you prefer? Melvin van Peebles I don’t give a shit [laughs]. Torsten Schmidt Nevertheless, this was another first, you had a lot of firsts throughout your career. But I guess the trading one and the Wall Street one, especially given the events of the last ten days, is a really special one. Melvin van Peebles Hmm. What happened about how I went to work on Wall Street is I lost a bet, and that was what we call the vigorous, the cost of the bet. I was sitting with some very, very rich friends and we were talking and the guy said something and I could do the numbers in my head. He said, “You can do that?” And he got the computer out and realized I was right. And one of the guys sitting with us, who was particularly Machiavellian, said, “Wow.” He was a big marker on Wall Street and a troublemaker, too, and being so big, he got me a job to be a trader on Wall Street. Torsten Schmidt How did you find it? Melvin van Peebles It was quite interesting. As an artiste, you write something, and you do this and this and you’re never finally sure it’s made it. But on Wall Street, if you’ve made a bad trade, by the evening, you know you made a mistake. However, interestingly, I could trade zillions of dollars all day, but I never made a mistake. No, that’s not true. I made mistakes. Many of the people working Wall Street were minorities, but they never were elevated to the full height of where I was. So, if I made a mistake, they would ignore me, because they knew I was making a mistake. So, they protected me, so therefore I ended up never making a mistake. Torsten Schmidt Part of the American dream is getting all those riches, so I guess up until ten days ago, Wall Street was where they were. So how did you resist the temptation of staying there? Melvin van Peebles I got laid anyway. I got girls, what the f--- do I need Wall Street for? Torsten Schmidt I guess, a couple of the characters over there would like to consider themselves artists also. Melvin van Peebles I don’t consider myself an artist, I’m just a loud-mouth who’s ready to back it up [laughs]. Torsten Schmidt Which got you pretty far in the end. Melvin van Peebles If tomorrow I discovered making ethanol, or being a planter in such and such, would help justice for the minorities I am interested in, then I would do that. I don’t give a shit. Torsten Schmidt When you were on the floor in Wall Street, on the south tip of Manhattan. Thinking back to the days when the Panthers were looking out for you, did you think any revolution would be possible in America and could it happen without being an economic revolution? Melvin van Peebles Let’s be very clear about revolution. Do you mean racial revolution or the whole structural revolution? Torsten Schmidt That was actually part of the question, hidden away there. Melvin van Peebles Well, you show me yours and I’ll show you mine. Torsten Schmidt Well, when you were talking about revolution earlier, to which degree did you want to change things? What did you want as your end result? Melvin van Peebles [Laughs] You notice he slid around the question there. What I meant was a little like Christmas – peace and goodwill to all mankind… Well, you’ve got to do that step by step. One of the major steps that still has to happen is for us to get our shit together, not just in America or Barcelona, but everybody. Maybe it’s being an astronomer and looking out there. We’re fairly fortunate as a race – and by that race I mean homo sapiens, the human race – maybe we can get our shit together. But it’s step by step, fire by fire. This was a fire that I had particularly acute sensibilities that I could be effective. One victory at a time, and part of that victory was: You guys must realize that doing this music now, that is making that change. People from all over the world are sitting down and seeing the unity. Once it was sitting down, and there might only have been four people to that tribe, then people started moving all over the world and that made it easier for the greedy to pit one group against the other. But, through music and other things, it’s coming together. In a very large and philosophical way, I would like peace on earth – [sings] hark the herald angels sing, but in the meantime you might have to kick a motherf---er’s ass. Okay, so be it. Torsten Schmidt What part of that ass-kicking is just for entertainment? Melvin van Peebles I met her last night. [laughs]. Torsten Schmidt Let’s not get into specifics there, but speaking of kicking ass, after the movie Three Day Pass people accused you – especially with scenes of Sweetback in the back of your mind – of your movie being too melancholic and soft and lacking the violence. Melvin van Peebles You’ve got to realize something, Christ was nothing but a carpenter in his hometown. Sometimes you go step by step. That’s a very interesting question and I want to repeat it. My first feature [film] was French. I wanted to make it because I discovered a way of twisting the bureaucracy and getting a director’s card. So, I made a film that was very, very kind to the French. That allowed me to break Hollywood, which I did. Sometimes you have to turn left to do right. It’s a sweet film, so everyone assumes I make sweet films. OK, you’ve got to do what you’ve got to do to get where you’ve got to go, that’s all. Torsten Schmidt When you do something, no matter whether it’s a song or a text in a book or a movie script, and there is a depiction of violence, do you consider whether it’s necessary to get the point across or do you just indulge yourself because you like to do that? Melvin van Peebles The truth, is I assume that I walk on water, and I do what the f--- I like. I make movies, I do music and everything else like I cook. I put in what I like, in case nobody else wants to eat it and I have to eat it for the rest of the week. I write a play or something and I hope people are going to like it, but if they don’t, I do. I can sit there and watch Sweetback or Don’t Play Us Cheap and have a good old time. The worst thing you can ever have is do something for others and they don’t like it anyway, then you’re really f---ed [laughter]. Torsten Schmidt We had someone here earlier who talked about destroying the Lego city after they built it. All political things aside, blowing up a police car and making it burn is great fun, isn’t it? Melvin van Peebles That was quite difficult as a matter of fact. That was a good sequence. You see, you don’t get to do these things the way I did them that’s any fun. There’s a sequence in Sweetback, so everybody understands, where they blow up a police car. That’s a lot of money, and you’ve got to have permits, and this and that and the other. I had an idea. I go on Friday to the place which allows you to have these explosions. I put it in on Friday, they give me the papers. I blow it up on Saturday. The police come, I’ve got my papers because nobody put the rest of the papers in until Monday. I counted on them being lazy. That’s all. That’s how I got away with that. But the rest of the movie was no fun. My guys and I had real guns, because the film industry claimed they were going to shut me down. So, the sequence with the Hells Angels guy, after they worked a few hours they said they wanted to go. I said, “Wait a minute, you’ve been paid.” “We want to leave.” This guy pulled out his knife and started cleaning his hands. My guys went [makes sound of rifle cocking]... My guys had guns. They stayed. Fun? That wasn’t no f---ing fun, that was just getting the f---ing job done. It’s fun when people are applauding. Torsten Schmidt I guess, the fun is in the actual creation of it, but you must be hitting some walls when you go from sitting at the typewriter and writing the script to having to deal with this army of people, and you have this vision… I guess, it’s a similar thing on a smaller scale if you’re in a band. Melvin van Peebles It’s like with my typewriter – everybody knows me. Nobody f---s with me. Do it or your ass is mine. My group moves, they don’t move, they ain’t there, or they’re there without bandages on. Period. I’m not the Salvation Army. Torsten Schmidt Christmas carols saved for later. Melvin van Peebles There you go. But you do that hopefully, so other people don’t have to do it under the same circumstances. The questions you’re asking me are war questions. We’ve had a truce because of the war. I had to beat up people, OK, but only to make it possible for others not to have to. But don’t turn it around and make it like, “How could you do that? What the f---? You wouldn’t be here if I hadn’t done that.” There’s nothing major or good, or anything else about it, it’s just getting the job done. Torsten Schmidt I guess you need to clarify a little bit, because most of us have been brought up in the longest period of people. What do you mean by “war questions”? Melvin van Peebles When I was making Sweetback, the Teamsters, the labor unions, wouldn’t do it when they saw I was doing it. If you made a movie in Hollywood at that time, and they saw the film, the laboratories would scratch your film. The people in the labs, union people, would scratch your film, so it was unusable. So, I had to cover all that. Now, you’d say, “Melvin don’t like that,” and they know what that means. Torsten Schmidt Speaking of the Hollywood system, in another movie you pulled a reverse Al Jolson and dealt with the whole thing of like... Melvin van Peebles Which movie? Torsten Schmidt The one with the face covering. Melvin van Peebles Oh, Watermelon Man. Torsten Schmidt It’s probably better if you tell it. Also, if you could explain the movie Jazz Singer, the Al Jolson one. Melvin van Peebles Actually, in this movie – I don’t know what it’s called here, but it was called Watermelon Man in the States – this white guy turns black. Then he has to live with this sudden blackness and how it affects his life. I didn’t write this script, it was originally written by someone else. There are a lot of funny, complicated stories. It was a studio movie. After Hollywood had let two black directors in – Gordon Parks and Ossie Davis – they were still chasing me because of the success of my first French movie. I said, “OK.” But it should be explained, both of the other movies they allowed black people to shoot after I broke Hollywood, they didn’t allow them to shoot in Hollywood – they had to shoot on location. The major prize was to shoot in Hollywood. I held out, I said, “OK, I’ll shoot the movie, if I can shoot in Hollywood.” So, they let me shoot there and they gave me this script. It was nice, but what happened in the script, it ended with this guy waking up and he’s white again, and I didn’t want him to, I wanted him to stay black. They wanted him white. I wanted him to stay black. We came to a compromise – we would shoot it both ways and make a decision later on. So that’s what we did, except I didn’t shoot it their way, I just shot it my way. I was busy with that battle, which was fine with me. I put in the political things I wanted said, I added the things I wanted to add, and I didn’t shoot it the other way, so they had to do it my way. Treacherous piece-of-shit thing to do to the studio, but hey, what else is new? Torsten Schmidt Did you hear about the movie Tropic Thunder? Melvin van Peebles No. Torsten Schmidt OK, next one, save that for later. Do you know James Logan in LA? He does a lot of leather coats, what he calls the hero coats, long black leather coats. Melvin van Peebles What is he, an actor? Torsten Schmidt No, he’s a tailor, maybe a leather tailor. He does a lot of the coats for modern-day hero movies, action movies. There’s a certain type of coat he would call a hero coat. If you look back at those movies, I have a feeling you might have something to do with those coats and that look as well, adapting it and bringing it into popular culture. Melvin van Peebles Let’s roll the story back a little bit to an earlier story. I said I used to live on a park bench in front of the Women’s House of Detention. One night I’m on the park bench and I hear this voice – “No, I’m f---ing cold.” Hmm? And I think, “Melvin, make me one promise. The next time we make money, buy me a coat.” So, the next time I made money, I had that coat made, a long coat for stealing bread. Then at night, to keep warm you put newspaper in your sleeves and in your pants leg, so that’s what I did. Maybe that became the style, I don’t know. But I had the coat made and every now and then, if things are particularly tough, I go to the closet and there’s my coat. So, if I’m back on the park bench, I’m warm. That’s not very complicated actually. Torsten Schmidt Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Melvin van Peebles.
[Applause]

Michaela Melián
Michaela Melián grew up the classical way, playing in orchestras from a young age. During art college she was asked to found Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle with fellow art fanzine contributors, and she immediately swapped her cello for the bass guitar. F.S.K. have always been the punk band’s punk band, in spirit if not in style, with an against-the-grain ethos that means they’re likely to change shape just when you think you have a grip on them. Never one to respect convention, let alone chronology, Michaela sat down at the 2005 Red Bull Music Academy in Seattle to discusses her art installations, albums, and her musical journey, stopping along the way to take in inspiring sceneries.
Hosted by MICHAELA MELIÁN I started out doing projects like installations where a fourth dimension, the sound, was coming to the installation. I did several tracks for pieces for shows. TIM SWEENEY When did you start doing the installations with music? MICHAELA MELIÁN It started with Ignaz Günther-Haus in, I think, 2002. That was the first one I made and I liked it so much… That was one idea, to get a showroom of an institution, like a public space, and I wanted to get different people there, not the normal art crowd, so I tried to make this house with music, and I made a special track for that house. TIM SWEENEY So before that you were doing art as well, but without music? MICHAELA MELIÁN Right. Because I always made music my whole life, I started when I was six years old with the guitar, then I started to play cello and I sang in different choirs and orchestras. So it was really like a musical childhood. And then I studied music – and also art – but music-wise I mainly played in a band called F.S.K., which we’ll talk about later, and I wanted to keep it separate. So I had this kind of band project and my art was not about music. But then I thought, “Why shouldn’t I bring this experience of making music for all these years, in studios and concerts, to this art world?” So that’s the reason. TIM SWEENEY That is a good reason compared to the stuff from the early ‘80s. So with this [picks up her 2004 album, Baden-Baden], did you do everything on this album? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yes, I play everything on the album – mainly I play acoustic guitar, and many tracks of cello and violin, and also melodica. In F.S.K. I’m mainly the bass player, so also bass and some synthesizer things. It was done in the home studio of the drummer of F.S.K., Carl Oesterheld, and he produces everything for me and does the drum tracks. As we learned from Steely & Clevie, you really have to have a feeling of drums to make it good. TIM SWEENEY Right. So this is on Monika Enterprise, which is run by Gudrun Gut. How did you decide to put it out on this label rather than Disko B or with F.S.K.? MICHAELA MELIÁN Well, I liked the idea of Monika Enterprise because Monika, like the name tells you, is mainly focused on female productions, electronic also. I know Gudrun Gut from a very long time ago when she started out with Malaria!, the same time as F.S.K. started. At that time F.S.K. was still called Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle – F.S.K. is the abbreviation. That means in English, “voluntary self-control.” It was a funny name at that time. TIM SWEENEY Everyone seems to like that name. MICHAELA MELIÁN Well, it was in 1980 and everyone was into punk, so we decided to have this special name. It comes from the German film industry and it’s the self-censorship institution for filmmakers. Filmmakers have this institution where they [submit] every film to decide if they will retouch genitals or cut out pieces that are not politically correct or whatever. So we liked the idea that when you bring something out, like a product of music, you have that self-censorship in your mind. TIM SWEENEY So shall we play the DVD of the art installation? MICHAELA MELIÁN We could do that. This is a ten-minute documentary on the exhibition I made and I could say some words about it. It’s in a museum in Innsbruck in Austria, and Innsbruck has one of the very rare European panoramas. A panorama is a round building that you can go inside, it was very famous in the 19th century. Mostly you have a round painting that goes 360 degrees around you, and it’s a re-enactment of an important moment in history. This one in Austria has the subject of the Tyrolean liberation fights of Andreas Hofer, when they tried to keep Tyrol a subject. TIM SWEENEY Wait, what’s that? MICHAELA MELIÁN What’s that in English? Tyrol? It’s an Alpine part of Austria, but after the first world war it went to Italy. It’s now a part of Italy. There were always places, like Poland, that belonged to other countries throughout history, and they wanted to be free. So that’s the liberation thing, and at that time Napoleon came in and they had these fights against Napoleon and the Germans, who fought with Napoleon against Austria. TIM SWEENEY So that’s the whole basis for this panorama? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yes. It’s a very important wooden thing, it’s an attraction for tourists still. It was built and painted more than 100 years ago, and you have this situation where people are fighting and you see a wonderful painting of the whole landscape. I did a new piece about this kind of situation, but I did a new kind of panorama about Innsbruck. [You normally] pass by there by car because today you have the big autobahns from Germany to Italy. You always pass Innsbruck, but no one goes there, it’s just passing by. TIM SWEENEY Isn’t there skiing there? MICHAELA MELIÁN Some Japanese and American tourists go there, but it’s mainly people passing by. So I made a trip passing by Innsbruck, looking out of several buildings or several landscapes where famous movies have been done. So perhaps we play it and you can see it? TIM SWEENEY But is all this music from the installation, or just this one track? MICHAELA MELIÁN Just this one track and it’s called “Panorama.” I tried to do a new kind of panorama, because in the historical panorama the visitor is always guided. You have a special moment of history and you have to learn about how this history was. There is a kind of link that you have to learn politically: what is the lesson? In my case I wanted to give people the impression that there’s an atmosphere or a mood, and you really can decide that there’s not just one moment in history – you're just passing by. So just play it and we can see it. (video: Michaela Melián – “Panorama”) That’s just the documentary about this one piece, and you can really see the whole subject. The art is very much about analog versus digital production. The drawings were slides and the slides were wandering around. The drawings were done with a sewing machine, because [I think] the sewing machine is one of the first computers – it makes a hole and a minus (draws line with her hand), which is like a zero and a one. And just to bring it away from that kind of handwriting, which is normally connected to this kind of “male genius” production of art, to have this kind of distance to the production. That’s the subject. Also, it has to do with my way of producing music, because nearly everything I use is from the analog playing of instruments and we don’t really sequence things. We play the drum machine in real time into the computer. We are influenced by electronic music, but [we try to] bring it back to this kind of breathing, in a way. To have, like Steely & Clevie said, more of an “oval” mood in the music. Because sometimes if you program the drums it’s really like [makes stiff movements with her arms]. You have to do it really good. When I do a track, I first start out with a sample, so with this track you could hear that Alpine zither music, four old men playing these tunes. I cut out a really short piece and it was in 3/4 [rhythm] and I converted it into 4/4. When I had that, I made a sequence of that and then I played along with the other instruments to that. So the sample is the only thing which is sequenced and the rest is done by hand. TIM SWEENEY So for the kick you just [makes punching gesture with his hand] for the whole nine minutes? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yeah. Later when we hear some F.S.K. you will hear that I am really trained in standing on stage for ten minutes going “boom-boom” [makes bass playing motion]. TIM SWEENEY Well, for this stuff it sounds like you have a lot of house and techno influences. Who were you listening to and who influenced you? MICHAELA MELIÁN I think for my music it’s a lot of influence from German music, from Kraftwerk up to Mike Ink [alias of Kompakt co-founder Wolfgang Voigt. Really, Mike Ink is a very big influence, and all the Kompakt productions, how they treat sounds. TIM SWEENEY So it’s a German thing? With F.S.K., there’s a lot of looking at American things, so this is more German – is it getting back to that? MICHAELA MELIÁN Well, you can’t really tell because I’m listening to so much music, like any kind of music. But in this one, I would say I often have some tracks of Mike Ink in my mind. TIM SWEENEY OK, so let’s go back now. MICHAELA MELIÁN Yes, I thought perhaps it would be a good transition to play a song. I have have a new track with me that is coming out on a compilation, so I could play that and then afterwards we could go on to F.S.K.? TIM SWEENEY Yeah, sure. MICHAELA MELIÁN OK. (music: Michaela Melián – “Kloster”) TIM SWEENEY So this was a new one? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yes, that was the world premiere. The track goes on a bit longer. I like to make these tracks quite long. TIM SWEENEY Was that part of another installation? MICHAELA MELIÁN No, it was made for this new compilation [Female Future: Transatlantic] when I got invited. I decided to make this music only for my installations or if I get invited, like for compilations. Like I said before, every track starts from music I plant into the track, like a hidden soul or hidden idea, and in this case there was a little sample of a record by the Monks, a beat band of the ‘60s. The compilation it was made for is about German and American influences. That band lived in Germany and were soldiers there and they influenced a lot of beat bands in Germany. So there’s kind of a link to that. I don’t know if you know the Monks? TIM SWEENEY Well, aren’t they on the list of least known bands? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yes, that’s true. Shall I play another song I made and then we can pass over to F.S.K.? TIM SWEENEY OK, so what is this now? MICHAELA MELIÁN This is a Roxy Music cover I did for Baden-Baden and I chose “A Song For Europe,” because I decided when I do my own records and I do songs, I only do covers. There could be a problem with my own band, because the last recordings mainly use my voice, when there’s a voice in the records with F.S.K. It could be a problem if there’s always my voice, so I decided not to do my own lyrics or anything, I decided to just do a cover. There’s this huge influence on me, also on F.S.K., from Roxy Music, so I decided that if I do a song I always choose a Roxy Music song [laughs]. TIM SWEENEY Oh, really? And this is now the one Chicks On Speed are covering? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yes. And so on. I just stopped it because we have a lot to say [laughs]. TIM SWEENEY With this new stuff, do you perform it out at all? MICHAELA MELIÁN Well, when I started I just wanted to make some music for these art concerts. When I compiled it for Gudrun Gut for the record, there were so many requests to perform it, so we really had to think about how we would do it. Now we've developed the concept of how we can bring it on stage, because normally I’d have to bring eight people on stage. I try to keep it very basic when we do it, but you still need seven or eight people to play cellos, guitars and things like that, and so I decided to have a different concept. I didn’t want to bring a computer, a laptop, so I did a version of some tracks mixed down and put it onto ADAT, so we have an 8-track tape on stage with a mixing desk. Carl, who did the studio work on the album, he plays along with violin and xylophone and does the mixing. So he can still influence what is on the 8-track and he can work on that, like a live thing. I play the cello, guitar, melodica and these kind of things. So we have a semi-live [set-up], but still the rest is coming from the tracks. But it’s not a computer where you have the feeling of music and time going by. That’s quite important, I think. TIM SWEENEY So it’s just the two of you? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yeah. It’s also a money problem. I played such a long time in bands that I like to have one product at least where you don’t have to share the money with five other people! And it’s easier because to play this music you really have to rehearse, because it’s basic on one side, but still you have to do it very precisely. TIM SWEENEY So how many performances have you done? MICHAELA MELIÁN I think only five or six, but I’m really looking to do it very [exclusively]. Two times in Paris, one time in Frankfurt, one time in Berlin. I try to select certain special events. TIM SWEENEY So shall we go back and talk about F.S.K. now? MICHAELA MELIÁN We can do that. TIM SWEENEY Can we give people an overview of how F.S.K. started? I know it’s a big story, there’s a lot to it, but how you guys formed – it seems like there’s a lot of concepts in F.S.K. MICHAELA MELIÁN Well, we could go from the very beginning and up to today. TIM SWEENEY Oh, you want to go backwards?! MICHAELA MELIÁN No, I think it would be better that way, and also, if you listen to the old records we did in this context, it might be interesting – you can hear how time goes by because of the kind of qualities you are able to produce in music, because it has changed so much in the last 20 years. We started out in 1980 and in that time when we started out, there were all these studios around and only these 4-track studios. All these small underground labels had to finance these records, so you can hear how difficult it was at that time to get a good sound, and how easy it is today with a computer. As a band it is quite expensive to go into a studio and make good records. We started out, like I said, in 1980, and we met at art school in Munich. TIM SWEENEY I don’t want to get too personal, but was that in your twenties then? MICHAELA MELIÁN In our early twenties. One of us is a photographer, one is a writer, I’m an artist and another one is now a curator, at that time he was also studying at art school. We started out with a magazine and we were very much influenced by Andy Warhol's Interview. All over Germany there started all these new wave bands – Neue Deutsche Welle, they called it – and punk bands, and we wanted to be a part of it. And in my case, I used to study music and I always studied art. I didn’t go to any pop or rock concerts. I came from this musical family so I went to some jazz concerts, but never to a pop concert. The first concert I went to was F.S.K., when I was on stage, so it was quite different for me. When I started with these other guys to put the newspaper together, they wanted to start a band and they wanted to have a woman in the band. They asked me because they knew I could play a lot of instruments. So the first bass I played I borrowed from another band, and for the first two years I had this borrowed Fender bass, so you can hear that it’s really different. It’s not so much about music in the beginning, it’s more a concept. You have to think about punk and not so much about being a very good musician. That’s not the idea behind it in the beginning. TIM SWEENEY So how many people are playing in this? MICHAELA MELIÁN It’s four people. It’s me, Thomas – he’s the writer, Thomas Meinecke – and Wilfried Petzi is playing guitar, and Justin Hoffmann is also playing guitar. I will play it for you. I don’t think we should play to the end, because perhaps you might not understand the lyrics, but to get a feeling. TIM SWEENEY Yeah, we’ll just get a feeling. (music: F.S.K. – “Moderne Welt”) So that was from 1980? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yes, and the refrain always ends with, “And we say yes to the modern world.” It starts with, like, “Peter says he likes to stay alone at night at home and that’s okay for him.” And, “Tina likes very high heels ’cause she likes to be sexy,” and things like that. TIM SWEENEY Huh. MICHAELA MELIÁN Haha, “huh”! So you have to see this in the whole context of punk. Everyone is playing on stage, sweating, and we are playing this kind of music with uniforms and no one playing the drums. I should play you another piece with this kind of drum machine, so you can see what I was talking about. TIM SWEENEY With the most recent stuff you’re doing, there’s this analog and digital, modern versus classic stuff, and with this there’s sort of the same thing, where the sound of it is very… I don’t know how to describe it. But you're talking about the modern world, so you're still having this dichotomy, I guess. Is that there, or am I making this stuff up? MICHAELA MELIÁN Well, I’m not sure I’ve got what you meant, but F.S.K. is very much about the concept of being a band and making music. So it’s really the whole story of 25 years of friends making music together. It’s music about music, how we listen to music and how we react to it and how the whole music world develops. We are not a band who are inventing a sound and staying doing it. We do all the time very different stuff. But it’s always us four – or five, for 15 years now – doing this kind of music. And you might hear how we treat the instruments and how we quote things, so people really know the sound now. But I wanted to play you another track off this first single so you can see the range of the single and why people thought, “What was that? ‘Cause that sounds really different.” (music: F.S.K. – “Herz Aus Stein”) TIM SWEENEY Who were the other German groups that influenced you when you formed the band? I mean, you’ve said Kraftwerk, but who were the others who were playing then that influenced you into starting? MICHAELA MELIÁN I think from the concept, the band concept, really Kraftwerk and Can were the most influential to us, as far as being artist bands. But there were not many German bands that influenced us, there were more American and English bands. It’s very much about the reception of music we liked, so we liked Gang Of Four and Velvet Underground, also the Raincoats and all this stuff that was around at this time. But Gang Of Four was really a big influence. I could play a song from ‘82. You can hear how we adapted these jazz quotes we liked a lot, that is quite funny. TIM SWEENEY When you first started, you had a magazine that you guys were doing, right? That was trying to be like Interview and Andy Warhol? MICHAELA MELIÁN The idea was a bit like Andy Warhol’s Interview, but that was very much interviews [laughs]. We were just people, still students, but everyone we liked we asked, “Do you want to do something for the magazine?” So it was mainly people who were writing about something, or people who wanted to make fashion or take photographs of their fashion, or artists with photos or drawings. So it was more like an art fanzine, I would say. TIM SWEENEY And how long did that last for? MICHAELA MELIÁN It lasted from ‘78 to ‘86. But the whole idea was that whoever wanted to be part of the party, he had to pay for it. So if there were ten people doing the magazine, then we split the cost between ten people. If someone wanted to contribute, he had to pay. And at the end we had like 1,000 copies, so everybody got like a hundred copies and what you do with it, that’s your problem. Some people gave it to shops, others just gave it to some friends, so it was a kind of funny distribution. The next one I wanted to play is from ‘82, and it’s called “Melody To Shoot You In Your Heart.” In Germany we have this funny thing where we can put three or four words together and make a new word out of it, so it’s “Herzschussmelodie” – I don’t know how to translate. (music: F.S.K. – “Herzschuss Melodie”) TIM SWEENEY So what jazz music influenced you guys? MICHAELA MELIÁN I think in that case it was a funny quote of free jazz. But this song I chose because it can tell you a lot about the production situation at the time. We went to the Sandbox Bass Studio and these guys normally make heavy metal and rock music. They’re totally leather outfit guys, who were doing a lot of drinking and they were like, “What are you doing here?” They had a 16-track desk and they used like every track for three or four different instruments. So when we did the mixing at the end, every one of us had like four [faders] and had to do it like, “OK, this instrument [goes up now] [mimes sliding faders up and down]. We had a whole concept of what everyone had to do. This song was like four times as long as it was when I played it now – we had this jazzy track and trumpet and xylophone and the cello and things like that. On the same track there were different instruments, so you had to really plan what you do with the tracks. And today that would be totally easy to do, but at that time, to be three days in the studio and to do four tracks, it was really hard work. TIM SWEENEY What made you guys decide to go to that studio? MICHAELA MELIÁN Because of Alfred Hilsberg, who ran the label [Zickzack]. He always had special deals with funny studios [laughs]. We didn’t have to pay so much. Very silly reasons. TIM SWEENEY You said you had a classical music background, what background did the others have? MICHAELA MELIÁN Very different backgrounds. Justin has been playing in bands since he was 11 years old, and he's a very good player on guitars and keyboard. And then there’s Wilfried, he is also playing the guitar and the trombone, and he has a funny history – he started out playing in these Saturday night event bands with people demanding songs. He earned his money. He’s a photographer but he used to play for years when he was young. He comes from a very rural part of Bavaria and he played in these bands. So we should hear a song where he is singing, because he has this very troubadour [style of] singing and he has this background where he can play many songs by Elvis Presley or whatever, the Beatles. He can do it. And then there is Thomas, he is like a total nerd and addict of every type of music, so he doesn’t play any instrument, but if he tries to do something, he can really do it. TIM SWEENEY So in F.S.K. you have all these different styles of music. Was [Thomas] one of the ones listening to all these things? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yes, he has the whole collection and introduced many things to the others that we didn’t know. And I think we met because we were really interested in listening to music – it was a group of people that liked to meet and just listen to music and that’s the way the band started. And I think that’s the secret behind it, that we have been doing it now for 25 years and it’s still not boring. But I should play you one with the troubadour singing. And that’s more of a kind of a pop thing. It’s called “Hymne”. Anthem? (music: F.S.K. – “Hymne”) TIM SWEENEY When did you first do a Peel session? MICHAELA MELIÁN 1985. TIM SWEENEY And the last one you did? MICHAELA MELIÁN That was November last year. And it was really sad, because we arranged with him to do the session in the spring, and he phoned several times to say we should come and do a session again, and we always wanted to come when he was in town. Because with us, everybody is always doing something else, not only music – it was quite difficult to get a time to go there. And then he arranged it for November and when we came over he had just died four days before. So it was a really sad coincidence to do it then. We recorded it when we learned that he was dead. TIM SWEENEY Do you have a favourite Peel session that you did? MICHAELA MELIÁN Not really, we did kind of strange things. We did four Beatles songs for him. TIM SWEENEY Were those released? MICHAELA MELIÁN They were released, but most of the stuff wasn’t released. Because you have to buy it off the BBC and that is kind of expensive. We should talk about that because what I play now to you with F.S.K. was always German lyrics and it was really this time when we started that this German new wave – Neue Deutsche Welle – started out, and we really used the German language. And after ‘83 all these small labels were just breaking down, so it was really going down, this situation for independent music. TIM SWEENEY Why was this happening? MICHAELA MELIÁN I think it had to do with the big music industry taking over the ideas behind the concept. It wasn’t only music-wise, it was the whole fashion. Like, they took over punk gestures into advertising, so they took away from this underground movement these kind of codes, and all these German bands who started out with us got taken over by the industry. They got really big offers, got 100,000 marks [to sign a deal] and [were told], “We’ll do three albums with you.” And then they would only do one album and the band would vanish somewhere, and it really died out, the whole scene. And then artificial products would do kind of a quote of this development - Nena [singer of “99 Red Balloons”] started out then – and took over the business. I think these are the reasons, it’s quite complicated to tell. But at that time all these small labels had problems getting in the record stores and it was a hard time. So many bands changed to English and tried again to sound like an English or American band and not to be something different or anti-music business or whatever. For us, we wanted to keep on the concept and because I lived in England, we had a deal with an English label, Red Rhino in York, and we thought, “How can we get this concept of the band to an English audience, but with our German lyrics?” So we began doing cover versions of songs that we have chosen to tell the people what the music is about, how we treat this material. I could play one to you and I think we did this also for a Peel session, but I have it for a different one. (music: F.S.K. – “My Funny Valentine”) This one I know that John Peel really liked very much. TIM SWEENEY So this was from ‘83? MICHAELA MELIÁN This was on that record, yeah. TIM SWEENEY And is this when you guys are wearing the plaid uniforms? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yeah, we changed to these kind of checked shirts and blue jeans, a different uniform. TIM SWEENEY And what did this uniform mean? MICHAELA MELIÁN That was kind of a gesture against new wave in a way. When new wave had taken over the whole system, in a way, we wanted to make a different quote. Thomas had bought himself a trumpet and Wilfried got a trombone, so we had this brass section. So that started then [laughs]. And you always have to see it in a concept, that was ‘82 and ‘83, that was really this time of heavy new wave… TIM SWEENEY So you were trying to do a reaction to that? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yeah, we always think, “OK, what is going on?” and we go left, or something. TIM SWEENEY So after this period, what did you start doing after this? MICHAELA MELIÁN It’s hard to explain, I’ll just play you from our first Peel Session another example so you can see the range. We also did the Bert Kaempfert song “A Swingin’ Safari” and it was our first concert in London – we played the ICA Rock Week. You have to imagine there’s a drum machine and three German guys playing guitar and I was playing the melodica on stage, so it was really strange. TIM SWEENEY This is from the same year? MICHAELA MELIÁN No, it’s later, it’s ‘85. (music: F.S.K. – “A Swingin’ Safari”) So this was from our first Peel session. I don’t know if you know how the production situations were in Peel sessions, but you just go to the BBC Studio 1 and it’s a huge room, half the size of this room, with wooden panels. A really beautiful room with a grand piano in there and really good situation. But you have to play it like jazz, in one take. Perhaps they do an overdub for the voice, but you have to play it really like a jazz band. It’s a live situation in a way. TIM SWEENEY At what point did you start working with David Lowery from Cracker? MICHAELA MELIÁN That happened later. In between we did some collaborations with The Mekons, a band with the same story, I would say. We also did some records for English labels and people from the Mekons produced them. TIM SWEENEY How did you get connected with them? MICHAELA MELIÁN I don’t know, by accident. By liking the same music, and getting in contact through the English label and living in England, it happened like that. Always, if you do something and you meet at the end, the people are interested in the same thing. We managed, funnily enough, to get one song, “I Wish I Could Sprechen Sie Deutsch,” in this listener chart of the Peel show and the BBC Radio 1 charts, so it was quite funny that this happened. But then in 1990, we decided to leave Zickzack Records in Hamburg and we changed to Munich – to Disko B and Peter Wacha. TIM SWEENEY Why did you decide to do that? MICHAELA MELIÁN We were ten years with this Hamburg label and it was kind of bankrupt at that time and it was difficult to get money to go to the studio. We were no longer like a new band, and if you are a label you always want to get someone who is new and helps to make money. So we decided we wanted to have a change and Peter Wacha offered us more money to go in the studio. By that time we had met David Lowery of Camper Van Beethoven, and he invited us to come to the US – he has a studio there. He said, “Why don’t you come over and record in the States?” A good idea about the whole concept of picking up American or English songs and doing a cover version – he liked to do that. So we went there in ‘91 and we did… TIM SWEENEY You went to Virginia? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yes, we went to Virginia, to Richmond, and started recording with him, and this collaboration lasted for five years. We did at least three albums with him and we also did several tours with him, so he came to Germany and we had this European tour with him taking part in F.S.K. Also, he invited us to do the US tour with his management that we got through Bill Graham, that was really funny. We got this night liner and we played Washington, Chicago, Atlanta. TIM SWEENEY What size venues were you playing? MICHAELA MELIÁN Big clubs – Mercury Lounge in New York. It was quite nice because it went all through him, so it was not so bad. TIM SWEENEY Right. So Mercury Lounge, that’s like 300 people or so? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yeah. And up to 500. And we played a big festival in Atlanta. I think we played 14 dates, so it was really a big tour. TIM SWEENEY So then you were getting these American songs and giving it a more German flavour? MICHAELA MELIÁN At the time we had this concept, we called it “transatlantic feedback.” Because in Germany, after the second world war, the whole pop [scene] started out just looking to the States. You have so many influences coming from there, and we wanted to… Well, it had to do with the reunification of Germany, and starting a new kind of nation, a national feeling in Germany. We wanted to do a quote on that, and at that time it started again that so many bands were singing in German, because of this kind of new national feeling, and we wanted to bring in a kind of question about that. Thinking more about the influences we had from abroad and feeling international, and not so much German. So it’s always like I said before, there’s something happening in the whole cultural landscape and you reflect on that. TIM SWEENEY What happened with this transition that happened in the mid-90s, when you went into Detroit techno? MICHAELA MELIÁN Perhaps we should first play something that David Lowery produced with us, because it sounds totally different. We had really good conditions in his studio. In the first recordings we did with him, we had this opportunity to invite a lot of musicians to come to the studio and play along with us. On this one record we had Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse, and Michael Hurley joining in. I don’t know if you know him, but he’s kind of a beatnik musician in his 60s, and he did some backing vocals for us, so it was really a very nice collaboration, fitting into the concept we wanted. The first record we made with David was Son Of Kraut, and I’ll play you now the national anthem of the GDR. We did a kind of unplugged version of it. That was the time when the GDR had already vanished from the map – you know, the East German part. And so we had a lot of guest musicians from the US like Mark Linkous. (music: F.S.K. – “Nationalhymne Der DDR”) TIM SWEENEY How long would it take you to record an album? MICHAELA MELIÁN When we did it in Germany, we really did it fast. We never used a producer, we did it on our own. We went to the studio and didn’t want to spend too much money. In Virginia, we had two weeks and it was really nice to sit around and say, “Can we try this, can we try that?” But mainly it’s always done in tracks with some special overdubs. So we really used to do it like a band, to play all together – to get it right with the feeling. But I wanted to play you one interesting track. David Lowery had this song that was in the top 40, he got a gold record with it, called “Eurotrash Girl.” He made it with Cracker, a new band, and we did an adaptation, a cover version in a Kraftwerk kind of way. Funnily enough, two or three years later – we did it in ‘95 – Chicks On Speed took it over and did a different version of that song. It’s quite interesting, so I would like to play both songs. It also marks a new story again when we changed very much to this influence of electronic music. TIM SWEENEY And that happened when? MICHAELA MELIÁN In the mid-90s. TIM SWEENEY As a result of the Chicks On Speed remix? MICHAELA MELIÁN No, it happened with that record, International – that was the break where we changed to these influences. (music: F.S.K. – “Euro-Trash Girl”) TIM SWEENEY What kind of records were you listening to when you made this? When the more electronic influences happened? MICHAELA MELIÁN We listened to a lot of house music. TIM SWEENEY Were there any key tracks back then that you guys were always listening to? MICHAELA MELIÁN It’s hard to tell now – we always listened to so much different music. I know that at that time we really looked to Chicago and Detroit and what came out of these cities. We were interested in these kind of producers. You still have this quote [in “Euro-Trash Girl”] of a yodelling Japanese woman who was doing this kind of Alpine style, we mixed it in that song, but still we tried to produce different sounds with our instruments. This is the record where you have the change. But I wanted to play you the Chicks On Speed track. TIM SWEENEY Did you guys listen to any Chicago and Detroit stuff from back in 1986? Was that on your radar back then? MICHAELA MELIÁN No. It started getting in focus in the middle of the ‘90s. We knew about it at the time, but I think in the first half of the ‘90s we really tried to keep on that band concept. So it started quite late, but in the mid-90s. Do you want to listen to that Chicks On Speed version? TIM SWEENEY Yeah. (music: Chicks On Speed – “Euro-Trash Girl”) MICHAELA MELIÁN It’s difficult to come back to the band sound with this kind of music! TIM SWEENEY So is that when you decided to split with David Lowery? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yeah, I think because of his band Cracker, he had a different concept of what he thought about us, so when we did the song, he decided to have this Japanese yodelling, and it was really a problem for us. Now I like it again, but at that time we thought, “We want to leave this yodelling behind!” And he still wanted to keep on with that thing. And then in the mid-90s in Germany there were so many interesting things going on. Very close to where we live there’s this small city of Weilheim where all these bands were coming from. There was a very good studio, so we went there and worked there. I could play you one track, which is very much influenced by house music, and just talk a bit about how we adapted house music and did it on our instruments, this electronic-produced music that we played analog, in a way. TIM SWEENEY And is this with Anthony “Shake” Shakir? MICHAELA MELIÁN No, Anthony came last year. So what we’re listening to now is from the mid-90s. It’s called “Odenwald” – that’s a forest in Germany where there used to be people smoking mushrooms and things like that. It’s on Disko B. (music: F.S.K. – “Odenwald”) TIM SWEENEY So was that the drummer playing that beat? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yes, just one drummer and I’m playing the bass, and we have one keyboard and two guitars. That’s the band line-up. But it’s really about the kind of music we really like. House music you normally produce differently. TIM SWEENEY Right, now you’re doing it as a band. MICHAELA MELIÁN Yes. Because we’re talking about these influences I could play you another track. It’s called “The Key Of Busta Rhymes,” so you have another influence. TIM SWEENEY And were you performing these songs out at the time? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yeah, yeah. So, like I said before, I’m really used to staying on one bassline for ten minutes when we play live, so I’m trained to do that. Because when we’re playing this music, or when you’re producing this music in the studio, you have all these loops and things like that. But if you play it you really have to – each of us is playing like a machine, in a way, but it’s different because we’re playing it. So let’s listen to “The Key Of Busta Rhymes” (music: F.S.K. – “The Key Of Busta Rhymes”) TIM SWEENEY So on your latest album, you worked with Anthony “Shake” Shakir. How did the meeting with him come about – a Detroit techno producer who worked with Juan Atkins and Carl Craig and Metroplex? How did you meet him? MICHAELA MELIÁN At that time we had done two albums which were heavily influenced, as you heard, by R&B and techno and house music. So then we thought, as a German band, to make a statement where we’d get somebody to come to Weilheim, to the studio. We would first do the recording on our own and then the producer would come in, like in the ‘60s and ‘70s, to be a producer to do something with the material. We wanted to have this kind of culture clash. The contact came about because Peter Wacha of Disko B – since 1990 we have been on Disko B – he did some stuff with Anthony, and he asked him if he might be interested to do it. And he said yes, so he flew into Munich and stayed with us and went for a week in the studio and got the tracks to do something with. That was quite interesting – the album is called First Take Then Shake, because we did everything in one take and then Shake came in and did something with the material. TIM SWEENEY So were you there when he was working with the material? MICHAELA MELIÁN It was him, but mainly Thomas and I stayed with him, because he was staying with us and we had to drive him to the country studio. But he decided on his own what he wanted to do. TIM SWEENEY What kind of things was he doing? MICHAELA MELIÁN It was quite interesting because there were ten tracks. I think five tracks he didn’t want to touch and then with the five others he did something special to every track. So on one track he only replaced the bass drum. Or on another track we start to play and in the middle he comes in and does a remix at that moment, playing along with us and taking over. And on another track, a song I was singing, he was just joining in with some scratching and strange sounds, and another track he did a new rhythm section for it. And then there was this very funny thing that we did – [we thought] let’s do one track we think he would really like, do some techno thing that he might think, “Oh, that’s something I would really like to produce.” When he heard it he said, “Oh, that’s not techno, that’s a polka!” [Laughs] He didn’t want to work on that, he just did a remix of the whole thing. So on the record it’s called “Tiger Rag,” after this famous ragtime, and he did “Tiger Rag Remix.” So that’s quite funny. Perhaps we should listen to the track “Salt Peanuts,” where he takes over, and then the two different versions of “Tiger Rag.” TIM SWEENEY OK. MICHAELA MELIÁN So this is where F.S.K. starts out and in the middle [Shake] comes in. (music: F.S.K. Meets Anthony “Shake” Shakir – “Salt Peanuts”) Audience Member So did he just take over the session? MICHAELA MELIÁN Yes, with the track and the remix of the track. I like that idea. So he just took over what we did and fed it in his sampler and then he mixed it with the track we did. So the whole length of the track we did, but in the track is his remix. Perhaps we should also listen to how he treated a song of ours because it’s quite different. TIM SWEENEY OK. So what was he using for that? MICHAELA MELIÁN We had to get him a sampler, and he was just sitting at the mixing desk with the sampler. TIM SWEENEY It’s interesting, because you hear with this one how it starts out with the live drums, and you hear once he takes over with the sampler. MICHAELA MELIÁN He was feeding in the material we did, and then he treated it, so it was really nice how he went into the material. And he was very precise and he did different things to every track, what he thought he could do to it. He was very funny, he always asked, “What do you want me to do?” And we’d say, “Oh, do what you want. What you think it needs.” We like this idea of collaboration and just giving him the material. So perhaps we should play this short song. He went into the whole drum section and worked on that. (music: F.S.K. Meets Anthony “Shake” Shakir – “Tiger Rag”) (music: F.S.K. Meets Anthony “Shake” Shakir – “Tiger Rag Remixed”) TIM SWEENEY I guess we’re running out of time, but that kind of takes you through the whole history of F.S.K., there’s a lot there. Does anybody have any questions that they want to ask? Audience Member You talked a lot about using drum machines at the time. Since a lot of the people here are into techniques and the specifics of those kind of machines, can you tell us a little about what kind of machines those were? MICHAELA MELIÁN Like I said, the first machine we used we just bought it in a music store, it was like what music entertainers used. Like, you have a switch for swing and rock & roll, and you have an extra knob for extra conga or something. We used that for the first two years, and then we changed over to the Roland 606 and the Roland Dr. Rhythm – we used both. And then we used a lot of Oberheim for like two records, and then we changed to the Alesis because we wanted to have the real drum sounds, no more artificial sounds, and then we changed over to a real drummer. Audience Member What about now? The music we heard at the beginning of the lecture? MICHAELA MELIÁN Well, our fifth member is a drummer, so we always play… Audience Member I mean the music that was played in the movie at the very beginning. MICHAELA MELIÁN Ah, OK, you mean my music. We don’t use a drum machine, I just use a Waldorf synthesizer, and we just play along and then correct it by hearing if it’s really in the beat. So we don’t really program it, we just produce the sound on the Waldorf but we play it by finger. And I like the Waldorf very much, so all the music I do is a cello, a guitar, the Waldorf and a Casio or piano. Audience Member Thank you.

Mike Paradinas
Uncompromising, ever-changing and always intriguing – that’s Mike Paradinas in a nutshell. Producing innovative and idiosyncratic music since the early 1990s, he has recorded under aliases, including μ-Ziq, Tusken Raiders, Kid Spatula and Jake Slazenger. His work – which takes in everything from hazy pop to breakcore – has been released by Virgin, Clear and Rephlex, and now he heads up his own eclectic and highly respected imprint, Planet Mu. In this lecture at the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy in Melbourne, the genre-defying auteur speaks about running a visionary label and his love affair with the UK rave scene.
Hosted by Nick Dwyer Right now, it brings me great pleasure to introduce you to a man who’s released many, many incredible records… and worn many, many, different hats. You might know him as Jake Slazenger, Kid Spatula, μ-Ziq – with the funny little symbol – and has released records on labels like Rephlex, Astralwerks, and of course his own Planet Mu label. Can we have a nice round of applause and holler for Mike Paradinas. All is well with you, mate? Mike Paradinas Yeah. Nick Dwyer One thing’s sure, judging from your accent you’re a long way from home right now? Mike Paradinas That’s right, the UK. I flew in a couple days ago. Just getting over the jet lag. Nick Dwyer Whereabouts in the UK would home be for you? Mike Paradinas Worcester, which is just south of Birmingham, Midlands, the middle of the country. Nick Dwyer How long have you been based in Worcester now? Mike Paradinas About ten years. Nick Dwyer Nice, good city? Mike Paradinas There’s not much of a music scene in there but it’s quiet. Good place to bring up kids and the property’s a lot cheaper. Nick Dwyer Yes. I think, put it this way, to get a good introduction to what you’ve been doing for the last few years is to play something from the label. Obviously, a lot of production over the years but the main thing that’s been keeping you busy is Planet Mu. Tell us about Planet Mu. Mike Paradinas It was a label I started about eight years ago because I was signed to Virgin, and wanted to release my friends’ music. I set up a sub-label on Virgin, on a major label, but it wasn’t really working out. I wanted total control, myself, so I went to an independent distributor, and set the label up, which is a lot of work, but if you can do it, it’s well worth it to get total control. Nick Dwyer When you say it wasn’t working out, major labels, they’re great at doing big albums but ... Mike Paradinas Yeah, they want an immediate return on their money. If you’ve got a longer-term outlook, it’s better to do it yourself. You know that if you’re working with music you love, then you don’t care if you lose money so much, until you’ve lost all of it. Then you care. Nick Dwyer Was it hard to set yourself up independently? Mike Paradinas Yeah, it was at the time because a lot of distributors were changing at that time. There was one called RTM, which Mark [Pritchard] knows about, because your label is with them. They got taken over by another distributor. I had just signed a deal with RTM, then I lost it straight away, so I had to find another deal. I never put a record out with them. It took another year of work to get a distribution deal, but once that was set up, then it was all pretty easy. Nick Dwyer What have you got right here? Mike Paradinas This is a test pressing of a record that’s coming in November. We’ve started releasing grime and dubstep in the last 3 years. This is a Loefah remix of Pinch. I should stick it on, and see what happens. (music: Pinch - “Punisher” (Loefah’s SE25 remix) / applause) Nick Dwyer Once again, the name of the artist on that is ... Mike Paradinas That is DJ Pinch. It’s a remix by Loefah, part of the DMZ crew, who are putting on parties in Brixton every couple of months. Digital Mystikz and Loefah are part of that crew. I’ve been going to their parties and trying to ... It’s the only interesting electronic music happening in the London at the moment, that seems vibrant. The parties have got a really good vibe, and that has been missing a lot in the last eight or nine years, since the rave scene fell off. Drum & bass I never got much in to after jungle stopped. Up in to, about ’98, I was in to drum & bass, but after that, this decade it’s not really been working for me. Nick Dwyer The vibe at the clubs ... Mike Paradinas Yeah, it’s a really good vibe there. There’s positivity I guess. I don’t know. The bass is good. Nick Dwyer Yeah. Mike Paradinas I like the music, mainly. Nick Dwyer What are the nights for you? Mike Paradinas There’s FWD>> and DMZ, really the two. I’ve never been to FWD>> because I can never get down to London for that but DMZ is on a Saturday, and I’m working through the week. Nick Dwyer A good sound rig is definitely a must with these nights. MIKE PARADINAS Yeah. You need to be able to hear the bass and get the warmth, so they’ve been using reggae systems, reggae sound systems and putting them in. There’s a good one at DMZ, which is the only club I’ve been to for this sort of music. NICK DWYER You’ve got to look at the whole evolution of what was once known as UK Garage, and it will all kind of genre-fied and subgenre-fied. For a lot of people that weren’t keeping up with it so well, you can kind of lose track of what’s going on. I’m sure a lot of people do know that, but for people that don’t, some people still think a lot of this music is grime, dubstep. At one point do the split off, and what are the different ... MIKE PARADINAS I don’t know. It’s hard to tell. About 2002, it was hard for me. It was all still garage, UK garage. I started seeing a lot of MCs. It started off in pirates, really. The MCs were spitting over the tracks. It was only about then, 2001 and 2002, that I think the records started being released without MCs on it. I think the first one I saw was Sharky Major, and stuff like Wiley and Pay As You ... Pay As You Go at that time. I think Roll Deep started after that. They’re the main ones. Dubstep started at about the same time I think with the Tempa label, Vehicle. All that lot. I don’t know. I just bought some records and I was into them. NICK DWYER What was [inaudible]. MIKE PARADINAS At that time, we were just releasing electronic stuff. I was buying a lot of this because it was interesting me, and we were releasing ... At that time, we had just re-released Remarc, who is a junglist. We had re-released his records from ’94 and ’95, ’96. I was bringing a new drum & bass audience into the electronics, which we had been releasing. At the moment, we still release a lot of electronic stuff. Now, a bit of dubstep and whatever I’m interested in. If I get sent demos, I just listen to as many as I can. Whatever I’m into, I ring them up and talk to them and see if we can work something out to release it. NICK DWYER How many demos do you get in on average in a week? MIKE PARADINAS I don’t know. Maybe about 50 a week. It’s quite a lot. NICK DWYER Do you make a point of making sure you listen to all of them? MIKE PARADINAS No. [laughs] I would love to, but I did have to throw away a whole load which I hadn’t listened to because they were from three years ago. I had still never listened to them, so I felt a bit bad, but then it did clear a big space in the kitchen. I could cook again. NICK DWYER Going right back to you, when did your first forays into the musical world kick off? MIKE PARADINAS Probably listening to Kiss FM in London, was ... I had been in a band, playing keyboards in a band, and I wasn’t that excited about doing that, and when I heard electronic music, stuff like house and acid, on the radio, that got my interest back. NICK DWYER Blue Innocence, I believe, was the name of the band. Any good stories with your band days? MIKE PARADINAS No. That’s the end of that. It’s a dividing line. I was still playing with them when I was releasing stuff on Rephlex, which was ’93, but it’s not interesting musically. The singer wasn’t very good. There was no future with that. We did almost get signed, actually. NICK DWYER You nearly got signed? MIKE PARADINAS By ... What’s his name? Dave Stone or John Stone? The guy who ran SOUR which was a jungle label at the time. He had a rock label as well, and he did A&R for Parlophone and stuff, but our singer was just shit. I realized that, but he didn’t, so I had to leave. It was pretty sticky. NICK DWYER When you’re talking about KISS FM, for you, what were the radio shows that [you were listening to]? MIKE PARADINAS It was Colin Faver, really. I got into in 1990 and ‘91. He was playing hardcore and acid and stuff; and then Colin Dale a bit later on, who was playing Detroity stuff. NICK DWYER At what point were you going about your first forays into making music yourself, inspired by ... MIKE PARADINAS I’ve been making music myself since about ’85 or ’86 when I got my first synth. I had just been borrowing a four-track and doing little things myself all that time. I think I bought a four-track in ’88; in ’87, maybe, and was doing little experiments then; demos for the band I was in and little electronic stuff, little bits of guitar stuff. I had a drum machine then as well, so it was a lot of putting a drum machine through a delay pedal and pissing about with it, basically. NICK DWYER When the music project started, it was originally you and a partner from the band? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah. When I started doing electronic music with computers was probably ’91, and there was a guy, Frank, who was a bass player in the band. He had a computer. So basically, I had my synth and my drum machine, and I borrowed his synth, and we got together mainly because he had the equipment and he let me use it. We wrote a few songs together, but in the end, he had to go off to university in Wales. I stayed in London. He wasn’t that into doing it. He just wanted to do his own thing, so we split amicably. We’re still friends. NICK DWYER As you mentioned before, one of the big things that happened that got your name out there to a whole, huge audience, was the hook-up with Rephlex. MIKE PARADINAS Huge? It’s not huge. NICK DWYER How did that [encounter] with Rephlex come about? MIKE PARADINAS I sent him a demo, and he rang me up and said, “Can we release it?” I said, “Yeah. That would be great,” and it happened. NICK DWYER That was it? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah. After a few years, it happened. That was probably the beginning of ’92, and it did take about a year-and-a-quarter, or a year-and-a-half, to get the record out. By the time it came out for me, it seemed like ages and years because at that time music was moving pretty fast in the rave scene. It was techno or whatever, but running a label now, I understand a lot more about cashflow, which I think was the problem at the time. Putting it out takes me a good six months or sometimes a lot longer to get something out, but I try and be as quick as possible because I know how frustrating it is for artists to sit on stuff. Nick Dwyer For you, at that time, you were talking about Rephlex, and Aphex Twin, and all that. Was it fairly inspirational for you as a producer? Mike Paradinas It was because at that time people were making really inspirational music. Knowing Aphex Twin at that time, making an album with him as well, was ... Because I was a big fan of his stuff as well. It was exciting. Nick Dwyer How many collaborations have you done over the years? Mike Paradinas I’ve worked with a few people. Aphex was the first… I’d worked with Frank before that, and been in a band, and stuff, so I was used to working with people. I’d worked with Luke Vibert since, which some times it doesn’t work out, and in that case it didn’t really work out musically. Jochem, who’s Speedy J, a techno producer from Rotterdam. I’ve worked with him. We did an album together. I’ve worked quite a few of my artists on the label, just pissed about. Gone round to their house and done tracks together, like Shitmat, Tim Exile, and Vex’d, people like this. I’ve been around the studios, and we’ve worked on beats. Nothing’s been released. Nick Dwyer Maybe, possibly, at some stage in the future, some of this will see the light? Mike Paradinas Maybe. I doubt it. Nick Dwyer In terms of Richard Aphex Twin though, he actually hasn’t collaborated with that many people. Mike Paradinas Yeah, he’s collaborated with Luke Vibert and Squarepusher, but apart from that ... He’s collaborated with most of his friends, probably all of them. I think our one’s the only one that was released as an album. I think he did a track with Squarepusher that came out, and maybe Luke ... No, that didn’t come out. Nick Dwyer Did you learn a lot from him, working in the studio? Mike Paradinas No. Nick Dwyer At the time? Not at all? Mike Paradinas Yeah, maybe. I liked the way he danced when he made music. Nick Dwyer There you go. Mike Paradinas That was pretty much most of what I remember was his attitude ... We didn’t really speak in the studio. It was pretty silent. We knew what we were doing. He would work on a mixer, I would work on the computer, and that’s how we did it. He would do one part, he would do a bassline, then I would do the next bit. It was like an Atari at that time. This was before the days of Macs. This was ’94, so it was all MIDI. I would do a bassline, then he would do the drums, or this bit. We didn’t have to speak, it was pretty obvious we did it 50/50. Nick Dwyer What followed the Rephlex thing, you got signed to a major label. Tell us a little bit about that. Mike Paradinas Yeah, what happened is I did these remixes for Virgin Records for an indie band called The Auteurs which were a jangly guitar band, or whatever. I knew their manager and he asked me to remix a track of theirs. I started remixing it. Each time I wasn’t happy with it, so I did another one, and another one. In the end I had these six tracks, which I’d done. I wasn’t really happy with them so I sent off to the manager. Tony played them to David Boyd, who was the A&R man for Virgin. He was really in to them. They came out, I got a bit of money. That was the first bit of money I actually got paid for ever doing anything for music. I moved out of my mum’s house and rented a place. That was good. It got released as an album in the end on Virgin. Then they wanted to sign me on the strength of the sales of that remix pack. They just released the six remixes. That was good. Nick Dwyer What kind of deal did they try to lock you in to? Mike Paradinas The bastards tried to lock me into a six-album deal for no money. No, I got an advance. That’s the thing about major labels is that you don’t get so much per unit, as they call them, but you do get an advance, so it’s worth ... If you want a big pile of money. I don’t know if they still sign people, majors. Do they? No. It’s all pop now, isn’t it? In those days, they did signs at underground dance things, or interesting electronic things, because it sold a fair bit. I think nowadays, it’s changing a lot. Stuff basically sells less now. [Phone rings in audience] Who didn’t turn their phone off? I don’t know if it would happen now, but at the time, yeah. I got a nice advance, but then after that, it would never recoup. I did three or four albums for them, and it worked pretty well. I never had any problems with artistic control. They were always nice guys. I was with the same A&R man through however long it was. About seven years I was with them. It was all a pretty good relationship and everything. It worked out pretty well. NICK DWYER Did you have a lot of creative freedom during this whole time, or did you … MIKE PARADINAS Yeah. Basically, they let me release what I wanted, so I was happy with that. In the end, they had to buy Mariah Carey out, and I got dropped. NICK DWYER It was Mariah’s fault. MIKE PARADINAS Yes. Totally. Everyone got dropped, except the Chemical Brothers… and the Verve. NICK DWYER The Verve. They stayed. MIKE PARADINAS Or Richard Ashcroft. He stayed. NICK DWYER You had many, many different aliases going on. It seemed like it was a lot of different projects happening. Tell us about what projects were going on at the time. MIKE PARADINAS Can I remember? Fuck. There was μ-Ziq. It was the name I was signed to Virgin under, so I carried that name on from Rephlex onto Virgin. I was writing those albums than with Warp and Clear, it was Jake Slazenger, which was a more electro-funk sound. I did a few 12”s for other labels under different names and stuff. That was it, really. It was just ... If you worked for another label, they wanted a different name, because they didn’t want to waste the money promoting different names, I think. Each label it was a separate name. That’s the reason behind it. NICK DWYER During that whole time, what was your approach to production? Would you walk into the studio and go, “Right. I’m feeling a bit Jake at the moment,” or, “I’m feeling a bit Gary,” or you just go in there? MIKE PARADINAS Something like that. It was just like, if you did a track, and maybe later, you would realize what you could put it out under. I was making loads of tracks on the Atari every day, and was pretty productive at that time, during the ’90s. Less so now because I’m running the label. It was a good time for that. I think the Atari, with MIDI, was a lot quicker to write tracks because if you turned it off you lost everything. There were no hard disks ... Well, there was a hard disk, but you couldn’t save onto it. It was all floppy disk. You couldn’t fit a song on the computer. Could you? You could. Not on the 1040. AUDIENCE MEMBER [inaudible] MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, You couldn’t fit audio on there. I don’t know. It was all on floppies for me. You couldn’t fit the sound. It was all MIDI, so you had to ... You fit the sequences on there, but when you reloaded it, it would sound totally different for some reason. I like to put it all onto that before the end of the day. NICK DWYER It was very much the situation back then, if you went into the studio you would tend to finish things off. MIKE PARADINAS Yeah. You would have to finish that day; otherwise, you would lose everything, pretty much. The floppy disks were pretty unreliable in those days. You couldn’t guarantee you could load the song up again, basically. NICK DWYER How long would it take you to finish off a tune back then? MIKE PARADINAS At least 20 minutes. At most, three hours. NICK DWYER No more than that. MIKE PARADINAS Sometimes, it was a few days, if you were working later on cutting up breaks and stuff like that. You would have to spend days doing stuff; a few days to finish tracks. NICK DWYER Aside from Atari, what else did your setup look like? MIKE PARADINAS Back then, it was drum machine ... It was all the outboards. It was all MIDI. You had a sampler, eventually had a sampler, and a couple of synths, drum machines. NICK DWYER How long did you keep your setup as that, and at what point did you start … MIKE PARADINAS I got a Mac in about 1999 and moved over then. Before then, it was all Atari. It was a bit of a headfuck when I moved to audio sequencing because it was totally different. I had to relearn everything, so it took quite a while to get my head around it. I’m just used to one way of working. I’m not very into technology, actually, which isn’t the best thing when you’re an electronic musician. I just like what I know. Once I’ve learned it, I tend to keep to the same thing. It doesn’t really matter what I use. To me, I just learn whatever is about, and try to make music with it. NICK DWYER Do you think to a certain degree that it’s the best way to approach production, especially with electronic music? It doesn’t matter how many bits of gear, or plugins, or whatever you have. It’s how well you know what you’ve got. MIKE PARADINAS It depends what sort of person you are. For me, it confuses me to have more than three things in front of me, whatever I’m doing. I like to keep things simple. I like one screen. At the moment, I’m being confused by the four channels on the mixer. For instance, we’ve got the CD and the turntables and two computers. NICK DWYER [inaudible] MIKE PARADINAS That’s why it’s out of view. You’ve taken it out of my vision. NICK DWYER It’s to calm things down a bit. Should we listen to another track from the label? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, we could. That was a dubstep thing, so that’s one of the latest. I don’t know. NICK DWYER Have you got any of your music from that whole period? No? MIKE PARADINAS I have on that laptop. NICK DWYER Is there anything you’d like to play? MIKE PARADINAS There’s a Venetian Snares. Where is that? That could be a bit more of a ... breakcore sound, which is big in Europe. And a little bit in America, I don’t know. Is breakcore big in America? Nick Dwyer Again, it’s one of the biggest problems with electronic music, with everything genrefied, and sub-genrefied. Mike Paradinas Yeah. Nick Dwyer For people that don’t know, how would you describe breakcore? Mike Paradinas I’ll just play it, I think… Nick Dwyer And whereabouts is Venetian Snares from? Mike Paradinas He’s from Canada. (music: Venetian Snares – “Twirl” / applause) 22:46 NICK DWYER So Venetian Snares? MIKE PARADINAS That was Venetian Snares. He works in different time signatures. If you actually listened to that, you might have realized it was five beats to a bar or ten or something. That’s his gimmick. It’s sort of jungle in weird time signatures. NICK DWYER That was one of the most exciting things about what was happening with jungle and everything, was producers actually spent a lot of time cutting up breaks and gave it a certain kind of energy. Is that, to a certain degree, what was happening with the UK hardcore thing and the energy of jungle, something you were trying to keep alive? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, it’s part of what I got into in music and hardcore was sort of the nuttiness of it, that anything goes, all the samples and the breaks as well. So it sort of mixed up a lot of things in UK music like sound system… and reggae sound system-type lineage and then hip-hop as well and techno, I suppose, was sort of speeding up of all this with taking drugs, I suppose. So it all got, you know, I was really into that sort of mix-and-match sound and then when jungle came along a couple of years later, it was like really sort of a new sound. You couldn’t have predicted it, really. What they were doing with breaks was pretty original, so I was really into that, yeah. NICK DWYER Your music’s always kind of been on the periphery of all these different scenes taking influence from them but, I don’t know, I guess kind of twisting it into some mutant hybrid. MIKE PARADINAS I just steal. Yeah. NICK DWYER Did you ever see yourself releasing more or making more kind of conventional music that you would see played at these kind of parties? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, sometimes. I wasn’t very good at doing it, though, so I just prefer to make the stuff I was happy doing, which always sounded a little bit more idiosyncratic or whatever. NICK DWYER Yeah. MIKE PARADINAS So, I just carried on doing what I was doing really, and it didn’t ever really get played in the jungle parties. NICK DWYER Yeah. At what point did the Planet Mu start kind of taking a life of its own? MIKE PARADINAS When I started up independently, it was ’98. A life of its own, what do you mean? NICK DWYER In terms of, I mean if you look at... MIKE PARADINAS I have to be there to run it. NICK DWYER If you look at the output of the last, kind of, few years, it’s been huge. MIKE PARADINAS Right. At what point did I start releasing more records? NICK DWYER Yeah. At what point did you focus your intentions more on the label? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, probably in about 2001 or something, I think, I started spending more time doing that. I suppose... I didn’t think about it, really. I suppose I must’ve spent more time doing that and less on doing music, and it sort of all... NICK DWYER And it’s still happening now? You’re kind of less in the studio and more… MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, I’ve been making a bit of music this year. Not too much, you know, but I sort of make a bit occasionally. I do tend to work nine-to-five on doing the label, so that’s the main thing for me at the moment. NICK DWYER Tell us, what would a typical day at the label look like? What’s involved? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, I sort of go onto the Internet and sort of talk to the artists really on AIM and iChat, and I have to do accounts like pay them money and work out how much you sold. Talking to distributors is a big part of it, occasionally listening to demos and sorting out what you’re going to release, sorting out art work. It’s a pretty diverse thing. You have to do every part of it: ringing up manufacturers, getting the best price, sorting all that out. NICK DWYER You’re running everything by yourself at the moment? MIKE PARADINAS Pretty much, yeah. Press is done by someone else, and obviously, distribution is as well. But yeah, I do pretty much everything myself. NICK DWYER Right. Who’s distributing your records at the moment? MIKE PARADINAS SRD, which is Southern Record Distributors out of London, and Revolver in the States. NICK DWYER Right. You’ve been with SRD for how long now? MIKE PARADINAS Since the beginning, for eight years. They’ve been really good. Also, MP3 distribution is the new thing really, so you got iTunes doing that and Bleep because everyone just downloads it for free anyway, so a few of them are starting to buy it now. NICK DWYER Right. MIKE PARADINAS Getting a conscience or whatever. NICK DWYER Tell us a bit about Bleep. MIKE PARADINAS Bleep is run by Warp Records, which is a UK label which I was signed to for one album in the ‘90s, and they started up the MP3 download company I think three or four years ago. We were like one of the first labels on there, and it’s been growing slowly. It’s starting to do quite well now. NICK DWYER Right. So you’re starting to see a healthy percentage of your overall sales through theMP3 thing? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, yeah. That’s right. NICK DWYER You know, one thing I remember reading something about two or three years ago that I always found quite interesting was in an interview you said about one of the albums that ended up on Soulseek… Do you want to tell us about this? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, that was a joke. I put it on the promos, I put, “If you sell it, if you put it on the Internet, I’ll never make another album.” But I haven’t made another album. It wasn’t for that reason. NICK DWYER Before the album came out, you said, “If it ends up on Soulseek, there’ll be no more music.” MIKE PARADINAS Yeah. NICK DWYER And... MIKE PARADINAS There wasn’t. NICK DWYER Yeah. MIKE PARADINAS It’s a good excuse. NICK DWYER Yeah, yeah, definitely. MIKE PARADINAS It was done as a joke but everyone took it really seriously, especially the Germans. NICK DWYER Yeah. MIKE PARADINAS So I went along with them. NICK DWYER Yeah, yeah, yeah. MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, I mean, when it started, the MP3 downloads back in about, I think it was 2003, 2004, when Bleep was set up, that was the first company we went with. Now we sort of sell them through an agent to all the download companies. It was a bit disheartening because there were really hardly any sales at all, so it’s good that it is starting to grow a bit. Vinyl sales are starting to grow as well. NICK DWYER Oh, really? MIKE PARADINAS 12”s as well. NICK DWYER Yeah. MIKE PARADINAS So it’s all looking quite positive, for us anyway. NICK DWYER Right, I mean … MIKE PARADINAS A lot of labels are going bust, though, so it’s not great for everyone, but… NICK DWYER Musically, are there any particular strands that are a strong point to the label? MIKE PARADINAS I don’t know. I mean, yeah, the dubstep stuff is starting to sell quite well. It’s quite encouraging. But a lot of stuff is disheartening. Loads of stuff just doesn’t sell at all. NICK DWYER In terms of the dubstep stuff, I mean, obviously, it’s a very… well, you know, it originated as a very London and now a very UK form of music. MIKE PARADINAS Croydon. NICK DWYER Yeah, very Croydon. MIKE PARADINAS Just Croydon. NICK DWYER How’s that stuff going outside… MIKE PARADINAS Little bit of Norwood. NICK DWYER Little bit of Norwood? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah. South London. NICK DWYER Any in Worcester? MIKE PARADINAS No. NICK DWYER No. MIKE PARADINAS No. NICK DWYER How about in terms of, you know, places like America? Are there scenes starting to emerge? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, there are some people like Secret Agent Gel doing dubstep in… I think he’s in New Jersey or something. So yeah, it’s spreading around the world, so there’s pockets of it. I think there’s a New Zealand guy doing, trying to do dubstep… NICK DWYER Yeah. MIKE PARADINAS … Who’s annoying everyone on the forums? What’s his name again? Do you know who that is? NICK DWYER I do know his name, but I’d feel bad if I said it right now. MIKE PARADINAS Yeah. No, no. His music’s not bad at all. It’s just the attitude. Forums are great to sort of find out who’s... Instead of being sent loads of CDs and stuff by post, it’s sort of good to look on forums and seeing who’s sort of big demos and stuff because they always sort of try and big themselves up really. So, it’s interesting to see who bigs themselves up is usually... they spend more time doing that and less doing the music, so it’s usually pretty shit, and then the people who are quiet are doing the best stuff. NICK DWYER Yeah. MIKE PARADINAS That’s not always true, but I tend to find it generally is true in some sorts of music. NICK DWYER I mean, you’ve got a forum yourself on your website. Is it a blessing and a curse? MIKE PARADINAS What? NICK DWYER Is it a blessing and a curse? I mean, you know, with any kind of forum there’s… MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, I mean, there are good people and bad, you know, so it’s... Sometimes you get annoying things up, but … We got hacked last week, so... NICK DWYER What did the hackers do? MIKE PARADINAS They put up a photo of a Lebanese girl with her feet blown off. No, a video actually. It was anti-war. But I’m in favor of that, so it didn’t come down for a day. NICK DWYER Right. Do you want to listen to another track now? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, whatever. Which? What do you think? NICK DWYER Well, tell us about the compilation of the Sacred Symbols of Mu. MIKE PARADINAS Oh yeah. We put out this compilation this summer. It’s got 24 of our artists on there with... It was released at mid-price to try and sell it, you know. It’s just to sort of promote the label, and we did a party in London with twenty-one artists in three rooms, and that went pretty well. Trying to introduce some of the new artists who had signed to people and just make a good party really, that was sold out and went down pretty well. NICK DWYER I mean, for you, you’ve got about what, 80… How many artists do you have on your roster now? MIKE PARADINAS 80 or so, yeah, I think. NICK DWYER Whoa… MIKE PARADINAS Past and future. You know, not all of them. We don’t work with all of them anymore. At least we put out records of them or whatever. NICK DWYER Yeah. I mean, for you, who are some of the artists on your label at the moment that are, I don’t know, exciting you a lot at the moment? MIKE PARADINAS We just played Loefah there, and then we got Soundmurderer who’s one of the other people helping out here. We’ve released a record of his which is on here. Actually, we’ve probably got the 12-inch of that. Have we? I don’t know. [Digs in record crate] Yes. Here it is. Should we play that? Because this is Todd, who’s been... did he give a talk the other day, last week? NICK DWYER Todd Osborne. So this record’s under what alias? MIKE PARADINAS Soundmurderer & SK-1, which is him and the other Tadd, Tadd Mullinix. (music: Soundmurderer & SK-1 – “Toronto VIP”) NICK DWYER A lot of the music on Planet Mu is, you know, fairly diverse. Do you find that Planet Mu fans are pretty accepting of a large, kind of, percentage of the output on the label? MIKE PARADINAS Yes. Pretty much. I mean, it’s good because you get a different audience into – I mean, the drum & bass people might be fans, might be into this, or whatever. When we released Remarc, it introduced a lot of people into the label and same with the dubstep stuff. It sort of brings a lot of things together. I don’t know, it might alienate people. Some people… no one likes all of it except for me probably. NICK DWYER Yeah yeah. And you’ve been rereleasing a lot of old-school jungle and all that kind of stuff with the Remarc stuff? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, we did that with just the Remarc stuff. That was it. NICK DWYER You’re working on another… MIKE PARADINAS We are going to be releasing Bizzy B’s old hardcore stuff. I don’t know when, but maybe in the next couple years. And we’ve been putting out his new stuff as well. NICK DWYER Yeah yeah yeah. MIKE PARADINAS He’s an old junglist. He produced hardcore into sort of ’91 and is still releasing jungle now, and drum & bass. NICK DWYER With the fact that you’re kind of releasing a lot of this whole jungle and especially dubstep stuff, is it... Have you been kind of working with any of that kind of production yourself? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, I did. I’ve done a few tracks like that. Trying to… NICK DWYER Right. Will we be seeing anything in the light of day yet? MIKE PARADINAS I don’t know, probably not. NICK DWYER I mean, is it kind of... I don’t know, is it a conscious decision to maybe move away so much from the production side of things? Has the label got busier or are you actually -- MIKE PARADINAS No, it’s just conscious. It’s just I get less inspired as I get older. I just feel tireder and less like making music. I don’t know. It depends, you know. When I was a young teenager, I was more inspired by, you know, frustration and angst and all that shit, which I don’t have now. NICK DWYER Yeah. MIKE PARADINAS So, I guess I don’t make any music anymore. Well, I do, but maybe it’s shit. I really don’t know. It’s hard to tell with your own stuff. I just play it to friends, you know. People tend to like my early stuff and say my latest stuff’s shit, so... It’s the same with everyone, isn’t it? “I loved your first album. What happened?” NICK DWYER I mean, how much time are you kind of spending in the studio at the moment? MIKE PARADINAS Well, it’s all the same. It’s just, I’ve got one computer and that’s it. So, the studio is the office is the bedroom is... You know. I haven’t got a studio, basically. NICK DWYER For you, what are kind of the hardest things about running a label in this kind of modern age? MIKE PARADINAS The overbearing loneliness. NICK DWYER Yes. Does it get lonely out there? MIKE PARADINAS I just sit in front of my AIM on the computer all day, and the human contact is on iChat, which is AIM or MSN. That’s it. Occasionally, you have the weekend when I go out and do gigs. That’s it at the moment. Go out and DJ. Nick Dwyer Are you playing out much at the moment? Mike Paradinas Yeah, I’m playing out when I get back. I’m playing Technicality, which is a drum & bass night out there. They’re starting a dubstep label, so I think I’m playing the launch for that? Although I’m not quite sure which room I’m playing in. That’s at Mass in Brixton. Looking forward to that. Then we’ve got the launch party for the Mary Anne Hobbs album. It’s compilation coming out on our label of Mary Anne Hobbs, who’s a Radio 1 DJ. That’s got a lot of good tracks on it. Nick Dwyer Tell us a bit about Mary Anne Hobbs for people that don’t know. She’s been pretty supportive of this. Mike Paradinas Yeah she kicked off dubstep being big in the UK with her Dubstep Warz show. She had it on Radio 1, this year. She contacted me over AIM actually and we got to know each other, met up a few times at parties. I was really honored, I never say that word, when she asked me to release her compilation or came up with the idea of a compilation. Most Radio 1 DJs, are like Gilles Peterson release, compilations of ... She’d never done it. She wanted to represent the UK underground, so it’s got JME, and Terror Danjah on it, Kode9, Burial, plus a few drum & bass things like Amit and ... I can’t remember ... I’m sure I’ve got a copy of it here somewhere. I did have ... Someone’s stolen it. Was it you? Nick Dwyer I did see it before on there. Mike Paradinas There we go. That’s it. Right. Nick Dwyer So it’s not all dubstep stuff? Mike Paradinas No, it’s got ... Yeah, isn’t it? It’s all dubstep. It’s got Andy Stott, which is like techno, four-to-the-four, techno from Manchester, Digital Mystikz, which is dubstep, Terror Danjah, The Bug, which is dancehall, or digital dancehall, Spor, which is drum & bass for Renegade Hardware that sort of harder, twisted sound bass lines. Nick Dwyer And Amit who’s doing quite a ... Mike Paradinas Which is sort of ... Nick Dwyer … very dubstep-influenced. Mike Paradinas Yeah some of his stuff is. This track, which Mary chose is pretty straight-ahead. It’s a really good track. There’s one called “Immigrants”, which sounds pretty ... Nick Dwyer Yeah. Mike Paradinas You know the one. That’s the one I always DJ out. I wanted to get “Immigrants” on here, but Mary Anne wasn’t having any of it. That’s the one I wanted. Nick Dwyer Should we listen to something off there, then? Mike Paradinas Yeah, we can. Who’s that? How do you eject a track? I don’t know. Nick Dwyer OK. So the Warrior Dubz is out ... when will this be out? Mike Paradinas A couple of weeks I think… 23rd of October… three weeks or something. You could play this one… (music: Milanese ft. Virus Syndicate – “Dead Man Walking” / applause) NICK DWYER And the name of that track is…? MIKE PARADINAS “Dead Man Walking”, I think. It’s a Milanese remix of Virus Syndicate. NICK DWYER I mean, you’ve had a bit of experience getting music on the radio before. Is it really hard to get music on the radio in England? MIKE PARADINAS It’s just luck, I think. If the right people like it, then it’s going to get on there, I think. There’s nothing you can do. I mean, if you get pluggers, it can help, but sometimes it’s a waste of money. But I think the main thing is if... It’s pretty obvious if the track’s going to be the right track because everyone is going to be into it, and it’ll sort of run away with itself. NICK DWYER What is this whole notion of radio plugging, and what do these people do? MIKE PARADINAS They take money off labels. NICK DWYER They just steal money off labels. MIKE PARADINAS Yes. And they say they’re going to give you everything, and they give you nothing. Same as press. NICK DWYER Yeah, yeah. MIKE PARADINAS A track’s usually got a life of its own, I think. It’s going to be pretty obvious if it’s going to be big or not. Sometimes you think something’s going to be big and it just completely flop. A lot of it can be luck as well. You can’t really pay for a track to be big. Actually, you can if you’re a major label. NICK DWYER Yes, yes. MIKE PARADINAS But an independent label can’t. We haven’t got enough money, so it’s just… We put the tracks out there. If people like them, that’s great. NICK DWYER Obviously, the last thing you want is to be left with a whole lot of copies of records. How do you know what is the right amount to kind of press up? MIKE PARADINAS Experience. NICK DWYER Experience. MIKE PARADINAS Yes. You just look at your sales notes, see how much the last one sold or something similar might have done, or ask the distributors, really. They’ll say, “Well, we think we can sell this much,” and I usually sort of underestimate and then re-press if need be so we don’t waste money. NICK DWYER Yeah, yeah, yeah. Should we have a look at this... We’ll play this a bit, but should we have a look at the website? MIKE PARADINAS Sure, yeah. NICK DWYER Is that quite a large part of the Planet Mu operations, like a lot of people are checking the [website]? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah. NICK DWYER Have we got the camera? MIKE PARADINAS The website, since the beginning, has been a pretty big part of it, I think. NICK DWYER We did have a camera set up at some point. MIKE PARADINAS We did have a camera. If we do it in a minute, he’s going to move it over. Maybe we should listen to another track while... This is Digital Mystikz. This one’s pretty famous. (music: Plastician – “Cha Vocal” feat. Shizzle, Fresh & Napper / applause) NICK DWYER So yes. The Warrior Dubz got to get in the shops. Great album. Warrior Dubz. MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, yeah. Out soon. NICK DWYER Out soon. MIKE PARADINAS Please buy it. NICK DWYER So how important is it for you as a label to have a comprehensive website? [website shown on screen] MIKE PARADINAS Well, we had an old website, and I could never update it. The main problem was if I wanted to put up some information, I’d have to contact the guy in Canada who set it up for me and sort of email him all the information, and he’d put it up when he got a moment. Actually, that’s his girlfriend… NICK DWYER That’s a holding page. MIKE PARADINAS Right. So, this one, the new website which we’ve just put up – this isn’t actually online yet – is totally, I can alter everything basically, I just log in. I can add a new artist, add a new release, put all the news in, whatever I like. NICK DWYER You’ve got complete, like, for every single artist on the label, you’ve got complete bios? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, everything is up now pretty much… everything except the... well, contact details and the forum, the message board’s not up yet. But it will be coming online soon. NICK DWYER In terms of... So pretty much the whole of the catalog is up there on audio? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, in clips. Not the full tracks, but there’s clips of pretty much everything, yeah. So that’s the Virus Syndicate artist page there, and ... So yeah, we just go to that release, that single. You can just click on the title and play the MP3. I mean, it’s good. The old website had samples as well, but it’s hard to find them. This one’s a bit easier. So people can know if they want to hear something from the label, they just go to the website, click on the release, click on the title and you can hear it. NICK DWYER Is it much of a cost to have something like this set up and kind of keep maintaining? MIKE PARADINAS No. It’s free because my friend does it for free for me. NICK DWYER Nice. MIKE PARADINAS Yeah. Attila. I thank him very much. I just send him all the records, and he’s happy. NICK DWYER Yeah. That’s brilliant. MIKE PARADINAS Now there’s the server costs because we’ve just updated to a new server, which is … it’s less than 70 quid a year. So, that’s really cheap. It’s good that he’s a friend who does it. NICK DWYER The other thing with the label is, obviously, if anyone’s seen any of your covers, you like to kind of get some nice artwork in there. MIKE PARADINAS Sometimes, yeah. NICK DWYER Sometimes. Is it much of an outlay to… MIKE PARADINAS To manufacture a record? NICK DWYER Yeah. MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, I mean something like this... [looks at art work on vinyl sleeve] That’s nice art work. It’s a cow being either dismembered or killed or something. That cost us 500 quid, the cover. NICK DWYER Right. MIKE PARADINAS The artwork, and it’s all digital, done in Photoshop by a guy in Miami, Arnold Steiner. That was one of the more expensive ones. Usually, you spend about three or 400 quid on art work at the most. NICK DWYER Yep. MIKE PARADINAS I remember doing something like a 12”, like this. The template’s already done, so we did a load of them like this and then just changed the color. So that’s 20 quid or something, you know? You just have to type the... Choose a color, type the barcode in, and it’s done. NICK DWYER In terms of the label, is it a pretty busy time in the next while? Obviously, you’ve got the Warrior Dubz thing, but what else is coming? MIKE PARADINAS I shouldn’t really be here, yeah… NICK DWYER Yeah. You’ve got iChat conversations to have. MIKE PARADINAS I know, but if I ever turn it on, I’ll be talking to loads of people asking for money. NICK DWYER Yep. Always good to figure out [inaudible]. MIKE PARADINAS Or thanking me for money. NICK DWYER Yes, yes, of course. MIKE PARADINAS Yeah, I am pretty busy. I’ve got- well, the parties are sorted out by promoters, so that’s... I pretty much had to sort out everything before I came, so I had a pretty busy week just before I came out here just sorting out all the manufacturing of the releases that are coming out in the next, up until November. Just making sure everyone had all the parts for everything, all the art work was there uploaded to the servers and wherever the printer is and all that sort of thing. Yeah, you’ve got to keep your head screwed on, but only three things at a time. NICK DWYER Yes. You’re going to be around for the next couple of days? MIKE PARADINAS Yeah. NICK DWYER So, if people want to, in terms of, ask you anything about label stuff, and I mean if anyone has any questions now, by all means, put your hand up. Do we need a mic? AUDIENCE MEMBER What does Planet Mu mean? MIKE PARADINAS I don’t know. Actually, Tom Middleton came up with that, which is... When I went down to Exeter to meet Mark [Pritchard], Mark was the first person to want to sign me before I went to Rephlex. I went down and was sort of wondering about what name to choose, and that was one of the things that I’d come up with. It was μ-Ziq, and Tom liked it and said, “Yeah, yeah, you’ve got to do that.” So... I can’t remember. But Mu. .. I think it means something in Japanese as well. I’m not sure. It can mean whatever you want, really. AUDIENCE MEMBER Do you see dubstep as some sort of mystical music? MIKE PARADINAS Mystical? AUDIENCE MEMBER Yeah. Do you think that ... MIKE PARADINAS I get into it, when I go to the clubs, but not really mystical. I’m not sure what that means. Maybe if you smoke enough, or... I don’t know. I don’t really take drugs, so... Mystical. I mean, it’s, for me, mystical is like a little part of your brain which is giving you signals, so... I can get pretty in to dubstep, yeah. Nick Dwyer What I was going to say before as well is you’re going to be around so if people want to get you on to some production stuff… Mike Paradinas Yeah, production stuff as well. Nick Dwyer But do you want to tell us a little bit what’s going on this realm? [Points to laptop] Mike Paradinas Yeah, well you were talking about cut up beats earlier, I had a cut up beat on here, which I prepared earlier. Nick Dwyer Here’s something I prepared earlier. Mike Paradinas I wonder if this is turning on. Yeah. I make my own tracks as well. I still play live and DJ and stuff. I just opened this track, which can give you an idea of what you can do with… This is jungle, so if you put the amen break in here, you’ve got the waveform. Then you cut it up. This is Battery, which is this little drum machine you load in your sounds, I just loaded in the Amen break. It hasn’t even got the cymbal at the end. Wonder where that is? I just move the start point along, then stretch it.
[Plays drum machine]
You’ve got all these different sound effects, reverses, and stuff, pitch it. You can do all this within the program by ... If we go to the break here, you can tune it up, or down, and then effect it and stuff. Make it really grainy or something.
[Plays grainy break]
If you want it to sound like that, it can. I don’t know if you would. Sounds a bit like that Milanese thing. Then you put it all together and you can program something in.
[Plays music]
There… you can see that it’s got ... audience member What do you use when you’re playing live? Mike Paradinas This is what I use when I’m playing live, which is Logic with Battery and various plug ins and stuff. audience member How much is pre-prepared? Is there anything improvised? Mike Paradinas Anything I can improvise. Basically you can loop stuff, you can mute stuff, and you can piss around with plugins. For instance, I’m going to loop a bit of this break here. [Plays break loop] I can go in on that. I’ll fuck around with that on the funny little plug in thing. You can do that. You can ... It’s mainly structured. I’ve got loop-based tracks as well, where you can have loops and mute them on and off. I’m used to working with Atari, which used to be a lot more live. We used to trigger the MIDI stuff. You could almost write tracks on the fly, while you’re playing live, because you’ve got the keyboard there to input stuff. With this I’m not playing with a keyboard, so the only way to input notes is with a little pencil or whatever. It’s not something you can really do live. You could. You’d have to stop and then do it. It’s not very good for dancing. audience member [Inaudible] Mike Paradinas I used to. Sometimes. Yeah, I do. In this case I did. Yeah. You can map them on to the keyboard in Battery. If I open it up again, I don’t know, it’s not set on the screen is it? You can map each of those breaks and the different start points to different notes on the keyboard. Then you can play them like that. Which, I think, sounds a lot better than if you’re putting in by pencil. Then sometimes I do put in the notes in the sequencer and I just move them around a bit and get it sounding a bit more ... That’s a C-sharp one for example. I’m not really sure. I prefer playing it on the keyboard, so you get a little more musicianly feel to it. You get in to it. Then this year I’ve only been writing on the computer with no keyboard, just to restrict myself. audience member So it’s all just penciled in? Mike Paradinas Pardon? audience member You’re just drawing things on, using the mouse? Mike Paradinas Yeah, that’s what I’ve been doing this year. I don’t know why. I’ve been limiting myself. Nick Dwyer Any more questions for Mike? I was going to say, we’ve got some stuff happening upstairs for the rest of the evening, if anyone wants to come up and ask you anything. Mike Paradinas Yeah sure. Nick Dwyer Then by all means, they can. Thank you, Mike, for taking time out to chat. [Applause]

Title: Mu (Fat Freddy's Drop)
Date: 2015-04-20

Mu (Fat Freddy's Drop)
It sounds somewhat like a modern fairy tale. A seven-piece band called Fat Freddy’s Drop, out of Wellington, New Zealand, starts off playing local gigs and builds a solid fanbase. They record an album in their own studio, distribute it privately and go double platinum in their native country. Racking up several awards for their debut effort, including 2005 Album Of The Year at the Worldwide Music Awards, FFD embarks on a worldwide tour. This the stuff of any musician’s dreams, all the while the band maintained their underground integrity. The key behind their success? In this talk at the 2005 Red Bull Music Academy in Seattle, Fat Freddy’s Drop’s frontman Mu reveals nothing but the truth.
Hosted by Mu ... like Daniel Best from Sonar Kollective. He was the first person to discover a tune we did called "Midnight Marauders." Tony Nwachukwu Came out in 2003, right? Mu Yeah. A good friend of ours. We were close. Used to live in Detroit he fell in love with a girl and moved to New Zealand, set himself up there, but was still selling records and doing well in the rest of the world. When he went off to do a European tour, I gave him... Sent him off with 10 copies of "Midnight Marauders" and he just handed them out. Then, when he was in Germany, got the record to Daniel Best, from Best Seven and Sonar, and they loved the fusion of soul and reggae, and that’s kind of where it started for us outside of New Zealand. Tony Nwachukwu Cool. The bottom line is you must be knackered. You must be tired. Mu Yeah. I mean... Tony Nwachukwu It’s basically been full on for you guys since 2001, right? Especially for yourself, because I think... From what I can see... From what I’ve read, it seems a kind of consistent... Being in the studio, live gigs, doing these kind of small EPs and making this album. It's taken 18 months to make this album. Is your head clear at the moment? Mu Well it’s good being here, because I’ve managed to escape the studio, escape... I have a family. Get a break from that for a bit. Yeah, that’s kind of life at the moment is if I’m not at the studio then we're on the road with nine of us on the road, travelling, trying to push the record around across the world. Tony Nwachukwu Gosh. From 2001, was the beach at your studio... Has that pretty much been the HQ for Fat Freddy's Drop since then? Mu Yeah, out of seven of us in the band, I’ve always been the one with the most interest in the studio side of it, and I’ve slowly, over the last five years, built up a nice little home studio situated underneath a house. I’m lucky to live in a beautiful spot in Wellington which is from here to the wall is the water, the sea, and our studio looks out over the water. We didn’t really want to go to some sort of bigger, flashier studio and record our stuff. We wanted to... One, learn about the recording process, two maintain the control of it and three just sort of take our time. I’ve been throwing all my money and my energy into making sure we’ve got enough gear in my basement to take care of all our recording. Tony Nwachukwu Sure. Apart from doing the studio thing and the live gigs, is that pretty much your bag in terms of how you’re living, how you kind of manage yourself and the band? Mu Yeah. I’ve kind of been working slowly towards how to be a professional engineer or musician, and that’s only been the last couple of years I’ve managed to get that situation to happen where all I’m doing is music and that’s mainly focused around Fat Freddy's Drop. Tony Nwachukwu So in terms of the making of your album, it took 18 months and it was a reflection of your live shows, you were saying? Mu I think it took 18 months because we were on the road a lot. Tony Nwachukwu So how did it work? Mu In certain initial periods we would just jam along, record the jams and then unfortunately get interrupted by having to get on the road again. We were touring and when we came back we started where we left off. So it was a wee bit sporadic at first and interrupted in the first half of the 18 months and then we decided in the later part of that we’ve got to sit down and nail it. We basically got sick of getting harassed by the New Zealand public, as to where the album was. We had to push on and get it finished. Tony Nwachukwu But it must be a good feeling then, knowing that you’re wanted. Mu Yeah, yeah. I mean, New Zealand is a small place, so the word gets back to you pretty easily and pretty quickly when people want something. Tony Nwachukwu Sure. Something I thought was really, really good was the fact that, in terms of your newer members of the band, that they’re actually members per se. A lot of bands, for example, have core members and they might introduce a drummer or a keyboard player when it comes to writing the album or performing live or whatever, but you guys pretty much kept evolving, in terms of your band member structure. I think that’s quite a unique thing. Has that always been your policy to kind of introduce... Mu Yeah. I think it’s an unwritten policy with us that every person that’s involved with our music project is very much an equal member of the project, both creatively and financially and I think that’s a really important part of and why we’ve lasted this long, and why hopefully we will continue to maintain the vibe, because everybody that’s involved feels like they’re in there and has something to contribute to the project. I think that the longevity of the band will definitely be reflected by that policy, I think. Tony Nwachukwu Oh, I would definitely agree with that. I guess there’s one thing to be said about being on stage and having that kind of improvisational approach to being on stage and making music, but at some point decisions need to be made, particularly when it comes to making the studio album. I guess you’re the person in the band who has to... Because you’re the producer, I guess. Somebody has to kind of steer the reins in some respect. Mu Yeah. I think that’s why the album took so long to make. We’re born on the stage. That’s kind of where we came from, and having to learn to write music and arrangements that were restricted to shorter lengths, was quite a tough process for us as a band to learn how to do. When we were writing the album, we went down many roads and had to retract and come back, and we’re just trying to find a process... It’s mainly just trying to find a process that suited a band that was pretty much just a live improv band coming up with appropriate length arrangements for an album. That was probably why it took a long time to do. How it worked in the studio with having to make tough decisions is I was definitely steering the production and the studio and the engineering side of the album, but it pretty much came down to... Because we’re a democratic band, it pretty much came down to whoever was prepared to stay in the studio the longest pretty much got their idea in there. The whole process for us is trying to include everybody in the band, everybody’s ideas, everybody’s melodies, everybody’s arrangements, and it was kind of like one of those competitions where you’re at a radio station. You’ve got to keep your hand on the car, and you win the car, whoever keeps their hand on there the longest. Someone who’s there like four days later, that’s kind of how things happened. Just very natural, but if you’re stubborn and you stay in the studio and you’re there at five in the morning then you’ve got a better chance of your idea getting into the finals. Tony Nwachukwu But have you got an unfair advantage, because... Mu Yeah, I’ve got an... Yeah. I can disappear, go upstairs, have a sleep, and come back. Tony Nwachukwu What was the most challenging track on your album to actually put together? We’ll listen to it a bit later, but... Mu I found the whole thing quite challenging. The songs, the ones that were quite hard were the ones that went off the most live, which really had no live, were the hardest ones to produce for the record. Tracks like "Wandering Eye" that just had such a live feel. Like I said, trying to find that process of trying to maintain that live vibe within a record, those were kind of the hard ones. The most fun ones were tracks like "Ray Ray" which I’ll play a bit later on, which is probably a wee bit more from where I’m from, and the fact that it was completely constructed in the computer in Pro Tools and the MPC and being able to sit in front of the computer for days tinkering away. Tony Nwachukwu Is that the one in the MPC? Mu No. I’ve got a version of it in the MPC and I’ve got a... Yeah. Tony Nwachukwu OK. Should we hear that? Mu Yeah, if we have it. (music: Fat Freddy’s Drop - “Ray Ray” / applause) Tony Nwachukwu So you can’t tell me that half of New Zealand’s music industry isn’t sniffing at you and trying to sign you. Mu Yeah, we’ve had different major labels in New Zealand sniffing around on our live gigs for a long time, but with the music that we’re running we are trying to bring something sufficient to the business side as well and being independent to us is incredibly important. Tony Nwachukwu Why is that? Mu For many reasons, but the main two is to have complete control of how we are perceived in the public and how we do things. And secondly, within New Zealand it just doesn’t make sense to sign to a label, when we’ve done all the ground work, we’ve played lots of live gigs, people know who we are, why would we give away 75% of the cash to a major label that wastes money spending money on bad marketing budgets, bad video ideas? There is no point. Where we get to see a very big chunk of all the music that we sell. So the maths doesn’t make sense to go to a major label. Make that money and keep it, you know? Tony Nwachukwu So, in terms of infrastructure, are you responsible for the business side as well? Mu Yeah, my partner Nicole, who lives out with us at the beach, she is the business manager for The Drop, which is a little company which is essentially myself and her who manages all the financial business dealings to do with Fat Freddy’s Drop. I kind of run the gigs and the bookings and that side of things and my partner runs the checkbook. Tony Nwachukwu As women should, as it’s much better than to spend it on equipment or something. In terms of being independent in New Zealand, obviously you developed some kind of partnerships with other companies in different countries, can you go into how that’s been for you? Say, your connection with Sonar Kollektiv licensing the album. Mu We decided not to give it away to one person outside of New Zealand and Australia. The Drop takes care of New Zealand and Australia, we have an English manager who set up a little label just to look after the record in England called Kartel, this guy called Charlie Welsh. Tony Nwachukwu How did you hook up with him? Mu He was dealing with another label back in New Zealand called Loop Recordings, who were doing a lot of electronic stuff and kind of on our tours through the UK met him and kind of thought that he’d be a good person to hook up with. We’ve kind of been, as far as distribution and hooking up with other labels, we’ve kind of been very much sort of dipping our feet kind of approach. We’d hook up with someone and like in the guest territories, we’ve gone with Sonar Kollective. The Kartel is kind of managing the UK, and the rest of Europe, and we’re currently looking for someone in Japan and trying to talk to some people here in the States, but trying more of an approach of not having one person looking after the rest of all, mainly for the reason that if it all tends to ship with that one person then we are rooted, so it is probably better for us to have someone taking... Like if the people in Germany screw it up for Germany then it is not screwed up for anyone else, and we just want to keep our eggs in many baskets. Kind of share the risk. Tony Nwachukwu So far, has this been fruitful? Mu I suppose that’s where we’re at at the moment. It is looking good, but we’re at a stage in the Fat Freddy's career where we are trying to sell records outside of New Zealand, so that’s where we are right now, in the middle of that. For us that means just constantly touring at this point just Europe and the UK. Tony Nwachukwu How many tours have you had in Europe? Mu We have done four, which is quite a big deal for us, because, one, that is 17,000 miles away from New Zealand, and our live shows are fairly produced and fairly high tech, so we have to travel with our own sound engineer. We have seven people in the band, we have managers, so that’s at least nine on the road. The band’s not a young band. Half of the band have got kids and families, and at some point in a two- or three-month tour you have to bring over your partner and your kid at some point. Tony Nwachukwu I didn’t know that part. Bottom line, in terms of earning a living and maintaining the band, it’s all about the live shows, right? Mu Yeah. Tony Nwachukwu So it’s like... it must be a challenge. Mu Yeah, when the live shows are very... We’ve traveled from New Zealand to the UK. Actually four times now, and the last tour was the only one that broke even, so we are looking from here on to hopefully start making money out of touring. We do very well in New Zealand. We can tour and play and make really good money in Australia and New Zealand, but we have to because we’re pretty much just throwing it all at the touring outside of those territories, because we are still slowly getting the name, but it’s not enough of a name to draw big fees to cover the travel of nine people. Tony Nwachukwu I mean, in this day and age it is surprising to have a band of three or four people, who aren't Top 40 or whatever. So is that your goal to kind of be pop stars? Mu No, we don’t want to be pop stars. I think there’s different tiers of business in the music business and obviously the top level is where they’re making a lot of stupid money. But I think there’s a level where you can maintain some integrity and just make good music and still make nine-minute, ten-minute tracks and hopefully sell enough CDs to make a bit of a living. We just want to sit in there, maybe the higher end of that is the aim, I think. I think we would be kidding ourselves if we expect to become pop stars. Maybe the lead singer would might take off and... [laughs] Tony Nwachukwu ...do some R&B. Mu Yeah, do some R&B. Tony Nwachukwu I see your brain was just going somewhere right now. Mu [laughs] I just want to know where our lead singer is right now. Tony Nwachukwu So currently, apart from the album coming out, the album did quite well. I know it went double-platinum in New Zealand, you won a whole leap of awards, didn’t you? Mu Yeah, we kicked up a bit of a ruckus in New Zealand. A few months ago we were asked at the start of the new year to be involved in the local main music awards for New Zealand. Actually, we were thinking initially that we don’t want to get involved with that rubbish, it’s all mainstream. It’s just not us. And then we changed our mind ‘cause I think that we’re in a position to hopefully change things in the music scene in New Zealand. Wouldn’t it be a just a wee bit stubborn and negative to do that? So we decided to go. We thought we might win one or two awards, but we were up for four and it would be good to go there and fly the flag for independent music, take off with a few awards and that’s what happened. We snuck in there and won four, two of the main awards and that was very rare. I can’t think of any other bands in recent history that were independent, not signed to a major, and to pick up some awards. Tony Nwachukwu Do you have to stand there and receive this award? Mu Yeah, we had to get up and... Tony Nwachukwu Did you have to dress up? Or did you just wear Fat Freddy's t-shirts? Mu We were looking pretty motley. We just kind of got up and... We didn’t even really have any plans for any speeches... Yeah, we just maintained our kind of low key vibe. We were humble and took our awards, and walked off stage. Tony Nwachukwu In terms of being at awards, for you it’s all about the beach where you’re at, your HQ, to be in a place where you’re surrounded with industry people who you loathe, so to speak, how did you feel being at that award it’s obviously got accolades, and it’s good to get accolades, but the bottom line, the industry is very much not where you want to be in terms of the whole major label thing? Mu Not really, but I think even globally I think the business model for the music industry is all changing, and I think we can be of help to ourselves and we can be a help to the people that are coming up and using the music industry to help get things changed. I mean, it’s all, for many reasons, changing with the availability of the music via the net and all that is changing. I think we owe it to ourselves and to other people to get in there and encourage change in the music industry. That is the whole reason for us to even accept our nominations for those awards recently, was to try and get in there and make it easier for more independent people to make music and get it out there, and not get ripped off and signed by major labels, you know? Tony Nwachukwu So the net has helped you a lot, you would say? Mu It’s definitely helped us, not directly financially, but as far as getting our music out there to the rest of the world, because New Zealand’s a long way away. I think for small countries like New Zealand that are on the other side of the world, they’re the people that the net helps the most, I think, with getting their music out there. Tony Nwachukwu So, what’s next for you? Are you working on a new album? Mu Yeah, I think I get back to New Zealand, I’m home for two weeks, and then we head off to... We just got a real short quick tour of places like Hamburg, Germany, most of Germany, through to the UK. Seven gigs in a row, and then we come back to New Zealand after that and we’ll be in New Zealand until the next European summer. Throughout the period we’ll start to work on the new album, and I think for us working on the new album is drawing up some new samples on the MPC, and having a bit of a jam on stage and trying to write some new songs. We kind of write our songs on the stage. Just a simple idea, a simple melody, and then hopefully three or four gigs later it has started to turn into a bit of a tune. The first few times it will probably be a flop, but that’s cool. We’ll do that process for our summer. We’ll workshop tunes live. We have a pretty busy tour back home, so plenty of time to workshop some tunes, and then once we’ve done that we’ll probably come back to the studio and start turning them into the second album. Tony Nwachukwu Did you record... Obviously you record all of your live shows. Mu Yeah, we would travel with our live front of house engineer. He has a laptop out front and records it all. Tony Nwachukwu Do you use that information, that audio, for the actual studio album, or do you...? Mu It’s more of a reference, but it’s definitely not unheard of that there might be a little breakdown in the middle of a show where it’s just down to a couple of instruments, and they become a loop that’s a part of the track for sure. Tony Nwachukwu Will there ever be a three-and-a-half minute tune by Fat Freddy’s Drop? Mu Not by us. I think we have to give the parts to someone else to do a radio edit. I think we can’t just write anything less than four, five minutes. Tony Nwachukwu Is that “can’t” or “won’t”? Mu A bit of both. I mean, that track that I just played before has four main sections and a bit of an outro jam, but it started with eight main sections ‘cause you got seven or eight people involved in the writing process. Like I said earlier, whoever hangs around the longest on that night in the studio and during the mix-down is going to get their section in there. Tony Nwachukwu And in terms of trying to get a creative perspective on a track, is there any tips and tricks you want to share with us? In terms of getting your snare drum in there or getting your bass melody in there. Mu Yeah. I mean, like you said earlier, I have the advantage of living there, so when everyone takes off, I change everything and when they come back in the morning they hopefully don’t notice too much. Tony Nwachukwu So, seven heads in the studio making music must be quite a challenge at some times? Mu Yeah, it’s not always pretty. In that process of doing this album were many tears. But that’s just a good thing, I think. Out of those tears come some good decisions. You just have to get through that process of confrontation to get to what you really need to have on the tune. Tony Nwachukwu What would you say would be the thing that was the most thought about in terms of direction and... Was it more of the direction thing or...? Mu Yeah, it’s more... Usually those difficult moments come quite early in the piece as to where the direction of the tune should be going. Once we’ve all had our fight and we’ve decided to go down this particular route and style for this tune, we usually lock in around the same page. It’s usually stylistic or a vibe kinda of argument early on as to where the tune should go. Once we sort that out then it’s usually pretty straight forward. Tony Nwachukwu In recordings is it kinda of like... Mu There’s plenty of outtakes. Tony Nwachukwu You said you had something on the MPC. Mu Maybe I’m just gonna illustrate... to explain, when we play live we don’t have a drummer or a bass player. It’s all... the rhythms and the basslines usually start from here from the MPC and over the top maybe a three piece horn section, trumpet, saxophone, trombone, electric and acoustic guitar [played by] the same person, a singer and a keyboard player. And I just want to simply illustrate how we play live [prepares the MPC]. (music: slow arpeggiated sequence from Fat Freddy's Drop – “Midnight Marauders”) ... on the other eight channels that I have on the disk, I should take a feed from every mic on stage and... That’s really just... I don’t mix the band on stage, I just take every mic just so I can access their lines for doing echoes and delays and reverbs. What I’m sending back to the front house engineer is three lines, will be left and right from my mixer then a separate fixing. The mono fixing which is the delays only. I’ll go mental onstage with the delays. The front house engineers actually have fun bouncing it up. He’ll decide that I just got too mental and pull my channel out, or if it’s working then he’ll bring it out. I’m sure half the time he’s got it down. Tony Nwachukwu I guess you go mental, you go mental quite a lot? Mu Yeah. It’s... Hopefully you’ll get to see a Fat Freddy's show at some point. I think at this point is what we’re best at, is playing live. We’re part way there with the album of making those... Saying the process of trying to become a... Make that transition being a live band to a studio recording was very hard. We’ve got part way there with this album and we’ve... I think the best is yet to come. I think... We’re starting a slightly different process for the next album. Tony Nwachukwu What was the most challenging thing about trying to get the live, live on the album? Mu When you... We did things in a weird... we’ve done everything in a strange order. We’ve become a very popular live band and then we’re trying to turn those into a record, whereas normally, people write a great tune and then they develop, they turn into a great live show. We’ve done it the other way around. It’s hard when you’ve written something onstage and you play it to people and it goes off in a room where there’s 300 or whether it’s 2,000 just rocking to your live show. Then you get in the studio and write a tune... It's just not the same, you know. a lot of changes. Yeah. It’s just not the same. It’s not the same as being eight people in the studio listening to the monitors and playing live in front of 2,000 people and rocking houses. Trying to make that transition has always been quite hard. It’s just the vibe, it’s not the same in the studio as it is onstage for sure. Tony Nwachukwu Then, wouldn’t it be about trying to capture some of that, including some of the improvised recordings from the live...? Mu I think... That’s what I was saying, I think the process for the next album may be a wee bit different. Nothing’s set at the moment we’ve all... Since we’ve done this album I think all the people in the band, we’re all in agreeance that the next album should be more recorded in a more old school approach. With us all playing at the same time and actually writing arrangements that are a little bit shorter and just playing them. Then, taking the best take and doing a little bit of multi-track and studio manipulation later. Essentially at the heart of it is a live take by everybody. We’ll definitely explore those processes in the next album for sure. Tony Nwachukwu Do you think they’ll be... The MPC always be the master beat or do you think you’ll...? Mu Yeah, I think... Definitely for the live show, I think that gives us our club edge. Find that we can go into a dirty little 250 people club with a big PA and do that kind of night, two in the morning set. Or we can do the lovely four in the afternoon festival set. We can... got our bases covered and... also acts for me as a bit of a point of difference that we have from other people is that we don’t have a rhythm section, a live rhythm section. It is in effect that bass lines and the beats are locked down. The changes and the different colors actually come more melodically and they come from the rest the band as opposed to the accent being on fill changes and... With the effects and the beat and stuff does move around a few but it doesn’t get too boring with the MPC. Hopefully I’ll think of what other use to keep things interesting with the MPC. Tony Nwachukwu Did you have any situation where the MPC has been a bit naughty? Mu I’ve been lucky. It’s been a few years since I’ve had the MPC freeze on me in the middle of a set. It hasn’t happened recently. It’s actually the only thing I get nervous about, and I still get nervous about before a gig, is not performing in front of people or stuffing up, but actually the MPC freezing on me is my only nightmare that I have. But that’s why I use the MPC, it’s solid, it just never lets me down. Probably like five times in my whole career with Fat Freddy’s Drop. Tony Nwachukwu And you’ve always created music with the MPC? Mu My main tools... Obviously, live is the MPC and I’ve worked in Pro Tools for a long time. But we had a conversation the other day... I’ve reached the point where I’ve been doing production for a long time and I’ve always managed to hide from MIDI. And I’m at a point where I bought some software synths the other day and sort of delve into that world. But up to this point, I have always been programming on the MPC and export it into Pro Tools as audio, because when you’re dealing with six musicians, it’s always performance-based and dealing with audio. Definitely a lot of editing and cutting up, but cutting up real audio as opposed to MIDI. Tony Nwachukwu Sure. Obviously, that will bring a different writing approach in terms of using plug-ins or whatever. It’ll be a good one, trust me. It’ll be alright. Mu I think... Essentially, I will maintain the MPC and audio in Pro Tools side of things but [to] incorporate the MIDI as an extra factor will definitely be useful, I think. Tony Nwachukwu Do you use much outboard in the studio? Mu I mainly work in the box, mainly mix inside the computer, but that’s all about to change. I have got many plug-ins, my front end on Pro Tools is pretty good, I’ve got some really nice mic pre's, some very nice mics and hire in a couple of good compressors and use Apogee converters, so essentially what’s going into Pro Tools is pretty good. So I feel confident and all the mixing can kind of stay in the box. Tony Nwachukwu This is good because I mean, you know, earlier you said that, you know, you basically learned as you went along, right? You know, you’re already saying things like an Apogee compressor. You’ve obviously done some research in terms of what equipment to use, what’s best out there, you know. Mu Yeah, yeah. I mean, before, pre-Fat Freddy's Drop, I’ve kind of, I’ve been... I’ve always been, I’ve worked in other studios before. I’ve kind of set up mine here where I worked in a very flush studio in Wellington and had access to good gear and, yeah. I’ve always been interesting in finding out how to record things really well. That’s kind of my world, really. Tony Nwachukwu Definitely shows on the album, I’ll tell you. Sounds amazing. Mu Cheers. Tony Nwachukwu So... A studio Mu or the live Mu? Mu That’s a constant battle. That’s the Fat Freddy’s Drop battle. Hopefully, for the next album we work out how to capture a bit of both, a bit of good studio accuracy, as well as a loose live vibe. Tony Nwachukwu Has anyone got any questions? Audience Member Yeah. I got two. I got two questions. First is just about the name, Fat Freddy’s Drop. Is it named after the Furry Freak Brothers? Mu That’s kind of what we tell people. Audience Member OK. Mu But I feel comfortable in telling you the truth. I’m sure they made it everywhere else in the world, but back in the day there was some acid, some LSD that came out to New Zealand called Fat Freddy’s, and that was probably the best and the strongest acid that I’ve... I don’t take acid anymore. This was a long time ago. Myself and Toby, he’s probably hiding over there somewhere. He might not have been involved in this. Me and the singer, I definitely took some, these trips. The very first version of a track called “Hope,” we did came off the back of a two or three day session on these Fat Freddy’s. That was the first thing we’d ever done, and we didn’t have a name, we were just tinkering around in our pretty basic studio at that point. We gave it to the local radio station because they had... It was the 21st birthday of one of the local student stations in New Zealand and they wanted a track, and we gave them this track, and it was pretty cool. They said, "What’s your name?" We don’t have a name, so we just kind of... We just called it Fat Freddy’s. That’s kind of stuck. The aim was definitely to lose that name and come up with a proper name, but it just never went away. [laughter] We just tell the press, because we kind of don’t want to push that whole drug thing with that music. We just tell the press, yeah, it’s the Furry Freak Brothers. Audience Member Probably the name for the acid came from the Furry Freak Brothers. Mu Yeah, yeah, totally. Indirectly, it’s the truth. Audience Member My second question was about when you perform live with the MPC. Do you usually load one file with different drum kits and stuff, or do you load several files in a row? Mu Each song will have its own program. I can normally fit half the set on one load, so it’ll be five tunes and five different kits and five different sequencers. I’ll mainly be reloading half way through our set. Usually, there is one song that we use during our set, which is called “Roady”, and we start with a very kind of jammy horn acapella while I’m reloading. Audience Member Since you have such a large group of people with the band traveling around, have you ever had a phase where you say, “OK, for now people are busy, so we only play with part of the band,” or you just turn down the show or tour if not everyone can do it? Mu We pretty staunchly stick to the seven-piece and that’s kind of, we can’t do it, then we can’t do it. Yeah, it’s funny. That’s the norm, but unfortunately, we’re about to head to Europe again just for a short trip, and one of our horn players can’t make it, so he’s going to miss the first gig or two. That’s kind of the first time that this has happened. Yeah, pretty much staunchly stick to the seven-piece, and that’s that. Tony Nwachukwu You’re drafting someone in for that or you just kind of have the... Mu We’re just try and wing it without, yeah. Tony Nwachukwu Killer, OK. Mu It definitely won’t be the same. It’ll be something different, it’ll be something cool. We kind of stick to that whole band or nothing. It’s quite hard to articulate why. There is some sort of freaky live magic that exists when we’re all playing, and there’s no point in trying to do it without anyone here. Audience Member Did musicians find it hard in the studio, if they are so used to play live, to vibe off of each other? Are people going in on their own or did you try and keep it that there’s a couple of people playing each time? Mu Initially, we started off very much quite separately. We would have the basic rhythm track in Pro Tools and a couple of horns would come in and do their parts and then the vocalists would come in on another day and they would do their part, guitars and all. Initially, it was quite separate. We found later on that it didn’t really had as much vibe. So we kind of went around in circles. We started off like that and then come back and get all the horns on a couple of occasions to come back and stand in front of one mic and just play together. It was a good thing that we have our own studio so we could experiment and work out what works best. But initially, it was a lot of stuff done separately having to come back and build it together. Tony Nwachukwu Is there a track that you are most proud of? Mu I’m pretty proud of the whole album, to be honest, I think, yeah. That’s, um... That’s not perfect, none of it. You’ve always got to leave room. That’s the whole thing about making music, is there’s always room for improvement. If you ran out of room for improvement, then you might as well do something else. I’ve always put into context that this is where my, our, skills are at this point and this is what we’ve produced and that’s cool. Move on, learn new lessons and look to improve. Generally, I’m pretty proud of it, of everything we’ve done so far. Tony Nwachukwu And when you listen to the album now, you know, when you walk into supermarkets in New Zealand or Tesco’s in London when it’s playing in the background, what kind of thoughts go through your mind? Mu It makes us proud. Especially back home, we are kind of like the cafe kings back home. If you go in a cafe in a major city in New Zealand, it’s usually the first album with only four tracks that play for 80 minutes. But those are usually pretty proud moments... Yeah, it’s great. I mean, we always wanted to maintain some underground integrity, but at the same time we’re making music for people to hear it and for it be heard, either way that’s great. Tony Nwachukwu It’s hard trying to strike that balance. On one hand it’s good that people hear good music, especially in this day and age, at the same time I think it’s interesting that this whole idea of being underground in terms of perspective and what you’re trying to achieve, I think it shouldn’t be underground, it should definitely be overground. Mu I mean, what’s underground and what’s mainstream at the moment, I’m pretty sure it exists outside of New Zealand as well, it’s just so much rubbish on the charts. That’s just what people are fed, so that is what people know. And if you’re in a position to push good music into people that don’t know otherwise, then that’s got to be healthy. Because the masses are just getting fed rubbish and if you are in a position to feed them something that’s a wee bit different, a wee bit better, then that’s got to be good. Tony Nwachukwu But the fact that you had a number one, isn’t it quite possible that Fat Freddy’s Drop could be mainstream? In the sense of sales and in terms of profile, not necessarily music taste... Mu If that’s the case, then that’ll be great, I reckon. I wouldn’t have a problem with that if we didn’t have to change the music that we’re making. Certainly, we’re reaching out for those sales back in New Zealand, they’re up there, I think. When I left New Zealand to come here, the album was just selling over 40,000 records. In a country as small as New Zealand, that’s pretty great. Tony Nwachukwu All from the beach, all privately distributed, that’s great. Mu For a country our size it’s huge and it won’t stop. It will keep on going, I think. Tony Nwachukwu To every household in the nation... Mu To every cafe, yeah. Participant I was going to ask a question, you mentioned before about your mics, you got really good mics. Can you tell us a little bit about your mics? Are certain mics that are more specific for recording vocals and ones for recording a horn section? Tell us a bit about that side of things... Mu I auditioned quite a lot of mics pre writing the album and tried a lot of classic stuff, like a Neumann U87 tried some AKG 44 mics and I unfortunately couldn’t get my hands on a U47, which would have been cool. In the end as the main vocal mic I went for a company called Blue Microphones and they make the most top end non-tube mic, which is called the Kiwi. Tony Nwachukwu Is that a bit of an irony there ‘cause it’s called “Kiwi”? Mu It’s a total coincidence. Blue Microphones is a company that I think is Latvian, they used to make the capsules for Neumann back in the day. They went off and set up their own company and they had all these fruity names for their range of mics and this one happened to be called Kiwi. That’s what sounded best to me. And then in the end, just ‘cause it’s a home studio, we used the Kiwi on a lot of the album. If I had resources and would have the money, I probably would have gone for the horns... I would have used ribbon mics. But unfortunately there’s not a lot of places where you can just go and hire flash mics. You can buy them, but you can’t hire that stuff outside. I found one really good condenser and had to use it on most things. Tony Nwachukwu And where did you record mostly, in the basement? Mu Yeah, it’s one bedroom bed set with a lounge, a separate bedroom and a kitchen upstairs and I turned the bedroom into the recording booth and the lounge into the control room, closed the door and pushed record. Everything in there, from drums to horns. We use the MPC for the live show, but a lot of drums and live bass did make it onto the record. Participant I just wanted to ask... On the way over here on the plane from New Zealand in the back they had all the audio channels that you can listen to on the headphones and stuff and channel 15 was Fat Freddy’s Drop. So basically, they had a whole bunch of the album, some of the old stuff, some exclusive stuff and “related” kind of Fat Freddy’s Drop tunes. I was just wanted to ask you if you make a lot of money through the licensing and if it’s one of your financial outlets ‘cause there’s heaps of compilations with tracks on them. I just wonder if that’s a really viable option in terms of trying to make some money. Mu I’m not too sure. I could be wrong but I think, because it’s public performance and the airline paid their APRA – in New Zealand it’s called APRA, who look after collecting money for artists – I think maybe they’re just allowed to do that. Tony Nwachukwu Are you guys published? Mu No, we haven’t got a publishing deal, but we almost signed a publishing deal, an administration publishing deal, just to get us through the next couple of years before we sign to a major. Tony Nwachukwu And that would be an equal split as well in terms of writing? Mu Yeah, for sure. I think it’s important that everyone remains freely down the middle for everyone to keep their credit. Tony Nwachukwu Sure, that’s very admirable in these times. I’d like to hear something else, actually. [to audience] You wanna hear something else? Would you say that you’re a superstar? Mu What’s that? Tony Nwachukwu A superstar. Mu I’m fairly well known in New Zealand. Tony Nwachukwu So when you’re walking around in the street, people know who you are? Mu It is getting a bit strange like that. People are starting to recognise me down the supermarket Only because we put our first video out not that long ago... We feature quite heavily in the video and the video is getting quite major play on TV back at home. This is one of my favourite tunes on the album that noone seems to have really found. (music: Fat Freddy’s Drop - “Del Fuego” / applause) That’s the more sensitive side of Fat Freddy’s Drop. Tony Nwachukwu [laughs] Can you talk us through how this was put together? Mu That was actually a really a fun track to work on in the studio. We kind of constructed it and wrote it in the studio, but it was one of the few tunes that was big, long takes. A lot of comping and editing was involved in the vocals on the album, taking little bits here and there from all different takes. Whereas the vocal on that track was pretty much from start to finish. The bass was the same and the horns with a little bit of construction with the beats, pretty much everyone played from start to finish. Tony Nwachukwu And it was all done within Pro Tools? Mu Yeah, that was all done in Pro Tools. Tony Nwachukwu You’ve got a really warm sound for using Pro Tools. What kind of plug-ins did you use for the compression? Mu My main... I used the Sony Oxford plug-in, they got a great EQ and presets. That’s one of my main plug-ins I use with a little bit of some of the mastering stuff from Waves, the C4 and the L2. I have two lots of plug-ins that I bought. I’ve got a laptop and I’ve got thousands of dollars worth of cracked plug-ins on, but in the studio I use a fairly clean G5 with stuff I bought, that’s just Sony and Waves. Tony Nwachukwu And for the dubby delay, what do you tend to use for that? Mu I either use tape delay echos like the Roland Triple 5s or the 501. Tony Nwachukwu You got one of those? Mu Yeah, I’ve got one of each. Just a quickie, which is a good trick I can [recommend] is using Digi Design delay, which sounds pretty terrible, but on the return channel, if you slap on some amplitude or some filthy filter, it kind of makes the sound a wee bit more like a tape delay. Tony Nwachukwu That’ll make it a bit more coarse and a bit more like analog. OK, killer. Audience Member I was going to ask about the song writing process. How does Dallas approach that and is it just his own thing or does everyone have a hand in it and does he work out something before hand? Or does he hear the music and then it comes from there? How does that work? Mu He usually comes, the lyrics are totally his thing, he writes the lyrics. He’s usually inspired by a jam with the band, we’ll come up with some new jam and that’ll set some new tone or some new vibe and then he’ll sit there in the corner of the room with a pen and paper while we’re jamming and write some lyrics. Then, it’s just to-ing and fro-ing and he’ll find a chorus, find a find and then suggest some changes in the music just to suit the lyrics he’s just written. It’s all pretty natural. He usually comes off the back of the music, the music’s usually first. Audience Member Would you say that your lives shows have changed since releasing the album in terms of that, a lot of the people touring England have heard the album and they want to hear the tracks from the album. Would you say your live sets, the songs are actually finishing now instead of doing the 30 minute roll over into the next track? Have you found it’s changed? Mu Yeah, it’s definitely had to change a wee bit to cater for... In New Zealand now we’ve started, that CD when I played earlier from, Live at the Matterhorn, was 20, 30 people on a Sunday night all probably stoned and drinking whiskey. Now, in New Zealand, when we’re doing shows in town halls to quite big numbers, you kind of, you feel like you have to give the set a wee bit more shape than we used to, that’s the down side of getting popular within New Zealand having to... But still having to, the songs are still, they’ve gone from being 30 to 40 minutes down to 15 to 20 minutes. We’ve made some compromise there. Unfortunately, what we used to do a lot is, just the other day I came up with a really cool sample I found at home on a record and Don Love put a kick and snare to it and played it that night with the band. Unfortunately that doesn’t get to happen as much because people want to hear some of the songs. It’s a bit sad. Yes, it has changed a wee bit. Tony Nwachukwu What’s the track that people keep on asking for? Mu People always ask for “Hope” and “Midnight Marauders” and we very seldom play them. That’s kind of us just being stubborn. They’re songs that we’re kind of done with, we didn’t put them on the album and... It’s very much maintained a bit of an attitude and it’s also our music and we’ll play what we want to play at the time and “Midnight Marauders” and “Hope” are songs that we kind of done and dusted a few years ago. We’re happy to release them on compilations but not happy to play them anymore. Usually if a gig goes off, especially overseas, and it rocks, we use them as encore tunes, “Midnight Marauders”, but they’re definitely not on the set these days. Tony Nwachukwu How does it work, seven people doing an encore? Do you all go off and come back on, or do you hide behind the instruments? Mu Yeah, we all just get off and we don’t look to do an encore, but if it’s there, then we’ll do it. Audience Member I wanted to ask if there was anything else in the pipeline aside from Fat Freddy’s Drop? You know, remixes or any... Mu Yeah, there’s a bunch of remixes coming out soon that other people have done for us. I don’t know if it’ll get to the point where I can get back into the studio doing some non Fat Freddy’s Drop stuff other than being remixes of other people. Other than just taking a break, we’re trying to fit it all in really, it’s just time really. Outside of family, Fat Freddy’s Drop, there’s not that much time really. Definitely trying to. Tony Nwachukwu Have you got a routine to the way you’re trying to combine family life with studio life and Fat Freddy’s Drop? Mu I’ve designed my life, because I’ve got the studio downstairs and I’ve got a fairly good work ethic and work long hours. Because I work from home, my daughter’s six and she probably gets to see her dad more often than most kids. I do a 10-hour day, or eight-hour day everyday that might take 15 hours to do. I’ll go downstairs, do some work, come back upstairs, hang out with my kid for a bit. Go back downstairs, do another couple of hours. The important times I need to be with my daughter, I am. When she goes to bed at 6:30 or 7 and I get out of the studio at midnight. By the end of the day, I’ve done an eight hour day. Tony Nwachukwu Has she ever got to go down to the basement? Mu Yeah, she’s got some, her and all the neighborhood kids have made into Pro Tools, many, many a time. Tony Nwachukwu Have you found any other up-and-coming Kiwis? Mu Yeah, there’s a bunch of good stuff coming to really look out for. A lot of really good singers to look out for. Some of the people that were involved on our album just as guest musos... A good rapper by the name of Lady Six, I think we might be involved next year in giving her a hand to put out an album. Tony Nwachukwu Is that going to coming out on The Drop maybe? Mu Yeah, maybe. The Drop has never really had the intention of being a label, it’s been a small business set up to run the matters for Fat Freddy’s Drop. But there’s kind of a need for a label to happen down under just to help people to put out some stuff. ‘Cause there’s a lot of single artists or bands that don’t have good vocalists and they need a bit of help. Tony Nwachukwu And obviously, they’re going to look up to you ‘cause you definitely changed things in New Zealand in lots of ways. Mu It’s good to have been part of a changing era. It feels like in New Zealand a lot of change is happening in the music industry at the moment and it feels good to be involved in that. Coming back to that, I wanted to play a remix. This is a friend, talking about up-and-coming people, this is a producer in New Zealand who I rate [as] probably one of the best in the country. I play a quick snippet of the track that he has remixed so you can see where it’s going. (music: Fat Freddy’s Drop – “Wandering Eye”) (music: Fat Freddy’s Drop – “Wandering Eye” (Submariner Remix)) Mu This guy made a great album with a Samoan rapper in New Zealand by the name of Kas, his performance name is the Feelstyle. I don’t know whether their album was available outside of New Zealand, but the album did really well in New Zealand. He raps both in English and in Samoan. Tony Nwachukwu What’s the name of the artist? Mu This guy [points to record playing], is named Submariner and the rapper is called Kas, the Feelstyle. Tony Nwachukwu Nice man, thanks for sharing that. Is that going to be out soon? Mu Our next single that’ll be coming out in the UK will be the album version and that remix. Tony Nwachukwu Is that going to be available in New Zealand as well? Mu Yeah, that’ll be available hopefully everywhere. In New Zealand we’ll have to import it. Tony Nwachukwu Why is that? Mu Just because singles are obviously a good way of pushing sales for an album and we don’t need much help in New Zealand. The single idea is an English initiative, they’ll bring out a 12" with the album version along a remix. Tony Nwachukwu OK, so that’ll be some eBay fodder for the Fat Freddy's fans at home. I was going to ask you, what is the story behind the album getting mastered in San Fran[cisco]? Mu In New Zealand everything is very DIY. There’s a lot of people like us, just bedroom producers who do stuff at home in the basement. That’s fine but there’s no one with the experience and all the gear to master records. On our side of the world, generally I reckon, certainly there’s no one in New Zealand. People would argue that there’s someone in Australia, I would tend to disagree [laughs]. I wouldn’t trust my record with anyone in Australia [laughter]. So I went on a plane and went to San Francisco. This friend of mine was living in San Fran quite a long time ago and he was working in a record shop and also working for a label and he put together a compilation and he suggested using this guy George Horn. He is quite a famous old-school kind of engineer, he goes right back with Fantasy Studios with a very long history and he engineered jazz, soul, funk and been around since the ‘70s. He used to master – not so much anymore – but he used to master a lot of the Ubiquity stuff. I just kind of thought he is an appropriate masterer to use just because he is dealing with both DJ records and live instrument records and we are a little bit like that. So stylistically we just thought, let’s give it a go... he did “Midnight Marauders” way back in the day and did a great job. So we thought, we’ll go back to this guy, because he’s going to be better than anyone in New Zealand. Tony Nwachukwu And how has that whole experience been for you being in the mastering room with someone who is mastering your guys’ baby? Mu It was good. He’s an old guy, he’s really old... well, not really old, but he kind of walks with a limp and he looks like as if he’s about 70, 80. This old guy’s sitting behind his console [mimes knob twiddling] and puts a DAT on and just cranks it right up, sitting there with a volume that was probably too loud for me. And he’s just this little guy hiding behind his console going, “Does that sound good?” “Yeah, sounds great.” Tony Nwachukwu Do you think it made a big difference to the record? Mu Yeah, for sure. He just had the experience of knowing what frequencies to tickle and what to compress. Basically, he just gave it a good squash and turned it up. He was good, he didn’t want to change too much, he just wanted to get a hold of the bottom end and make sure it wasn’t too loose and pretty much leave it as it was. That was a good experience. I mean, I didn’t want to get too involved and ask too many questions. Had it been a situation where I wasn’t liking what he was hearing different I would’ve jumped in the air and said something, but it sounded great so I left it to him. But I needed to get to someone outside of New Zealand, someone that had analog gear. It was an album that was essentially digitally recorded and I just felt it needed to have it pass something at some point on the way out that was analog. Tony Nwachukwu Most definitely. And did you master back to DAT again? Mu Yeah, he set two DAT players through an old Scully console, not too much outboard, most of it was just the EQ on the console and the only modern thing that he had was a limiter, the hardware version of the L2. Tony Nwachukwu The Waves thing? Mu Yeah, the Waves L2 was the only kind of modern part of the chain. Tony Nwachukwu So you were a very happy man on the way back from San Fran, I guess. Mu Yeah, it was cool. I was listening to it on my iPod on the way back flicking through the newly mastered record and other stuff on my iPod and it all sounded good. Tony Nwachukwu Is that something you will always definitely do in the future, always master your record outside of New Zealand? Mu Yeah. It’s more than just the gear, it’s the experience. I don’t feel that I necessarily have to go back to George, but I think you got to go somewhere where the person who is mastering the record, he or she is of reasonable age and has been doing this for a while and has the ears and has the gear. Both of those things don’t exist in New Zealand. I mean, I have really been enjoying the mastering the Sonar Kollektiv people get all their stuff mastered at, a place called Calyx. Tony Nwachukwu It’s in Berlin, isn’t it? Mu Yeah, by a guy called Bo Kondren. Personally, I would feel happy to jump on a plane again to Germany as opposed to America, but it’s just got to go somewhere where someone has got the ears to do it, really. But I’ve been enjoying their mastering a lot lately. Tony Nwachukwu Do you think this is something that you ought to add to your list of experiences and things you want to get into, the whole mastering thing? Mu Eventually, I wouldn’t mind. I kind of do a lot of mastering for people in New Zealand just inside Pro Tools at home, just for people that don’t have [the possibility]. I think I don’t have the gear and the experience but I have an ear for mastering and the feeling for mastering and I end up doing it a fair bit for compilations at home ‘cause a lot of people don’t have the resources, or mainly the money, to get it done properly. People come to me and ask me, “Can you master the single for me so I can get on radio?”, I say to them that I can probably give a hand but usually suggest to them that they should go to a proper mastering house and get it done. But it’s usually pretty obvious very quickly that they don’t have the money to do it and I just squash it and turn it up for them, so it’s got a good level. Eventually, to do it properly with outboard gear would be definitely something I would like to do later for sure. Tony Nwachukwu It’s about building up the analog roster, I guess. Is there any kind of equipment that you are after at the moment? Mu I really want to buy an analog console. Trident have just put out this new desk called the Dream Series. I definitely want to get more analog on it, move a wee bit out of the box. Actually, I just sat here on the Friday night and listened to – who was it? Mathew Jonson – who does music just in his computer and I was listening to his music and it was huge, it was fat, and just because he didn’t mix it within the computer. I wouldn’t mind going down that road. Maybe using Pro Tools is the way to record things, but definitely get it out of the box and get it onto a desk. You know, mix and go straight to DAT and get it out the computer. And the way Mathew mixes down, it was quite interesting, the whole chain. I have got a Rosetta 800 [by] Apogee and AD-DA conversion on the front end of Pro Tools so I can get in and out quite easily and quite high-end. I’ll be restricted to eight outs but it’ll work. I just have four stereo pairs and the main elements coming back through the desk. Tony Nwachukwu Just to get that warm kind of finish. [to participants] Has anyone got any other questions? There’s a quote I read, and I really like this, it says, “Take your time and be confident with your decisions. Confidence is based on research and thought. Don’t want to make too many mistakes.” Mu Where’s that from [laughs]? I mean, that’s how we are trying to live our lives. In this business making music it’s just so hectic and so busy, you haven’t got time to make too many mistakes. I think it’s better to take your time and research it all and having all the options, be that being creative in the studio or be that from a business point of view, just take your time. It worked for us many times. Like I said earlier, we had lots of major labels sniffing around and trying to tie us to go down this particular road. And at first on the surface it looks like this is a great deal, we should do this, and we should go down this road. And every time we haven’t done that and stuck do our guns and gone our own way, and six months later down the road we look at that option had we done that, it would have all turned to shit. That’s probably what I was trying to say there. Just back yourself and your decisions and take the time to think about it. You got to back yourself. Tony Nwachukwu Mu, thank you very much indeed.

Paul de Barros
Seattle journalist Paul de Barros has interviewed every jazz legend you can think of and covers festivals around the world. He writes a weekly column for the Seattle Times and is a contributor to Downbeat magazine. His 1993 book Jackson Street After Hours: The Roots Of Jazz In Seattle is a tribute to the rich musical history of his adopted hometown and digs deep into its social and political context. In this talk at the 2005 Red Bull Music Academy in Seattle, he takes a journey through time and sound, from jazz to anarchism and the avant-garde, all the way up to grunge. Serious knowledge dropped by a true music-lover.
Hosted by Torsten Schmidt Before you start going into telling us what’s so great about the Northwest, what can you tell us about yourself that we should know? Paul de Barros You should probably know that one of the reasons I’m here is that I’m the local jazz writer. I did a book called Jackson Street After Hours. You’re going to see some pictures from it. It’s kind of the untold underground history of the early Seattle music scene… As I did that research it made me start thinking about what made Seattle what it is. It made me become rather contemplative about it. I write for the Seattle Times every week on Fridays, I write about jazz, also some world music. I used to write more about pop music. I don’t anymore, kind of got specialized about 14, 15 years ago. I did review Nirvana once, however; I think that was the last rock review I ever wrote. You can read into that what you like. I write for Downbeat magazine, which is the national jazz magazine out of Chicago. I cover a lot of festivals around the world for Downbeat, and that’s probably all you need to know about me. Torsten Schmidt What do we need to know about Seattle apart from Boeing, Microsoft, the Space Needle, the EMP probably not being Frank Gehry’s greatest building and... Paul de Barros [laughs] Well the first thing that you need to know about Seattle – and I have to give credit to the person that this came from because it wasn’t me. I was doing an article for Downbeat about ten years ago about how there were all these young jazz musicians who had gone to the Cornish College, which is up on Capitol Hill. By the way, you’ve been welcomed but welcome to Seattle. It’s a very odd place and I hope you have a wonderful time here. I moved here in 1979 myself – I’m not a native. I’m from California – became rather attached to it. Not to the weather, I must say, but to the place. I know you’ve all come from a lot of different places so welcome to the madness of the Northwest. John Schott is a guitar player who now lives in Berkeley who was going to Cornish and I called John and I said, “What is it about your class in Cornish, the late ’80s, early ’90s, [drummer] Mike Sarin, [guitarist] Brad Shepik, John Schott, [drummer] Aaron Alexander, [saxophonist] Briggan Krauss. There were about ten or 12, mostly men, who went to Cornish who moved to New York and within a matter of a year had suddenly become really successful jazz musicians on what they called, The downtown scene, in New York; the Knitting Factory scene in the late 8’80s and early ‘90s, an avant-garde kind of eclectic, post-modern jazz scene. I asked John why he thought so many musicians from Seattle had become a part of this particular scene and what had driven their creativity. He said, “The circle-A, Paul.” If you lived here in the ’80s you would’ve known what I meant. If you walked around this neighborhood in particular back in the ’80s, there was an anarchist “A” with a circle around it on practically every building; graffiti. The anarchist spirit is very, very strong in Seattle. It goes all the way back, I think, to the nineteenth century. This is a city of free-booters, of outsiders, of contrary people. This is a city full of people that if you say, “It’s raining,” they’ll say it’s not. If you say, “The sun is… the sky is blue,” they’ll say, “No it isn’t it’s gray.” It’s a very contrary exceptionalist place and I think John is very right about that, that the grunge rock that happened here went hand-in-hand with a bunch of experimental jazz musicians as well; Tim Young, a guitar player who’s still here. When Bill Frisell and Wayne Horvitz moved here from New York right around the same time, they sponsored a lot of these young musicians. I think the circle-A anarchist thing is real strong here. You can go all the way back to 1919. Seattle is the only city in the United States that ever had a general strike. The IWW, I mean in fact it was called the Thirteenth Soviet of the United States at one time. The Northwest was the strongest place where the IWW took hold, the Wobblies, the International Workers Of The World. That was a left-wing sort of proto-communist workers movement that was very popular in the United States amongst lumbering people, primary industries: lumber, mining, shipbuilding, that sort of thing. You’ve got this strong tradition of outsiders and anarchists who go against the grain. Torsten Schmidt I mean strong traditions, you’re talking 1919 and unions, work unions were almost an established thing in Europe at that stage. This city hasn’t been around for that long. Paul de Barros No. Torsten Schmidt What’s the age of the city to start with? Paul de Barros 1851. Torsten Schmidt Were there settlements before that? It’s obviously always a pretty Euro-centric way of looking at, “Oh yeah, it’s 1851.’ People have been living here for how long? Paul de Barros Oh, well, depending on which anthropologist you talk to. There’s a lot of great Native American music, the Makah people, Muckleshoot people, anywhere from 25 to 35,000 years. The first Europeans got here in 1851 and they kind of expressed the other side of the city’s character, which is also very kind of prim, business-like, orderly, sort of what I call the ‘roll-top desk mentality.” The city, from the very beginning, had a kind of schizophrenic dual personality. On the one hand, Arthur Denny, who founded the city, one of the first things he did was found a university. He wanted this to be the business district, this to be the university. It was all planned in his mind and yet the flipside of that was this kind of anarchist, rowdy, very male, honky-tonk neighborhood that sprouted up in what’s now known as Pioneer Square; what was originally known as Skid Road. One of the first band leaders in this area in the 1920s, his name was Vic Meyers. During Prohibition, when it was illegal in the United States to drink, his band would play down at the Butler Hotel, which is in Pioneer Square – it’s gone now – and they would… you could drink there. You could buy booze from the bellboys. He later ran for Lieutenant Governor on a Gandhi ticket. He had a picture of himself taken in a diaper leading a goat. He was elected and he served four terms. A jazz bass player named Red Kelly ran for Governor and got 40,000 votes. This is a place where people have a rather ironic take on politics and kind of an outsider take. To mess with the established order has always been part of the scene here. Torsten Schmidt You somehow still got that schizophrenia that you get harassed till God knows what to show your ID to buy a bit of booze, but you can get all the smack in the world and ... Paul de Barros Right. There’s always been kind of a puritanical city fathers and then beneath it this kind of repressed action. In the 1890s Seattle really took off because there was a gold rush in the Yukon. Seattle was the jumping-off point for the gold rush and this is where people got outfitted; they bought all their stuff for the gold rush. So, this honky-tonk neighborhood sprung up around Pioneer Square. A city can do one of two things when it has vice. It can either try to outlaw it or it can try to make money from it. This city decided to make money from it, so from the 1890s until 1969 the city was completely crooked. The mayor, the police chief, everybody was on the take getting money under the table. This was a very good thing for music because music thrived in the city because the cops were paid off so that there could be booze, drugs, gambling, alcohol, prostitution. From the 1890s to 1969 it was a pretty rocking city. In fact, in the 1920s Joe Darensbourg, who was a clarinet player who came up here from New Orleans, settled here because he said, “There’s no city in the United States, other than New Orleans, that has so many night clubs after hours and so much illegal goings on, so it’s great for a musician.” Let me just play you a little cut from John Schott’s record. John made an album called Shuffle Play and I thought it was particularly appropriate for what you all do here. He took some of the earliest recordings ever made like Thomas Edison, one of the earliest African-American songs ever recorded in 1897, which is called “Poor Mourner.” Let’s say this is a remix of one of the first recordings ever made. There’s a line in it, “Ye shall be free when the good Lord sets you free.” This is John Schott. His album, Shuffle Play, encourages you to play the album in any order you want to play it, that’s why he called it, Shuffle Play. He did remixes and electronic manipulations with live instruments as well as with electronics of all these original recordings because he was fascinated by the early recording. It doesn’t sound like much in the beginning and then you’ll start to hear this African-American voice. (music: John Schott – “Poor Mourner Repainted”) New Orleans was really the birth place of jazz. It’s a complicated story, but it has to do with the way the laws were changed in the city that brought certain kinds of black people together. Creoles, who had musical training, and black people, who represented more of the country music and the rural music, came together and made what we know as jazz, and before that, ragtime piano and blues. There was a great diaspora from New Orleans that started after 1917, of people moving to Chicago, going to Los Angeles, and also coming to Seattle. We started getting some of these musicians, like [Jelly Roll] Morton and Oscar Holden, who was another piano player who’s on the cover of my book, his picture is up there at 12th and Jackson too now, who started spreading this music really, really rapidly. Without going into real details, New Orleans was really the cradle of jazz, and jazz was really the cradle of all popular music in America. Anything you want to hear, from hip-hop going back, you can find in Armstrong or Ellington or Morton. It’s all there. The singing styles, the improvisation, the rhythms, it all comes out of that early jazz. Torsten Schmidt That early jazz being, probably, I guess you’ve got some recording samples that will illustrate a little bit how that term progressed as well over the years. Paul de Barros Exactly, and in fact, if we go to the next slide ... [looks to screen] That’s Oscar Holden. He was the piano player who actually hired Jelly Roll Morton to play in his band. Even though Oscar was normally a piano player, he played clarinet as well. He met Morton in Chicago in 1912. Then he lived up in Victoria in Canada, and in Vancouver, and lead a band at the Patricia Hotel in which Morton played. It’s very likely then when Morton played here at the Entertainers, he was playing for Oscar, but Oscar died long before I could have gotten to him to interview him, so I don’t really know and nobody really does. Let’s move on to the next one [looks up a screen]. This is the corner where the sign just went up. This is the corner of 12th and Jackson, and this was the Black and Tan Nightclub where everybody from 1922 to the mid-’60s that was anybody in jazz, and later in rhythm and blues, played it to play here. It was in the basement of this building. It went up because this neighborhood started to host all of the black people that worked on the railroad. For a while it was actually called the Porters and Waiters Club, and the porters and waiters had a union and they would stay overnight in the neighborhood. Since they had to wait for a train going back out, they’d be in town two or three nights, so they needed something to do. So, all these bars, restaurants, gambling joints, and jazz clubs started to spring up. The building is actually still there, and the sign we put in kitty-corner from the Black and Tan, that marquee, you can’t really read it, but it actually says “Black and Tan” on the marquee sticking out from the corner of the building at 12th and Jackson. It was owned by a guy named Noodles Smith, who hired all the early players. He was a gangster. He owned all the clubs, and basically if you wanted to start a club yourself you had to pay him off. Let’s go to the next picture [picture on screen]. This is Joe Darensbourg on the right. He’s the clarinet player that I mentioned who came out here from New Orleans. The band leader is Freda Payne, she’s the one behind the banjo. She would play in bands that ran up and down from San Francisco and LA up to Seattle, on ships, on the president lines. The reason people did this is that you could gamble legally if you were six miles out. They had bands, booze, and gambling, so this was another big source of work. Let’s move along. Torsten Schmidt When you speak of work, obviously the income was coming from different sources, as later on in the ’60s, or even nowadays. Recorded music was still in its baby shoes. How did these people survive as musicians? Paul de Barros It was all live gigs. There was no recording industry here whatsoever. Torsten Schmidt I mean, if you have a guy called Noodles Smith running the joint, why would you have a union in the first place? He doesn’t sound like a character who would be very much for a union. Paul de Barros The union got you jobs. You’d go to the union hall at 14th and Jefferson and you’d say, “Where can I get work?” There’d be contractors there, and they would send you out to the clubs to work. It was organized, even though it was run by gangsters. Gangsters are very organized people. Shooting somebody is a form of organization. [laughs] Torsten Schmidt It’s a pretty binary thing, yeah. Paul de Barros It’s a form of sorting things out. Most of the early jazz musicians played for gangsters. If you read any of Louis Armstrong’s stuff, he talks about that in Chicago. Seattle really wasn’t much different, but there was no mafia here. It was all just kind of small-time operators. Torsten Schmidt How did the different travelling circuits of musicians interact with each other? You said there’s people that come down from California or up here on these boats, and at this stage would you have national artists that would come around on big tours? Paul de Barros Yeah, that’s sort of where I’m going. [Gestures to screen] For example, this picture here, I think the piano player’s cut off, but on the right, the piano player’s Palmer Johnson. Palmer came up from Los Angeles and he learned from Oscar Holden. He became sort of the piano professor in town. Other people would come in on famous bands and they might leave the band and stay here for a while, or people would start working here and get picked up by a band and go out and wind up getting hired by a famous band leader. There was a continuous kind of dialogue between touring bands that were led by people who were successful in the recording industry and had national reputations and local musicians here, but you couldn’t get famous here. You couldn’t become a famous band leader here. In fact, there was so few jazz band leaders here in the ’30s and ’40s, there wasn’t even a full-sized swing band. It was all combos like this, three, four, five, six people. Let’s go to the next slide because I think it’s the one that speaks directly. [Screen shows another slide] This is a perfect example of what I’m talking about. The cool dude in the middle of this picture, with the shades on, is Dick Wilson. Dick was really on of the premier saxophone players. I’m going to play you a little bit of his music. He’s in a touring band here. This is Andy Kirk’s band, from Kansas City. Kansas City, of course, is where Count Basie and Bennie Moten & The Blue Devils and the kind of swing band sound really originated. Andy Kirk lead one of the best black swing bands in the country. Dick Wilson grew up in LA, but he moved here when he was going to high school. He went to Broadway high school during his last couple of years, up on Capitol Hill. He started playing with that clarinet player I showed you, Joe Darensbourg, way up on Highway 99 in a place called The Jungle Temple. A lot of the places here these kind of names like The Ubangi, The Congo Room, they all had African names because the Harlem renaissance had really popularized the sense that jazz was an African music, or an African based music. They’re playing up at The Jungle Temple, and who should come through town but Zack Whyte, who’s a territory band leader from Texas. By territory band, I mean that he only played in a certain small territory, but he wound up getting all the way to the Northwest from Texas. Dick gets hired by Zack Whyte, travels all over the country, winds up in Kansas City, and the band goes broke. Dick gets hired by Andy Kirk and winds up coming back to Seattle in 1941, when this picture was taken at the Eagles Auditorium, which is now where ACT Theater is downtown on 7th Avenue. When Dick came to town, local people knew who he was, so he had the pleasure of having an advertisement in the newspaper that said, “Hometown boy, Dick Wilson, comes home and plays with Andy Kirk,” and so all of his friends went out to see him at the Eagles Auditorium. See if I can get to this tune. This is Dick playing a saxophone solo with Andy Kirk on a tune called, “Lotta Sax Appeal.” Unfortunately, all these tracks are mixed up. Here we go. This is from 1940. That’s him. (music: Andy Kirk & His Orchestra – “Lotta Sax Appeal”) Torsten Schmidt If this is 1940 and 1941, obviously the world has been slightly restructured at that time. Did the demographic change in any sort of way because all the men were away either in Asia or in Europe? Paul de Barros Well, nobody had shipped out of here yet. It’s still 1940, ’41, and we didn’t even get into the war until the end of ’41, but eventually that did have an effect. The effect that it had on Seattle, surprisingly enough, was not to decimate bands, but in fact to really boost the economy. This place was just rockin’ in the ’40s. One of the things Quincy Jones described, going to Garfield High School, which is the same high school where Jimi Hendrix went, Ernestine went there too, Ernestine Anderson, and saying, here we were in high school and we were trying to play jazz. We knew something was going on in New York, and we would hear rumors. He’d say “We heard Rubber Legs Wilson put benzedrine in somebody’s coffee, and that was the big rumor. We heard Ray Brown is coming to town, and he’s got this new band, and Dizzy Gillespie’s in it. What does he sound like? Because he haven’t heard him yet.” They would go out, and that was how they heard him. Records also carried the message, but bebop was really the new message in the ’40s, and that’s how it got here. Torsten Schmidt Obviously, a lot of us come from countries where choir singing and church choir singing is slightly different than what you guys might have out here. Are there any recommendations on good choirs to check out while we’re here? Paul de Barros Church choirs? Oh well, you go to Mount Zion. That’s the main, big, black church. Actually, I can recommend a few churches along Pine, too. You got to mind your manners. Got to go to church. [laughs] Torsten Schmidt If you left your information with us, I guess there might be some people who would like to check it out, because it’s not a household thing around where… Paul de Barros Absolutely. You’ll hear some great choirs here. The Total Experience Gospel Choir is more of a professional choir that sings secular gigs, but there’s some real good church choirs here. Ernestine, not growing up here of course, didn’t come out of that tradition, but she had a real strong career in the ’50s, early ’60s, then she dropped out for a while, came back in the ’80s and she’s been singing ever since. She’s matured now, she’s 75 years old, she’s not singing like she did in the ’50s. If you want to picture this in the ’40s when these guys were in high school, when you walked along Jackson Street from 1st Avenue to 14th Avenue, along Jackson Street, through Chinatown and on the side streets, you could drop into as many as 25 or 35 different night clubs and many of them went all night. One of them on Maynard had a dinner show, a nine o’clock show, a midnight show, a 3am show, and a breakfast show, and they started all over again at noon the next day. There was a continuously running dice game in the back, that ran for three years without stopping. Day and night. I interviewed the bartender who was in charge of it. There was really a lot going on in this town in those days. Ernestine grew up knowing that this scene was right in her backyard from Garfield High School, and she wound up singing at the 411 Club at the breakfast show when she was 16, 17 years old, down on Maynard. Quincy Jones knew that this was happening in town. He would go to the Washington Social Club, which was on Madison and 20th, and there he met this blind singer from Florida named Ray Robinson, who you know as Ray Charles, who taught him how to make arrangements and every night they would get together and talk about music. Everybody would go to the Washington Social Club late at night after their gigs because the bands that were traveling through town would go there to hang out and jam after their regular gig. If Dizzy’s band came to town, all the musicians would go down to the Washington Social Club at one o’clock and they’d all play. That’s how the kids, “kids,” learned how to play music back then. They were 15, 16, their moms didn’t know where they were. They lied, but they got into these places somehow and they got home late. Torsten Schmidt What would be the difference between the gig, let’s say Dizzy’s band is there, the regular gig and when he played for the [inaudible] later on? Paul de Barros Well with Dizzy there wouldn’t be that much difference because Dizzy was leading a bebop band, but the question is on target because usually the reason you’d go out to play in a jam session is that you got to open up and play more freely. The regular swing dance band gig would just be playing for a dance crowd. That’s been true in the jazz scene from day one. Jazz musicians have traded ideas at jam sessions after the regular gig from the beginning. Torsten Schmidt Was there a crowd big enough and wealthy enough to support a national band coming here and buy tickets? Paul de Barros Huge. About six blocks from here was the Trianon Ballroom at 3rd Avenue and Wall, and that’s where Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey, Harry James, Benny Goodman, all the great swing bands all played there. They had crowds of two to three thousand people. There were theaters downtown like the Pantages Theater and the Metropolitan Theater where Duke Ellington played. Oh yeah, this town was supporting from about 1934 on, and even in the 1920s Mamie Smith played here. All the great early blues singers came through town in theater shows, because there was a very strong theater tradition here, even though it was a young town. It was a big audience and a real hunger I think because it was such a pioneer outpost, people had a hunger for something cultural and something interesting. Torsten Schmidt You were talking about a young Quincy Jones meeting Ray Robinson. Can you fill us in a little bit about the nature of the talks they had at night and what they all learned from the other? Paul de Barros They’re a little bit vague both of them, I’d have to say. Let me play you a little bit of Quincy. Quincy went to Garfield High School and started a swing band. Let’s see if we can go to the next... [points to slide on projector screen] This is the Trianon Ballroom that was about six blocks from here where all the big bands played. The guy holding the trumpet in the middle of the band is Quincy Jones, and this night when the picture was taken was his 16th birthday. He was celebrating his birthday, playing in the band. The leader of the band was Bumps Blackwell who’s playing the vibraphone. To Quincy’s right, playing alto saxophone is Buddy Catlett, who would later play with Louis Armstrong and Count Basie. Quincy was going to high school, and he had no other dream than to lead a big band, but by the time he grew up, the big band scene was over. It was practically over when he was in high school. He wanted to play with Lionel Hampton so bad, that he went back stage at the Pantages Theater and he showed Lionel the arrangements that he had written in high school. Lionel, who would say yes to anybody because his wife really ran the band, said, “Yeah, Gates, get on the bus, man. You’re hired!” Quincy got on the bus, he didn’t even go home because he was afraid his mother would tell him he couldn’t leave, he was still in high school. So, he got on the bus, then Gladys came on and saw him on the bus in the morning. She said, “What are you doing here? Get off this bus and go back to school!” Quincy had already told all of his friends that he had been hired by Lionel Hampton. He was so embarrassed, he told me didn’t want to go back to school the next day [laughs]. That was everybody’s dream, to get onto a big band. Eventually he got hired by Lionel Hampton, he started arranging for the band. Torsten Schmidt How long, how much later was that? Paul de Barros Actually only about a year and a half later, in ’51 he got hired. Torsten Schmidt When you’re in high school, a year and a half can make a big difference. Paul de Barros He graduated from high school, he went to Seattle University for a year and then he went to Boston to what was then called the Schillinger School, which is now the Berklee College of Music, and five months after he got there, Lionel came through and hired him. One of the reasons Lionel hired him is that he had already hired another singer from Seattle named Janet Thurlow. She reminded Hampton that he had promised Quincy to hire him. Janet got him onto the band. By that time there were four people from Seattle on the band, so Lionel Hampton ended up hiring a lot of people from Seattle. Quincy got an offer in 1959 after going to work for Mercury Records, producing albums by Dinah Washington, Ernestine Anderson, all kinds of people. He got offered this amazing deal to put together this big band of his dreams and go to Europe and open a show with Sammy Davis Jr in the title role. It was called “Free and Easy,” it was based on a Harold Arlen show that had been written in 1939 but rewritten by Arlen, the great songwriter who wrote “Over the Rainbow” among other things. He got Clark Terry, Phil Woods, Sahib Shihab, and he hired four of his friends from Seattle. He hired Patty Bone the piano player, he hired Buddy Catlett to play bass, he hired Floyd Standifer to play trumpet, and they took off for Paris and they opened the show. About three days later it closed because the Algerian Crisis happened in France. I like to bring this back to Seattle’s love affairs with the blues because starting with those crazy white kids and the Sonics and the Wailers and the Kingsmen, the blues really was a strong force here as soon as Ray Charles and this great mix of black people moved here from the South from the 1940s on. If you play music in Seattle, you somehow need to honor the blues in some way. It’s not like California. There’s a visionary streak here because we’re close to the Orient, we have a lot of trade with Asia, but there’s also a real groundedness here. I like to think that the thing that Jimi Hendrix got from Seattle, a lot of people will talk about the distortion and the electronics, but I really don’t think that that’s what he got from Seattle. What he got from Seattle was blues. He played on Jackson Street. This is at Washington Hall, this picture [gestures to screen], which is four blocks from the corner of 12th and Jackson. Jimi’s father, Al, was a competition dancer on the Jackson Street jazz scene. His grandparents were vaudevillians who got stranded here in 1911 after a vaudeville of theirs had been playing the Pantages Theater. Whenever I hear this cut by Jimi Hendrix, I like to think that in some way “Red House,” the blues that he recorded on his first English album, really hearkens back to what he learned in Seattle. Those are some of the themes. I hope I introduced you to some character of the place. It’s a place that loves the blues, it’s a place where people seem to really feel like, a little bit ornery and contrary, a little bit eccentric. It’s a place where black music is very, very important and it’s also a place where white people have been really fascinated by ethnic musics of all kinds. It’s a place where eccentricity and being naughty is very much opposed to the powers that be. We’ve had this long history of an oppressive middle-class culture or “roll-top desk mentality’” on the top and this kind of naughty let’s have fun and drink all night and be bad people going on against it, a kind of repression. I think you can hear that in some of the music. I’m happy to take any questions, but I hope that I haven’t distorted too disastrously your image of what our city is. Audience Member What was the name of Quincy Jones band that went to Paris? Paul de Barros They just called it the Quincy Jones Big Band. Yeah, in fact, let’s see if I have that... I think I... Torsten Schmidt That was the first out of how many times that he got stranded? Paul de Barros This is actually the vinyl that they made, it’s called Birth of a Band (holds up record). They were in Europe for nine months playing. They told me horror stories getting stranded overnight in Transylvania, playing country fairs so they could get their train ticket to the next town. Eventually… Clark Terry, the great trumpet player, was in the band… Eventually, this is actually a form of experience in Quincy’s career, because most of us know him as a really commercial producer, the guy who produced the Brothers Johnson and Michael Jackson. That was the turning point in his life, when he went on the road broke for nine months, he came back. He told me this, he said, “Paul, I vowed to never lose money again in the music business.” Torsten Schmidt Which he did how many times again? Paul de Barros Yeah, but he made a lot, too. He really vowed to learn how the business worked. He became well-versed in the commercial side of it. Any other questions? Audience Member Can I borrow your record collection please? Paul de Barros Can you borrow my record collection? Yeah! I’ll just put it on my iPod [laughs]. Audience Member What’s your favorite jazz record, maybe one that we can still find on the record shelves? Paul de Barros One of my favorite local ones, it’s interesting you ask that, I’ll play you just a bit of it. It was made here by the Al Hood Quartet in the 1980s (holds up record). Al’s dead now. He was a piano player, but this is a free jazz, freebop album. Real nice album. I’ll just play the opening of it. Jim Paul, doesn’t play anymore, but just has a nice feel. Just a kind of a free jazz quartet. (music: Al Hood Quartet – unknown track) Torsten Schmidt Can you give us some other names of labels to check out because obviously we stop somewhere at a time when most of us jazz gets interesting, especially as sampling source? Paul de Barros Yeah. Torsten Schmidt Any things to look for which are local and which would give you that Seattle feel? Paul de Barros You know, unfortunately there hasn’t been that much recording done here. This album was done on a little album called Auroar, that a friend of mine ran for a few years, his name is Gary Banister. These records are around if you see anything on Auroar, but there’s only three or four of them. Most of the albums that were made by people here wound up being made somewhere else. The early stuff is on Linden, which is a label that started in the ’50s here, but it covered everything like country music, pop music, a little bit of jazz. Now there’s a Jackson Street label that’s run by Paul Rutger, who’s a cellist and a bass player. There’s Origin Records, but we’re not talking vinyl here, we’re talking CDs. There’s really not that much out there in the crates, I’m afraid, for local jazz. Audience Member Scott Joplin had to do something with Seattle? Paul de Barros No, Scott Joplin never came here. Scott Joplin was the ragtime piano player and composer from St Louis. He went the other way, he went to New York. As far as I know he never even toured here. WC Handy came here in 1898, the guy that wrote Memphis Blues, the first published blues song. He came here with the Minstrel Show at the Pantages Theater in 1898. We got a lot of the big shows like that, but as far as I know, Joplin never came here. There is a great ragtime composer named Joe Jordan who composed some of the best rags, and he was from Tacoma, which is very nearby here. Yeah? Audience Member You mentioned free jazz several times in your speech. What impact did free jazz have on the jazz scene here in Seattle? Paul de Barros Free jazz? Torsten Schmidt Free jazz, yeah. Second question, do you know any Ornette Coleman or Don Cherry stories? Paul de Barros Well I know lots of stories, but they don’t have anything to do with Seattle. Free jazz has had an interesting history here. I would say the first free jazz started happening at a really interesting nightclub here in the 1960s called the Llangollen. It was a room run by a guy named Jim Heldman, who was just a crazy man. He played piano and he played the bass, and he would have musicians come and jam with him that were playing at local ... Jerry Heldman, I’m sorry, not Jim. McCoy Tyner player there. You may know, see if I brought this, not sure if I did. No, I didn’t. If you know the South African composer Abdullah Ibrahim, who plays piano, also called Dollar Brand, he hired saxophone player from here who played on that old Llangollen scene. Michael Bisio comes indirectly out of that scene. Free jazz has always been strong here. There’s still a real strong free improvising scene here at the Gallery 1412 which is on 1412 18th Avenue on Capitol Hill. It’s always been underground. Al Hood had a class at Seattle Central Community College that he would run at his house. It was of free jazz improvisers. It’s been an underground that’s always been strong. Torsten Schmidt What are the hidden gems, the missing chapters that are probably not part of the Barnes and Noble world that we should know about? Paul de Barros In terms of the music? Torsten Schmidt Yeah, I mean obviously the music industry was a totally different game back then and there are probably lessons to learn from that age. Paul de Barros I don’t know if there’s any hidden gems as far as the music goes, I mean the box sets have pretty much brought out everything that’s… from his first solo with Lionel Hampton. I think the most interesting thing about Quincy is that he was really ambitious. He’s a real textbook example of somebody who really, really wanted to make it. It’s funny, because as you say, he lost a lot of money as well as making a lot of money. He really wanted to make it in the mainstream of the music business. He didn’t want to be on the side. I think that’s one of the reasons he left jazz after the ’50s and mid-’60s. He wanted to be where the action was, where the money is. He’s an extremely good-looking man. I’ve been around him with women. It’s quite a remarkable experience. He’s an extremely attractive, charismatic person. People just kind of melt around him. I once saw him do something here in Seattle that was incredible. There’s a local band here that plays repertory jazz, and they’re just sort of okay. They invited Quincy to come conduct them, and it was like they were a different band. I’ve never saw him work in the studio, but you could see that this man just by his body language and what he expected from people, could get three times more out of any musician, and I think that’s really part of the role of a producer obviously. He really could get stuff out of this band. It was like you suddenly understood why he had made so many great records… because he has very high expectations but a lot of real support and he communicates stuff with his body. Also, I guess another little secret about Quincy is that he’ll say anything. He said stuff to me on tape that no living human being should say about other people. You just think, “Is he really telling me this?” You can’t publish it. He’s completely open. He has to have people to manage him and take care of him so he can be dragged away from interviews because he just likes to talk and share stuff really openly. Just the opposite of Ray Charles who was a very closed human being, the opposite of his stage image. Ray also was extremely ambitious, really wanted to make it in the business, but... let’s just put it this way, he had a lot of demons and he was very closed about his business world. Musicians did not like to work for him. Torsten Schmidt What’s the story with the city and the demons? Is it because of the harbor? So many great musicians’ minds have been wasted here on smack basically, is it because you’ve got the harbor nearby? Why is it that there’s such a strong influx? Paul de Barros I think so. This crazy trumpet player from Tacoma named Neil Friel, he went to Stadium High School in Tacoma. He told me as a high school kid, they could get heroin in Tacoma. This is in the ’40s, white kids in Tacoma. That really shocked me. I’d never heard of anything like that. I think it’s probably just because it was a poor town, probably a little under-policed. Drugs were around, definitely. Again, when I ended with Hendrix, I really should say that Seattle’s undercover image was blown when the grunge era happened, and when Microsoft and Starbucks hit the world, the roof blew off of Seattle and there’s still lots of people in Seattle that aren’t happy about that. They preferred it when no one had ever heard of the place. You’ll hear jokes while you’re here, “If the sun comes out don’t tell anybody.” Because we want everybody in the world to think it rains everyday. There’s a xenophobia here about other people that’s very real. I’m from California and the first year I lived here I was shocked about the horrible things people would say about California all the time. Just really mean shit on purpose to get you to move [laughs]. There’s a real undercurrent of “Would you just get out of here and leave us alone?” That’s still here even though the town is really, like I say, the cover is really blown off. That gray sky is gone, at least psychologically, and people know about the city. Lots of musicians moved here. The big change that happened after grunge is that a lot of the musicians who had money and could start recording studios and could support night clubs stayed here. That was the difference. Now there’s actual money here and creativity and people that stayed instead of moving to LA or New York. That’s what’s changed in my lifetime here. Torsten Schmidt It’s about sustainability and not just about throwing something at the wall and see what sticks? Paul de Barros Absolutely. It’s about Stone Gossard [of Pearl Jam] opening up a studio and having jazz musicians record there. It’s about having lawyers, bless their hearts, that know how to write contracts, so you don’t have to go to LA to have a manager. It’s about having a recording studio with somebody who knows how to produce a jazz record with a real bass sound on it. It’s about all those things. It’s about studios, it’s about clubs, it’s about sustainability. That’s what we have here now. There’s a music industry here. Until three years ago, there wasn’t even a really functional chapter of NARAS, the recording academy. I was on the first board, and it was during my tenure with a lot of the people who live here, like Michael Shreeve who played with Santana, Dave Dieter, people from the grunge bands. Once we kinda got that going, it was really clear there was a music industry here, for better or for worse. Now Seattle is really part of the music industry. All this history I’m giving you before, it was not. It was kinda the underground, special, eccentric, on the edge place that nobody cared about, nobody knew about. It was like a little secret place. So, you can understand that old-timers wouldn’t be happy about it changing. Torsten Schmidt Yeah, I guess we’re pretty curious in finding more of these secrets and revealing them. Paul de Barros We’ll never tell! [laughs] Torsten Schmidt Secretly share them and we won’t tell them that’s only ranking, the rainy cities, it’s only ranking 41st or something of the rainy cities of the... Paul de Barros I don’t know. Torsten Schmidt Thanks for sharing some of these things with us. Paul de Barros Oh yeah, my pleasure. Torsten Schmidt Give the man a hand. Paul de Barros Thanks for coming. Thanks.

Peter Hook
First with Joy Division and then with New Order, veteran bassist Peter Hook has played a key part in putting Manchester on the musical map. What’s more, The Haçienda – a club he and his bandmates financed – helped to kick-start the acid house scene in Europe. In this lecture at the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy in Melbourne, he talks about all these ventures, synth meltdowns, dodgy deals and how he fell into life as a globetrotting DJ.
Hosted by TOBY LAING We’re lucky enough to have Peter here. He’s touring different parts of the world at the moment, DJing. He’s just been over in New Zealand and Brazil and Uruguay. He’s here in Melbourne as well for our show too. Of course, he needs not really much of an introduction. He and his equally famous colleagues are phenomena of global music coming out of Manchester in the mid-’70s. Joy Division trends morphing into New Order somewhere along the line and involved in many other projects as well as producer and musician. The bass stylist, all of those things. It’s really good to have you here, Peter. Thanks for coming… PETER HOOK Thank you. TOBY LAING Being in a position like this, addressing a group of people about your music. It’s probably not the kind of thing that you were imagining all those years ago when you were just getting into music. PETER HOOK It all began in 1977. If you’d have gone along to somebody and said you wanted to learn music, then they would have thought you were an idiot. I think it’s quite interesting these days, and I’m not too sure as a self-taught musician whether I could say it was good or bad. I don’t think I’m expert enough to say that because I came up the other way. I came the back stairs route of learning to play music and being in a group. So, it seems quite odd to me that people teach people how to be in groups. It’s quite strange so maybe some of you could enlighten me to whether it works or not. TOBY LAING It seems like you just picked up an instrument at a certain point and you were inspired by a certain performance or by what came to be known later as punk. PETER HOOK Yeah, I’d never been interested in music apart from listening to records and stuff like that. I’d never played a musical instrument apart from the recorder at school. I went to see the Sex Pistols at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester in June of 1976. I went out and bought a bass guitar the next day. Don’t ask me why I did that because I don’t know. because I’d never even considered. I think the thing was that when I saw the Sex Pistols, which was sort of at the end of my teenage years, obviously 20, I didn’t have a clue what the fuck I was going to do for the rest of my life. It was like, I saw the answer. I just saw the Sex Pistols spit at people on stage, and I thought “I want to do that. I want to be able to spit at people onstage.” As long as they don’t spit at me. You have got to get it right, you can spit them but they can’t spit at you. I thought, “Right, to be in a group, you obviously need an instrument.” So, I went out and paid £35 for a bass guitar because my mate, Bernard [Sumner], had a guitar. You’re not allowed to have two guitars in a punk group. Or you weren’t then. That was it. We were a group. Then, we thought, “Shit, we’ve got no music.” [laughs] Sort of one little oversight. So, we started writing music and that was it. I’ve been doing that for 30 years. TOBY LAING So, you picked up a bass. You weren’t necessarily drawn to it. Within that punk idea. there’s a lot of freedom, but there are a couple of rules about a certain approach to music… PETER HOOK Yeah. We sort of broke that quite soon, really, because the first music we wrote was obviously punky as in the fact that you couldn’t play. I think that it was quite soon that your tastes are refined. My musical taste, as in the people I was listening to, I suppose you’d have to say was quite refined. I liked The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, all your heavy metal stuff that was big. I suppose you’re listening to a lot of different slow and fast music, whereas in punk it was all one pace [growls a punk singer]. Like that, you see. We soon got bored with that. That didn’t get us. I know that bands still play like that today, but it didn’t get us, so we sort of moved off musically quite quickly. The rules of punk, which I still sort of hold dear, is that you don’t necessarily do what people say. The great thing about forming a group, I’ve found, was that you could tell everyone to fuck off because you were in a group, and somehow you got away with it because you were in a group. You went to television studios, you were drunk, you were obnoxious, you just did what you wanted, you fell over, you spewed up, and that was in a group. It was great. It’s quite interesting now when you see things like Pop Idol and all this sort of reality thing because groups have to be completely different. They have to be nice to people. Well, the way that I was brought up was independently. We had an independent record label, which means we didn’t have really have anybody telling us what to do. The only drawback from that was that no one would lend you any money. As we all know in this world money is very important in learning, I suppose. The thing that we were always self-financed as a group on every concert we did, every tour we did, and every record we did which hasn’t changed. Nobody funded us. Nobody owned or told Joy Division or New Order what to do, which was very, very lucky position to be in, and I suppose that’s what made me whatever it is I am now. TOBY LAING I think that’s what I was getting at. It’s like taking that idea of being able to do what you want with your music, not being limited to a certain kind of instrumentation, you started to, early on, to utilize a whole bunch of things… electronic instruments. PETER HOOK Yeah, but I think the thing that you’d have to admit is that obviously, you had a talent. I’ve met a lot of people that, even though they’ve been great people, have not really had a talent, and talent comes from no one knows where, does it? Talent comes from God if you like. TOBY LAING It seems like, at one point, talent was coming from Manchester. PETER HOOK Yeah, again, I’ve been very lucky in that I live in Manchester. I don’t know why so many great groups come out of Manchester, I wish I did. I mean, when I think that my friends, The Stone Roses, The Happy Mondays, The Charlatans, Buzzcocks – Christ, even down to that ginger-haired twat Mick Hucknall [laughter]. There’s still a lot of people that have done something in music. Inspiral Carpets, the list is endless of people that came from Manchester. TOBY LAING You don’t have a theory about the culture of Manchester? What might lead to this? PETER HOOK Bernard, his thing was that it was so fucking awful that everybody would always want to get out of it. So, you form a group to get out of it which, I suppose is just as good a reason as any. I still live in Manchester. It’s still very important to me. Ironically, it’s still is important musically. The Smiths, don’t forget the Smiths. Now, Badly Drawn Boy, I Am Kloot, Elbow, Doves. Still, a lot of groups come from Manchester … I mean, we kick Liverpool’s ass, man… it’s fucking great. TOBY LAING The early days, the independent label … Kind of the freedom it offered, but also, obviously, the restriction of not having any funding or having to be self-funded … How did that loose business structure deal with the popularity of … PETER HOOK Well, I mean, business-wise, obviously, now that I’m knocking 51, I’m quite good at business, but I did learn the hard way and we got ripped off loads and loads of times. It was quite interesting signing Red Bull’s contract because it had a clause at the end that said I agreed that it was a reasonable and fair contract. I crossed it off because I didn’t think it was a reasonable and fair contract, but I still signed it. You spend your life going through things like that. I was very lucky in that I got to the ripe, old age of 40 before I signed a contract. The only contract we had was when we signed to London Records in 1996 or something. Before that, I’d never had to sign a contract. because we were punks and we didn’t sign contracts. It was quite interesting. So, business-wise, you do get taken advantage of, but the thing is, as my mother used to say “You’ll see the back of them all, Peter” and very luckily, I have. The thing about doing it independently and being free is that things could happen very quickly. I remember writing “Love Will Tear Us Apart” in an afternoon with Ian, and he went away and did the lyrics, and then we came back, and we didn’t even have the tape machine in those days, so for the record companies to hear it, they had to come hear us perform it, which was quite interesting because it’s quite interesting when you think that an LP like Unknown Pleasures, because we were poor, it only existed in our heads. It didn’t exist anywhere on tape because we were too poor to record it. We didn’t have anything to record it on, so the only time it existed was when we played it together, which was quite a startling concept when you think how much you take for granted being able to listen to music these days and that the way that you write music in layers across a computer. You have an ultimate variety of doing whatever you want to it. It sometimes amazes me that, I think, that Unknown Pleasures only existed in our heads, and the only time we could play was when the four of us played it together. Again, the thing was that, yeah, we played our manager “Love Will Tell Us Apart.” “That’s good, lads. I think that might do all right that. I’ll get Tony Wilson down,” and he got Tony Wilson down, and Tony Wilson heard it and went, “Yeah, that’s good. That could be good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We’ll go and record that.” Phone Martin Hannett and we phoned Martin Hannett, and we went and recorded it, and that was “Love Will Tear Us Apart” done like in a week and out. Unfortunately, it coincided with Ian [Curtis]’s death. God rest his soul, but the point was that you could do things quickly in those days. Everything didn’t have to be planned like a military campaign. You can’t release a single until you finish your album, till you’ve got your video done, till this and that. All that bollocks. TOBY LAING You just mentioned Martin Hannett and describing yourself as a self-taught musician. You picked up a base and just started playing it, almost luck of the draw. PETER HOOK Luck of the draw [laughs]. TOBY LAING Did you… You’ve since worked a lot in the studio as a producer, self-produced albums and also your own projects. You’ve produced The Stone Roses. PETER HOOK It’s what I hated about producers, and what I hated about Martin Hannett, in particular, was that he didn’t do what the group wanted because I think that producers, while they may be right or they might be right – “Maybe the chorus is too long, or your vocal is slightly out of tune. That drum loop’s too busy, or da de da de da da” – the thing is that they finish the work, they get paid, and they’d go, and you’d have to live with it and talk about it ad infinitum. The thing is… is that my view of producing, which is probably why I never get asked to produce anybody any more is that the bands should always be the one that’s happy, not the producer, not the record company because the band have to live with it. Whenever I have produced… I produced The Stone Roses and people like that. I’ve always, if I did something the band didn’t like, we had to change it because I always felt, as a musician, that they have to live with it and not me. That’s my production ethic. TOBY LAING Are you going back into the studio to produce anything in the near [future]? PETER HOOK To be honest with you, production is one of the most difficult and time-consuming jobs, and even though you get paid for it, if you have a hit album then you can make a fortune. I find it so consuming and such hard work that I prefer playing in the group, really. My greatest love is playing in the group. I do DJing because the other members of the group don’t want to play, so I needed something to fill me time, so when Mani asked me to DJ on Primal Scream, I said yes. TOBY LAING That initial phase when you had developed this popularity in Manchester and outside of Manchester and around the UK. Taking that music then to other places, what was the… PETER HOOK You see, that sounds easy. It wasn’t that easy because we used to play to nobody as Joy Division. We played a gig in Oldham, which is near Manchester, and there was nobody there. No one. I remember, two girls came in after about 20 minutes. They walked up to the front of the stage because there was nobody in there, we were playing, and we stopped. The girl went “Hey, are The Frantic Elevators” We went “No, no. We’re Joy Division.” They went “Fuck, we’re in the wrong place,” and they went. When you play to no people, it doesn’t matter, does it. We were playing the same set, the Unknown Pleasures set that six months later, or a year later you’d be playing to thousands of people. There’s no rhyme or reason to it, at all. The thing is, I suppose as a performer and as a musician, every single time you play, you’re tested. I was saying before, that when I DJed at Parklife [the Australian music festival] on Saturday, which was quite ironic, because when I walked home because I started off with a slow tune and everybody had been playing fast stuff, someone threw something at me, which was a crushed up Red Bull can… I took the money with relish today for that. It happens all the time. Sometimes you go down well, sometimes you go down crap. You don’t take your success anywhere with you. Everywhere you go can be really, really difficult because it attacks your heart and your soul if you’re up there playing and someone spits at you or throws something at you or shouts, “Get off, you’re shit,” or whatever. “You cheeky bastard,” you know, it gets you right “in there.” The good thing about being in a group is at least you’ve got your mates to [grumbles]. When you’re DJing, you haven’t got shit. [Pretends to be scared] “Where’s that big guy got… the one that was on the end,” you know? I mean, performing attacks you every time. It’s very easy to lose your battle. Or to lose everything, just by one guy going [makes offensive hand gesture]. I actually find it worse now because I’m sober. “My name’s Peter, and I’m an alcoholic …” Now that I’m sober, I see everything. Whereas before, when I was drinking I didn’t see anything, I was just [growls]… It’s funny, it’s made it actually harder. The thing that puzzles me is, I started off sober, so I don’t know why that changed. Been sober for years, playing. Now it bugs the shit out me, when people are pissed. TOBY LAING There’s some unpleasant experiences. As a performer, something has been compelling you to continue writing songs with this group of people when, at times, it seems like it’s been a difficult relationship with your other colleagues in the bands. PETER HOOK The difficult thing for me is that it is the only thing I know is writing songs and playing them. It’s very difficult for me to sit there and say to my children, “Oh, you should do your exams because it’s very important.” He goes to me, “Well you’ve never got any exams, and look at you! You’re alright.” I’m like, “That’s not the point!” Sound like me dad. It’s the only thing I’ve known is writing and performing music, and sometimes when I’m really, really pissed off with them all, and I think, “Shit, that’s it. I’ve had enough of that knobhead, he’s driving me mad. I’m going, I’ve had enough …” Then I think, “Well, what you going to do?” “Oh, OK, I’ll play …” It’s a strange world, isn’t it? TOBY LAING Obviously, you do get some form of… the expression of it obviously is something that… PETER HOOK The expression is… I couldn’t even explain. Somebody, when I played… this is name-dropping. Sorry. When we did Glastonbury last year, there was 120,000 people there, and they all sat there staring at you. It was an absolute bizarre situation to be in. People all caked in mud, off their tits on psychedelic mushrooms, chanting along to “Love Will Tear Us Apart,” how could you explain something like that? It’s pretty good. It’s great. It’s nice to be appreciated. It’s nice to have your ego massaged in one way or another. The thing is, is that when you sat somewhere in the four o’clock in the morning, trying to think of a word that rhymes with witch… We always used to call them “five o’clock in the morning” lyrics. “Oh, fuck. Can you just put that in, and fucking let’s get out of here.” Then, you have that side of it, the really difficult side, the writing side and also dealing with the business side. Then the great bit is to walk out on stage and have them all scream at you, I suppose, and enjoy what you do. The satisfaction is amazing. It’s not real, though, you know. As you finish, you still have to clean up dog shit and all that. TOBY LAING I’m not sure if you’re sick of talking about the whole situation where you found yourself not only in a band that was pretty busy but also, in a band that was involved in various business enterprises such as, a certain place of entertainment called the Haçienda. PETER HOOK Our record company and our manager decided that because we had nowhere to go in Manchester, we should open our own club. So we did, and in all fairness, the club did change. If any of you went clubbing. He’s yawning, he must have been out there last night. It changed the face of clubbing and with acid house music. Sort of created dance in England and Europe. The whole ecstasy thing just went completely through the roof. The club was … It was a very difficult thing because when you worked out how many people had been in the Haçienda in the fifteen years it was open, you reckon that each of them had probably cost New Order and Joy Division about ten quid each. So we’d lost that much money on the club. Even though your accountant kept saying to you it was great promotion and… When things are going bad and you sat there a bit skint thinking, “Hmm, I could have done without that promotion, really.” Would rather have had the money, you know. But we’re artists, aren’t we? TOBY LAING Yeah, the promotional value … obviously, you had to the brunt of it, but it’s a very famous place and the whole scene with Factory Records and the Haçienda and New Order. PETER HOOK Yeah, I mean thanks to 24 Hour Party People, the film, it sort of resurrected it around the world and made it… it was a very special place. The thing is, our manager did say to us, “I think we’ve done well out of Manchester, we’ve done well out of music, we should give something back.” We didn’t realize that he meant everything [laughs]. We thought he just meant a little bit of it. A tenner, maybe. Not everything. So, but, yeah, mistakes you make. You sign a little bit of paper when you’re hungover, and then the next thing you know, it’s kicking you up the ass for 20 years, isn’t it? We have to say we’re still here and we haven’t done badly out of it. We’re still… I’m a very successful musician, and I’ve done well. It’s been hard work. I mean, I still have to work now. I work for a living. I work because I love it. That’s what my wife always says, “You fucking love it. Shut up moaning.” But I do love it, but I do still have to work for a living. TOBY LAING When I just think of the… when I think of your musical output and the various styles that it’s… You may not be conscious of it, being in the middle of it all, but you seem to be drawing from a lot of different places throughout the years. You obviously- PETER HOOK Yeah, we’ve been really lucky for being in the right place at the right time. You’d have to say that Joy Division, Factory, New Order, Haçienda had it. They were definitely in the right place at the right time. I think we write great music, which I think is the… you have to believe in yourself at some point. You have to be able to stand up and say, “This is great, fuck the lot of you.” Even when it bombs on its ass, you have to say, “Well I still think it was great.” I write music for myself. I don’t write it for, as much as I hate to say it, for you lot or anybody. I write it because I love it and because when I finish it, I think it’s fantastic. I don’t tailor-make my music for audiences. I think that even as a DJ, there’s an aspect of tailoring your music. Like when I played in Wellington the other night, I was saying to you [points to interviewer], it was an indie crowd, and they were all moaning because I was playing dance music. The devil in me thinks, “Well fuck you then. Tough shit. Shouldn’t have come, should you?” [laughs] You know, it’s like that. Then the other side of me thinks, “Am I going to get beaten up? Well, maybe I should put some on.” TOBY LAING When you DJ, it’s all kinds of stuff that you’re playing? PETER HOOK Yeah. I always found DJing absolutely ridiculous. I thought they were a bunch of egotistical pricks. I was right. Now I’m an egotistical prick as well, it’s fucking great, isn’t it? I guess someone said I was being an egotistical prick. No, I didn’t understand it, to be honest. The only reason I began DJing was because Mani, the bass player of Primal Scream who was my friend, he said to me “It’s a great way of getting pissed for nothing.” I thought “Well, that sounds interesting,” so I went to see him. We did a gig in Barcelona, which was absolutely hilarious because he was twatted and I didn’t do anything. I just stood there answering questions about why New Order don’t gig. [Spanish accent] “Why you never play in Spain? Why you never come here?” He was throwing the records at people when they were annoying him. He was spinning, he was scratching at one point. Really into it and I went over and said, “Mani, that’s not on, that.” [laughter] “Oh fucking alright, OK then.” I thought, “This seems like a proper good laugh, this DJing.” That was the reason why I started DJing and I went through the drinking part of it. Getting completely pissed and chasing girls around stuff like that. Which I’m not proud of. Then I got into the musical side of it. Started putting music together that I thought would be good. To be honest, after being in the studio with New Order for three years… the thing that pissed me off most was that we hadn’t been playing. We had been in the studio for three years, we had done a record, but we weren’t doing any gigs, which I found very irksome. I started DJing and then started thinking about music to play to people and obviously got into the whole reason of why DJs DJ, because they put music together in a way that makes it entertaining, makes it have an impact and people take it for granted. I mean I can count on… I can count on everybody’s hands here [gestures to audience] however many times I have been into a club and never noticed the DJ. But if he wasn’t there, we’d all be a bit bored, wouldn’t we? It’s one of those funny things. I was very scathing when I began it, and now I think they’re great. TOBY LAING I mean, regardless of how incredibly out of it a lot of people must have been at the time, the club we were talking about before seems to be a bit of a landmark for DJs exposing crowds to music, which they may not otherwise have heard, putting it together in a way that they may not have experienced before, and it’s led to various different subcultures around the world. PETER HOOK We had the record in the Haçienda of paying a DJ the most that a DJ had ever been paid, which was Sasha for his first sold-out night in the Haçienda. He got paid £2,000 in 1988 or ’89, which was quite a lot of money then. So, I suppose in a way, that whole DJ-as-superstar culture came from acid house and… it’s funny as a musician when you’re not a DJ, you just think, “Well, all they do is play records. They’re playing our records. That’s all they’re doing.” I mean, obviously, there’s more to it than that, but to my mind, I still think the musician, I should have to say, is the most important person, because they wouldn’t have anything to play, would they? The reason most DJs get into writing their own stuff is because they get paid more for playing their own stuff than they get paid for playing your stuff or my stuff. That’s how they make money on publishing. That’s a step. It’s a career step, I suppose. Hope I haven’t disillusioned anybody there. TOBY LAING So, you came out of the studio last year after three years, did you say? PETER HOOK Well, yeah, I mean, off and on. When you get to our age, as daft as it sounds, you don’t do it the way that you did. I used to go in the studio and I’d do 18 hours. I’d just go back, sleep, go back to the studio. I did that for 20-odd years, you know. You’d lose a few girlfriends, wives. You miss a few children growing up, and then you think, “What the fuck am I doing?” So you do it in a different way now. I do it as a 10-to-6, as a job. I think it’s that interesting thing that when you start, you live for the group. As you get on through it, you do the group to live. It’s just… I’ve done the intensity, and I’ve done all that lot. I’m very lucky in that I have a bedrock that enables me to come on a jolly to Australia and play in front of a few people in a park in Melbourne or whatever. I’m sort of very lucky. I get paid for doing it. It’s great. But without the bedrock of the work that I put in, the intensity of that, that takes you to the edge in many ways, then you wouldn’t have that freedom to do it. I think I’ve paid my dues. TOBY LAING You just mentioned before writing, “Love Will Tear Us Apart” in an afternoon or an evening. That actual songwriting process, how is it… How many different forms does that take? PETER HOOK To me, it only takes two forms. Either it comes really quickly or it takes forever. If you look at a song like “Blue Monday” that took a hell of a long time to write. because of the technology we were using, the way that Bernard and Stephen [Morris] approach the technology was fantastic because I often found it boring as shit, and I would have been happy just to play on the guitars, and not be music at all. I found it really dull and tiresome, but they persevered and went through all the controlled voltage and building their own drum machines and working your way through of joining synths together to do pulses, to split off. We had a guy who built… We used a drum machine that came from an organ, like your granny has, playing bossa nova, waltz and all that. We took it out and got this guy to rebuild it and make it so you have separate outputs for each instrument. We did that in 1980. We used that on stage, which was actually a bizarre thing to use on stage from your granny’s room. To fire the drum machine, a guy converted it from controlled voltage so that you can pulse a synth that Bernard built from a kit in England called the Transcendent 2000 – which never fucking worked. We went through all that, and basically, it consumed you, unbelievably, the amount of work you had to put in. Very lucky these days, you can just buy it and turn it on. You’ve got a complete home studio within about half an hour with as many sounds as you want. It’s incredible. That’s why it was really nice when I was watching the girl downstairs playing the squeeze box. It was absolutely wonderful to hear an instrument. It’s really nice. Normally whenever I hear an instrument, I press a button and an instrument comes. It’s really nice [that] some people actually play still. It’s fantastic. But the technology to do “Blue Monday” was unbelievable. When we think that we’ve Prophet Five in 1980, we paid £2,000 for a Prophet Five. God knows how much that is today. Probably 25, 30 grand or something like that… TOBY LAING Yeah… PETER HOOK Believable. We had five of them because they were so unreliable that you couldn’t rely on one to play. You had to have three set up, ready to switch them over if they went down on stage, and two in the back for when the other three went. Literally like roulette. Whether any of the bleeding stuff worked. When the emulator came along, if you know the Emulator? It was a sample player. You used to load a sample on a floppy disk and play it on the keyboard. We got the first one and we thought it was just [inaudible], oh every song, “Hey wow, great.” Really overdid it. It was so unreliable that every time you used to go on stage… I remember we were playing a gig in Germany, and this thing wouldn’t load at all. Kept putting the disk in and it just wouldn’t fucking load … Our sound guy was watching it. I saw him get off the podium at the back and walked, stormed all the way through, right up. Come up to the side of the stage, got on the stage, come on the stage, picks up the emulator, threw it on the floor, picked it up, put it on the stand, and it loaded. It was that… The technology was that shit [laughter]… I remember we had a phone call at the venue in Bremen or something with this German guy. He came to see us, and we’d got into the habit then of banging the Emulator on one of the legs with a hammer. If you hit it on the right leg, which was the top right, it’d load. We had a phone call in the production office, and it was Erasure, [who] were playing somewhere in Germany. They’d heard that we’d figured out how to fix the Emulator. They said, “Which leg do you hit with the hammer to make the fucking thing load?” You went through all that equipment thing of people using you as the guinea pig, and your money to do it, so the thing is that the sound that you did create, and that Bernard and Stephen were the pioneers of it, was really, really difficult to do. It was really difficult in those days to make an electronic record. As you said before, the perseverance and the effort was worth it. You can dine out on it for years. TOBY LAING It’s definitely worth it in the case of “Blue Monday,” which is a record that, I’m sure we’ve all heard in all kinds of different places. It’s one of the biggest-selling records of all time, on the 12” format. PETER HOOK Yes, and we lost 10p on every copy because the sleeve was… When they designed the sleeve, because it had cutouts in it, it was really expensive to make, but nobody noticed that. So, when we sold, they were losing money on each sale. TOBY LAING Do you think all this is paying off in some kind of karma bank somewhere? PETER HOOK (Laughs) That’s the great thing about being independent; you can make mistakes like that. If you’d have been on Polydor, someone might have come along and gone [inaudible]. We did this. It was a fantastic sleeve, the way it was based on the floppy disk. It was absolutely revolutionary. Steve Morris’s great quote about it is, “It was the bits that you didn’t get that were expensive.” The holes that were punched out were the bits that cost the money. The nothing bit, which was quite interesting. TOBY LAING Well. It’s interesting discussing these tensions you had in the band. PETER HOOK All these mistakes (laughs). TOBY LAING And mistakes, and… PETER HOOK Maybe I should do a book of mistakes. TOBY LAING Problems along the way. Just listening from an outside perspective, it’s this ability to compromise. The flexibility you’ve each shown to the project, as well as the single-mindedness at other times that have led to this stream of creativity over the years. PETER HOOK The whole thing about being in a group, to my mind, is compromise because it’s all about chemistry. I don’t know whether you’re all solo artists, or whether you’re in groups. But speaking as a group member, you start off with your friends. Then within about six months, you can’t fucking stand the sight of each other. That last version was in my case for about 30 years. You get less for murder, don’t you? It’s about chemistry. I appreciate when we all went off and did our solo projects. It didn’t have the chemistry that New Order and Joy Division had. But it was still great. I had a great time. It’s a difficult thing. Being in a group is difficult. Thing is, I’ve never met any group, ever, that ever got on. Ever. Primal Scream got on for a while, but even that didn’t last. Then you’re standing there with them [thinking], “Look at that twat… I’m going to kill him in a minute, if he fucking comes near me now I’m going to kill him.” [Pretends to speak to the other person, smiling] “Alright mate, yeah.” [Turns away] ”Fucking twat … bastard…” It’s like that. Every single group is exactly the same. It’s fantastic [laughs]. PETER HOOK That’s what I’m getting at really. It’s a jigsaw puzzle of all these different personalities and different approaches and what the different members of the group seem to find important at different times. TOBY LAING But I mean, in the case of, say, the electronics coming into the group, and suddenly, you’re the bass player, but you’re contending with these sequenced bass lines, but you find a way to contribute to the music in a whole new way by playing higher on the instrument, by actually turning the bass into… PETER HOOK Yeah, I started that in Joy Division, actually. It was Ian Curtis that spotted… I mean, Ian was the singer, so he’d just sit there while we played. When he heard something that he liked, he said, “That sounds good. Do that. And you put a guitar to that, Barney. Do that.” I mean, that’s why it was so difficult after he killed himself, selfish bastard. We had to record it then and figure it out ourselves. You know the whole thing changed when you got to “New Order” because he was the one that listened and spotted it. It was him, I’d have to say, was the one that spotted that playing high upon the neck gave you an identity and made it unique if you wanted. The thing was, that transferred actually quite well to New Order. While Bernard sang, I could play around his singing because he can’t sing and play at the same time, in the same way that I can’t sing and play at the same time. I do one or the other. I’m not like Sting. That’s a funny one, that one. I’m just thinking about a bass in Florida in this shop, semi-acoustic bass. It was really nice. The guy said to me: “Don’t buy that one!” He said, “we got a really, really special one coming in tomorrow.” And I went: “Oh well what’s special about it?” He went: “Come in tomorrow and you can have this really really special one. Leave that one. Buy this one tomorrow.” I went in and I said: “what’s special?” And he went, “Sting signed it.” Fuck off. I bought the other one. Oh, so anyway, where was I? I forgot. TOBY LAING It does work very well… PETER HOOK Oh right, I’m sorry… TOBY LAING You playing Sting’s bass on those tracks? PETER HOOK Yeah, it did. It fitted in quite well but I suppose you’d have to say it’s a mixture of talent and luck wouldn’t you? What else can you say? Didn’t plan it. I never planned anything. You can tell by all the mistakes. I’m interested to know how the band, New Order, is at the moment. I know there’s been a fair amount of gigging lately and how that approach… Is the electronic gear behaving itself better these days? PETER HOOK Ironically, I was [inaudible]. Most of you know this but most of it’s on tape anyway. When bands play, they either use DAT, which we used to do in the old days. Now most people play on a CD or they use a hard drive. We still use a multi-track. We use a 16-track player. We still use some pause, we still trigger keyboards from the tape. We try and keep as much of it live as we can these days. Funny thing is, we went around the world for 10, 15 years, giving all this gear a fantastic holiday. It’s not very appreciative gear, falls apart. Pick it up in Bangkok airport. It doesn’t travel well. So you do get to the point where you’re thinking, “Well fuck I can’t travel with this. It’s just falling apart all the time.” So we switched it, which was quite lucky really. It’s still that thing. It’s all about performance. When you walk out on stage, or when you walk to go out to play or whatever, it’s about grabbing the moment and making it yours and sending whoever’s watching home thinking, fucking hell, yeah, he was good, or he was shit. As long as you get some reaction, I think that’s what it’s about. Really, I don’t mind if people mind, or if people play to back your track, for the simple reason it still takes a lot of skill to pull it off. If somebody pulls it off to a backing track, then you’re going to appreciate it just as much as if you pull it off and you’ve got a thirty piece orchestra, all playing live. I’m not snobbish about that. TOBY LAING There’s some more of that compromising and flexibility that I was talking about before. Is that still very much a part of taking the stage show on the road nowadays? What’s the approach now to doing a big show at Glastonbury? Is it just like the old days? PETER HOOK I find it quite odd actually because we get loads of stick of our fans for playing the same set every night, which we don’t do. We do vary it a little. I think with the time constraints and the fact that you’re all doing all the things and you don’t live 100% for the band, you can’t do that. So our punters, our fans, are always complaining because we play the same set every night. I’m thinking, you’re not supposed to play to the same people every night. So our fans complaining about, “Oh you’re here again? I really don’t like you being here because you’re here every night. Why don’t you piss off?” You play to the people in Ireland, for the Irish people. You don’t want some geek to turn up from Manchester going: “Oh you’re playing the same set you did in Manchester.” And you’re like, “Fuck, what are you on about?” It don’t make any sense. It’s just a weird thing. You sort of go through a moaning for ages, “You should play something different.” You might think, “Well if we leave something out, the Irish kid might be really upset that you’re not playing ‘Ceremony’ or ‘Blue Monday’ because we’ve put a different song in for you.” It comes to that thing of, how far do you go about pleasing people? How far do you bend over? TOBY LAING But it is very important to still be playing at this stage. PETER HOOK Yeah. My love is playing music. I love playing bass. I love it more than anything in the world. Most of my arguments within the group were when Bernard wanted to get modern. “Can’t you play some keyboards?” I’d say: “No I can’t. I don’t want to play keyboards. I just want to play bass.” We used to fight about it because he felt it was making it old-fashioned. Like you know, we should be like Depeche Mode or something like that. TOBY LAING We were discussing upstairs about the importance of playing live, which is something that maybe more studio-based musicians, producers, might like to hear about. Something that seems to be a bit of a change in the music industry over the last couple of years with transferring music through burning, downloading, whatnot. It seems like you can’t stop it. It’s how music gets around nowadays. It seems to be a very natural way for music to travel but it seems to impact a lot on album sales, if you produce a CD, a studio project … PETER HOOK Our LP got leaked by supposedly a trusted journalist and put on the internet, which as a musician can be quite… you’ll never know if that guy putting it on the internet has cost you 100,000 or cost you a million sales. It happened to the Chili Peppers this time with Stadium Arcadium. It happened to us. It’s life’s rich tapestry isn’t. You can’t stop people. I mean I used to do it. I’d record an LP on cassette and give it him. So I mean everybody does it, I do it. TOBY LAING It seems to have reached the point now where… In the past, maybe it did affect your market a little, but at the same time, the music would get further to people who wouldn’t even dream of even buying it. Now it seems to have reached the point where even the people who would’ve bought the album originally maybe are… PETER HOOK I still think the people who would buy your album would buy it because I would. I was on one of my jaunt, at an airport, and I bought the Primal Scream LP. I bought it because I love them. I was thinking: “Fuck it I’ll buy it.” I could ask Mani for it or I could ask Bobby Gillespie for it, but it was nice to buy it. So I still that think people are the same as me and if they like the record, they’re going to buy it. I think the thing that’s changed is kids really. Children when they get into, and they have the technology now, and the freedom to do what they want, so they don’t have to go out and buy a record. They can download it. My children sort of don’t think that music exists in any other form than a download. Why would you want 12 songs? I only want the one that’s hit. I don’t want the other 11. It’s modern life. It’s the way it is. There’s so much choice. There’s so much freedom and flexibility. The thing is you can’t moan about that, can you? You can’t. TOBY LAING It seems to be modern, but at the same time, it’s going back to sort of an older model where the artists and the bands really do need to get out and reach the live audience. PETER HOOK Yeah. We were talking about this before. What we were saying was what that in record-company terms, there’s a point that groups reach that they call the “Rolling Stones moment,” which is when people want to see them live but they don’t want to buy their new record. As my accountant put it, it’s just the way of people re-living the glory days, when they were off the tits, 20 years ago. They just want to hear that stuff, not your current stuff. It’s becoming recognized in a lot of older groups with a big back catalog, that people like to hear the old stuff, which is probably logical really, more than the new stuff. It affects you because, as an artist, your record company can’t justify lending you money or spending money on recording because they’re not earning back on your records. You earn it on the live performances. The record company doesn’t get anything from your live performances So they’re saying, “Why should we bankroll your record when we’re not earning anything and you’re getting all the money from… ” They don’t say that, but they mean that, I suppose. So I mean it’s just a different way in that, as we were saying before, that gigs are now very expensive but people will go and pay it. It was $86 for that Parklife thing. Yet if people walked in Virgin, they go, “Fucking hell, $10 for that? Holy shit, man!” It’s just a different thing, isn’t it? People seem to be happy to pay to see you live which I’m not going to complain about but they sort of pull back a bit when they buy records. TOBY LAING I would like to open this up to the floor and see if there’s anyone out there who has any queries; any things that they are wondering about, that maybe Peter Hook could fill them in on? AUDIENCE MEMBER A lot of people just remember seeing 24 Hour Party People. Steve Coogan plays a very interesting Tony Wilson. What was the real Tony Wilson like? PETER HOOK He’s like family to me. I hate him and love him in equal measures. People considering… There’s a lot of history involved with Tony Wilson. He was the head of our record company. When the record company went bankrupt, he owed New Order, Joy Division, about £3 million. So £3 million of our money just disappeared. With the Haçienda and the bar that we opened in Manchester, we lost, we reckoned, about £6 million. We lost a lot of money, and people find it hard to believe why you have anything to do with him, but I suppose I’m lucky. My accountant always says, because he’s a dreaded accountant, he always says to you that as long as you keep earning money, the fact that you’ve lost money doesn’t hurt. It’s when you stop earning money, then it will really hurt. So, I suppose I’ve got that to look forward to, really. But I get on really well with Tony. I think his ideas and his way of working is fantastically anarchic. It just gets to the point where after fifteen years, you’re bored with anarchy. How many riots do you want to go to? You just want to sit home and have a beer, watch telly. It’s like you have to balance it out, don’t you? Whereas, with Factory and the Haçienda, there was no balance. You were always veering from one catastrophic thing to another. In the end, they were using our records, New Orders’ records, to fund all the other acts on the label, and run this dodgy nightclub, which I must admit, I had some of the best nights of my life in, without a shadow of a doubt. You can’t do it. You can’t… “Come on and hurry and finish the record. Haçienda’s running out of money.” You go, “Ah, fucking hell”. AUDIENCE MEMBER With what you were saying before, about Haçienda. The thing about people like Mike Pickering and all that. Were you guys around much during this period, when these guys were actually chasing out these American records. PETER HOOK Yeah. AUDIENCE MEMBER When all of a sudden there was this… Tell us a bit about, what was the vibe in the air like? Have you got any music as well? PETER HOOK If I could remember it, I’d tell you. No, it was great. It was a right laugh. It was rocking. How can you describe something like that? Everyone was off their tits. The funny thing was, everybody is construed as being like the drugs have a major part to play in it. But in all truth, I’d say in Haçienda, out of 2,000 people, maybe 10% were taking drugs. The others were having a great time, they were high on life. In some ways, the drug aspect of it gets pushed, because it’s on the edge, the way rock’n’roll is I suppose. But it simply wasn’t true that it was… I still think that it was about the music, not about the drugs. Yet everybody thinks that all that acid house, dance thing, is about ecstasy and drugs. I don’t think it is, I think it’s about people enjoying music and having a great time. I had some of the best nights of my life, if I could only remember them. AUDIENCE MEMBER Hello. A lot of us have seen the movie, of course. So, I was wondering what you think about it. What’s true and what’s definitely not true? PETER HOOK Well, it depends on who you talk to about which bit’s true or not. We had the… I do love this thing, the way that filmmakers talk to you and get you to do their job for them. Frank Cottrell-Boyce, who wrote it, just did interviews with New Order, which we were happy to talk to him about, got the best bits of what you talked about, just put them all together and made it entertaining. Some of it was true and some of it wasn’t. Some of it was glamorized. Some of it wasn’t. Everybody’s memory of it is different. I thought it was quite interesting that Tony Wilson’s book about it, he wrote his book about that time to the film and changed it so that it fitted it in with the film. And I was like, “Why have you done that? That isn’t true.” He says to me, “You’ve got to realize, Peter, that fiction is much more interesting than fact.” I don’t think it is, personally. It was good. It was quite weird. I’d never seen, obviously, when Ian died, I didn’t see it. I was only 22. I was just a kid. Me world had caved in, so I didn’t address anything like that. It was the first time I’d ever seen that aspect of it, which was a bit unsettling. It was quite sad. Also, all the stories about all losing the money and all that lot. To me, that’s fucking cataclysmic. I mean, it’s my kids… aren’t provided for or whatever, and yet to sit there and have everyone laughing at it, “Haha, they lost 10p on every copy.” “You fuckers, what are you fucking laughing at, you cheeky bastards?” But that’s the thing. It’s funny. It was done in a lighthearted way, you know, so I suppose once you got used to that aspect of it. It was alright. I thought he did a good job, and the thing is that you have to measure it. Everywhere you go in the world, people have seen “24 Hour Party People.” When I DJ, it’s always “24 Hour Party People” featuring Peter Hook from New Order. So you know, it still keeps me going so I suppose… It would be interesting to see if the Joy Division film, which is called Control, that they’re doing at the moment, has any impact like “24 Hour Party People.” I don’t know, because it’s dark, whether it will or not, I don’t know. But if it does, it’s pretty good having a film made about you while you’re still alive. You know, two. Sorry, two. AUDIENCE MEMBER How does your creative process differ, say, between when you’ve been in a band and you’ve been working as a solo artist? Do you find that being in the band scenario is more inspiring or less inspiring than working by yourself? Or, I’d imagine it’s a combination of the love-hate-type relationship-type thing. But, being in the band may be a more inspirational scenario to be in certain situations. PETER HOOK As a musician, the way that I write, I prefer to write from jamming. It’s always, whenever I start something, nine times out of ten, I’ll start with me and somebody else jamming. I’ve started an offshoot. I’ve started a group with Mani out of Primal Scream and Andy Rourke out of The Smiths. Everyone was taking the piss out of us because it’s got three bass players and it sort of made us all the more determined to do it, really. And we did it and it actually sounds really good, but Mani and I did it as a reaction because Bobby wouldn’t gig. He was pissed off. because Bernard wouldn’t gig, I was pissed off. So, we decided to do something. We got something together, it started so well so then we decided to gig. For me, writing, I write from jams. That’s what I prefer to write from, and it’s quite an arduous process because you jam for an hour and then you have to sit there listening to it and go, “Maybe we could get something out of that.” And people go, “What are you going to get out of that?” And you get a crystal. It’s just the way that different people work. The way that I like to work is from jamming so that something exists and then you hear something in it and you work on it. When we split up in 1990 and I tried to do something on my own, and I thought, “Right, fuck it, I’m going to do it on my own. I’m sick of them bastards. I do enough for them.” He says, “Freedom, come on. We got all the gear going.” Started off listening to it and I thought, “Oh, that sounds good, doesn’t it? [inaudible] Shit.” So I prefer to work with people and I dunno…. It can be inspiring. Also, when someone’s like… “Come on! Argh!” AUDIENCE MEMBER When you’re a group and everyone is jamming, and everyone is contributing to a song, how do you decide which one has written the song? PETER HOOK There you go, the reason why most groups split up. Money. You start off with your mates and when your mate wants five quid more than you, he’s not your mate anymore, is he? My belief in publishing is that everybody should have the same. If you’re in a band, it should be the same, regardless of who does what. I think the important thing is that you’re all together. I mean, I’m not talking about some idiot… My mates have just kicked a guy out of their group, who’s been in the group for 18 years. They’ve just kicked him out, and I was saying to them, “That must have been really tough,” and he went, “To be honest with you, it wasn’t, because out of the eight albums we’ve done, he was only there for two. The other six he was just off his head. Pissed up in the corner.” They got sick of his wife phoning up and saying to him, “Can I speak to him?” and he wasn’t there. He was in the pub around the corner, charlied off his nuts. In a situation like that, you go, “Hang on, no”. It’s the most difficult thing in the world, and all you can do is try and reconcile it if you want to go on, because if you don’t reconcile it, then you won’t go on. Maybe you have to take more of a compromise because the future might be more important. It’s entirely down to how you can live with it. If the singer gets double, and you can live with it, then fine. If you can’t live with it, then you have to get out. AUDIENCE MEMBER So, if you’re making a song and one person comes up with a very simple idea, but it might be the thing that makes the song as good as it gets? PETER HOOK Well, I don’t agree, because if you listen to The Stone Roses, where would The Stone Roses be without Reni and Mani? And they never got any songwriting credits. They never got any publishing. Which I think is absolutely ridiculous. If you look at a band like The Smiths, Morrissey and Marr actually said to Rourke and Joyce that it’d be easier to collect the money for the publishing if they did it in two names. Is that fair? AUDIENCE MEMBER No, that’s what I’m saying. PETER HOOK Rourkey and Joycey had, I think, maybe not as much as Morrissey and Marr, because they wrote the melodies, the lyrics, and dah-dee-dah, but I still think they’re worthy of being included. But a lot of bands do do that. If you’ve got a band like the Beautiful South, Beautiful South split publishing eight ways. How many people are in the band, that’s the way they split it. And the singer does that because he thinks that that’s fair because you’re all living together and working together which I agree with, but other people don’t, you see. I think it’s a simple matter of what you can live with. Everybody thinks they did it, don’t they? “I did that, that was me. That was me. If it hadn’t been for that word. I did that.” You just argue till you’re blue in the face, can’t you? I think the thing that makes bands work and makes it work is compromise. You have to swallow it. Sometimes you don’t. Sometimes it is down to you. But every group that I’ve worked with, I’ve always split it equally, which is just daft. So, none of you are coming in a band with me, right? AUDIENCE MEMBER It seems to me like you’ve followed the road less traveled. You’ve done all these very strange things. You’ve made these bizarre decisions, lost all this money. At the same time, created this amazing art. Achieved a degree of immortality, if you like. You’ve got some great stories. But, is it worth it? PETER HOOK Yeah, of course it is. I wouldn’t be here, would I? If it wasn’t worth it. It’s been fantastic, I’ve had a great time. It’s all about work, really. I love to work. I can’t get around that bit of staying at home. I can’t do it yet. Even though you feel guilty. It’s my son’s birthday next Wednesday, and I’m not there. He’s 17. He doesn’t give a fuck about it, he doesn’t talk to me anyway, you know what I mean? He’s a teenager for God’s sake, he doesn’t care. But it bugs me, that I’m not home for his birthday. I don’t even live with him, so the chances are, he’ll probably be out with his mates, getting pissed somewhere. So, he wouldn’t want me hanging around anyway, but it doesn’t stop you feeling bad about it. But part and parcel of what you do as a musician is play your music to people. What you do as a DJ is travel and play your music to people. That’s what it gives you. Someone said to me, “Do you want to come to Brazil? Do you want to go to America? Do you want to go to Canada?” I went, “Fucking right I do, yeah. Come on.” That’s what I’ve done all my life, really. I’ve toured all my life. When I don’t do it, I get ratty. AUDIENCE MEMBER Did you guys always work with a manager? Early on? PETER HOOK With a manager. AUDIENCE MEMBER Yeah, when you first started out. PETER HOOK Yeah, what happened with our manager was that we decided that our manager, or maybe he decided, I can’t remember now, was as important as the rest of us and, to my mind, 30 years later, we made a mistake and we gave our manager 20% of the publishing. Which you shouldn’t do, for the simple reason that you can give him the publishing without it coming out of your publishing. You can give it as a commission. So because we were all in it together, and we did go through a lot together, I mean, the guy’s dead now, so we gave him 20% of the publishing, the manager. I don’t know any other band that’s done that. AUDIENCE MEMBER But was it quite early on that you started working… PETER HOOK It was very early on, yeah. You wouldn’t do it now, let’s put it that way. Not for any reason. With management and agents. The hardest thing to find in the world is a good manager, right? because when it comes down to it, experience will give you the ability to deal with people when you go and do things like this, or when you go and do things like when I go and DJ in a club. I have the ability to deal with people, but when you don’t have to do that bit, you can concentrate on the bit you do best. AUDIENCE MEMBER Yeah. Peter Hook Music and all that bit, it’s a fantastic release, but I would have to say that finding a manager is the most difficult thing in the world, I find, as a musician. AUDIENCE MEMBER Yeah. PETER HOOK I’ve bought more fucking sports cars for tossers than anybody I know. And they get the advance, walk off with their 20%. “See my new car?” And they do naff all for you and you end up sacking them. I must have sacked loads and loads of managers. My view of management is, if you’ve got a great band, it’s very, very difficult to fuck up. AUDIENCE MEMBER Yeah. PETER HOOK If you’ve got a shit band, then you need a fucking great manager. AUDIENCE MEMBER But it’s that point where, like you were saying, if you’re trying to balance all those things at once, it becomes difficult because it starts to take away from the music… PETER HOOK It’s impossible. As a group, we try to manage ourselves and it’s impossible. It really does your head in because there’s only a certain amount of rejection you can take. It just does your head in… the way I look at it, you’d have to decide for yourselves if it was even worth thinking about. If some guy comes to you, he’s got passion, he’s got intensity, then it’s worth giving it a go. But you’ve got a way up on the other hand. What we need, really, is a school for managers, because musicians tend to make music quite naturally, correct me if I’m wrong, quite easily, and management is a real art. I’ve been in record companies when I was on Polydor with Monaco. Monaco sacked all the bands that had shit managers. Not musical. They just simply sacked the bands that had shit managers. Which was nearly all of them, as it happened. They kept Ian Brown because his manager was good. It can be that important that you’ve a good manager, but it is like throwing a dart at a dart board. AUDIENCE MEMBER So generally, since you first began, the whole booking side of things, all that, was generally… you had someone that was taking care of that? Or you did a lot of that when you first started? PETER HOOK It was done very much by word of mouth when I started, you know? A lot of the punk gigs you did as favors. The second gig we ever did, we supported The Adverts and Penetration in Newcastle, and the reason we got that gig was because we’d done a gig with Penetration the night before and they said, “We’re doing a gig tomorrow, why don’t you come down and play?” And you did a lot of that. You had to put your hand in your pocket. You had to pay for petrol. We slept in the van overnight, it was fucking hell. It was terrible. Freezing. But that’s what you had to do to get to the position where you’re getting paid to do gigs. It does come down to your music, doesn’t it? If you’re music’s good and you believe in it, then you just carry on. The interesting thing about musicians is that they will carry on – a lot of them, blatantly, when they’re getting nowhere, but if you meet the guy, he’s still at it. You look at somebody like Baby Bird, I was a great fan of, and I was really shocked to discover that Baby Bird had put out eight LPs before he had a hit album. It does always surprise you. Someone like James Blunt even had done… he’s done a few albums that got nowhere before he had it. As a musician, it’s in you, that doggedness, I suppose, to keep going, thinking that you’re all right when everybody else thinks you’re shit. It’s like that, innit? It’s a very, very difficult thing. We got an award in England from the publishing, PRS, don’t know what it is in Australia, what it’s called, but it’s one of those, “We’re glad you’re still alive” awards. “Twenty-five years on, well done, lads.” And the guy who was head of the PRS was talking about musicians and he was talking about the amount of revenue that the PRS take in. It’s an unbelievable amount of money, your Paul McCartneys and everybody, they collect it all and give it out. And he was saying that in England, out of the whole population of England, there was only 2,000 musicians that earn enough to make it their primary job. AUDIENCE MEMBER Wow… PETER HOOK When you see the queues for [X Factor] and [Pop Idol], you’d think it was 20 million of us that were earning enough money. AUDIENCE MEMBER That’s good to know. PETER HOOK Well, I hope it doesn’t depress you, but you could be 2,001, couldn’t you? I was shocked at that. I thought, “Fucking hell, it’s so few of us that make a living out of it.” It really surprised me. AUDIENCE MEMBER I’m a DJ so I was not really offended by your [comments], but I wanted to ask you about DJing because you talked about the compromising within the band. What do you feel like when you stand in front of an audience playing records? Do you think that you should compromise with your audience? PETER HOOK I’m a little different as a DJ because I’m what’s termed a celebrity DJ which in England a lot of the time, considering there’s me, Sean Ryder, Bez, Mani that do it, it’s a lot of people come along to have a look at the old geezer that was in a band. “Oh, he was in the Stone Roses, let’s go and see what he does” or whatever. Do you know what mean? There’s that aspect to it. When you get there and play, that’s when you either stand or fall, don’t you? Either people enjoy what you do or they don’t enjoy what you do. That is the art of it. So I come in it and saw a different thing as a DJ. I don’t think you should compromise because I was saying to my learned friend here earlier that it makes you make mistakes. I have things that I do, parameters that I work with and I know what makes me happy, what I think keeps the intensity up, what I think is a good song, but I’ve fallen on my arse many a time. You can’t… one of the great things, I suppose, about what you do is that it’s always exciting like being hit with a crushed up Red Bull can when I walked on and played my first song at Parklife on Saturday. I was like, “This could be interesting,” and then you carry on and play. You pick yourself up and you have to get on with it, don’t you? I find when I compromise, I make balls of it, and they’re not happy and I’m not happy. So, what I’d rather have at the end of a night is, as much as I hate to say it, I’d rather have me happy than anybody else because it’s me that has to do the traveling. My mate was telling me that Armand Van Helden was telling him that he DJs for free, he said. He said, “They pay me to travel and hang around in airports and sit on planes and stuff like that,” which I suppose it’s hard and you’ve got to be true to yourself. Maybe it comes to the point where you sort of do it subconsciously. I was telling him that I played in Wellington, and I play a lot of dance remixes and New Order stuff and I play a bit of punk and stuff, two halves, and people hated the dance bit because it was an indie club. Nobody told me they just booked me and I tell them what I play and you just go and do it. The promoter panicked because they were leaving because they weren’t drinking. He said to my guy who booked me to take me off. “Bring him off. Get him off.” The guy really upset me because I’m playing, and he’s like “You’ve got to get off now” and I’m going, “Fuck, you told me two-and-half hours, what are you fucking talking about?” And he’s going “no, no” and I’m going “what are you talking about?” and all the punters are screaming at me “Play ‘Blue Monday,’ play ‘Blue Monday’!” Fuck you. Ruined it. I said, “What the fuck’s going on now?” Anyway, I just went into the indie part then with my set and the promoter must have thought, “Oh that’s all right, he’s playing indie now, we’ll forget him,” so the guy never came back. So, I’m like, “Where’s that fucker gone? Where’s he gone? What’s going on here? What’s going on?” I finished my set, went backstage, he was asleep on the couch. I said, “What the fuck are you doing winding me up like that?” It’s going to happen, isn’t it? AUDIENCE MEMBER Well, that’s a very good explanation, I think. I wanted to ask you as well about “Blue Monday,” because it’s turned up in so many places, like you said. All different genres of… PETER HOOK Remixes… AUDIENCE MEMBER Yeah, but as well, the original, like in different regions in hip-hop DJ sets, all over the world. When you made it, did you intend to do a danceable record or was it just out of inspiration? PETER HOOK We started off with… the inspiration for “Blue Monday” came from a bass drum riff that Bernard had heard on a Donna Summer B-side. And we used that and created the track around that. Then he wanted to do and oom-pah-oom-pah-oom-pah that he’d heard on a Sylvester record. And we put that together with the drum riff using a DMX Mark II. We used a Transcendent Sequencer that he’d built himself, firing at Prophet Five, and you used to have to do it in the old binary code, you know, with the off and ons, so if you made a mistake, you had to go right back to the start and start the whole thing again. And “Blue Monday” was 10 minutes long. It drove us absolutely insane because if you made a mistake eight minutes you had to go back to the top and program off, on, off, on, on, off, off, on, on for every single thing right to the end. It was absolutely mind-boggling the way you did it. The interesting thing about “Blue Monday” was we’d written it and we were over the moon with it. We thought it was great which is quite unusual really because a lot of the time you have self-doubt and Steve, our drummer, is quite a weird character. He’s very eccentric, very English. He always likes to program in the most inaccessible spots, and in this case, it was using a kettle lead that was about that long, so the DMX was under a chair and he was on the floor programming it. And we were going, “Fucking bring it up!” “No, no, it’s all right. I’m fine here.” And he’s programming away. And we’d done it, we’d done this drum track, we had the sequence tracked on it, and he got up and he went to the toilet and he pulled the kettle lead out and dumped the whole drum program. And then we had to plug the lead back in and start programming it while we remembered the riffs. And it was never the same. It was always the one that got away. You know when the one that dumps, it’s always the one that got away. The mix that you’ve not got is the one. It was like that. For us, it was ruined right from the word go because we’d lost the one and we had to put up with this rewritten drum track. But no, you never do, do you? I’m fucking sick to death of “Blue Monday,” to be honest. Every time it starts off I go, “Aw, fuck.” It’s like “Wild Thing” from The Troggs. And yet, people love it. I always say to Bernard when we play, “Why don’t we leave it off?” And he’s always, “I’m fucking sick of doing it.” Well, leave it out then? “Can’t do that, people won’t like it.” Which is about the only time he thinks of the people, mind. You get in that position. When I play, I use a remix of “Blue Monday…” if you want to hear it… that I like. For obvious reasons, it’s a lot different. (music: New Order – “Blue Monday” (unknown remix) PETER HOOK Yeah, so a kid did that as a remix. Sent it to us to OK and it didn’t come out. It’s never come out so I’m the only one that’s got it and it makes me really happy, and he says “Oh give me that dead fast one” and I’m like, “No. It’s just mine.” AUDIENCE MEMBER Bit of a fan question. I used to buy your 12-inch releases in the 80s and I loved your bass sound. I’d buy True Faith or Bizarre Love Triangle because I wanted to hear more of the song and, in particular, your bass. So I’d race out, get the 12 inch, bring it home, throw it on, listen, wait, wait, wait. No bass. PETER HOOK So was I… AUDIENCE MEMBER Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was this the compromise that you were talking about earlier? PETER HOOK No, I used to go fucking mad about it. Call them every… Shep Pettibone was a complete, absolute tosser. In my eyes, everybody else was. In that, as I was saying before, there was a swing towards electric instruments. They didn’t want any acoustic instruments so, when they did a remix, it was electronic. And of course, I, as a bass player, I hated it. And I used to say to Bernard, “Well how would you feel if they left your vocal off?” And he’d go, “Well, they don’t, though, do they?” [laughs] AUDIENCE MEMBER OK. That was a real disappointment to me, and I’ve wanted to ask you that question for 20 years. PETER HOOK As much as a disappointment as it was to me. But it’s funny now, because it’s now changed that now they use the bass loads. Sometimes in a remix, they’ll use a lot of bass that we didn’t use on the track, which is one of the nice things about the remix these days. With all the tracks you get on computers. I sound so old, but in the old days, 24 tracks, you really had to compromise what you put down, so when you did a remix, it was limited things. Nowadays, because you’ve got limitless tracks, your remixes have got a lot more to play with, which is quite interesting. But you still make mistakes. I hated what Stuart Price did on the last record of New Order’s. I hated the mixes that he did for us, and I was really looking forward to the remixes. When they did the remixes, it came back with no bass on it. Really, really limited amount of bass. So what I did was, I went down, when I found out what they’d done, the record company had sent the parts of Stuart Price’s mix to be remixed and not the parts of New Order’s. I went fucking berserk, and then fucking blow me down, they do it on the next record as well… AUDIENCE MEMBER That’s peculiar, because to my mind, anyways, the really unique being about the sound of the music over. PETER HOOK I agree with you. You’re preaching to the converted here, mate… AUDIENCE MEMBER Can I ask you a second question in relation to that, though? because it happens to me a lot, if I play the music and someone goes like, “Oh yeah, it sounds like The Cure basslines.” AUDIENCE MEMBER Ironically, the people ripping you off never really bothered me. What really bothered me about The Cure is when I saw the guy, and he was playing like me, which actually annoyed me more than him sounding like me, if that makes any sense. “You bastard!” I don’t mind people ripping you off because when I start writing, or when we start writing, we generally try and rip someone off. “Oh, let’s do a Kraftwerk one. Let’s rip Kraftwerk off.” And I think the skill in it, and the art in it is when you finish, and it doesn’t sound like Kraftwerk. But you’ve used it as a step. We got sued by John Denver for a track called “Run” that he said sounded like “Leaving on a Jet Plane.” And I have yet to be… if anyone can play me that track and then play me… and I’ve done it. It does not sound, to me like “Leaving on a Jet Plane.” But they have these people called musicologists that analyze it and then decide whether it’s there, and that’s a legal decision. So we had an American musicologist for John, it seems John Denver employs somebody to listen to all music, to see if anyone’s ripping him off, like he’s not got enough money, or didn’t have enough money at that point anyway. And they found us. And the musicologist said, “It sounds like John Denver, eight notes out of 12.” Somehow, they use it to do it. So we thought, “Ha ha, we’ll get an English musicologist and he’ll prove that it doesn’t sound like it.” And he did it as well, and he said, “Yeah, it does,” and we had to give John Denver 20%. It does happen but we don’t do it. You all do it as a band. Our stand is that if people rip you off, there’ve been bands like The Cure, where my mother has even said to me, “That sounds like you, Peter.” You know, “The Walk” and “In Between Days” and stuff like that. But I take it as a compliment. Maybe it’s something you save for your retirement. AUDIENCE MEMBER Are you actually, you are involved in the soundtrack for the new film? PETER HOOK Yeah, we got the footage last week actually, yeah. So we are doing it, yeah. There’s not a lot of time in it because of the film to set the period uses a lot of period music from ’76, ’77, ’78 so they don’t need… so it’s not going to be like a soundtrack album. There’s going to be some of it, but not a great deal. AUDIENCE MEMBER G’day. I was just wondering how many basses you’ve got and if you’ve got like a favorite or anything? PETER HOOK I don’t really… I never really got into collecting guitars, and I never really… to me, it was just a means to an end. I used one bass guitar on every New Order LP, which is a BB 1200-S Yamaha, and I’ve never found anything that for me sounds better than that. So, I have one of those. I waited six years to get another, and I had two then, so I had the spare and about six months ago… I’d never seen another one ever… and about six months ago I was doing a gig in Toronto and this kid brought one up for me to sign that he just bought, and I took it off him and wouldn’t give him back. Gave him $1,000 for it. Got the guy to show him the door. No, I didn’t. Swapped him one, actually. I use the BB 1200-S for studio. Live, I saw, I can’t remember what group it was, I think it was The Alarm and they used a Gibson EB-O 2, which is a semi-acoustic bass and I really liked the look of it. It’s one of the only guitars I’ve actually liked the look of, so I thought, “Oh, I like that,” and I got one and it was terrible because it was medium scale. It was impossible to tune. It was really unreliable. It was just a crap guitar. I got a guy in Cornwall called Chris Eccleshall to build me a copy using Yamaha electrics and a Yamaha… because I’ve got very small hands… I prefer a small neck. A narrow neck so I can’t use Fenders or anything like that. Rickenbackers. I like a Yamaha neck so he rips off a Yamaha neck, straight through long scale with Yamaha electrics done as a semi-acoustic, which is the one that I play hot, ones that I play live. And he sold a lot of them I was quite surprised. He sold 276 of those old guitars which he calls the Peter Hook Bass Guitar which I was quite pleased about that. I like that. Don’t get any money off it. Anybody else? Can I go home now? TOBY LAING Maybe that is enough for now. Thank you very much, Peter. [applause]

Phonte
Hailing from Durham, North Carolina Little Brother heralded a new wave of early 2000s rap acts with a clear debt to the likes of A Tribe Called Quest, Public Enemy and De La Soul whom they saw as big brothers to their own musical aspirations. Composed of producer 9th Wonder and rappers Big Pooh and Phonte, the group’s 2003 debut album, The Listening, instantly put them on the map just as a different kind of Southern hip-hop sound was rising to dominance. Soon after the group moved from the independent ABB Records to Atlantic where they released The Minstrel Show, continuing the critical acclaim but falling foul of commercial expectations.
In this lecture at the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy, Phonte talks about how the group stood out like a sore thumb in their local scene, breaking through on the Internet with famous fans such as The Roots and Pete Rock and the dangers of making it and believing your own hype.
Hosted by Jeff Mao Our guest this afternoon is a member of the group Little Brother. They are one of the finest groups creating what he himself describes as hip-hop. Phonte Coleman That’s a touching intro, brother. Jeff Mao He is not the official producer of the group, but he has a little something to do with the direction of the sound they come up with. Join me please in welcoming Mr. Phonte Coleman. [Applause] Phonte Coleman Thank y’all. Y’all far too kind. We’re going to keep it live in here today. We’re not going to do the same old dry lecture, we’re going to get into some things, we’re going to keep it popping. This is how it’s going down, we’re going to give it to you raw, nigga. Going to keep it real. This is how it’s going down tonight. I wore my darkest-colored shirt, so you niggas would see me. I’m actually honored to be here, I’m actually a big fan of the Red Bull Music Academy, it’s like the equivalent of being Inside The Actor’s Studio for rap music and shit. Jeff Mao Yes, it is. That would make me James Lipton, something I’ve always aspired to be. So, Phonte tell me, where are you from originally and where is the group from? Phonte Coleman I’m from Greensboro, North Carolina. The group is from a city called Durham. Durham is a relatively mid-sized town. Jeff Mao What’s that area known for? Phonte Coleman Durham is known for basketball. Any basketball fans or ACC basketball fans, like Duke, Carolina? Jeff Mao We’ve got Carolina over here. Phonte Coleman Oh, yeah! It isn’t really known for much though – basketball, tobacco, medicine – that’s pretty much it. And colleges, it’s a college town. Jeff Mao So, you attended college in Durham. Phonte Coleman Yeah, I was at college in Durham, North Carolina Central University, which is an historically black college, an HBCU, which is a term that means “historically black colleges and universities.” Now, what those are, are colleges mainly in the South, founded mainly for black people. At the end of slavery there were a lot of grants from the government that were started for black kids to be able to go to school. There are still some left today, quite a few left, but I give it about ten, 15 more years. I don’t know how much longer they’re going to be standing. Jeff Mao So, the group started out of NCCU, is that correct? Phonte Coleman NCCU. Jeff Mao And who are the other members of the group, for those who might not be aware? Phonte Coleman The other members, because obviously we sell millions of records, are MC Pooh and the producer 9th Wonder. A lot of you might know 9th, he did “The Threat” for Jay-Z, he did Destiny’s Child “Girl,” “Is She The Reason,” and then God’s Stepson, the Nas remix album. Jeff Mao The group is from North Carolina. What was the environment like for you guys coming out with the sound you did in North Carolina? Phonte Coleman For us, we were an anomaly, like the black sheep, I guess. For those of you who may not be familiar with the South, it’s diverse, but not as diverse as BET or MTV would let you to believe. Pretty much the sound coming out right now is the heavy 808, the crunk or snap music. For me, Pooh and 9th to be coming out with some early-’90s throwback shit was, like, wow! It was a good and bad thing. It was good in the way it got us a look we wouldn’t have got otherwise, but it was bad – and I actually wrote a blog about this – but it was like a backhanded compliment, like a way of people saying, “You know, you’re pretty cute for a fat girl,” or if a motherfucker told you, “For a black guy, you’re pretty smart.” So, for us it was, “They’re spitting for people from the South.” What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Is everyone in the South barely functioning illiterates and shit? The good thing was if we had been from a Brooklyn or LA or whatever, everybody would have been like, “Aight, whatever.” But the bad thing, at least the way I took it, was on some backhanded compliment shit, like, “Ooh, You speak so well.” But it got people talking, it got me here, so I ain’t mad. Jeff Mao You guys are really a product of this age and era, in that you got some notoriety before you signed a deal. Can you explain how that came about, who championed you? Phonte Coleman Initially our buzz was on the Internet. I was a big fan of the website Okayplayer – that’s The Roots, Common, Mos [Def]. I was mainly a big Roots fan. I used to go the site just to discuss music… When we started making our music, we put one of our songs on there just to get some honest opinion on it. As a lot of you know, the Internet is good because you can get an unbiased opinion on your stuff, because everybody’s a tough guy on the Internet. I learned that once I started meeting the actual chatroom users. On the net, they’d be, “That shit was wack, that shit was horrible, fuck that shit!” And then you meet them in person and it’s, [meekly] “Hi, I’m B-Boy78 on Okayplayer.” [Laughter] “What happened to you? Didn’t get enough hugs as a child?” The Internet can be a funny thing, everybody’s a keyboard thug. But we put the joint out there and it got a good response. The first song, we did was called “Whatever You Say”, and we put it up there and
it ended up getting crazy downloads. I guess, we were like the Tila Tequila of Okayplayer. This was before MySpace had jumped off. And that was how it jumped off. We got a call from
Questlove from The Roots, he championed the group and came out saying he loved it. Pete Rock was a fan. Pete Rock was actually the reason I quit my job. We started getting props from a lot of places, people that I grew up listening to. It was all breath-taking, man. Jeff Mao What were Pete Rock’s words of encouragement and what was your job? Phonte Coleman I had a job at Belt, a department store. I don’t know what the Australian equivalent would be, but they sell shirts and tops, china and all that shit. I was working in the Tommy Hilfiger section, selling polos, and I called home to check my messages one day and there was this message going, “Yo, yo, yo, yo, what’s going on, Phonte? This is Chocolate Boy Wonder Pete Rock. Your album is crazy, classic. Yo, I’ve got to get you on this album, son. Peace.”[Looks blank] I had to listen to it again. Beep. “Yo, yo, yo, yo, what’s going on, Phonte? This is Chocolate Boy Wonder Pete Rock. Your album is crazy, classic. Yo, I’ve got to get you on this album, son. Peace.” Beep. [Laughter] I’m not going to lie, there are a lot of people – oh, shit, [knocks microphone]. Let me move my ice out the way – the ice in my teeth keep my Cristal cold. I’ve been through a lot of shit, I’ve seen my children born, but when Pete Rock called me that was the first time I actually came close to fainting. At the risk of sounding like a groupie, fuck that, but I had Pete Rock calling my house, man. It was at that moment I realized I didn’t want to work no more. [Laughter] It was around the holidays and in the States we have Black Monday, it’s basically the Monday after Thanksgiving and that’s the busiest shopping day of the year, shit is insane. I’m talking about motherfuckers lined up outside Toys R Us. [Points to something in the room / laughter] That’s why I’ve never done this shit, this is some new shit, it’s so provocative. Anyway, Black Monday, I was supposed to work and I just didn’t go. They were like, “Phonte, we need you.” But this was six in the morning, six in the morning and I had to be there at five to open the store. “Who the fuck is buying Tommy Hilfiger sweatshirts at six in the morning? Are you fucking crazy? I’m gone, you niggas will never see me again.” I just didn’t show up. It was just a leap of faith, I had my rent due, but something told me to step out on faith, and I just did it and it paid off. [Applause] Jeff Mao So, that was after Little Brother’s first LP came out. So, after Okayplayer and Questlove’s attention, you got the deal with ABB [Records]. Tell us a bit about the reception to the album. Obviously, some of your heroes gave you positive feedback, but if you could talk about the Internet, getting an honest response, and the idea of buzz, of hype. Phonte Coleman Hmmm, buzz, hype… The key thing I’d say to everybody in here, no matter what your skill is, don’t believe your own hype. A lot of the time, as artists, you live in an echo chamber and you’re around like-minded artists, so a lot of the time you’ll hear, “Oh, this is dope.” You hear it all the time, so that creates a false sense of security in yourself and in your art. You think, “Damn! Maybe I am really that next shit?” It might be justified, not saying it’s not, but all of us we are not the norm, we do not represent the tastes of the vast majority of people. I mean, yeah, we’re geniuses and we create and expand the limits. But we’re not the motherfuckers voting on American Idol or buying Now That’s What I Call Music Volume 40. Those are the masses. You’re feeling me? A lot of times when you’re on the Internet and you’re reading journalists and there’s all this praise about you, you kind of start to believe your own hype. And if there’s a lesson to be learned from the Little Brother saga, moving from ABB, which is an indie to Atlantic, which is a major, that would be the lesson learned – don’t believe your own hype. The Listening came out and it was “a breath of fresh air,” we were getting four mics in The Source, write-ups in XXL, we’re going on tours and everyone is toting you as the next big thing. Then you make the move to a major and it’s like, “OK, we’ve got a fan base, we’ve got this, we’ve got that. We should be good to go, we’re going to take over the world.” Then the first week sales notice came out and it’s, [pretends to make a phone call] “Hi, this is Phonte. I know I quit but I was wondering if there are any openings in the Tommy section. I heard you got the new fall line in and I wanted to help you out with that.” It was a wake-up call, going from our first record, which was The Listening, which got tons of critical acclaim and buzz, then moving to a major label for our second album, The Minstrel Show, which got the same critical acclaim and buzz, but… we believed the hype. Jeff Mao Let me ask you something before we even jump into that. Was there any hesitance on any of the group’s part even to go towards Atlantic? I mean… I know everybody wants to reach more people that are like-minded, expand their audience, but was there any consideration taken of that? I remember there’s a lyric on The Minstrel Show where you say, “I had cats telling me I shouldn’t rhyme / To drop an album that people couldn’t find.” Tell me a little bit about the sort of environment being on ABB and the decision to go from there to Atlantic. Phonte Pretty much, man, we started out on an indie label, ABB, and the good thing about indie labels, which some of you may have worked out already, may be familiar, indie is a good thing because they say, “You can do whatever you want. We are all about the artist, we are all about the art and the art of the art! You can do what you want!” Then it’s like, “OK, well, pay me.” “Well, that’s, uh, we don’t do that, don’t be having money for that yet, but this the art.” That’s the kind of give-and-take of the indie situation. The money may not be crazy, but you can do whatever you want to do. Now, the flipside about that is that on a major label, yeah, the money is better, but at that point you’re kind of controlled by corporate interests. It’s safe to say, if you name your album The Minstrel Show, that chances are you’re kind of going to cut yourself off from a lot of things. Pretty much, from ABB, it was Benny B, he’s from Oakland and he still runs the label. We still stay in contact, we still do business, and we actually brought him on in our Atlantic deal to handle our vinyl, because we still thought it was a good point for us to keep that grassroots connection. Being with the indie is just kind of like, on an indie label, if I bring the album to my indie label on Monday in January, Tuesday in March we can have it out on sale. Major label, I bring it to the label on a Monday in 2005, y’all might not see it till damn ’07, ’08, ’06 at best. It’s a lot more red tape, so that was something that we kind of had to get used to, because it was like, on an indie, it’s just go. Like, “Yo, you want to press this up? Let’s do it!” “Yo, I just finished this on my laptop last night, nigga, let’s get it out!” “Ooh, word up, let’s do it!” On the majors, it’s like, “Yo, we got this song, we think it’s wonderful!” “Yeah, uh, I don’t hear a single, yeah, just take that back. Work on that some more.” It’s a different ball game. I can honestly say… We were talking last night, I can honestly say that I would not have wished it to go any other way. I’m glad that things happened the way they did with our second album, because looking back in my life and just where I was, I honestly can’t say.… I can honestly sit here in front of all of y’all and say that I was not ready for a hit record. I just wasn’t. Jeff Mao Explain what transpired with the second album, what was the concept of it? It was called The Minstrel Show, maybe you can explain what it means and the concept of the album and how that might have affected things? Phonte Coleman Are any of you familiar with what the term means? It refers back to a form of American entertainment that took place in the late 1800s, early 1900s and it was a form of American entertainment when you had black people dressing themselves up in black face and performing for a white audience. Now, it was pretty much one of the crude, most racist forms of entertainment, but it also served to form a base for most forms of entertainment in the US. Out of that came vaudeville, which brought the modern theater, which pretty much got us here today. There’s a lot I can say about that, but you’re pretty much dealing with an art form, which involved black people playing out black stereotypes for a white audience. “Yeah, of course, black people are dumb. Look at them shucking and jiving and shit.” Everyone understand that, does it makes sense? So, to link that to current-day hip-hop, it was just me thinking about where the music was going and a lot of stuff I was hearing. Hip-hop was just doing the same thing. Instead of being an instrument for positivity, telling people they’re beautiful and to build them up, it was destructive and there were a lot of images we were seeing around the time, that were kind of, “Damn! Enough is enough.” I like 50 Cent and Lil’ Jon as much as anybody else, but at the time there wasn’t really a balance of anything else being heard on the radio. If you’re going to play 50 Cent 40 times, then play Oddisee 20 times. Just counterbalance it out a little bit. That was the concept of the album and it was a parallel to our careers. We were three rappers signed to a major network called UBN, which is U Black Niggaz Network, and they sign to this network and put on this show called The Minstrel Show. So, on the album every song served as a musical sketch, it was set up like an episode of Saturday Night Live. You can tell by the way I’m explaining that it sounds quite crazy, so when we gave it to Atlantic they said, “We love it, it’s great. The way you’ve put it together is wonderful, but we don’t hear a single.” My thing with radio, particularly for artists like us – I don’t get to travel abroad too often, so I don’t know elsewhere – but there’s no place for artists like us on urban radio. It’s not going to fucking happen, not in a million years. In urban radio, and in entertainment in general and entertainment, period, the law is to appeal to the lowest common denominator, to appeal to peoples’ most basic interest. So if the No 1 song in the country is some motherfucker spelling A-B-C-D, then anything above that doesn’t stand a chance. Often you’ll hear people in radio saying, “We’re just giving the people what they want.” That’s something I’ve always questioned because you have to look at the people in relation to the media which people they’re speaking of. It’s not you and I, it’s fucking kids, seriously. I’m not talking teenagers, like 16. I’m talking nine-, ten-year-olds. Someone in the business told me once, “If my five-year-old can sing it, it’s a hit.” That made sense. I’m all for repetition, recall, let people sing along. Nobody wants to hear a song they can’t sing, I understand that, but if you’re using a five-year-old to dictate the tastes of the adult American public, shit, five-year-olds watch Barney! In the case of artists like Little Brother, I think radio is pretty much over … you can’t try to take a person who’s been fed verbal baby food all their life and then put a steak in front of them be like, “OK, eat that.” They can’t process it, it’s too foreign for them. Jeff Mao You say you’ve no regrets about how being on a major label transpired, but do you think maybe you were a little naive going into it? Phonte Coleman Actually, I should’ve been more naive. Going from an indie, we had a lot of distribution problems, we’d be getting calls going, “Yo, man! I love your record but I can’t find it. I’m in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and I can’t find it.” So, when we went to Atlantic we were like, “OK, we’ve got the machine behind us, they’re going to give us the push, it’s going down.” No, it didn’t go down. In retrospect, I think I should’ve been more naïve, a little more jaded, more cautious. My philosophy is: You never know until you try. I’d much rather make a decision and then look back and be, “Damn! I fucked up,” than wondering what could’ve happened. “What if we’d done this, what if we’d done that, we could have made it, I could’ve been the greatest nigga.” It’s better to just take the chance, take the hit. Just man the fuck up. In retrospect, I’m happy we made the decision to sign to Atlantic because it armed me with so much more knowledge of how this business really works. Jeff Mao If there’s folks who’s not familiar with the music of the group, maybe there’s something that you want to play? If there’s any stuff that you want to play from the group, anything… Phonte I could play a couple jams. Jeff Mao Just to give an idea of what type of stuff they actually create. Phonte I’ll make it quick. I’m going to give y’all the Little Brother megamix. I think this is the one that’s [music plays and stops]… Yeah. We got the slow joint on here. This is actually the first song that we ever recorded. It’s called “Speed,” and this is a song that was basically just us talking about our lives at that time. We were all working jobs, trying to figure out how we was going to work jobs and still make our music, you know what I’m saying? You’d be up in the studio until like five in the morning, and got to be at work at seven, you know? It was kind of a rough time in our life. It was a bittersweet time, looking back on it, and listening to this shit now, it sounds so young and shit. Maybe I’ll do it, like you listen back on some of your shit and be like, “God, I was so young,” and you sound so naïve and shit, you just thought your art was going to change the world and then you just get fucking crushed [laughs]. “Fuck yo dreams, nigga!” This is the first song we ever recorded. It’s called “Speed,” and this is me singing the hook on this. (music: Little Brother – “Speed” / applause) From that same album, this was the first song that we put up on Okayplayer that got us the buzz or whatever. The buzz… This one’s called “Whatever You Say.” This is a song that actually... There’s a saying that artists are often the worst critics of our own work, and I kind of believe that’s true sometimes, because this was a song that, once we did it, we finished it and it was just like, “OK, all right, cool.” Album cut. “All right, cool.” We just threw it up on the Internet and people went crazy about it, and it was like, “Damn, really?” Then, on the other hand, you’ll have that song that you spend hours on, and you feel like it’s just your life’s... your all-encompassing pain and struggle, and motherfuckers be like, “OK, yeah, that was aight. That shit was cool, man!” You never know how shit can go, and that’s kind of the beautiful thing about art, is you really know, anybody that says they know they have a hit, they fucking lying. It’s been stuff that, I’m sure you’ve been in situations when you’ve heard some shit and you be like, “Word up, I think this is it.” You have that feeling, but at the end of the day nobody really knows, man. Nobody knows. This is a song, “Whatever You Say.” This was the first song that we put up on the Internet that kicked off our buzz or whatever. (music: Little Brother – “Whatever You Say” / applause) Thank you. That was the first joint we put up and people really reacted to it, it kinda surprised all of us. Jeff Mao One of the things that struck me when I first heard your music is there’s a certain ease in the way you do what you do. There’s a soulfulness that is, or was, refreshing. I guess, it’s an intangible thing – and if you have it, you have it, if you don’t, you don’t – but can you articulate why that’s there with you guys? Phonte Coleman A lot of it just has to do with us being from the South. For those of you who may not be familiar with the American South, the North – Boston, New York, Philly – it’s a faster pace: go, go, go, whereas in the South things are a lot calmer, quieter and you have time to think. I can open my door and see birds and see the sky, it’s refreshing. The thing that made Little Brother work was the fact that we were coming from a region that had no musical precedents and really wasn’t a music city. So you got away with getting into your own zone and doing your own shit. You don’t have to worry about your A&R man and random motherfuckers getting up in your shit. You can just do your shit in your zone, hone it, perfect it, nurture it. And then, when it’s ready, take it into the outside world. In one of the bigger music markets you’re under the microscope from the jump, so from the conception of your career you’re trying to keep up with the Joneses. Then also, I was talking about this with Waajeed, the cost of living in North Carolina is very low, so when you know your mortgage ain’t too expensive, you can hold your dick a little bit. “Fuck y’all! I ain’t doing that shit, I ain’t selling out, I’ll never sell out.” You can afford to do it because, you know, if I just make $1,200 this month, I’m good. But in the North, that isn’t happening, you’ve got to make that money. I think that’s what it is, the ease of the South, the slow pace, just the conversational nature of the South. People in the South are known for our honesty, our warmth, I guess, and we try to articulate that as much as possible. Jeff Mao Now, when you guys are in the studio you’re not the official producer of the group – 9th Wonder is the musical producer of the group – can you describe what the process is like for coming up with compositions and concepts and structuring the songs, because you also do other vocals besides your rhyming? Phonte Coleman In the studio I’m a producer but not a beat-maker. Though, I guess, you could say I’m a producer in the Quincy Jones sense, getting people together, mapping things out, sequencing – more organizational. For me, it starts with the track. Me and Pooh will do the track, sit down, start with some concepts. I’d say 90 to 95% of the time, I come up with the hooks. A lot of times I may write a hook but Pooh’s voice sounds better saying it, so it’s, “I’ll write something but you say it.” That’s pretty much how it works. Once we get into the studio, that’s when the production happens, putting it all together, making it all make sense, that’s pretty much where I’ll come in. Jeff Mao Do you want to play any examples of the stuff you sing on? Phonte Coleman Yeah, aight. Yeah, I’ve got some shit. If there weren’t cameras rolling, I’d play it. We’ve got some singing, the “Phonte sings in the shower” album. Jeff Mao Or even the song that was a surprise for you guys. Phonte Coleman This is the song. Rewind [rewinds record]. Y’all still with me? This is a project I did called the Foreign Exchange, with my homeboy Nicolay. The way we did this record was, we did it all completely over the internet, this was back in ’04. Essentially, he’s a producer I met from the Netherlands and I loved his tracks and I was like, “When are we going to start doing stuff together?” He said, “Cool!” We started trading some files and we had a whole album. The name of the group is Foreign Exchange and the name of the album is Connected and this is one of the singles we put out off the Connected album. The name of the song is “Nic’s Groove.” This is me singing the hook, me and this chick named Rhonda Wimbush. (music: Foreign Exchange – “Nic’s Groove”) I don’t think I’m going to play this for you, man [fiddles with mixer]. I’m going to play this… (music: Zo! & Tigallo – “Steppin’ Out 08” / applause) I fuck with that shit. That’s the kind of shit, if you were working in a retail store and they’d have the AM rock station on, you’d hear all the white people’s songs, you’d learn to like that shit. You’d be like, “Damn! I’ll fuck with that shit, nigga… that Jessica Simpson shit is bangin’… [Sings falsetto] ‘Since You’ve Been Gone…’” You’ve got to listen to what they play. You got to listen to what they play. Joe Jackson “Steppin’ Out,” that’s one of my favorite AM songs, that shit is magic. Jeff Mao You sing on a good portion of things. Not everybody is able to do that. Can you go into your singing background? Phonte Coleman It’s always odd when I get compliments for my singing because I don’t consider myself a singer. I sing, but I don’t sang. There’s a difference between a singer and a sanger. I grew up on sangers, Luther [Vandross], Patti Labelle. They’re sanging. I can sing, but they would be sanging. With me it was in church. My grandmother was into the church, so Sunday morning comes around, you’ve got to go, whether you feel it’s justified or not. You couldn’t play sick. If you play sick in church, then you’ve got to be sick the whole day, so afterwards when your boys come to the door and you want to go out and play, “No, you’re sick. Go, lay down.” So, in church you’d sing in the choir, I’d do my little solos. And then the first form of music I actually got introduced to is R&B, I didn’t get into rap until I was seven or eight. When I was growing up the music my mother played was Luther, the early-’80s breakdance shit like Shannon “Let The Music Play,” Newcleus, that early-80s breakdancing and roller-skating shit. That was my start. Jeff Mao Ironically enough, the song you guys are internationally best known for is one with you singing on it. Phonte Coleman Yeah, the “Make Me Hot” one. Can we get a power plug? My laptop is losing power, I thought I had enough juice in it and I didn’t burn anything on CD. While he gets that out I’ll play you something. [Fiddles with mixer / music starts and stops] Jeff Mao Was that a surprise, because that was really just a skit on the album? Phonte Coleman The shit was a joke, literally. Basically, it was a joke track with me singing and a cat from the UK named Yam Who? took it and made a ten-minute megamix off that shit. It was long as hell, it was funny [sings] He did that shit for ten minutes, but when we come overseas cats would be like, “Appreciate that homie, appreciate that.” [To sound technician] What’s your name? We’ve got to get some texts. [Technician shouts “Glyn”] Give it up for Glyn everybody. [Applause] Wonderful job on the floor you guys, you guys make it happen, that’s why you make the big bucks. That’s you… no, not him, you… So, singing that shit, I just did it as a joke and my singer’s alter-ego name was Percy Miracles. I say it was, because now Percy is dead. Jeff Mao Percy’s dead? Phonte Coleman I ain’t told you about it? Ah shit! I thought you knew. Jeff Mao Well, play it anyway. Phonte Coleman I’ll tell you about it, then we’ll talk about the death of Percy. It’s not my singing that’s dead, just my character Percy. OK, let me go here, Little Brother. This is off our first album and basically it’s a joke track called “Make Me Hot.” Our producer 9th used to work with a lot of cats around the way and shit. Motherfuckers would come to the studio unprepared, not knowing what they wanted to do, and we called it the “Make Me Hot” syndrome. “What you want to sing about?” “I don’t know.” “What’s your hook?” “I don’t know. Just make me hot, man, just make it hot.” So I wrote a song about it, just joking, and it became a phenomenon. (music: Little Brother – “Make Me Hot” / applause) That was the spark of the Percy revolution. Percy was my alter-ego, an amalgamation of my favorite blues singers and all my old uncles. Percy’s first appearance was on The Listening, then when The Minstrel Show came around the album was set up like Saturday Night Live and Percy was my musical guest and so his song was called “Cheating,” which was my attempt at an R.Kelly/Ron Isley duet. Again, this is all just jokes and shit. So, this is “Cheating” from The Minstrel Show, Percy Miracles featuring Mr Diggs. (music: Little Brother – “Cheatin’” / applause) Jeff Mao Now, that’s not easy to do. Phonte Coleman It really is, man. Jeff Mao To simulate that type of R.Kelly track? Phonte Coleman It’s easier than you think, man. It really is. Jeff Mao To do it that precisely? Phonte Coleman Well, thank you, I appreciate that brother. Jeff Mao I always thought that could be released as a single. Phonte Coleman And that is why Percy’s dead, that’s why I had to kill him. It’s over. The thing is – and I wrote a blog about this on MySpace – the thing is we’re in a different day. Percy Miracles is someone I created to do the wild, crazy, stupid outlandish shit I like to do. So, I did the “Make Me Hot” shit, I did “Cheatin’,” and the funny thing is, after it was over I sat back and thought this was some of the most ignorant shit ever. That was supposed to illustrate the point of The Minstrel Show, of what music has kind of become. We did “Cheatin’,” and I’m thinking I have the ignorant crown, then two weeks later R.Kelly came out with “Trapped In the Closet.” Next to “Trapped In the Closet,” “Cheating” sounds like fucking Luther Vandross, it sounds just like a regular song. It was at that point I realized that was one. But it’s a hard line to do parody, particularly with black music and hip-hop and R&B, because very often it parodies itself. The thing about Percy is if motherfuckers don’t think it’s a joke, then the joke is on you. And I ain’t going out like that. Jeff Mao Otherwise, we would’ve invited Percy. Phonte Coleman Then Percy could’ve come. I don’t know if his visa is right, he had a couple of warrants out on him, couldn’t cross the border. But it’s a different era. You have kids now that... When we was coming up, “The Humpty Dance” was... we had our novelty records too. We had “Humpty Dance” and “Whoop (There It Is)” and we had those kind of fun novelty records too, but those were the exception. Nowadays, the novelty records are the rule, so I just decided it was just way too dangerous for me to play on trying to mock and trying to parody that stuff, because a lot of the shit on the radio now is a fucking parody. I had to be more responsible, I guess. Jeff Mao Let me ask you something, because just going off of the experience with Atlantic and everything, you had mentioned not slipping into the trap of being so-called the “angry rapper,” the “mad rapper,” a bitter sort of critic, and the thing about an album like that, to me, is, even though you have a track like that, it’s not a track that’s complaining about everything. To me, I don’t get that from your music as far as it being just a gripe session all the time, so I don’t know. Is there something you can speak to about being wary of that and falling into that kind of persona? I think it happens with a lot of underground cats. Phonte It did. I guess with now, which a lot of y’all know, one of the biggest words in the music vocabulary that I just fucking can’t stand is the word “hate,” or “hater.” It’s like you can’t have a fucking opinion, you’re automatically, “Oh, you a hater, son. You hating. You hating.” It’s just a word that’s used to dismiss and to excuse a lot of bullshit, and it’s just like, “Dude, if I don’t like your music, that’s not hate, it’s just…” There’s a lot of stuff that sells that I understand why it sells, and I get it. I understand that there’s a market for it and I understand why it moves, so when I say I don’t like it, it’s not that I’m hating, it’s just not for me. It’s not intended for… I’m not the demographic for that type of record. As far as us being like, “hip-hop haters” or whatever, being seen in that light, I think it’s like, for you, because you know the music, you get where we’re coming from, because we’re from the same era, more or less, but the casual music-listeners now, “hate” is like a part of their vocabulary, so if they don’t see you just falling in line and doing everything that everybody else is doing, they assume you’re a hater. Taking that into consideration for the next record, it was just, we’re working on the new album now, and the new album is called Getback, which we’re supposed to have out in the spring. It’s kind of like taking everything that happened with The Minstrel Show, internalizing it and really making sense of it all. Looking back on the record, I still think it was a great record and I’m still proud of it, but I don’t like the way I handled it. I think I took a lot of stuff to heart when I really didn’t have to. I started caring about shit that didn’t matter. I would encourage you, if more and more of you go into the business, one of the best quotes I’ve ever heard is from a singer called Eric Roberson who was a singer out of Jersey, and he said, “Man, the main reason why we do music is so when we do, it feels like the first time.” And to me that summed it up perfectly because that’s the reason why we do it. Looking back on my career and the dips and the dives and the curves in a short time, I started caring about shit that didn’t matter. I was watching SoundScan, reading radio spin charts, doing all that shit. If you’re a businessman you have to protect your business and get into it, but as an artist, why the fuck am I reading this? I’ve never read Billboard a day in my life. Why the fuck do I care and why the fuck am I looking at charts and sales figures? That’s for my label to do, not me. And so with Getback, the new album, it’s just about us – or me personally, I can’t speak for the whole group – but when I first started writing rhymes I didn’t sit down and say, “Yo! If I write this rhyme the right way Clear Channel is going to play my shit all day.” Or, “BET is going to have my video on smash.” I didn’t care about that shit, and so when I found myself starting to think that way I had to fall back and take inventory. That’s what I’d say to each and every one of you [to audience]: to keep whatever is in you that wants to make music, to keep that close, keep it as pure as possible because once you lose that, it’s a wrap. Jeff Mao I just want to open this up to questions, Phonte, pass the mic around. Audience Member I want to ask about the BET situation a year ago, when they said they refused to air your video because they deemed it too intelligent for their target audience. They stepped back and played it on the late-night show. How do you view that situation one year later? Phonte Coleman Man, the BET situation. For those of you who may not know, BET is Black Entertainment Television in the States and we did a video for our first single from The Minstrel Show called “Lovin’ It”, and the video for me was normal, but they didn’t play it. The word that we got, the word that circulated on the Internet and everywhere, was that they didn’t play it because it was too intelligent for their target audience. I’m not making this up, I swear to God. So that was it. If ever there was a time when I realized The Minstrel Show was not going to do that well, that was one of the moments. Look, I swear to god, so many times, I’m not a big believer in omens, but there were so many omens right from the jump. The first day we came to Atlantic to promote the album on its day of release it was raining. We were up in Atlantic, 28 floors up, looking out over the city and it was gloomy and stormy, it was all fucked up. Then the BET thing jumped off and nobody from the label came to our rescue, nobody in the building fought for us. What ended up happening, BET issued a statement saying, “We have the right to play what we want to play. We can’t confirm that that was said.” Basically, giving niggas a stiff -off. So, the single dropped in August; sometime around October, November they played the video for a week, just to prove a point and then the shit was over. By that time it was a little too late because the record was out. Looking back, I look on BET and outlets like that the same way I look at radio. Was my music too intelligent for their audience? I don’t think so, but if you take “Laffy Taffy,” “Chicken Noodle Soup,” “Peanut Butter & Jelly,” “Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It” and “Lovin’ It,” what stands out in this picture? But for me, I’m done with complaining about the media outlets and the radio. They’re going to do what they’re going to do, I’m more concerned with trying to find other outlets, taking it into our own hands and building up some shit for people like us. Let them niggas have that shit [waves hand dismissively]. Audience Member First up, much respect for your work. It’s an honor and a pleasure to have you here. On that note where you’re just explaining I’m wondering where you are now label-wise. Phonte Coleman We’re still on Atlantic. We had meetings with the label a couple of weeks ago. Going into the new record everyone’s aware of the mistakes that happened on the last one. They’re aware of where they fucked up, we’re aware of where we fucked up. At least this time, everyone is going into it with a clearer picture. I didn’t want to turn this into an Atlantic records bitch-fest because it’s not, they don’t deserve that. They certainly made mistakes, but so did we. Going into this record it looks like things will be better, but we’ll all just wait and see. Don’t count your chickens before they hatch, man, or you’ll be assed out. That shit be over. Audience Member I have a question. Phonte Coleman No, son, no. [Laughter] Audience Member Why would you [do] me like that on TV? [Laughs] No, how much of a factor do you think payola has to do with an artist like yourself not being played on urban radio? Phonte Coleman Payola, if you don’t know, is an old-school term that basically means pay-for-play. If I know [Jeff] Mao was the hot new program director at Hot Foxy 109.7, then I’m coming in going, “Yo, Mao, how’s it going, brother? I’ve got this new Oddisee record for you man, and I’ve got a little something for your troubles.” [Passes over envelope] It was basically just paying for play. People have different views on it. I think people should do whatever they want to do to get heard. If you want to give a DJ some money to play your record, then that’s what you want to do, but the problem is the little guy gets taken out. The golden rule is whoever has the gold makes the rules, that’s how that shit works. That’s one side. Another side, that I think a lot of people aren’t aware of, is some records do get through the cracks, but the thing is it’s a question of demographics. Radio isn’t about selling music, it’s about selling silence. To advertisers. So at the end of the day, I don’t give a fuck how great your song is, you may have written a great opus that’s going to change the world, but if 14-year-old girls aren’t ringing up my phones requesting that shit, I don’t give a damn. I’m trying to sell tickets to the Summer Jam and I’m trying to get this advertiser to buy some more time, so if they aren’t reacting to it, sorry. You can pay me all you want. It’s double-edged; payment does happen and repetition is law, the more and more you play something, it’s going to catch on. But I think it’s more to do with your snap records, your real simple “Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It,” things that are really easy to remember. A song like “Lovin’ It” or “Don’t Feel Right” by The Roots or “Kick Push” or “I Gotcha” by Lupe Fiasco, I don’t care how much you play them, it’s still like you’re trying to feed steaks to babies. I have a friend, who works in a radio station, and they had an online contest to vote on what song would go on rotation. One was an “underground artist,” one of us, I guess, and the other was a New York street rapper. Of course, it was online so the underground guy won because all the nerds come out in full force, “I’m voting ten times, fuck that!” So the underground guy won by about 80%, so they go to the program director and say the underground guy won. So he asked where he’s from. “He’s from New York.” “OK, where’s the other guy from?” “He’s from New York, too.” “Who do the kids like?” “The kids like the street guy, I guess.” “OK, we’re going to put that on rotation.” So, once again, it all comes down to advertising. Even though the guy won the popular vote, it was on the Internet. And I guess that comes back to the popular hype and believing who you are. If I’m a radio program director, am I going to believe more in a bunch of geek motherfuckers just spamming on the Internet or am I going to believe those 15-year-olds calling in, “Yo, put that on rotation”? It’s fucked up all around. Payola does still exist, but from where I’m sitting it’s not as black and white as it is, particularly for stuff that we do. It’s just a different ball game. Audience Member You mentioned earlier that you spent time looking at charts and things that you didn’t need to. What did you do to switch off from that? Because I think, in the UK, it’s quite a small net of DJs and they’ve got their favorites and sometimes they’ll be supportive, but then for no reason they’ll switch. I think that’s just DJs anyway. Sometimes you don’t want to make music for them, which you shouldn’t do anyway, but if I see them out… Phonte Coleman You mean there’s going to be a problem? Consequences and repercussions? Audience Member Yeah, sometimes I just start to hate every DJ. How do you switch off from that and still keep making music? Phonte Coleman The thing about DJs in the commercial radio you’ve got to understand, they’re fucking employees. DJs do not break records no more. Getting mad at a DJ for not playing your record is like getting mad at the nigga who works at McDonald’s for not making a bun with no sesame seeds on it. It’s like, “This is in the McDonalds textbook. Every bun has got to have sesame seeds on it. Every Big Mac is going to be two meat patties, there’s your sauce, there’s your cheese, here’s your pickle on a sesame seed bun. You want me to take something off, I can take it off. You want me to put something on, you want a Big Mac with bacon on it, I can’t do that. That’s not in the Big Mac handbook, baby. I can lose my job, nigga.” That’s essentially what radio DJs are, they’re fucking employees. They’re told what to play, when to play it and how often. So as far as wanting to choke a motherfucker, just realize their position. Dude, at the end of the day, you’ve got a job to do. I’m not going to tell you how to do it, I’m going to find my own shit. With all the media shit and the advent of MySpace. YouTube is pretty much like my MTV 2 now. I see shit on YouTube that I’d watch on TV. Shit like that, until it eventually gets gobbled up and becomes some corporate shit, but we’ve got it for now. [To sound technician] OK, Glyn, I’m not taking questions from her [laughs]. Audience Member I was just wondering why you’re called Little Brother. Phonte Coleman Why? I normally fault people who ask that question, but you get a pass because I’m overseas. Normally, it’s journalists and I tell this long drawn out story about having a baby brother who died from leukemia and they believe me. They’ll be crying and I’ll burst out laughing, just having a little fun. When we were thinking of names, we just thought of shit that looked good on paper. We wrote down a load of names. Little Brother, that works. Eventually, it came to have the meaning of us being the little brothers of all these groups we grew up listening to from my era. Public Enemy, NWA, Geto Boys, Tribe, De La, all those groups are like our bigger brothers in the game, we grew up watching them and idolizing them. Once we got the ball, and could run the game ourselves, we were like the little brothers following in their footsteps, just following the tradition of making good music. That’s where the name came from. Jeff Mao It’s not the anti-Big Brother. Audience Member Who or what is blowing your mind right now? Phonte Coleman I listen to so much shit. I listen to so much stuff, so it depends what kind of mood I’m in. This is one of my favorite songs from an unlikely source. Anyone who can guess what this is, I’ll give them the CD. [To Jeff Mao] Not you, I know you know. He was big in the ’80s, but his ’80s stuff was kind of pop, though he had some good songs. But in the early ’80s he had some joints, this was one of my dance joints, my stepping out shit. (music: Billy Ocean – “Night (Feel Like Getting Down)”) Anyone know who that is? Audience Member Billy Ocean. Phonte Coleman That was before “Get Out Of My Dreams, Get Into My Car.” Jeff Mao That’s on the Jane Fonda Workout. Phonte Coleman Are you bullshitting? I don’t know if the cat from Fat Freddy’s Drop is still here. This is actually a remix that Jazzanova did of a song of theirs called “Flashback.” People ask about music that blows my mind, well, Jazzanova and the whole Sonar Kollektiv family, their shit is kind of mind-boggling. (music: Fat Freddy’s Drop – “Flashback” (Jazzanova’s Breathe Easy Mix)) That shit is hard-nosed. [Music stops / applause] This a trumpeter from Finland whose name is Jukka Eskola. The name of this song is “1974” and when my man sent this to me I really thought it was from 1974, but it’s only two years old. This is like salsa dancing, this is my salsa shit. (music: Jukka Eskola – “1974”) That’s that fire… Shit like that is inspiring to me. Now, I listen to all my art shit, the “good fight shit,” but at the end of the day I am a black man from the South and you’ve got to remind someone once in a while. Sometimes I feel like being just that, I’m bumpin’ this. (music: Project Pat – “Chicken Head”) Fuck, that’s my jam. [Applause] Jeff Mao I think Steve had a question. Audience Member Yeah, I’ve got a question. What were the terms of the deal at Atlantic, if you
don’t mind talking about it? Phonte Coleman The terms? Pretty much that we’ve got this album and then after that, who
knows? Jeff Mao A couple of days ago, when Cut Chemist was here, he was talking about not having an option on the next album and how that affected some of his push, because the label didn’t feel like they had something that was going to pay off towards the next one. You know how a coach who’s in the last year of their contract, people feel like they’re a lame duck. With you guys it’s early in the process but… Phonte Coleman We still have albums up on our contract. They guaranteed for us to do two records. They guaranteed us that, then it goes to options… We’ll put it out, and the way the game is now, if this one does good, then we’ll have another record on Atlantic. If it doesn’t, I don’t think we will, quite honestly. The thing that made labels great in the past, was every label had a superstar that finances all the flops. Interscope has a Black Eyed Peas and a 50 Cent that helps pay for all the Interpols of the world. But now, the sales are down so much they’re ain’t no more superstars and the superstars that are out there ain’t selling what they used to sell. So every label is counting the pennies because the whole thing of this guy financing all the little guys, well, this guy isn’t even financing his own record anymore. So it’s become even more dog-eat-dog kind of cut-throat thing, because the labels are just hemorrhaging money from all over. So with us, I just think it’s going to be a thing where they’ll see the reaction we get and go from there. For me, I just know the music we make and the stuff that we do, no matter where we land, I’m going to land on my feet. Whether it’s at Atlantic or Homeboy on the Corner records, I’m just going to do me, do whatever I do. [Applause] I want to do this as a challenge. This is a song that I really love and I want to offer a sample challenge to anyone who’s a producer. If y’all want to take this shit and chop it up, see if you can make something dope, we’ll do a song, try to do something. I love this song, but I don’t know if you’ll think it’s gay, can’t be chopped up. This is by a group called Free Design, from the late ’60s/’70s, like an East Coast answer to The Mamas & Papas and they did a cover of “Light My Fire” by The Doors. I’m a big fan of harmonies, and I want to see if we can chop this up. (music: The Free Design – “Light My Fire”) That shit feels you’re on top of some shit… This is my jam right here, of everything that’s out right now, some may consider it a guilty pleasure, but I don’t believe in guilty pleasures because why should you feel guilty about something you’re getting pleasure from? This is my jam right now, there’s nothing topping this now. (music: Omarion – “Entourage”) When we go the club, who was the DJ in the club last night? [Several hands raise] Can you just run that by for me tonight one time? Are you in the club? [inaudible comment] I gotcha. Round of applause for Judith, everybody. [Applause] Hey, love what you’re doing, that’s why you’re making big bucks, I took them from him and gave them to you. That’s music that makes me feel, the “SexyBack” song, that’s supposed to be really sexy, but it doesn’t affect me like that Omarion. That just makes me want to put water on my chest and watch it glisten. [Laughter] Or put a light on me and get a pedicure and walk barefoot through some sand. As soon as that shit comes on how can you all sit still when that beat drops? [Plays wrong track] Jeff Mao That one, too. Phonte Coleman Just watch that sexy look that comes on their faces. You can’t front on that shit. (music: Omarion – “Entourage”) It’s undeniable. You’re gonna playing that tonight? I’m gonna step hard. Jeff Mao Does anybody else have any questions? Audience Member On the next Little Brother album, do you think you’ll have many guests? Phonte Coleman Well, we do have one that I think is going to surprise a lot of people. The song we came up with is really dope. On this one, we’re probably going to reach out to a couple of people. Jeff Mao Too early to say? Phonte Coleman Too early to say and then, too, we’ve still got to build up who we are. It’s kind of hard to get the crazy big names and work that as a single because people still don’t have an idea of who Little Brother is. So, it’s hard if you put out “Little Brother featuring Justin Timberlake!” That’s going to do more for Justin than it’s going to do for us. Just using him as an example, I don’t know him. We are going to have a few key guests but other than that it’s going to be kind of spare. A lot of outside production, though, a lot of new producers. Not new, but you know. Jeff Mao Outside of 9th? What’s the conscious decision as far as that goes? Phonte Coleman We’ve got to grow. There’s a lot of cats we’ve always wanted to work with, like Premo, he reached out to us. Just Blaze is a real big fan and big supporter, Nottz from Virginia, Alchemist. There’s just so much more. I think with all of our past records they were defined by the sound, the sound kept it together, but with the new record I think it’ll be me and Pooh are going to be the glue that keeps it all together, so it’s going to be a different experience. We’re six tracks deep in so far and I’m having the time of my life. Audience Member Are there any future collaborations with Nicolay? Phonte Coleman Yeah, me and Nic are talking about that, we’re pre-planning the new Foreign Exchange record. We’ve got to finish the Little Brother album first, by about December. We’ll probably start a new FE record by about February, but we’ve definitely got plans to do another one. Jeff Mao Anybody else? (music: Omarion – “Entourage”) Phonte Coleman That shit’s cold, y’all know it. Any more questions? Jeff Mao Alright, if you got more questions, you know that he’ll be around. Thank you. [Applause] Phonte Coleman I just want to say thank y’all. Y’all too kind, thank you, thank you. No, I’ve always wanted to do something like this. I was telling Jeff [Mao] earlier, I shy away from things like this because I feel it’s kind of presumptuous and big-headed to assume a bunch of motherfuckers want to hear you yammer for an hour. So I try to keep it interesting, keep it fun. But I thank you, this has been an incredible experience.

Qua
Qua is Cornel Wilczek, a Melbourne-based multi-instrumentalist. In addition to releasing two full-length artist albums of his own under the Qua moniker, Cornel has engineered and produced a multitude of acts. And, as he discusses in his lecture at the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy in Melbourne, he’s also been involved with art installations and become gently engulfed with his day job, designing sound for ads and films and producing wonderful closed-eyes movie soundtracks of burbling acoustic electronic music.
Hosted by NICK DWYER Have a warm welcome for a multi-talented man – a composer, producer, musician and sound designer, been working on a multitude of projects in Melbourne over recent years, playing in many different bands, Mr. Cornel Wilczek. [applause] Cornel, are you well? QUA I’m very good. [looks at clip mic] I’ve never worn one of these before. I’m good. NICK DWYER Excellent. Just to give people an idea, how long has music been a part of your life for? QUA Really long time. I think I started learning guitar when I was eight, and then once I left school studied jazz guitar at uni[versity]. Then strayed for a little bit, studied graphic design, then did a couple of years of that and thought, “What the hell am I doing?” And then slowly got into soundtracks and went to Media Arts at RMIT [Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]. It’s a really interesting course, it’s based around quite a few different disciplines and looking at them in a fine arts context. So looking at film sound design as art as opposed to design. And through that met lots of people and started a career making sound. NICK DWYER Pretty much everyone in this room is either a producer in their own right or is tinkering around making music and a lot of people do know, but for some people it’s a word that comes up and it’d be nice to get a definition. What exactly is sound design and what does a sound designer do? QUA OK, a sound designer within a film context will look at using sound – not necessarily music, but sound to help with a narrative aspect of the film. So say, for example, you’re working on a scene with sync sounds that are dialogue, movement, footsteps and atmospheres and trying to get a balance that not only describes what’s happening but tells a lot more of the story, that can somehow add tension to a scene that needs to be tense, can offer a very abstract way of giving a bit of a history about a person and things like that. There’s no one way of doing things and that’s the beautiful thing about sound design, that it’s a very lateral art form. And you can be very experimental with techniques and often get away with it in a very commercial context, which is excellent. It’s one if the few jobs that you can work commercially and have quite a lot of freedom and experimentation with. NICK DWYER For you growing up as young Cornel, loving music, playing guitar, at what point did the idea of sound design, and in particular was there a soundtrack that you checked out as a kid where all of a sudden you were like, “Oh my gosh, this has opened up a whole new world for me?” QUA Yeah, there were probably quite a few moments. I guess, one moment would be seeing Tron. I’ve got my Tron shoes on. That was incredible. NICK DWYER Who composed Tron? QUA That was Wendy Carlos who did the music. And actually a lot of the sound design came from Wendy Carlos’s music as well so a lot of the atmospheres and a lot of the non-musical elements came from Wendy Carlos’s synth treatment. So it was probably the first time I became aware of this aspect in film and then, you know, getting older, seeing so many more David Lynch films, for example, were a big eye-opener. Or ear-opener. NICK DWYER As you’ve progressed in this craft as a sound designer, do you find it a lot harder to enjoy films? Rather than just focusing on the story, you’re honing so much more in on the sound? QUA Yeah, studying was really hard. Like, you just couldn’t watch a film properly. Actually now it’s got to a point where I’m so tired of analyzing that I can actually watch films again, which is really nice. And you know, a good sound design treatment will easily allow you to enjoy a film anyway because when you’re not thinking about technique and you’re just thinking about the film and the narrative itself, then it’s quite successful and they’ve done a great job and that happens a lot more these days. NICK DWYER For you, over the years, have there been any very disappointing moments where there’s been a film with great cinematography, great narrative, but you’ve just been like, “Man, the sound design was terrible”? QUA Yeah, there’s lots. I kind of wish a lot of sci-fi films treated sound design a little better. The obvious examples like the Star Wars recent things could have been fantastic but they weren’t. Yeah, yeah, lots. [laughs] NICK DWYER What would be another great introduction for everyone to not just your own productions but some of your work as [a sound designer]? Shall we watch “Devil Eyes”? Tell us about “Devil Eyes,” man, in particular Paul Robertson, who is a great friend of yours. QUA Paul Robertson is a Melbourne-based, I should say Geelong-based animator, who’s now becoming quite widely known and doing lots of film clips for different people, but we studied together. The thing about Media Arts is that it was a very cross-disciplinary course where animators were working with sound designers and that’s where I met quite a few bands that I’m currently working with. We just have a really interesting relationship where I just give him music and he gives me animation and we just are continually working. This piece is something from the last album I did under the name Qua, and Paul Robertson did this animation in about a month and it’s fucking insane. (music and video: Qua – “Devil Eyes” / applause) NICK DWYER That’s pretty impressive. How long ago was that made? QUA That was 18 months ago now when the last album came out. I’d really like to do some more with Paul really soon. NICK DWYER So there was a video that he essentially made for you? QUA Yep, as a film clip. NICK DWYER Right, for anyone that was in the room earlier on, as we were just talking before this lecture, there’s another thing that you and Paul – which I wouldn’t mind showing a bit earlier on – it’s a pretty funny thing. There’s another little thing that you and Paul did and that was you doing music for him. So you’ve got a nice little healthy exchange going on? QUA Yeah, we’ve got a little symbiotic relationship that, if I have an idea, I’ll pass it on to him and vice versa. Often, when we’re working on animations he’ll start one scene and I’ll start another scene and then we just cross like that. It’s just really nice and I think the really important thing I’ve learned doing soundtracks and things like this over the past few years is just relationships are so important, and working with people that you get along with is one of the most productive things in the world. NICK DWYER Obviously it sounds like you and Paul have a really healthy symbiosis, but is it always an amazing thing for you seeing your music reinterpreted? When you created that track originally, was there an idea in your head of something else, I don’t know, you were perceiving and then to kind of see his take on it with that animation? QUA I had ideas but I didn’t want to express them to him and that’s not at all what I would have thought of. I think the first time I saw it I almost cried, it was just absolutely amazing and so sad. I’ve got certain friends that I really trust their interpretations a lot and I’m working with a few other animators now on some new things, which is just fantastic. NICK DWYER The Qua project is entirely you, pretty much? You do employ other musicians, but all of the music that we heard just before, are you playing everything on that? QUA That’s me playing everything, yeah. That’s not as typical. That’s a bit more acoustic, the other stuff is a little bit more electronic. But live I’ll work with quite a few different performers and musicians because it’s pretty hard to do live. NICK DWYER How long has the Qua project been going for and how was this thing known as Qua born? QUA When I moved to Melbourne from Adelaide in 2000 not having access to bands and I didn’t know anybody here, just had a computer and needed to keep making music. So it never was an intentional thing to do stuff by myself. But like I guess a lot of electronic producers that I know, who were working in bands and other formats beforehand, suddenly when you’re left to your own devices you suddenly make all this music and you’re like, “OK, here’s a solo project that I never intended to do.” NICK DWYER Going back to Adelaide, we’ve heard a little bit about Melbourne since we’ve been here. I’m sure a couple of people know a little bit about Sydney to a certain degree, but tell us about Adelaide as a city. You are born and bred in Adelaide? QUA Yep, yep, like a lot of Adelaideans [I’ve got] European parents but I’m first generation Australian. Lived in a very multicultural part of Australia, of Adelaide that is, and, yeah, it’s a pretty strange place. It’s a million people so its not actually that small but it feels like the smallest town in the world. NICK DWYER It’s quite a large urban spread though? QUA It’s about as big as Melbourne as far as the actual size goes but a quarter of the population and it feels very sparse. There’s been some interesting music in the past few years, but it has until probably recently been quite isolated. Bands like AC/DC and Cold Chisel and all that, Bon Scott and all those people are from Adelaide so it has had an interesting musical history. NICK DWYER Growing up as well – the feeling of isolation, we were talking before the lecture started about how Virgin came along and opened up a lot of things – but growing up in the ’90s, did a lot of the cities feel quite isolated from each other? QUA Oh, absolutely. That competitive thing that you feel because you don’t understand another culture, coming to Melbourne and going to raves and big parties and just being so overwhelmed and feeling quite conscious. And just really hating the position in Adelaide because we felt so isolated. But sure enough, you find out the more you travel that it’s just like any other city, and that competitive streak between cities in Australia pretty much dissolved once cheap flights became available and everybody started working with one another. Which was always there to an extent, but as young electronic performers we couldn’t really meet other people from other cities, we weren’t able to work like that. NICK DWYER When you were in Adelaide prior to coming to Melbourne, what were your first forays into music production sounding like and was there much support for it in Adelaide? QUA No, there wasn’t too much. The first thing I really did there was work with the Contemporary Arts Centre of South Australia and set up a few experimental sound design installations. It didn’t go down too well. I remember an opening I did where I had a lot of long-term patrons to the gallery coming in and saying, “What the fuck is this? Sound does not belong in a gallery space.” It was just really quite depressing. Saying that, it generated a lot of interest and I met a lot of really amazing sound artists from it. And then we all moved to Melbourne. NICK DWYER [laughs] You were also saying that within Adelaide, those artists that were doing electronic music, there wasn’t much of a sense of camaraderie, it was quite the opposite to a certain degree? QUA It was just very competitive. Not really knowing what was happening in the rest of the world and feeling so isolated. If you bought a piece of equipment, had a computer, you were really precious about it. You got really pissed off when you saw someone else with a piece of gear as well. I think that happens in a lot of cities, especially when you’re quite young and naïve to a lot of things. Then I moved to Melbourne and was quite impressed with how embracing and friendly – especially the experimental and avant-garde music scene, which is generally the most pretentious in any city – was just so beautiful here, and quite inviting and welcoming. NICK DWYER Tell us a bit more about this. What year was it that you first arrived here and what musical treats awaited you? QUA I moved here in 2000 and actually the biggest thing that drew me here was a record store called Synaesthesia, I’m not sure if anybody’s aware of that. NICK DWYER It’s still there now? QUA Yep, yep, Synaesthesia is in the city. It was just a hub for… Anybody that made or liked music would go there. And Mark, who owns it, did lots of distribution and also has his own label and put on performances in the store as well and that was just… This is when I was really getting into the more experimental side of things and I was just overwhelmed by this community that seemed to exist really well and everybody was releasing albums and playing regularly. It just seemed like the place to be. NICK DWYER When you talk about the experimental stuff that you were feeling a lot of the time, internationally, what was getting a lot of play from you on your stereo? QUA I came from a bit of a free-jazz background and stuff like that. As far as experimental stuff, a lot of the musique concrète artists. Contemporary stuff, I was personally into experimental meeting pop, so a lot of the whole ’90s German [scene], like Mouse on Mars and things like that. And especially Japanese, I got very into the Japanese music scene, like Nobukazu Takemura and people like that, was just amazing. Everything I’d wanted to hear. NICK DWYER So did you move to Melbourne basically to be in a new environment or did the RMIT thing play a large part in your decision to move here? QUA That played a massive role. It was between hanging out in Synaesthesia, the record store and finding out about Media Arts as a course, and realizing there was another collective there that was based around education, having quite amazing lecturers like Hilsa Matsis, who was another musician who I was playing a lot with at the time and happened to be a lecturer there. And Philip Brophy, who is a filmmaker and composer as well, who I was actually big fans of before I started the course. Having them as mentors really meant a lot. NICK DWYER And then all of a sudden, you talk about a great sense of community starting to come out of RMIT. You talked about Paul just before, but who else was in this RMIT community who have gone on to do great things in music? QUA Well, my closest friends there were the guys in Architecture in Helsinki and we all worked together originally, and then there’s other bands like Music vs. Physics, who are hip-hop. It was just basically all genres of music were born out of this. A lot of amazing experimental artists as well and then we met people from other institutions, like Anthony Pateras, who was at VCA at the time, and Robin Fox, who are now living and working and doing lots of interesting stuff overseas. God, just so many people have now gone on to do stuff, not just in sound but also in film as well. Through all my film and soundtrack work I think I’ve met at last in any one project someone that has been through the Media Arts process and they are usually the people I can relate to and really connect with. NICK DWYER From the get-go with all of your musical projects, have you strongly believed that it should be accompanied by a visual aspect? Just how important is that visual side, do you believe, for music? QUA Actually, I don’t think it’s that important, but when it's done well it’s just amazingly entertaining and I just happen to have lot of friends who work in that field. I don’t think it has to always fit together. I know a lot of people are like, “I can’t perform without a VJ,” and I know that’s sometimes a little bit sad. But when you get that relationship really working, especially when you’re a laptop musician or whatever, it’s really nice to have something else to focus on because it’s not that exciting sometimes having people stare at you while you’re pressing buttons. NICK DWYER The other day with Paul Kelly and Declan Kelly we heard one track from Architecture in Helsinki, but this is a Melbourne-based band that have gone on and are reaching some quite nice, lofty heights at the moment. Shall we hear a track from them and maybe it’ll be good to play a couple more bits of Melbourne music. QUA Yeah, alright, I’ll play some Architecture in Helsinki. NICK DWYER And also, explain a little more what your role in the band is? QUA Um. General random hanger-on-erer? They work on my stuff, I work on their stuff. I do some writing with Cameron, the main songwriter, we also do a lot of recording, borrow each other’s gear. I mix their stuff and master their stuff and they mix my stuff and master my stuff. I’m just as much part of it, but not actually touring with them. NICK DWYER They’re on tour at the moment, aren’t they? QUA Yeah, they’re on tour in the US. I’ll play, um. What shall I play? I’ll play this. (music: Architecture in Helsinki - “Wishbone” / applause) NICK DWYER So tell us a little bit more about the Qua project, which has obviously off the back of the success of that project, pretty much changed many aspects of your whole life. When did the Qua project start taking fruition and what was it with that project that you were musically trying to achieve? QUA I never really had any real direction with it except that as I was running through the course of Media Arts I realized that I had this compilation of music, and when I put it all together it worked as whole and just ended up getting a record deal in Australia through Surgery Records. And without ever intending to release any music it started doing quite well and managed to get album of the week on most radio stations. And then it got licensed in Japan, just randomly, and I had no idea at the time how it happened. Before I knew it, I was playing quite regularly in Japan and traveling in Japan a lot and working on lots of Japanese productions and stuff like that. And realized I had a bigger fanbase over there! NICK DWYER Tell us a little bit about the label it was released on, and for you it sounds like it was a label close to your heart. QUA Yeah it’s a magazine called Headz, and they ran a magazine called Fader by Headz in Japan. I had every one of their albums and never thought twice about contacting them to get my stuff released on there. It’s mostly post-rock and experimental stuff, a lot of the Chicago-based post-rock scene, like Tortoise and things like that, and Jim O’Rourke and Fennesz and then Nobukazu Takemura. It’s all my favorite artists and suddenly I’ve got an album there, and touring… It’s just insane. NICK DWYER When you talk about you being over there for production, what’s this all about my friend? QUA I think one thing that I didn’t expect but quite happy it happened was just through releasing albums, I think a lot of my stuff has a kind of cinematic feel. it does lend itself to soundtrack very well, and by default got lots of soundtrack work, for film and TV. NICK DWYER For Japanese film and TV? QUA Yeah, yeah. And also just I think a lot of people happened to like the sound of my album as well and I ended up doing production for a few bands, I’ve been working quite closely with a Japanese band called Meow. It’s just stuff that happens when you release an album and have different people interpret it and see how useful it can be to them. NICK DWYER But I mean the Japanese thing, it’s kind of like, I don’t know, you release your first album and the next thing, it’s kind of like a dream come true. Was that pushed at all by yourself or was it a freak accident? QUA It was a freak accident. I never tried. I mean I’ve always wanted to spend a lot of time in Japan, I’ve always been fascinated with Japanese art and music, but it was never intentional. I’d still love to be bigger here and doing more stuff here but it just so happens that, yeah, I can do that in Japan quite easily now. NICK DWYER You mentioned before with the first Qua album, you were getting album of the week on Australian radio stations. Is there support for Australian music on local television and radio, or are there fundamental flaws going on in the foundation? QUA I think radio is really good in Australia. it could be better, there could be more stations, more options, but I think it’s fairly supportive. Every city has at least one good radio station, Melbourne happens to have two really good radio stations. It is really supportive where my album, there’s ten minute periods where there’s lots of digital noise, it can get played on the radio aside bands like Architecture in Helsinki. It’s just amazing. I was quite blown away and didn’t realize I had that much support. And television is quite amazing too. There’s some really interesting people placed in music licensing and TV. You’ll find really great bands in Australia, and electronic artists have had tracks licensed to TV shows and commercials and the love has been spread, and people are making money from this now. It’s really quite, not as supportive as it could be, but healthy more than one would expect. NICK DWYER How about the government? There are a lot of nations where the government actually gets behind supporting bands going overseas, all kinds of music grants. Is that happening in Australia? QUA I guess there isn’t as much as a lot of other countries, it’s still something you really have to slave away at. If you’re willing to spend the energy and put the time into getting grants and really pushing the whole funding aspect, you really can do quite well and there are a lot of bands that are like that here, but it does become a full-time job very quickly and I’ve never had the patience to do that. Which is unfortunate because there’s been some great opportunities in the past that usually just slip by a lot of really amazing artists’ fingers, but saying that, there are some people taking really good advantage of that right now. NICK DWYER Shall we hear something off your first album? Tell us about this album, what was happening in your life at that moment? QUA I was coming to terms with my environment and trying to meet people and do stuff and trying to survive financially and all that sort of stuff. And I felt quite isolated, but was really having fun discovering this environment and discovering the way I made music. NICK DWYER Music, more often than not, is a by-product of your environment. For a lot of people, does this album sound Melbourne? QUA Maybe it does, I can’t think of other things that sounded similar at the time, but to me it’s very much that place that I was living in at this time and it has a sense of discovery that I was feeling. Whether it sounds Melbourne, I don’t really know. It’s a really interesting question and I don’t know what the Melbourne aesthetic really is, but it tends to be probably a little more happy to experiment. So I’ll play something. This is something off the first album. (music: Qua – “Monkey Sleep”) NICK DWYER That’s beautiful, man. How old is all this material now? QUA Oh, this was 2001, and a lot of this was done in about two weeks. NICK DWYER Can you run us through the process of how was each individual track attacked? QUA They were all done quite differently but, for example, that track, it began as a bit of a sound design piece so I was doing lots of field recordings. And this is often a method I use when I run out of ideas and don’t know how to construct things. I just do lots of field recording and work very collage-based and then start layering things on top and then pulling out that skeleton of sound design and seeing how it holds up. You often get really interesting and different arrangements that you usually wouldn’t think of. NICK DWYER If we listened very closely to that track, would we be able to hear the sound of… What kind of things? QUA Well, there’s not much left, which is really interesting! But what was there was, I live very close to a children’s farm and a lot of field recordings were based around a lot of those animals. And, what else? Stuff immediately in my environment. NICK DWYER So lay that all down and then build around that and then take away the original? QUA Yep, yep. That’s not how I do everything but that was a big part of things at the time and I still do now when I run out of ideas. NICK DWYER And subsequently what followed off the back of that was… For a lot of people it’s essentially a dream to be able to carve out a living based on purely making music, and some of whom have worked their way into very high positions, but all over the world a lot people are still struggling to make music. You’ve managed to carve out this whole new niche of being able to every day make music in one way shape or another and to live off that. Now, prior to this album had you been doing any film projects before or it all came off [the back of the album]? Obviously it was something you’d always wanted to do… QUA The only film projects I’d worked on were things based around my studies. I desperately wanted to get into film and TV and all that but, you know, it’s just really hard. Especially here when there are only a few opportunities, there’s only X amount of films produced each year, that’s a lot less than a lot of other countries, and it just seemed like an impossible thing to do. But to find out that releasing an album was the best thing I could do to get film work was really surprising and just purely off the back of that got approached, primarily by directors who had bought the album and heard some sort of narrative quality in a lot of the tunes. And when they found out that I could actually write music, score for an orchestra and stuff like that, it became a really handy feature. So, yeah. NICK DWYER What were some of the first projects that you were approached to do? And how were those first projects, going from essentially retaining pretty much complete creative control over what you’re doing, and all of a sudden, maybe there’s a bit of a shift there? QUA For some strange reason, I don’t know why I’m involved so much in animation but I am and I love it. But it started with a lot of animators and animation is a very labor-intensive process, as anybody knows who’s worked in it, and I think animators really like that level of detail in music because they use that level of detail in their animation. It started with animation and I worked quite heavily with a Melbourne-based animator, Nick Kallincos, who has done some beautiful stop motion pieces and it started by getting things into lots of festivals around the world, and then from that I’ve been getting lots of TV commercials. Lucky enough to have an agent approach me and saw the opportunities to put a lot of this more experimental stuff into TV commercials and I have to say that’s been really interesting because you often get a similar budget to a movie, but you’ve got 30 seconds and so you’ve got the opportunity to really get this 30 seconds right. And it can be the most frustrating experience in the world – and also really liberating because you’re working with so many people that have a piece of this, have some sort of ownership, whether it be the creatives from the advertising world or the director or the client. So it’s a really frustrating, yet really liberating thing to do because you can actually really do things to the Nth degree. And if you need to hire 20 people to play this piece, and you need to do it in this hall, you often can – you do have those budgets to work with, which is really nice. So, as a result I advise anybody, I’m sure there’s the advertising aspect that a lot of people don’t agree with and I didn’t at first I was very reluctant to do it, but when I realized that this could actually benefit me making music… NICK DWYER Working with these kinds of budgets and say, for example, you feel you really do need to work with a 30-piece string section or whatever, have you been able to grow and learn a lot because you’re in this situation that as a bedroom producer or something you don’t get these opportunities? QUA Going from being a bedroom producer to suddenly working in these really amazing studios with 30 people behind you watching you mix and being in these really stressed-out situations and running the show, organizing all the musicians to come in, and suddenly I’m micing up all these instruments that I’ve never really done before. You know, I knew how to mic up a drum kit and I knew how to record bands but I’d never recorded big ensembles. I’d recorded a few instruments but… I couldn’t even find how to mic up on the net, it was really quite confusing. But when you’re thrown in the deep end a lot of amazing things can happen. And, like I said, the experimental side of that was really quite amazing, what you can actually get away with. And I have to say, if anybody gets the opportunity to work in that field, do it, you can do some really interesting things. NICK DWYER Obviously it was a pretty lucky coincidence with what happened off the back of the album for you to get involved in this field, but just how hard is it and what would you say is the best way? There’s a lot of people in this room that are making music who would be very well-suited to that side of the industry. What is the best way to get out there? Or is it a pretty closed door? That whole advertising industry and film industry does seem like, not so much a boys’ club but it’s mates of mates of mates of mates who get the opportunities. QUA Oh, it is, and you often find when you look into the histories of certain artists that they’re often related to someone or there’s some kind of family connection or someone that’s invested into that has had an interest in their nephew or whatever. It is very closed, but I think the best advice I can give now is that it’s about building relationships. If you have people you really get along with and have a good working relationship with, you’ve just got to stick with that. There are quite a few directors now that I’ve done their student films with who are now getting great opportunities and looking at doing feature films and finally getting people interested in them. It’s a beautiful thing because you’ve suddenly got these people that trust you and like what you do and you can do your own thing, as opposed to being given very tight briefs that don’t offer much freedom. NICK DWYER Have you got an example of an ad that we can watch now that you did? QUA Oh, man. NICK DWYER [laughs] Sorry to put you through this. QUA Let’s have a look. This is something that I wouldn’t tell too many people about. Look, I’ve done some things that aren’t necessarily aligned to some of the music that I do and then I’ve done a lot that are and, unfortunately, I don’t have a lot of my ads with me. But I’ve got a few things here. I mean, this is great, this is for Austar Broadband and… NICK DWYER And just before we see it, what was the brief that you were given from the client? So now we’ve got this ad, we want moody! We want edgy! How does it work? QUA Well, yeah, sometimes you get those types of briefs. This was a brief where they just said it’s about nerds, it’s got this particular narrative, they wanted really lonely music and they referenced stuff like the Carpenters that I really like. So this was great to have complete freedom to do whatever I wanted. So I thought this was a great opportunity to do something that I’d never, ever, ever tried before and that is a big vocal, Beach Boys-esque harmonies over one of my favourite instruments, which is the French horn. I’d never been able to use it before and wanted to get it into something, so I managed to get a French horn and try something completely different. This was a great production exercise to me, and even though I’ll never write anything like this again, it’s a really good experience to see how you can introduce these kind of instruments into your own work. (advert: Austar Broadband commercial / applause) NICK DWYER So in the light of that, how long did you work on it and did you find the right French hornist? QUA I ended up playing it myself with lots of editing. It was just great to actually try, and this is what I really do enjoy about doing things like this every now and again, is finding a genre and getting that genre right. And even though you might never, ever do that again, it can lend some really interesting production techniques. To get that right sound I realized I had to go to tape and had to use rooms as opposed to… NICK DWYER Oh, so you ended up recording it on tape… QUA No, I ended up bouncing things down. So, as an electronic musician suddenly being faced with a brief that requires a whole set of tools, it’s insane, it’s amazing. It did my head in, I didn’t sleep for a whole week trying out different things. A lot of experimentation and ringing around helps. NICK DWYER That raises a very interesting question, obviously. Anyone who’s in the business of releasing records, I mean, some people take a lot longer, but essentially there is a deadline, somewhere there [gestures down] or it might be in ten years’ time for others. But all of a sudden you’re thrust into an industry with the strictest deadlines known to man. How do you deal with those? QUA Not very well. You just have to do them, and it can be a bit overwhelming when you’ve got ten deadlines in a row. But I’ve learned a lot from it and that’s being very good at making decisions now and actually being able to listen to something and have an idea that’s very strong before I start something and work out an execution and knowing gear that I might need to use and not wasting time getting the wrong gear. Knowing what mics to use, knowing what pre-amps to use on a certain job, knowing what software to use even, you just streamline everything when you’re in these positions. The stress is really hard to work with but wow, now that I’ve got some of this knowledge, applying it to albums and producing other people’s music has been just amazing. NICK DWYER You’ve found yourself in some very stressful situations, how do you deal with stress? QUA I work through it. Yeah, I just like to work through it and keep going and don’t let it defeat me and I think that’s the best way to do it. There’s nothing worse than just thinking about it. There’s been a few times where I’ve been completely blank and it often happens when you’re being told to do your own thing, and especially when someone says, “I like your album, can you do something like that?” That can be the most stressful of all. In fact, “Dude, give me a brief, give me something to work with.” That can be really, really, really hard and the only way to deal with it is just to work through it. I think the moment that you give up and let things go you can just feel really down. Obviously everybody here loves doing music and there’s nothing worse than being completely bankrupt with ideas and the only way to really get through it is just work through it and actually have some good peers and a good collective to bounce things off. I’ve got a few people who I’ll ring and say, “I need help, can you come down and just listen to something.” Without those people… NICK DWYER We were mentioning about the Academy and the whole sense of community and sharing music, sharing ideas. It sounds like off the back of the RMIT thing and all this, how important is this sense of community and nurturing a good community, having great people around you, for you? QUA Extremely important. For example, finishing Media Arts and, very similar to this experience, having an environment where you’re working with other composers and musicians all the time and having what we had regularly, reviews where we’d just sit down and play each other stuff and talk very casually about stuff. You don’t realize how important it is until you don’t have that and then suddenly you start to wonder what the worth is of your music and you just lose sight of the overall picture. So the ability to bounce things off other people – and also listening to other people’s stuff, I feel very selfish sometimes when listening to other people’s music. It gives me ideas and I’ve got nothing to comment back and I’m just thinking, “I’m going to try that.” That’s a really important part for me, listening to other peoples’ logic. How do you construct things and why are you constructing it? Those conversations are really, really important, and not just other musicians but people who I use as a bit of a peer group, filmmakers and animators and everything. And I think anybody in the creative profession can often give you some really good insight into your own work. NICK DWYER Going back to what is essentially your day job now with doing film and television commercials and the like, how does it affect you creatively with your music? QUA It gives me lots of great ideas, except I just don’t have enough time to work on it because when it’s on, it’s on. Soundtrack, as great as it is, it’s left last in the equation. So you’re often being faced with a week to work on something and they’ve got to get it out. Two weeks down the track it has to be pressed onto film and they’ve just forgotten about sound, basically. That happens in the biggest productions all the time, so when you’re working, you’re on, you’re switched on the whole time. It’s affected my stuff dramatically because I haven’t had the time to do it, but it's just a matter of taking time out. You find most composers will work something like nine months on, three months off, and you just have to take that time off because there’s no relaxing. You’ll never get, “You’ve got three months to work on this, work on it in your own time.” It’s just never going to happen. You get a couple of days to show some sketches. Besides that it’s creatively fantastic, it’s just being able to try very different things and work with budgets to actually find out why certain gear is so expensive and to find out why so many people use these mics. Just to know that from first-hand experience – as opposed to reading it in magazines or being told – is really great, because when you do need to use some of that stuff in the future, you can be quite quick and work out what you need and execute ideas a lot quicker. NICK DWYER Do you have to train yourself in becoming pretty adept at knowing when enough is enough? It doesn’t need any more layers, doesn’t need any more, just stop now... QUA Yeah, oh yeah. That comes from timing usually and someone saying, “I’m taking it away from you now,” because I would just continually work on things. I don’t know when to stop so it’s really nice to have other people in soundtrack to tell you when to stop. NICK DWYER You’ve generally got someone behind you to say, “You know what, Cornel? You’ve done enough.” QUA It’s usually my girlfriend saying, “Come to bed.” Or it will be the director or it will be my agent who books me all the work because there’s another job on or whatever. NICK DWYER You’ve been involved with a few feature-length films. How does the process of sound design for these films work? Are you given the film as a whole and you watch from start to finish, you get a vibe for it and then you start taping little bits? QUA I haven’t been lucky enough to be in that position where I’ve just been given a whole film and told, “Go for it.” My role has often been fixing up things and you find that, especially in Australia, that comfort and security behind someone that has done lots of films before is really important, so contractually they’ll align themselves to those people. These people don’t necessarily do all the music, which is really strange, and they often get lackeys like me to do parts. And that’s how you start, that’s pretty much how a lot of people start in the film industry by doing certain things. NICK DWYER Kind of the hip-hop equivalent of ghostwriting? QUA Yeah. Look, it’s like that and there are some classic examples that I’m not allowed to talk about, lots of strange politics, but it’s really interesting because you can work your whole life in film and never be credited for anything, which is really quite sad. But the best years have yet to come. NICK DWYER We played a little bit of your work with Paul Robertson before but do you want to play the Street Fighter thing? Tell us a little bit about this project. QUA I got a grant last year to work on a new animation with Paul and we didn’t really have… he just started. NICK DWYER What was the grant? QUA It was, um. I’ve got a terrible memory for these things, a Melbourne city initiative and it was part of something or other. I don’t know. I just do it, and I’ll take any opportunity to work with Paul, he’s quite amazing, and this piece, [we] had no idea how we would tackle it, but I decided to do something completely different. I actually found something that’s closely aligned to my childhood roots, which was a very prog-rock soundtrack, all done by electronics, which was a lot of fun. And I wrote tunes and he animated to them and then he animated some things and I wrote to them, so yeah. NICK DWYER And this went in to take on a life of its own in the sense that once it had entered a few festivals it seems now that even some games companies are like, “Hey guys, we quite like what you’re doing there.” QUA Yeah, yeah. It just went out of control. It got onto the net and got a million downloads in a week and that’s pretty good for something that’s ten minutes and is quite a large file. Who knows how many there are now, but it just got everywhere and without ever entering things into festivals we got it into quite a few festivals. And from that now, quite a few game companies have been really interested in turning this into a game, which will be a project for next year. As far as how we’re going to tackle it or how I tackle it sonically, wow, I just have no idea but it’s going to be a lot of fun because it’s going to be quite a big project. NICK DWYER And when you talk about games companies you’re talking about the top tier of your Xbox, PlayStation. QUA Yeah, this is a PlayStation… NICK DWYER More phenomenal budgets to work with! QUA Wait and see! Look, at the end of the day, I hope they don’t hear me say this, but I’d do it for free. I love working with Paul, I just find it so entertaining. (music and video: Cornel Wilczek and Paul Robertson – “Pirate Baby’s Cabana Battle Street Fight 2006” / applause) NICK DWYER So with the approach to the music for that one, did you play those instruments yourself? Guitar solos and all? QUA It’s all programmed except for the guitar solos, that’s me. I love guitar solos. Yeah. I like playing with computers, but I mean, the guitar solo is one of my favorite things in the world. NICK DWYER Now we’ve had two Qua albums released so far and work, I do believe, has been underway for the third for quite a while now. I do believe you scrapped the project halfway? QUA Yeah, yeah. I had a new album last year and then started from scratch. I just felt like I’ve learned so much from my production in soundtrack that it was an opportunity to put some of that into my own music, which is pretty rare these days. And working with Mountains in the Sky and Architecture in Helsinki and Curse Ov Dialect and producing other peoples’ albums and doing a better job than my own, I thought it was going to be really fun to actually apply some of this to my new stuff. NICK DWYER And has anything been recorded so far? QUA Yeah, yeah, I’ve started recording. It’s a lot more uptempo and poppier than stuff in the past and I’m using a drummer live, which is Laurence Pike, who plays with Triosk and Flanger and we’re going to do a tour next year, which will be great, through Europe. NICK DWYER You’ve also brought a pretty nifty little toy. I think anyone who’s been up the front of the desks has seen this shiny little Lemur thing. Tell us about this, man, and can we get a little bit of a demonstration about how it works? It looks very pretty. QUA Sure, I’m just going to keep talking while I load some things… NICK DWYER So Lemur is a French company? QUA They’re called JazzMutant, [whispers] a terrible name, and it’s a multi-touch screen device. Something that’s always been important to me is playing live and with electronics I always felt things were a little bit… It was just really hard to be completely live and to be gestural, and coming from a musical background and playing lots of instruments, I’m actually really good at using my hands and fingers and really desperately wanted to have something a little bit more gestural and that could be manipulated a lot more. I’d been looking around for ages and I’d tried different things, using a guitar synth live and all these things, and it hasn’t been that successful. But this is the first thing that I’ve found that can help me be really live and do very dramatic changes on the fly to arrangements and really look at constructing songs live and relying less on sequence-based stuff. NICK DWYER This thing has pretty much single-handedly revolutionized your life? QUA Oh, totally. I sleep with it. It’s just replaced a lot of hardware. I’ve still got a long way to go with working it out but I just really believe in interfaces that steer you more away from the computer and get you more hands-on. [inaudible question] It’s great if you have patches pre-made for you but to build patches takes a bit of time. I have a bit of a programming background as well so it’s fairly easy, but if you’ve got a friend that can help build patches for you, it’s fairly simple scripting languages. But there’s a bit of maths involved to actually be able to emulate certain things. But if you just want to trigger things and just send CC levels, it’s fairly easy. [inaudible question] Yeah, yeah, so I use it to run Ableton Live, Reaktor and Plogue Bidule. It’s fantastic. AUDIENCE MEMBER How’s the lack of tactile feedback, the fact that you can’t feel the controls, only see them? QUA It’s pretty strange, there’s no physical feedback but there’s lots of visual feedback, which you have to build in yourself. That’s the other thing, if you want some sort of visual response, you have to program some sort of flash or something to give you some external feedback. You can also program it to take any output signals and to give you feedback from whatever you’re using as well, whether that be automation of faders or whatever. But that takes a bit of getting used to. But I can live with that. AUDIENCE MEMBER Who is it made by? QUA They’re called JazzMutant. I’m not sure where they’re from in France but they’re very lovely guys. Quick for support and all that sort of stuff but I don’t really know too much about them. NICK DWYER How many of these do you think are in existence, is it a case of they produce a thousand or is it in the hundreds? QUA I gave a figure before but I think it could be wrong. I’m not really sure but it’s still a small start-up company. They just released this new operating system which now supports MIDI, because before it was just OSC, which would only really work for Macs and Reaktor. So now that it supports MIDI you can use it a hell of a lot more. AUDIENCE MEMBER When you perform live what do you use? QUA Now I’ll be using this. I use guitar, that’s the other thing, I do lots of live looping, lots of synths and occasionally work with a drummer as well and do lots of live looping so really constructing on the fly. But just using Ableton Live and Reaktor to do most of that. AUDIENCE MEMBER Is that what you use to do the loops, Reaktor? QUA I’m using Ableton Live more and more now. NICK DWYER Any more questions for Cornel? Well, if you guys want to come up and have a look at this a bit closer and what have you and maybe have it explained a bit more at length, then I’m sure Cornel wouldn’t mind at all, he’s a lovely guy indeed. But right now can we have a very hearty thank-you very much to Cornel. [applause]

Randy Muller
Randy Muller is the brains behind a stack of 1970s classics. Working with bands such as Brass Construction, BT Express and Skyy, he brought orchestral strings to funk, was at the forefront of synth disco and became a stalwart of the mighty Salsoul label. As an arranger, producer and songwriter Muller has been responsible for hundreds of songs, many of which would go on to become classics and influence his contemporaries.
In this lecture at the 2007 Red Bull Music Academy, he talks about playing steel drums as a child in Guyana, moving to New York and how the city’s public school system acted a breeding ground for musical talent.
Hosted by Monk One With me on the couch today, all the way from Brooklyn, New York City, it’s my pleasure to welcome Mr Randy Muller. [Applause] Actually, Randy, you moved out of Brooklyn, but you’re still a Brooklyn boy
at heart, I guess. Randy Muller Always Brooklyn. Monk One This is a guy who’s done so many songs, he was just telling me, “I had to print out a discography online because he doesn’t remember all the songs I’ve done.” The stuff you were just listening to when you came in were his compositions, numerous other classics of the disco era, the so-called classic club scene of New York in the late ’70s, early ’80s. That music came out of funk, and before that there was a lot of funk that you were involved in and I want to give people some background of
where you started, where you were born, how you came into the scene and what it was like when you were a boy growing up. Randy Muller First of all, I want to thank you guys for inviting me. This is really a cool thing. This is my first time checking out the scene. The Red Bull Music Academy was described to me and I was expecting a very Harvard/Yale/back-to-school set-up, so to come in here. I just got off the plane, my bags are behind me here and I haven’t had the chance to go the hotel – but coming here, this is a wonderful, wonderful thing. I wish I had this when I was trying to get into the business. You have the equipment I used to dream about and all these potential collaborators gathered in one space. This is so utopian; I just love it. Only good things can come of this, getting all these creative minds under one roof without the bother of taking out the garbage and going the job. And all the access here, this is just fantastic, so I appreciate you being here. To answer the question of how I got started, well, I was born in Guyana, down in South America, right next to Venezuela. It’s 83,000 square miles, a small country. I started out just banging on the stairs because we had no instruments and I love percussion. In a lot of places in the Caribbean, we had these small wooden stairs going up, and I would find the tone on each step [gestures banging stairs] “dunng, dunng, dunng.” It wasn’t so perfectly tuned, but after school I would sit there with some coconut oil on my skin and try to make music. But what happened later on, I remember getting steel drums. The bands were very big and the professional bands would throw out the steel pans… they had no more use for them, they didn’t sound so good. I would go and collect the old steel drums from the garbage and I retuned them and formed my first band. I took the drums, got some guys together and we started playing those songs on them. I think it was really cool and that’s when I first started getting into the music business in a way. I had this entrepreneurial idea, “Guys, we can make some money from this…” I decided we could play Christmas carols. We could play “Silent Night” and they’d give us some money. It was a penny, two pennies, there was no union scale. It was a great idea. Some people felt sorry for us and gave us a few pennies. But I guess, I wasn’t a great marketing guy because it was the middle of August and Christmas carols in the middle of August is not too saleable, it’s not so cool. I guess, they felt sorry for these little kids and gave us a few pennies. But that’s how I started playing on the steel drums, then I left Guyana and came to Brooklyn, New York. I thought it was such a cool place: America, the streets are paved with gold. I was telling someone the other day, I did see a sparkly street, not realizing they had this new asphalt here, where they grind up the glass. “Wow, the golden streets.” So, Brooklyn was almost like a movie set for me. I lived on Hart Street but my window was right near the sidewalk. The first time I came into Kennedy
Airport, I was whisked into the city and saw these lights. This is America, big lights. I was in my room and I could hear guys singing in the streets these four-part harmonies [sings]. I just thought, “Wow, America is so cool.” Monk One When was this? Randy Muller This was the ’60s, about 1964. It was unbelievable. The guys had the do-rag and the processed hair, and were walking around singing cool harmonies. So, after that, I graduated from banging on the stairs and used my grandma’s dinner plates and started banging on them like a xylophone. The big plates made the lower sounds and the little plates gave the higher sounds. I was in public school and I remember getting my first guitar. I used to pass a pawn shop and I saw this guitar for $16 – this is big time. I know when my grandmother bought me the guitar I didn’t want to sleep, I just wanted to stay up playing songs. Around that time I got the flute. They asked you in school which instrument you want to play, and I wanted to play the flute so badly, because when I was in Guyana there was this old guy named George. He was kind of a homeless guy, but he lived across the street in this little village and every Christmas he played “Silent Night” – I guess that’s where I got the “Silent Night” from – and it was so cool, because I was waiting up to see Santa for myself, and all of a sudden, I hear this beautiful music that sounds so great. I wanted to be like George. I just made my first flute solo album because of this guy. People said, “He’s just a bum, he’s just a homeless guy.” But it just shows you never know what kind of influences you’re going to get, and up to now I love this instrument with a passion. So, I got my start from nothing fancy, just tried to use what was around me. Later on, I had a little band, I played guitar with another fellow, we used to play talent shows at school. We thought it was cool because we’d get a lot of girls that way and we sang all the hot songs. A guy from Puerto Rico, name of Joseph Felicia – I don’t know where he is, I’ve not seen him since we were kids – but we made a lot of music together. Then I went into junior high school and this is where the whole thing of taking recorded music seriously started. I put together a talent show in junior high school and I was writing songs – stuff I wrote on my plates – and I wanted to get a couple of guys with me. I took band [class], we had some guys in the band, pretty cool trumpet guy, and I thought I’d put these guys together for this talent show. I needed a bassist, a drummer and so on… so, we got these guys together and started playing these tunes. There was one guy who’s now a big-time actor – I saw him on some good movie. What’s his name? Goldberg. I can’t remember his first name, Michael Goldberg, that’s it… great trumpet player. We took guys who were in the school band and I had my own after-school program. I had four trumpet guys, two sax players, just playing around and getting some songs together for a concert. Pretty much that’s what evolved into a group called Dynamic Souls and Brass Construction. Monk One What bands were you listening to at the time that gave you the inspiration to work with brass sections like that? Randy Muller I always loved brass and there was a lot of interest in the calypso sound, the Caribbean bands. I listened to a lot of Mighty Sparrow and these guys had great horn sections. But I also loved the big-band sound, the Duke Ellington sound and Count Basie. In a country like Guyana – and I saw this happen in England when I went there in
the late ’70s… you had real broadcasting. In Guyana we had this station – and the population was mixed between Indian, the black population, Chinese and everything – but I had to listen to a few hours of Hindu programming before I’d hear the funk, and I was introduced to other types of music and sounds. I think it was great, it helped me so much as an arranger. I’d listen to Jim Reeves, country music, Glenn Miller, all this old stuff, any kind of big band. I had a shortwave radio and we’d hear music late at night from wherever; you know when it goes “Whoo-oooh-ooh,” and some guy with a megaphone-sounding voice. I used to love just tuning in to hear whatever exciting stuff I could find in the middle of the night. Monk One Did you hear the Latin bands that were big at the time? Randy Muller Yes, yes, but I didn’t even know their names. I’d just hear them late at night, and it sounded so cool. It’s a cool place, wherever that music is coming from, I want to be there and I want to do that. It was a very interesting time and it made an impression on me. Monk One At this time you were about to go into high school. Had you already started at Jefferson? Randy Muller We put the talent show together in seventh grade in George Gershwin Junior High. It’s funny how I went to Jefferson because Caribbean culture, or at least my family, doesn’t see music as something valuable. It’s like me telling them I want to be a robber when I tell my father I want to be a musician. It’s like a joke – anything to do with the arts, it’s not valued. If you say, “I want to be an artist,” it’s the worst thing you can say. “Are you kidding me? You need a job, something that will help mankind: doctor, lawyer,” something fancy like that, highbrow stuff. I had to satisfy both ends, and my dad was a pretty cool guy. The guy used to embarrass me sometimes. I’d go to gigs, and people would be like, “There goes your dad, he’s on the floor, girls around him, Mr Cool.” Him going, “That’s my son.” I felt like hiding behind my drum set. But he’s the one who got me into professional music. He introduced me to his friends and I joined a professional steel band. Steel drums, but they had a drum set and a Fender bass, an Ampeg amp. It was an interesting mix for that time, 1967, a guitar with a steel band, it was pretty hip. They were called the Panharmonics, and they were pretty successful in the area, we played all the Caribbean gigs, boat rides and bus rides. But to tell your family that you wanted to do music was a big thing, so I made a deal with my dad. He said, “You keep your grades up, you can play.” So, that’s what I did, I’d be backstage at gigs doing my homework, then do the show. It worked out, but music was not a thing that was much desired in that culture. It’s like saying, “I’m a failure as a parent. My kid wants to play music.” But, I guess it worked out. Monk One You told me you were accepted at a high school for high academic achievers, but it wasn’t a music school. Randy Muller Yeah, I was supposed to go to tech, which was a cool all-boys school where all the big brains went. They all went there and then to MIT afterwards to do great things for mankind, and I lied to my grandmother and said I didn’t pass the test because all the cool guys were going to the other high school. So, I went there and we had lots of music, beautiful girls, it was great. And a very supportive teacher. He saw what I was doing at a very young age – I would write scores, I taught myself to write just by reading books and observing. The steel drum was one of the best things I could’ve played because it taught me about chords. If I wanted to do a major 7th, it was, “OK, you hold an A and a C, you hold a C and an E, you hold an F and an A, and you get a voicing of a certain chord.” So, I learned how to put them together, serendipitously this whole thing grew. I was able to translate that so when I was voicing horns or strings it’s the same kind of process [gestures working out chords]…
You find out these things about textures and making a certain voice speak. The steel drum, something that seems so simple and primitive, was very instrumental in learning about music theory and how to construct things. I learned about dovetailing brass and making a sound big, wide and open, which is something I did – I only had four guys but sometimes you make them sound really big by open voicing. So, it was very interesting in those days, and the teacher took an interest in me. I would have questions about theory and harmony and he’d take me after school to check out a group playing somewhere. I remember Rahsaan Roland Kirk playing at the Carnegie, so we’d go and check it out. He didn’t have to do that, it wasn’t part of the curriculum, but he had an interest in what I was doing. And in the school band, we played “The Kid From Red Bank,” some Basie tune, and we’d just get interesting music to play. I had a pretty good support system. I was just doing a radio show the other day and they asked me about advice for kids and what has changed. It was a Brooklyn station, and I was talking about how vibrant the public school system was in New York City, how fantastic it was in producing these bands at that time. We had Crown Heights Affair, BT Express… Monk One A lot of great jazz bands… Randy Muller A lot of great cats came out of that, and that was the public school system. There was a connection between what we do as musicians, it does something to the mind… we’re multi-lingual, we talk a language other people can’t get into [lists chord changes as an example]. We could do these translations in our heads. That skill can be translated to mathematics and language and other things. Most lawyers I know, they want to be musicians and musicians want to be lawyers. The grass is always greener. But it’s wonderful for the mind, especially music, I can speak about that from experience. You exercise your mind and thinking, and there’s logic involved, a certain kind of reasoning. We look at dots on a piece of paper, and make sense of that and we can make people laugh, and cry and move their body. We’re taking frequencies and mixing them in a certain order and form and affecting human emotion. This is powerful stuff; we have special powers. [Applause] We do. This is big stuff! Politicians only dream about having that sort of power. That’s why those political ads have the music behind it to pull the emotion. We know how to do that well, we know the notes and frequencies. Monk One I want to play some of the first recordings you worked on. Not too far out of high school, you formed Brass Construction, and I think we can hear your horn arrangement here. It’s pretty intense. Randy Muller You’re going to surprise me… (music: Brass Construction – “Take It Easy” /applause) Randy Muller Oh, my God. I feel like This Is Your Life. I think I was in high school when we did this. Oh, my God. Monk One One thing that’s fun, you seem to be showing your chops off, making the horn section as crazy as possible. Randy Muller I think we had a lot of influences from jazz. People may not associate the group with funk, and they’re not a funk group, but I love the horns of Chicago. Early on, if you listen to my very first album – the album with “Movin’” – the lyrics are very sparse. We sang hooks and change. I wasn’t into lyrics. This track was still the time of Chicago, I loved their horns, and I loved Blood, Sweat & Tears.
Very hot. Tower of Power and Mandrill were very influential, I enjoyed “Mango Meat” and all those songs. So in those days you had to show you had your chops. There were certain licks the drummer had to play, you’ve got to do that. But I love the glaring horns, I love the power of it. Monk One Was this when you met Jeff Lane? Randy Muller Yeah, I met him in high school. Monk One Can you explain who he was? Randy Muller He was a local producer who was forming a little production company. One of the guys went to school with his daughter and told him about me and he wanted to meet me because we were getting pretty hot around the neighborhood. In those days Brooklyn had a wonderful infrastructure for live music. I’d go during the week, because I was the guy who got the gigs. The guy would say, “Come in on Thursday, and we’ll give you a try.” No pay. You’d go, you’d play, they’d like you, book you for Saturday. Brass Construction, because we were too young to drive, we’d take the subway – the whole band would go to the gig on a train. All your boys would come and help you carry the drum and custom amplifier. It was crazy. I look back and think I don’t believe we did this. Until we got big-time, and would all fit in one van and go to the gig. If you bring your girlfriend, you’ve got to squeeze her in, and we’re all in the back of the van. Some people didn’t want to pay so they’d come with to get in free, help us lift the stuff, that was the deal. Anyway, Jeff was a local producer and I guess he heard about us and Morris was going to school with his daughter. I met him, and he was doing gospel music with Nat Kennedy. I can’t say it was hokey, but you look back and say, “Wow, he did that!” The lyrics would be him having a bad day and everything’s going wrong and a bird would do some droppings on him and the lyric would go, “I’m so glad a damned cow can’t fly.” [Laughs] I did some stuff with Jeff and had a lot of fun, learned some things. We went to the studio, there was an engineer called John Bradley. In those days it was 16-track, and so we learned how to group the stuff together. You took the horns and there was a lot of bouncing. Monk One Can you explain what bouncing is? Randy Muller You combine the tracks. Let’s say you have 16 tracks, but you got 20 different things to put down. Today we’re so spoiled, you’ll have ten tracks for drums. But in those days, you had the kicks separate and the drums would be like two tracks, maybe one: actually maybe three; the kick in one, then everything else and another for stereo. If push comes to shove, we’ll mix it down, combine everything and make it permanent on one track, which frees up the other tracks that were taking up the space. Then, we have four horns, you play the horns
twice, that takes up eight tracks. So maybe you blend them in and bounce them down to how you think they should be sounding on the record. You balance them; more horns, more trumpet, whatever. That’s basically what bouncing is, you’re taking multiple tracks and funneling them down to one. The thing with it is that if you do a lot of bouncing, you get tape hiss. Monk One That kind of thing is not an issue anymore. Randy Muller Not any more, you have enough tracks. Sometimes I think it’s great and helps with the experimental aspect of composing. But sometimes I look and see guys with 20 tracks of drums and stuff. In the old days, you had to get it right early on. That’s why being literate and doing charts was important. Today, it’s more like freeform. “I’m not feeling that kick right now, I’m going to change the kick, put something else. Put another one under it, get a loop going.” We had nothing like that. You sync it down, that’s it, it’s over. So you have to know what you’re doing. It’s a more strategic approach to production. Even the tempo, you couldn’t change tempo in those days. You didn’t go, “It’s 120. I don’t like that, maybe 123.” Back then, no. Your tempo didn’t change a bit. And if the tempo went up and down, the drummer would get excited. But that’s how it was, there was a permanence to your work. Also, you’d do five songs in a session. In those days, you had live players, you had to pay these guys. Having strings was big-time; those were union guys, serious musicians. You can’t just say, “Give me a bit of this, ‘da da da.’” You’re getting charged for it, and these guys know what they’re doing and they’re looking at the clock. After time, it’s double-time and it brings up the budget of your record. So, you have to know what you’re doing and plan. Arranging was key. Now you hear something, and it’s, “Nah, I’ll change that. I’ll take a sample from some place, I’ve changed my mind. Turn the strings into horns.” There’s value to that as well. Both ways have their charm, I guess. Monk One Getting back to what Jeff did, he brought you in to work on arrangements. Randy Muller Actually, I never did string arrangements before in my life until Jeff said, “Muller, I want some strings on this track by Wednesday.” “I never did strings, I did horns.” “You’re smart, you’ll find out, by Wednesday. Just tell me what you need.” “Oh, my God, I don’t know how to do this.” So, I went to my professor and said, “Tell me about the violin.” “What do you want to know?” “Please, tell me about the violin.” So he said, “Well, there’s the clef, and you can do this and that and ‘blah, blah, blah’, and it sounds like this on the piano if you write it here.” And I go, “OK.” He said, “What do you need?” I said, “Give me five violins and two violas.” I didn’t know what I was doing, I was embarrassed. So now I have to write the charts that I didn’t write with a piano. I was getting some ear training and some scales, and I remember when I was writing for the gospel stuff, I got a guy from school called Jeffrey Steinhurst, to write this stuff out. It was like guesswork; I don’t know what the hell I was doing. We did the song, put the track on, and it sounded good, just like I heard it in my head. I was like, “Yes! This is so cool.” And I started to develop the language of writing. I remember the song “Express” and Jeff would be, “I need some strings on this.” I’d be writing it at my grandmother’s table without a piano, and I’d hear it in my head. That’s why those string parts in “Express” were so simple. But I wasn’t finished and he was outside my house blowing his horn [makes sound of car horn]. That’s why I missed simple little lines. That’s how the track came about and became a gold album or whatever it was. Monk One So BT Express was more like a funk band… this was what, ’74, ’75? Randy Muller ’72. Monk One So, he had the idea he was going to put strings over this thing. Kind of an unusual concept. Randy Muller At the time, very different. Monk One But the boy genius can invent a string section. So, let’s listen to what you came up with while he was blowing his horn at your grandmother’s house. (music: BT Express – “Express”) Monk One The crazy thing is that song went onto become a huge, huge smash, right? [Applause] And the other crazy thing is that song kicked off a whole style of groups who suddenly wanted to put string sections on their funk. Randy Muller That’s true, there was Silver Convention. You had that thing we called the “fall off,” where that string goes [makes sharp upwards movement], I don’t think anyone did it before. I serendipitously stumbled into it because I was used to doing horns. I wanted a horn blast, so I just wrote this thing on the paper and it became one of my musical rigidities. Monk One Check out if you guys can hear it. (music: Silver Convention – “Fly Robin, Fly”) Monk One So, there you are not knowing what you’re doing, writing strings that sound like horns, and then you’ve got people all around the world copying you. Randy Muller That’s what music is about, you’ve got interchange and exchange. We talk to each other over oceans and geography, and this is what goes on. We’re part of the times. We were saying something new then. It’s part of an almost Darwinian process, where the best ideas surface and someone grabs it and runs with it. It becomes something like public property. You can’t just say, “I’ll do a cool beat and no one else can do it.” It’s going to go out in the main. It’s a compliment, I’m flattered that someone steals something of mine. In music we speak to each other, there’s so much cross-pollination that goes on, I think it’s beautiful. Monk One Talking of cross-pollination, I want to play another Brass Construction song that probably everyone has heard before. (music: Brass Construction – “Movin’”) Randy Muller Well, it’s funny, in those days we didn’t think of sampling, we weren’t thinking legalistically, we didn’t think about it in those days. But in retrospect we do see the similarities. Today, the publishers would’ve had a great big battle with that one, it’s very similar. Monk One I heard a rumor that Motown wanted to sign Brass Construction at one point. Randy Muller I remember getting phone calls, it was actually from Jobete, the publishing division. I still have the contract in my house. I signed it but I never mailed it in because I changed my mind, the vibe just said no. All the guys signed it, had it ready to mail out. They were very interested in what we were doing, and we had a very different sound at the time. They had the group Rare Earth in their stable, and they wanted another horn funk band. I would get phone calls at school telling me to be at the phone booth at two o’clock, and they would talk to me and send me songs. I think they were more interested in us recording songs from their catalog, but yeah, maybe things would have been different. We never turned their contract in and ended up going with United Artists in the end. Monk One Your songs at that time were instrumentals. Randy Muller Mostly instrumentals. Jeff pushed me to put words in there, but I was an instrumental guy, I just loved the music part. I remember listening to the all the stuff from Thom Bell, a brilliant arranger, but I could sing the third cello part or the third trumpet part, I would listen that closely to the records because I liked to hear what’s going on back there. But Jeff would tell me to add some words to these songs, that it would make the song more commercial. You notice our records, they’re all verbs “Movin’,” “Changin’,” “Talkin’,” “Dancin’,” it was all verbs. We had this theme that ran through the songs, but I just made it up, like, “OK, “Sittin’.” [Laughs] Now, I would like to sit here and tell you about the great deliberation of my music, it’s deep – well, no, it’s very spontaneous. Monk One Around this time the vibe of what was popular in music was changing, and you can hear on those early records that the four-on-the-floor kick is coming in, as opposed to the syncopated style. Randy Muller You had the Motown sound where they had that slick polished thing going on with great arrangements. I think Brass and BT were the first bands to make that street funk, like if James Brown had strings. We took that rawness of the street sound and merged it with the polish of the strings and the fancy horns. The strings were the more revolutionary element. It was funny because on the first album there was a song called “Changin’”… and I remember still being in school, learning about technique and hearing about a thing called contrary motion in theory. So, I would take all the homework and practice them in the songs. It was displacement, “I’ll take this and shift it here.” I would do all these little techniques that I’d learn in class and incorporate these techniques into my arrangements. I like “Changin’” so much because I was using all these things I learnt in class like contrary motion displacement, all these techniques. Monk One Shall we give it a listen and you can point out what you’re talking about? (music: Brass Construction – “Changin’”) Randy Muller The way we did it, we did the rhythm track of bass drums and guitar and keyboards. We’d have rehearsals in the basement and do some of the parts and then sometimes we would change stuff in the studio. But if it was grooving in the studio, I would just let it groove and then write more stuff around it. Monk One Did you punch-in stuff? Randy Muller Yeah, we did a lot of punching. Muhammad Ali would be proud of us, we did so much punching. It was a vibe thing. The essence of a lot of these tracks is the rhythm track has to be pumping, otherwise we wouldn’t bother with it. I’m a frustrated bass player, I love the bass, I’m big on basslines. We’d have these ostinatos that keep on going and you just write around them. Even the simplicity of the lyrics, in a way I
look back and say it’s good, but sometimes less is more, the abstraction engages people. It’s like a commercial, you say a lot but you’re saying nothing. This time was very significant, you had the war going on. We had a lot of stuff going on socially for the black community, there was the civil rights thing happening, and let me see, Nixon was out, right? We had a lot of things going on in America and globally, and what helped these tracks to resonate around the world was we didn’t get a very static lyric. Just to
say, “Times are changing” – has a certain power to it. “Got myself together and I’m moving on.” It sits with the whole civil rights thing and people trying to get empowered; that was big and they identified with that, it’s an anthem. It seems simple and trite, but you have to put in its social context. “Movin’” still gets a lot of play, I see the ASCAP and BMI stuff, and today we’re going through a change again, politically around the world. I think we need some of this stuff to happen. Monk One That’s interesting advice to lyric writers. Less, in this case, was definitely more, because people can apply their own context to what you put in the songs. Randy Muller Sometimes you can say one word and it will have a lot of power. Just because you put in 300 words, it doesn’t mean more than one word. The beauty of one word is that it has these levels of abstraction. If I say “happiness,” what does that mean? We all have our own concept of what makes us happy, and you can write a ten-page essay on it. You have to look at it that way. Monk One Do you think the same thing can be applied to music in terms of complexity of music expression? Randy Muller That’s a deep question, man. I see with the loops and stuff you get a one-bar loop, two-bar loops, just changing the ornamentation is what’s happening there. You’re dealing more with sonic spaces, like colors and textures, a pastiche of sound, just getting a raggedy–sounding drum beat and putting something else with it, making a kind of musical gumbo. I think it’s just as powerful. I like what’s happening with music today, a lot of great things are happening. I know a lot of the old guys are saying, “They don’t make it like they used to,” and the old guys before them were saying the same. This is part of it, it comes with the territory, it’s not a static thing. We react to changes in our society, we’re a product of our times. Someone asked me the other day, “Who are you?” I spotted my definition of self. I’m a product of all the radio I listened to and all the movies and all the songs. I’m a product of my media experience, I’m a product of my calypso music back then, I’m a product of James Brown and Aretha Franklin and Duke Ellington and Mighty Sparrow. I put them all in one space and they speak and came up with something new. What’s happening here? We don’t have to get deep about it, but the same revolution and changes we’ve seen happen in music are happening in art and even politics. Everyone’s going for the little soundbite and icons to express greater ideas. We use little samples and that sound brings a certain emotion to the song. Sometimes you want something to sound grainy and straggly. It’s like using film versus video, it gives you a different look. Using color or black and white; it’s the same object, but if you put it in a certain space, then the emotional response becomes very different. As producers and writers, you think about these things and make certain decisions how you want to express your thoughts and ideas. What’s good about today is there’s so much access, it’s like having a larger alphabet. We have 26 letters we can use and all these words, so imagine all the colors we can paint with via a larger palette. We can become more precise in our expressions. We don’t just want green, we want a certain type of green. We don’t want 20bpm, we want 20.5bpm. We can speak with more precision musically and artistically. In the old days, if I had a song idea, I had to have money to manifest it make it happen. There were no string synthesizers, in the old days a piano was a piano – you had to have enough physical space for it to make it happen. Now you can have a small space and make big-sounding music. There’s no economic barrier. In the old days, I wanted strings, I had to pay big-time union guys. Now we can do amazing things with samplers and so on. The old music is great, it has its charm as well, but it’s like saying all the great movies have been made back in the 1960s, all the great directors have died. No, we’re doing great things visually now as well. You see changes in art, it’s like going from Michelangelo to Picasso or Peter Max in the ’60s, they all have their charm. It’s like, if Peter Max would say, “Ah, Van Gogh is terrible.” And Van Gogh would say, “Oh, Peter Max, you don’t know how to draw a straight image… Picasso, your stuff is all twisted.” There are different ways of expressing things, we even have different thoughts; our politicians now talk to us using certain symbolism. I don’t know if that’s lazy, but you see a certain connection, so it’s not a static thing. So, getting back to the point, there was good music back then… you’re responding, you’re a product of your experiences and what’s inside you. You are who you are, and I think that’s good. Monk One For a lot of us, many of our media experiences in music were informed by stuff that came out in the late ’70s, disco etc, and many of those were arrangements came from you. Some of the great songs and club tracks in New York in the ’70s and early ’80s. You filtered your Mighty Sparrow and Duke Ellington down, and now the music you made entered our collective consciousness and is informing the music we make, whether we’re reacting against it or working with it. Randy Muller This isn’t a philosophy class, but as human beings we like to have maps, we need something that guides us. We have to have an operating system to make sense of what’s around us. We don’t like being without maps, that’s why we have religion, to explain the inexplicable. “The gods are angry.” Then another guy says, “No, it’s not the gods, whatever.” We need to understand what’s going on around us, so we have maps. In music, it’s the same thing. I like to think I did it all on my own, but no, I had George. People said he was a useless old man, a drunk playing the flute, but he informed me up to now. I’m still carrying George’s voice. The trick is to try to get good maps to follow, good solid maps. What is a solid map? We take a certain chance. I try to listen to a variety of music. I don’t just stick to my local hip-hop station, I listen to all sorts of stuff. I just did a smooth jazz album… very different to the stuff you just heard. I did some hip-hop stuff, I did a relaxed album full of birds and sounds, using atmosphere. From that to the other stuff is a wide spectrum, stuff with no kick drum. Monk One No kick drum? Wait a minute, I need a kick drum. I want to talk about stuff with a heavy kick drum. Let’s get off the philosophy cloud for a minute and talk about fun stuff. After you had big success with Brass Construction, can you tell us about some of your experiences meeting the Salsoul, Prelude, Patrick Adams, Peter Brown, midtown Manhattan, there were an incredible number of amazing dance records coming out at that time. A lot of that stuff was centered on a small number of players. What was that scene like, before the Paradise Garage? Randy Muller It was very, very exciting times. I’d be in the city doing sessions with the musicians and come out and see Patrick Adams. It’s funny how I met the Cayres – the guys who owned Salsoul – because I’d just taken my life savings out and
decided to record this group Skyy. I did a lot of it while I was on the road with Brass [Construction], come back, record at night, get a cheap rate, didn’t have the full budget. Anyway, I shopped it and got turned down – “We’re not hearing it, we’re not hearing it” – and I said to my girlfriend, “I’ve lost everything, my life savings on this group and nobody’s buying it.” Then one day I’m looking through Billboard [magazine], at the hot labels, and I see Salsoul and decide to go and see them on Monday, find these Salsoul people and get a deal. I remember doing a session the following week and someone saying, “Let’s go by
this guy’s place.” All the producers hang out there and all the musicians: Patrick Adams, the Philly guys, Norman Harris… But guys, I was new in the business, relatively speaking – I went there and walked in and the guy said, “This is the guy.” That’s how I met Ken Cayre, the guy I’m trying to make a deal with. The guy walked up to me and said, “Oh, my God, I’ve been looking for you.” I didn’t go out that much, I was always busy in the studio. It’s funny, he approached me and I said, “I have this group,” he said to come by the office, and the rest is history. I did get a deal with Skyy and made several albums with them. It was real exciting times; music was alive. I recorded at Blank Tape Studios, Larry Levan was doing his thing and the Paradise Garage was big… Monk One Can you tell us about the Garage? Did you actually take unfinished stuff there? Randy Muller I would sometimes take an acetate over and test it out in the club. Larry Levan and the guys would be playing, and sometimes you’ve got to wait until late in the set; they won’t play the new stuff early on because they’ve got to get the crowd right. So, I’d have to wait until 3am, all the cool people are coming in, the DJs. I didn’t really like hanging out late like that, but I wanted to see how they’d react to my record. There were some very friendly guys in the booth, it was an open, free-spirited place and guys came up to me and embraced me. This was a really cool DJ guy, I didn’t want to insult him, so I tried to engage the best I could. But it was a cool place, we had a DJ called Frankie Crocker in New York, who was the hottest DJ, he broke records. I think he was very much responsible for the success of Brass [Construction], a lot of that stuff. Because radio at the time didn’t go in for a whole lot of research. They’d play it, that’s it, it was bottom-up kind of approach. We had guys like Sylvester coming up at that time. Monk One So, Frankie was also hanging out in the booth? He would see the reaction to whatever was playing, and if it was hot, he’d turn around and play it on the radio next week. Randy Muller Exactly, it was a great testing ground for new stuff and a lot of wonderful things came out of there. Monk One Did you ever change your songs as a result? Randy Muller Yeah, if the kick wasn’t loud enough or you need to bring up the guitar or whatever. Sometimes, you’d go back and make the adjustments. Sometimes you wouldn’t have to touch it, you would go right away into pressing. Monk One I want to play one of the tracks from Skyy and I wonder if maybe afterwards you can tell us about this song and how it came to be. (music: Skyy – “Here’s To You” / applause) Randy Muller That’s a blast from the past. Monk One That’s got to be a masterpiece. What can you tell us about making it? Randy Muller That’s a very special record to me, it’s a very positive record. It was about my girlfriend, my wife at the time. But what’s interesting about it is the great musicians. The Skyy rhythm section is one of the best I’ve worked with, Tommy on drums, Solomon’s a
great guitarist and Denise became the sound of the group. Monk One That was the first song she did? Randy Muller Denise was like the third harmony background in the group. There were three sisters, the singing part of Skyy, and prior to that we featured her sister who had a smoother, softer voice, and I remember thinking, “Why isn’t Denise singing lead?” So this record is the first to feature her lead vocal, which went on to be the sound of the group. But Gerald Lebon, the bass player, is really hot; I loved working with the group, great musicians. We went on to do stuff with Cameron, I used the Skyy rhythm section on all those tracks, we became a unit. I’m spontaneous, but I still like a structure, so what I’ll do is sit at a Rhodes, I’ll have a mic, everyone has their can. I generally don’t like the group to know the song too much in advance. I would sit with Denise and get a sense of the key. I don’t like to rehearse the vocals too much, give the guys the bassline so they can get the feel, then go in the studio without too much rehearsing, give the guys instructions over the cans. “Cymbals here… bam… let’s go.” We were just talking and rocking, and it comes out spontaneous, you can hear the life in the track. Everything locks, you get a great chemistry, the Skyy guys are great. And that’s a really cool, happy track and it’s memorable to me for Denise’s performance. Monk One You used the Skyy rhythm section on other projects, so you were getting other work at this time. Randy Muller I did some stuff with Tamiko Jones, I used them for Cameron. We were just a good unit, we locked well. And after a while, they knew what I liked. Most of my records, I hit my cymbals on the second beat of the measure – even in my new one, there’s something about that two I like, just put the crash on the two – it just pushes the beat a bit more. So, Tommy knew my hits, how I like the drums to flow… Monk One Were these the same guys who played on the Charles Earland stuff? Randy Muller That’s right, he played on Charles Earland. What’s the name of the song, “Let The Music Play?” Monk One We’ll hear a bit of that, but I want you to tell them about when you were rehearsing to make this. (music: Charles Earland – “Let The Music Play” / applause) Monk One This came out under Charles Earland’s name and it’s called “Let The Music Play.” Was that the Skyy girls in the background? Randy Muller Yes, I totally forgot about that song. Charles Earland is a very respected jazz organist… he’s done some great things, and at that time the dance thing was happening and everyone was going club so the company wanted to go into that market. They called me to hip him up, so I did and had a wonderful time working with Charles. He’s no longer with us, but he’s a brilliant cat. I recall a very interesting experience when we were rehearsing. We were in Detroit, he’d played in the club the night before and I flew in just to get things going, and he had his band there. Some of my charts are pretty hard, and I noticed one guy just fell out, the bass player just fell to the ground. “What’s this about?” Then the guitar guy fell to the ground. “What’s going on?” Suddenly, I was started feeling dizzy and it turned out we had a gas leak in the club and we almost collapsed and died. The gas had no odor, and I was thinking it’s the effect of the music, “This is amazing! The guys were dropping like flies.” I found myself going, and a guy was shouting, “Guys, get out, get out.” Someone came in and opened a door and we went to the hospital. Anyway, Charles… great guy, haven’t heard that track in a while and it sounds good. Monk One Another you played on was this one. (music: Tamiko Jones – “Can’t Live Without Your Love” / applause) Monk One That’s Tamiko Jones and “Can’t Live Without Your Love.” Randy Muller Yeah, wow. Monk One You definitely had some interesting keyboard and synth textures. You came up at a time when there was a transition from more traditional keyboards right up and through the full-on synthesizer era. Can you tell us about the transition, but first of all about what you used? Randy Muller For that record, for the “dugga-dugga” 16th thing in the back, I used a regular Clavinet and we put it through an MXR phase shifter, and we get
the big wide open sound. I think there was also a Fender Rhodes playing in the bottom along with Arp strings. Monk One You used the Oberheim? Randy Muller Yeah, for a lot of the tracks I used the Matrix 12, which gave you a lot
of fat sounds. As a matter of fact, that Skyy “Here’s To You,” that [makes synth noise] was the Matrix thing, the OB-8 was really on a Matrix 12 there, that was used a lot. But there was a time when we went through this change, and it was interesting because I came from that big horn
tradition and all of a sudden no one wants to hear horns. The guitar went out, the DX-7 came in, then all of a sudden, we had the Linn drum, the DMX drum, then the Linn drum, and also the Doctor Rhythm, going way back [laughs], and also the 808 and the 909, which are classic pieces now. But to me, the 808, 909, these are supposed to be real drum sounds, which they
failed at, but they finally came up with something which was a thing unto its own self. I remember Linn saying, “This sounds like real drums.” No, it’s not, but it filled a certain space and worked. Now the dance community took it up and the 909 sound became really cool for dance music, and then the 808, which even the rap cats were using, there was something about that. But, all of a sudden, horns weren’t happening, guitars were definitely out, it was anti-groove. But in rock music, they kept the guitars, kept the live drums. But in R&B, we moved into a very techno sound, very hip, got into technology a bit more. I remember with Brass Construction, it was brass, get it? You’ve got to use the brass. But it’s not happening, so we did a couple of albums where we didn’t use as much brass, we put it in a secondary, even tertiary stage in the production. “OK, we’re a brass band but we’re hip, too, and we try to get that sound.” Every so often you go through a cycle where a sound becomes popular. There was the Syndrum, “poow-poow,” remember [Anita Ward’s] “Ring My Bell?” You had
to have your Syndrum. We did a record “First Time Around” by Skyy on the first album, Larry Levan did the mix and his remix was Syndrum, man, almost the whole record [makes Syndrum noises]. It was like a Syndrum solo, because
that was the hot sound, it meant you were hip, so we plastered it with Syndrums to make it happen. The old analogue sounds weren’t hip anymore and technology was new, exciting and sexy and we got into that. So, you’ll hear some records that use more technology. Brass [Construction] did a record called “Walking the Line”, where we used more of the keyboards on the records. It was a very tough time for the acts, the traditional fans want you to sound the way you’re supposed to sound, but the general market is saying, “No, we don’t want that.” So, I tried to write more in the middle, but it was difficult. The guitars weren’t happening, so the keyboards were taking the place of the guitar. A lot of funk bands weren’t happening in the charts. Some big funk bands, like Earth, Wind & Fire made the transition, Kool & The Gang did, they got a new singer who was a bit more vocal. Kool & The Gang used to have some killer stuff, like “Hollywood Swinging,” just some amazing stuff. I used to love their stuff, some serious jazz stuff, too, but they shifted and got into more vocals and they became very successful with great records that topped the pop charts, not just the R&B charts. Monk One So what do you do, if you’re in that situation where you’ve been very successful with a certain style and now that style is just not considered hip any more? You’re Brass Construction, this producer comes in and says, “Your last record didn’t do that great, I think it’s because brass isn’t hip anymore. You need to call yourselves DX-7 Construction…” What do you do? Randy Muller We tried to handle it. We had a similar situation with some of the Skyy stuff. I remember some of the later records, it was, “You’ve got to get with what the kids are doing, we’ll get some of the kids in to write some stuff.” I found out a lot of it didn’t work, because it’s like trying to get your dad who’s 55 years old, and he puts on some new clothes and goes to the club and tries to be hip. But it doesn’t work, because it’s still your dad trying to be hip. So, we tried to maintain our sound. You could do things with the content of the song, make the lyrics a little more street relevant, a little more in-the-now. Like a guy speaking old English, saying, “thee,” “thy” and “thou.” OK, we don’t say “thee,” “thy” and “thou” any more, you just use more modern parlance, you say the same thing in a different way. You get some of the more modern instruments, you cooperate a little bit, you can make a marriage of it. Skyy were very good, we didn’t have too many horns, it wasn’t a horn-based band, we used them a bit when we needed that voice. But these guys were very good rock musicians, they used to prefer playing rock & roll stuff, they used to be called Fuel before then and they could do serious rock stuff. But, for commercial reasons, we said, “No, we’ve got a groove, let’s do this.” So, we did that, but without losing our identity. It’s a tough thing because you have to think, “Do I do what they want me to do or what I want to do?” The whole point is to sell records. I can make records all day that will please
me, and my boys around the block will think I’m the greatest guy in the world. But then you go into the market and you’re talking to yourself. You have to do something that will engage people, that seems relevant, that’s engaging enough for them to go in their pockets and buy that song. There are other songs out there, and they don’t have a billion dollars, they may only have $20. What am I going to spend my $20 on, this song or this song? You try to make it engaging enough that they buy your song. You have to always consider the market. “Who am I speaking to? What’s my audience?” If I’m going to speak to a Spanish guy, I may speak brilliant Latin or French, but you have to speak in his language to get through to him… it has to be engaging. It all has to do with the instrumentation and the colors of the track. It’s an interesting
question. Monk One So, around that time, the mid-’80s, late ’80s, when you were theoretically going out of style, you were actually coming back into style in the form of being sampled. There are plenty of tracks that were sampled that, but here’s one good example. (music: Skyy – “High”) Monk One What were you trying to do there with the strings? Randy Muller Well, it’s called “High,” so I thought of taking off. It’s kind of corny, but that’s what I had in mind. You say high, you think of flying, so we tried to reinforce that idea. Monk One Well, it works, and, obviously, a lot of other people picked up on it, whether it’s the bass drum or the groove, the way the whole thing locked together. Randy Muller I liked this song, it’s one of my favorites with Skyy. Sometimes you write a song and it’s OK, it’s not exactly what you had in mind. But this track by Skyy is one of my favorites… really well executed. Monk One Staying with Skyy, when you were almost done, I think it was the Skyyport, the third Skyy album, album, you were telling me you felt the album wasn’t finished, it needed something else. Can you tell us about this? Randy Muller When you do a record, as producers and creators, there has to be a certain kind of honesty. Your boys are around you – “That’s cool, that sounds hype” – but you have to step back and be objective. Your friends want to hype you up, they want to give you good news – “Yo, that’s the bomb” – but you try to step back and be objective. I did a Skyy album, I listened to it and I always have a test: would I buy that album? I thought it’s cool, but it still needs something to pull it together, give it that little bit of rawness. And this album, I went in that day to re-edit that stuff, downstairs where we edit the tapes, and I just said, “No, this record is not working.” I had an idea of what to do. I gave the drummer a beat, got the secretary from the studio, a guy delivering a pizza, I said, “You want to be on a record? Come here.” I had this hook, “No Music,” because there was no music. The bass guy wasn’t there, it was just something I made up just to make the whole thing congeal. So this is the track, it’s called “No Music.” We had a thing called the Skyyzoo [kazoo], and we just put a little melody on top and this is the song. (music: Skyy – “No Music” / applause) Randy Muller That’s the pizza guy doing the clapping. Monk One And that’s what the album needed. I want you to let people know what you’ve been working on these days, but also, if anyone’s got any questions, ask away. So what’s going on? Randy Muller I’m doing a couple of things. As I said, I love the flute and I’ve done a lot of things that feature brass and horns. I always wanted to do something with my flute, something mellow. I was going to do some straight-ahead jazz, but the smooth jazz genre is growing, the new jazz thing is happening, and I wanted to do something different from what I’ve done in the past because there are different aspects. So I decided to form a group called Randy Muller Boom Chang Bang, the weirdest thing, but I love the name. What is a “Boom Chang Bang?’ I don’t know, but it sounds cool, so it’s Randy Muller Boom Chang Bang, and we’ve done this CD. I’m also doing a ’70s funk album, which is exciting because it’s going back to this kind of stuff. It’s an act called Soul Biscuits and that’s going to be with the live stuff, but incorporating the new technology too. It’s going to have live guitar, live drums, the cheesy hooks that I used to do. It’s something I want to do, just go back to basics, go all out to the end, then back to basics. I’m also doing a hip-hop artist called Shadina – that’s more of a Mary J. Blige type of thing, but I think she’s just
a brilliant singer, so I’m working on those albums. Monk One You’ve also worked with Kenny Dope extensively to reissue your back catalogue. I think there are a couple of CDs out… Randy Muller Kenny and I did an album called Randy Muller’s Best. We took a lot of the old stuff, went back and got the 16-track and 24-track masters. Some guys rerelease these compilations and it’s basically the same song on there, just put a bunch of songs on one thing. We decided to go back to the original masters, put some more modern punch on there, it goes through an SSL, which is something we didn’t have in those days. Give it a little more punch, don’t mess around, keep it pure. Kenny did a great job on that, hooked it up, rocked it, couple of edits. So that’s an album out now, Kenny Dope Presents Randy Muller’s Best. Monk One And they can get this stuff where? Randy Muller Oh, it’s like a commercial. My label’s called Plaza Records, you can go to www.plazarecords.com and see also the other stuff we have. Also, Traxsource, for a lot of you guys who are into dance music, that’s a great place to get funky music. You can go to Traxsource and look for Plaza Records. For my smooth jazz stuff, you can go to Wavehill. Or you can go to CDbaby.com, they’ll mail it out to you. The Randy Muller Boom Chang Bang, just came out last week. Monk One So anybody out there got something to say? Hang on, you’ve got to wait for the microphone. Audience Member There’s an obvious progression in the string writing from the early BT Express stuff to Skyy and I wondered if there was a point where you specifically checked out string music. If so, what was it? Randy Muller I love the stuff out of Philly, I love that Philly thing. Thom Bell I listen to a lot. The old Stylistics stuff, oh my god, the arrangements are like butter, wonderful, great writing. I also listen to a lot of Van McCoy, he ended up doing “The Hustle.” He was a great guy, he did a lot of charts around town. But yes, a lot of Thom Bell stuff, I used to listen to it and take it in. I just love that Philly thing later on, just great music. So a lot of strings, not counting the classical stuff I would listen to. Audience Member You mentioned gospel earlier, I wanted to know if you worked with Shirley Caesar? Randy Muller I did an arrangement of a song called “No Charge,” I don’t know if you know that song. Audience Member Yes, I do. Randy Muller “No Charge” was a song where we needed some things. The song’s considered a classic now. It was an honor, I didn’t really know who she was. This person called Shirley Caesar, I didn’t know, but the guy said she’s really big. And it’s such an interesting, honest song about a little guy whose mother wants him to take out the garbage and he wants to charge her… And the mother gives him this list: for the cost of carrying you, no charge, for all these other things, no charge, and she just slams him with this stuff. Great record. Audience Member What was it like working with her? Randy Muller I didn’t know her because she did the vocals before. But last week she was performing at A Night Of Healing, the Rev Shirley Caesar I understand, but I hear she’s a wonderful person. Audience Member So you haven’t been able to meet her all this time? Randy Muller No, no, I’ve never met Shirley Caesar or had a discussion or anything. Audience Member Since you started making music the way people listen to it has changed a lot, from vinyl to iPod. What do you think of that? How does it make people experience music differently? Randy Muller A lot of it’s about the sound. We just put together these blocks of sound. You talk about Phil Spector with his Wall of Sound, we can just do that, we have that ability to lay a bunch of stuff. I just got into using the Stylus, which is really cool, you can get a whole bunch of stuff. I have a track on the Soul Biscuits thing like that. I’ve stayed away from plug-ins, but now I’m starting to use them a bit more, so I got into the
Trilogy and Stylus thing, which are great tools. There’s one track where I used the Stylus and the drummer, integrating the two, going from the drummer to the Stylus and
back again. It’s a weird thing I’ve started to do, because the stylus can give you really live sounding stuff, if you know how to manipulate it properly. I like things really precise, I want my beats a certain way and in some cases, you can get it. With the Stylus Commercial, you can make the tempo go up, put a human touch to it. But I think it’s more of a sound experience. Some songs don’t even have bass, because the frequency spectrum is all taken care of, you can have an 808 or something take care of the bottom of the range so the song has that wide spectrum. I think the average listener is very sophisticated, we got used to good sound today. They may not tell you, “It needs 60hz,” or whatever, but they can say, “I like that one, I don’t like that one.” They’re not going to do an analysis, but they’re very aware of the sound and how it hits them. Before, there was more of an emotional interplay, people were listening and sometimes the lyric was so strong they didn’t care so much about the music carrying it. Today, I think Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation says it all. We’ve got to have a kicking beat, the sound’s got to be right, for dance music and the popular stuff we do, it is like a rhythm nation… Monk One But, in a way, nothing’s changed because you talked about how you guys used to write songs that had to have that low end, they’ve got to be pumping. Randy Muller It’s like, say, we used to drink pure water, then someone puts a little sugar into it and you think, “That tastes good.” So they put a little more in and we got used to the good sound. The whole thing evolves like a Darwinian thing. With sampling we took the best stuff from that period and goosed it up even more and made it stronger. We took four of those things and put them together and got something new. We listen to the sound spectrum and we don’t get too deep into analysis, but we know it needs a little 30hz. With the Skyy stuff, we always used to boost that 60hz or we’d go to the 30, a +2 on the 30, just for the kick on the bass, just to give it that drop. Now if you’re doing rock & roll you don’t get care about the bottom so much, but in R&B that bottom is very important. Audience Member Most of your records we’ve listened to were sampled in the ’90s, but you didn’t get any credit. How do you feel about that? Randy Muller No, some of them we did, we had a very good publishing administrator. That “High” record, Too $hort, the rapper, did a whole record on it. He had the word in the title. Some records slipped through the cracks, but for the most part we did deals with the companies for compensation. Today they’ll give us some credit on it. Some of them, it’s just so long ago, forget about it. Audience Member Could we also listen to some of the new stuff, the hip-hop? Randy Muller Sure. It’s totally different, but there’s a song on there, the title track called “Groovin’ U,” where I wanted to create a very ’70s feel, smooth jazz, yet very raw. You’ll hear “Groovin’ U”, then you’ll hear a house track for which Kenny Dope did a mix. It’s called “Devotion”, where I took a gospel singer, taking quote/unquote smooth jazz and new jazz to another place. It’s very housey. (music: Randy Muller Boom Chang Bang – “Groovin’ U” / applause) Randy Muller This is not done for a dance audience, more of a smooth jazz audience. Monk One Smooth jazz isn’t hip, man. Randy Muller I know. We have another thing called “Standing In The Rain,” just to show you the range of what I’m doing. (music: Randy Muller – “Standing In The Rain” / applause) Randy Muller It’s very different from the first track. You’ll find the Soul Biscuits thing is very different. It’s a very rough draft. This is a song I wrote in high school. The horns aren’t real, I just put in a sampler, which wouldn’t even hold it out. So this is a rough draft of Soul Biscuits “Beautiful Day.” (music: Soul Biscuits – “Beautiful Day”) Randy Muller These are just roughs, it has to be mixed and the sound made stronger. Audience Member Maybe two little things before you go. It’s remarkable to see you embrace working with Kenny Dope so strongly. He’s a guy who has great attention to detail, he can tune a hi-hat for six hours. Could you tell us how you got to know him, the intricacies of his work and if that relates to what you were doing? Randy Muller I don’t really look back to see what I’ve done and realize my connection to other things… I can’t get too specific if you want me to connect my work with someone else. Audience Member Did you find out about The Bucketheads before the check from the publishers was in the mail or afterwards? Randy Muller Kenny had done it before, but they did the right thing and went through the publishers, got the clearance. A lot of old tracks for me are over, they’re done, then someone comes and puts some life into it and recontextualizes the whole track and gives it life for a new generation, which is great, I encourage that. Matter of fact, I’ve been working on taking a bunch of my tracks and giving them, to producers. Those guys want to remix, fine by me, it’s keeping it alive. Audience Member Speaking of keeping it alive, we understand you are a musician, but there’s this keyboard thing set up there. Is that because it looks good… Randy Muller It’s great aesthetics [laughs]. That was just in case I wanted to demo something. Audience Member This could be the case. Monk One Play some chords, man, show us you’re a real musician. [Starts playing / applause] Randy Muller I don’t know what to play, I can’t think of anything. No, this is too jazzy. The thing with the funk thing, you need a good beat and I don’t think I’m in the mood to sing a ballad. But yeah, I’ve been known to play the keyboards now and then. Monk One So if some of you can set up a good beat while Randy’s hanging around here, we might be able to entice him to get into the studio. But, for now, I’d like to thank Randy for coming down here. [Applause]

Recloose
The story of Matt “Recloose” Chicoine slipping a demo into Carl Craig’s sandwich is etched into techno folklore. The move led to Recloose signing to Planet E with an acclaimed debut and a world tour as part of Craig’s Innerzone Orchestra. Eventually Recloose traded the urban environs of Detroit for the beaches of Tatahi Bay in New Zealand. In 2005 he scored an underground club hit and the following year a nomination for best dance album at the New Zealand Music Awards.
In this lecture at the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy, the Michigan-native talks about life-changing moments and the links between machines and instruments.
Hosted by Toby Laing We are lucky enough to have with us for the next 12 hours [laughter] this young man here, Matt Chicoine. Also known as Recloose. A big round of applause, please. Recloose Hello. Hello Red Bull Music Academy, hello. Toby Laing You may know Recloose from his work as a DJ touring various parts of the globe. You may also know him from his production work, producing remixes, albums, from way back, releases with Planet E, and currently his album on Peacefrog, Hiatus on the Horizon. He’s a musician, DJ, producer, et cetera, et cetera, band leader... Recloose Dickhead. Toby Laing Indeed. Recloose Father. Toby Laing Father. Recloose Sandwich artist. Toby Laing It all started with sandwiches in one way, didn’t it, mate, perhaps. There was a very special sandwich that you prepared some time ago. Recloose It all started with two pieces of bread and a tape. Toby Laing This was some time in the ‘90s, working your day job, making sandwiches. But at the same time, obviously, producing music in your home studio. Recloose Yeah, in my home dining room, with, what did I have... an S-900 and a crappy Roland keyboard and Cubase. I was making sandwiches in the day, just honest day job out of university. And it was, luckily enough, a deli where a lot of the techno godfathers used to come eat, and others as well, artists and musicians and whatnot. Anyway, I had a demo one day. Carl Craig came in. I was actually a bit chicken to give it to him in person, so I served it up on some bread with a pickle. Demo on rye. Put it in his bag. Thought I was going to get in trouble, get fired, but I got a record deal. It’s good to be chicken sometimes. Toby Laing Let’s go back a bit. You’re working with your Cubase at home in your dining room, but before that, you’d studied music. You’d been into music for a long time prior to your first forays into electronic music. Recloose I came up playing the piano and saxophone. I paid my dues in the high school marching band. Now I’m enjoying music, but back then it was just pain, having to walk around in sub-thermal, sub-Arctic weather playing wack shit. Yeah, so I paid my dues. Came up playing the saxophone, learned a bit. Not extensive training, but had a background in it. Got to university, started doing radio DJing. That was a really good way just to get up on records. They had a really nice library down there in Ann Arbor, WCBN. Then just started DJing and producing and playing the saxophone again, so, full circle. Toby Laing I don’t know what kind of perspective you have on this, but, for those of us outside of Michigan, there seems to be something about Detroit and the area around there that promotes music. I mean, there’s something in the water, or the air, or in the snow. Recloose I know this is probably one of the most commonly asked questions to people from Detroit. My theory, and I think I’ve heard other people say similar things, is that it’s one of these sort of magical places in the sense that it’s blessed and cursed all at the same time. In some ways, it’s such a poor city and there’s a lot of despair there, but there’s a lot of beauty that comes out of that as well. It’s a city where it just starts to get a leg up, and then something happens and it’s on the back foot again. There’s always something quite intriguing going on with people’s yearnings. I think a lot of that comes out in art and music, especially, for years and years. Toby Laing Was there a point you can remember where something clicked, or something changed, in your consciousness of music? Or was it a gradual process that was always in the background? Recloose I’ll be totally honest. I did not grow up in Detroit, I grew up in the suburbs. The difference between the suburbs and the city is immense. Totally different. You grow up in the suburbs, you have very little knowledge of what’s going on in the city. It’s almost like not spoken of unless it’s on the six o’clock news in some sort of negative light. So it was very eye-opening, being at an age where I could go and explore the city for myself and see what it was all about, and then get to the point where I actually moved there. The feeling that I got from the suburbs didn’t inspire me to make music. When I came to Detroit, I was immediately inspired to make music. It was that feeling again, it’s this historical place. It’s blessed and it’s cursed. There’s ghosts. There’s stories everywhere, there’s history. I can see why a lot of times with journalists and fans of Detroit music, they get this very romantic notion of it because of this reason. You go there, it’s one of the most striking places you’ll ever visit, because there’s people living there, but it’s a ghost town at the same time. You come to certain neighborhoods, and you see billboards from the ‘60s, untouched. Literally, a friend eating dinner on Woodward, the main street, running north-south into Detroit, saw a tumbleweed rolling down the street. This is the major city in Michigan. It’s this very bizarre thing. It’s a city, but it’s almost becoming rural again, you know what I mean? That said, it’s easy to be romantic about it if you see it through magazines or movies or visit it on occasion. I think living there can be a bit hard sometimes, because it can be a tough place to live. And there’s not all of the same conveniences that you have in a city like New York or Chicago or whatnot, but it’s a kick in the ass and it’s a great place to come up. You meet like minded-people, they all seem to find each other and make music and be artistic. Toby Laing That’s what happened to you. You did find some like-minded people when you went to university and started producing music. You got this demo out to Carl Craig, and he, what, responded immediately or sometime later? Recloose Yeah, I forgot about it, and I got a call a couple days ago. I was just doing my thing. I was actually making music. I was like, “Hello?” “Hello, this is Carl Craig.” I was like, “Who?” “This is Carl Craig.” Holy shit. Gulp. All that kind of shit. I was a bit starstruck at first, but he’s a real down-to-earth cat and it just went from there. He was very helpful in the process of developing a sound and learning the most basic shit about music, like panning. I had everything right at 12 o’clock. “Dude, maybe you want to put some of this over here, and this.” I was like, “What’s that do?” There’s very basic things that if you haven’t studied music, you don’t have someone to show you, you don’t really have any notion. I was definitely a novice, so he showed me some very useful stuff. As well as just business savvy. “Be up on your shit, be ready to be screwed, because this is the music industry.” Some of us may know, or you will know soon. Watch your backs. [laughs] Toby Laing You actually joined the Innerzone Orchestra as a turntablist, or... I don’t know if this is true, man. I’ve read it but I’ve never heard it from your own mouth. Is that for real? Recloose Yeah, yeah. Toby Laing What was the touring, and the gigs, and whatnot? Recloose We did a handful of gigs, so Carl had this crew, the Innerzone Orchestra, and it was a small kind of improv jazz group, where he was running stuff off the MPC, and then we had Francisco Mora on the drums, who’s this out jazz drummer, played with Sun Ra and whatnot, and then Craig Taborn, he’s a Brooklynite, but he came up in Michigan as well. And myself, and then we had also had Paul Randolph, and Lacksidaisycal on some of those gigs, AKA Ta’raach, some people might know him. We did some gigs around the States, like Coachella Festival, and things like that, and did the Montreal Jazz Festival, went to Europe, did some festivals in Europe. Lot of fun, and a very good experience just for me to be in a professional band environment, outside of my marching band experience, or my high school jazz band to see what actual, proper musicians do onstage, and the exercise of listening to one another, finding that space. When it’s appropriate to do something, when it’s not, how to build tension and release, and things like that. It’s a very good experience for what I’m doing now. Toby Laing That lead to that kind of period of your work. Would you say that that was feeding into your first release, the first LP you put out or the early remixes and onto the LP, the first 12"s that you did? Recloose Yeah, it tied in a bit. At that point I still saw them as two different things, doing stage and then being in a studio. And I think they are essentially two different things. In the studio, you’re capturing performance, but with an audience, it’s kind of a different dynamic, but there were definitely lessons I learned from doing those Innerzone gigs that I brought back to the studio. Just to be experimental, you know. I think I always wanted to take a relatively experimental approach to what I was doing and trying different things, but playing with cats like that encouraged that even more. I mean, Carl, at that point in time was very into that, and Francisco was just mad, and we used do to these... We used to call them space chords and we’d just make noise, free jazz for ten minutes and piss everybody off. We’d be loving it and they’d be hating it, but fuck it. Toby Laing It still seems to be the order of the day for Carl Craig at the moment when he plays live, takes his orchestra around. I remember the North Sea Jazz Festival, you were playing over there a while ago. Recloose Yeah, well he did a thing with Francisco there as well, and that was even on a bigger scale, and it was a Sun Ra tribute thing. This was back in 2003, so in its nature, it was going to be pretty out there and pretty experimental. But, I mean, the last few times I’ve seen Carl, he’s been DJing, I think with Serato, or Final Scratch, or one of those newfangled things, whatever they are. [talks into mic] Everyone okay, is everyone there, hello? Is everyone good? Hey, how you all doing, hey. So quiet. Toby Laing It is quiet in here. Maybe we should play a song. Play a tune maybe. Recloose Turn on the background music. Just roll this old stuff. (music: Recloose — unknown) Toby Laing You’ve got to have someone in the project who’s not just letting whatever happens, happens. You got to hold on to some kind of vision. Recloose No, there needs to be somebody controlling, not controlling, but directing it. Letting people exhibit their artistry and feel like they’re creating, but at the same time steering them in a certain direction. Saying, “That’s cool. Maybe we can work on that a bit better. Let’s try this a different way.” I didn’t have the background to do that at first, because records, they don’t give you shit. Samplers, they don’t give you shit. They don’t talk back. They just do what you tell them to do. Whereas musicians, they’re living, breathing things. So it was a whole different thing. But enough hard lessons learned, I think I’ve come out better for it. Takes a while, definitely. It’s a whole different realm, doing a band. A lot of work, but a lot of fun as well. Toby Laing Maybe we should play something to show the kind of music that you were translating into a live sound. Recloose [flips through CD case] OK. I think I’ve got rough recordings of some of the gigs, just to give you an idea of what we’re doing. Or should we have a before and after? Toby Laing Yeah, let’s do that. Recloose Everyone still there? Hello? Hello? Is this thing on? So here’s this like this kind of clubby thing called “Turkish Delight.” (music: Recloose – “Turkish Delight” / applause) Toby Laing Then you put it in a small van and drove it around Europe for a couple of months? Recloose It was quite tricky. Because again, with samplers, it’s so easy to create a lot of parts. But when you have a band. You wouldn’t know about this, but sometimes you can only make a band so big. Granted, Fat Freddy’s Drop is, what, 38 deep. But you can’t have all the instruments all of the time, so we had to sort of prioritize and pick what worked. (music: The Recloose Live Band — “Turkish Delight (Live)” / applause) That’s the idea. Nasty, live in Sweden. Basically what we ended up doing was everyone played all the parts and then everything else ended up on MPC and just triggering live. What I do is I switch from saxophone, trigger up samples, go back to saxophone, play percussion and that’s a really great thing about this band, because everyone’s quite multi-faceted. So if you’re going to have people in your band, it’s really good to have people that can play three instruments, and can sing and dance. And then you have a really good show. Toby Laing After that experience of putting this band together and managing people, I suppose you could be forgiven for firing them all and just going back into the studio just by yourself. Recloose Yeah, man. Toby Laing Going back to the original scheme. Recloose Who needs people? Toby Laing Is that the case or are you going to persist with this approach, or... Recloose Yeah, we’re still doing the band. I think it was quite time-consuming, recording lots of takes, and lots of people, and different situations, and going back through and editing them. And that was the thing in the recording process that I realized, “I don’t necessarily have to do this.” There’s times when you have an idea, and if you don’t have the musician you’re forced to either play it on a synth or something, or go look through all your records and find something that’s going to approximate that idea. Sometimes it’s great to have a musician and just say, “Play this, just like this.” You know? On the flip, it’s sometimes good just to have your records to go through. It can be time-consuming but oftentimes when you look for samples you’ll come up with things that you didn’t expect to find, and it can often make your music take a turn for the better. Again, I guess it’s just a balance. Just finding what works best for you. But I recommend if you’re gonna record people, get them to do only as many takes as it takes, and don’t edit it unless it really needs it, because you’ll waste all day, and weeks and weeks and weeks going through. Toby Laing That goes back to what you were saying about there having to be someone who’s directing the project, saying what they like, what they don’t like. You’re going to end up with less of your hard-drive space full of whatnot. I seem to remember you working the horn section really hard on a couple of those tunes on your album. Recloose Yeah, and you were there. It was... It’s funny what you end up with. It can be quite difficult. You have to think about the whole picture, like setting up the right environment, the mic is set up, make sure it’s the right room. Do you want to do multiple takes? Do you want to record them as an ensemble? Is there lunch there? Do they need a massage? All these things you need to take into consideration, because thay all contribute to the performance. Yeah, oftentimes you have a very specific idea in your head and you can’t really expect people to come in and nail it first take, you know. It’s like, they’re going to do what they do. I suppose preparation is the key there, and not doing two million takes. Toby Laing I don’t know if you’ve got anything that you could play us that maybe a... an example of what we might be able to expect in the future. Recloose Yeah, so I’m just working on my next album. I just hope I haven’t bored people to tears because it’s so quiet in here, man. Is everyone bored or what, what’s going on? Is everyone okay? All right? OK, cool. Anyway. Yeah, I’m working on my next album and I’m having fun. I think that’s the most important thing if you’re having fun. I think the last album was a bit of a stress because it had been so long since I put an album out and it was quite a time-consuming process, finding the right label, getting the right deal. This time around, it’s been a lot more fun. Toby Laing Maybe you’ve just got some words of advice after going around meeting with different labels, changing labels. Maybe you’ve got a couple of things you might want to say. Recloose I think when it comes to labels, I mean, don’t ever assume anything. Make sure that the contract is tight. If you don’t know what the contract says, make sure someone knows what it says. You do need a manager to oversee that kind of stuff. If you don’t have the business savvy and know what a contract says, you need to get someone to do that. In addition to which, what I learned on the last album, every label’s different, but I don’t want to feel like I’m shit talking about Peacefrog, but some labels need people to stay on their ass and see the project through. Some labels take the initiative. They have the creative vision, they say, “OK, here’s the music. We have an idea of how we want to market it. We want to portray you in this way. We have this whole design going on. We got a logo. This is what your look’s going to be. We’ve got the photography all hooked up. This is your tour dates ...” blah blah blah. Peacefrog is not this kind of label. They’re the kind of label that you need to come with the grand master plan. You need to tell them this is what’s going on. Unfortunately, I had a manager who didn’t follow through on that stuff. As a result, we had a song that got a bit of attention through Dust here in Dallas and whatnot, and then the album did alright, but because there was not someone riding their ass and saying, “Here’s the 10-step plan to marketing this record. We’re going to do these songs as singles, these are the remixers, here’s the video, here’s the second video, here’s the tour dates, this is what you need to provide, this is what we’re providing, here’s the timeline.” All this stuff. We didn’t have any of that. And I sat back thinking, “Well, they’re the record label. That’s their job.” But some record labels don’t see it like that. The best advice I can give is to say, make sure you know what’s going on with your music, how it’s being handled, and ultimately you need to be in control of that stuff. Because if you’re not, it’s your career. If it falls to the wayside and people start dropping the ball, at the end you’re going to be the one that suffers, so make sure you’re on top of it at all times, you know. I think it’s another great lesson... Every release I’ve put out, every musical experience I’ve had has been a lesson. There’s always been a lot of mistakes made, but that’s just how you learn. You develop. Musically you develop, as a business person, as a manager, everything. I’m still kind of half-ass about shit, but a lot less half-ass than I was so. Toby Laing You go into a relationship with a label and it’s quite alright to have a lot of expectations and to make it clear what those expectations are, so that everyone knows. Maybe some of them will be met. Recloose That’s what you’d expect, but you can’t, again, you can’t always assume. You don’t want to drive people crazy. You just have to figure out, “What do I need to do in order to get them to do what I want them to do?” You don’t want to ride them every day on the phone because it’s just going to piss them off and they’re going to go, “Forget this guy, he’s a pain in the ass, I don’t want to do anything for this guy.” But you can’t wait three months to hear, like, “When are they going to call, when are they going to email me, when are they going to tell me what’s going on?” You kind of have to be proactive in order to make sure that your music, your identity, your career is being managed in the right way. It’s so great just to bury your head in the sand and just make music. That’s what I would love to do. I’ve been doing that since I started basically. It’s only the last year or two, I’ve said, “OK, all right. I need to come back to reality and stay on top of this stuff.” You know? In an ideal world, we’d all just be flaky musos and just sit in the studio all the time and, “Contract? I don’t want to see that. Just bring records. Bring instruments. But don’t talk about business points, cuts, publishing. I won’t have anything to do with that, that’s not inspiring to me. I just want to make music.” But if you want to keep making music, you do have to know about these things. And I’m definitely not the person to ask. Don’t waste your time. Toby Laing What is this little tune that you have there? Recloose I got... I don’t know. I just... You know. Oh, here’s another thing I’ve been doing. Getting a new album together, which I’ve found is quite a good process. As I make these tunes, at the end of the day, I like to do a bounce down. I don’t know if... I’m sure other people do this, but it’s good to keep a running catalog of what you’re doing, especially on an album, and just update your progress every time. Basically I’ve got like eight tunes. Rough. They sound like crap. A lot of the performances are just reference, but these are just ideas so I can just play little snippets. If you don’t like it then it’s just because they’re rough and I’m not done with them yet. (music: Recloose – untitled instrumental) Audience Member Hi. Have you got any tips on dealing with flaky musicians? Recloose What’s that? Audience Member Have you got any tips on dealing with flaky musicians that you were on about earlier? Recloose Try to keep them happy, within reason. But know who’s boss. If you’re paying them, they have to answer to you at the end of the day. That doesn’t mean you have to be a hard-ass about it, but you do have some say. If they’re not on time, you need to tell them. If that’s what you expect of them, you need to tell them that. And if they’re habitually not on time and it’s disrupting your work flow, then maybe you should find somebody else. It’s really hard when they’re your friends, especially. It’s difficult, because it enters this whole other realm. Business, friendship, we all know these things don’t always mix. But you can’t be afraid to be straight-up with people if they’re not meeting your expectations. It’s just a matter of developing the language of getting these ideas across to someone without alienating them, pissing them off straightaway. It’s something I’m definitely still learning. When you’re in a studio with someone and you’ve given them this beat, but they start singing a melody, and you’re really not feeling it, how do you approach it? What do you say to them? Do you say, “That shit is wack. Try something else, now, because I’m going to get sick”? Do you not say anything and just have a very uncomfortable look on your face and hope they understand what you’re conveying, what you’re feeling? Or do you say, “Yeah, that’s cool, man, but why don’t we try it a little bit differently?” These are the three different ways you can get these things across, and I’m sure there’s other ways, too. Tact is always good, but being straight-up works. If you’re boss, you have to remember that you’re boss. You can’t be wishy-washy, or else you’re not going to get anywhere with it. Toby Laing Do we have any more questions at the moment? Yes? Audience Member I was just wondering, most of your releases that you’ve done, have you released simultaneously in all the territories where you were looking to release? Like whether it’s been through the States, or through Europe or Japan, if they all happened at the same time, or if they’ve been stayed? Recloose It’s a very good idea to release simultaneously, because then you get into problems of people selling imports and pissing off the local label, distributor, whatever the case is. It’s usually a very good idea to do it, coordinate it, so it all comes out at the same time, unless you’ve explicitly said to all the parties involved, “Look, this is the only territory you sell to. You cannot export this product,” because then you get into some really tricky business. It’s good to keep it tight and keep it released at the same time. Audience Member You’ve generally got to work it that way? Recloose I’m not the most hands-on guy, but I’ve been pretty sure that that’s how it’s worked. I remember with the last album, we only sub-licensed it to Loop in New Zealand, so Peacefrog handled everything. It wasn’t much chance of a conflict there. Audience Member How structured are you with your music-making? For example, if you come to the studio, are you available? Can you be reached on the cell phone the whole time? Do you go through all your emails in a day? What does a day look like? Recloose In the studio? Yeah, I usually do my business stuff in the morning, take phone calls and do e-mails until about, however long it takes, ten o’clock, and then make music from ten ’til lunch time, and then make some more music, and then hang out with my kid. I try to keep it pretty regimented. But music is one of those things where you can’t always box it in. Sometimes you’ll have an idea at two in the morning, and you just have to get up and get it out. Music, family, it’s this tight-rope walk, but you try to keep it pretty regimented if possible. Audience Member Have you always been so structured? Recloose No, I’m a new father. My son’s three years old. I was a pretty much a bachelor for the first four years of making music, so I could come and go as I pleased, and I could stay up ’til all hours out of the morning, and work for fourteen hours straight, and not bathe for a week. It was all good. I was a bachelor, I didn’t have to do my laundry, whatever. Sweet. Now it’s not the case. I’m living in a box. The box is somewhat malleable, but it’s still there. Audience Member Has that affected your creativity? Recloose Yeah, actually, at times it has. It’s been a challenge at times, but I think I’ve adapted. I’ve learned how to work in that way. I think that it’s good to have structure sometimes. Chaos is chaos, and working within confines can be good for your creativity sometimes. It’s good to put a limit on it, just in the same sense that some people have very basic studios and make brilliant music with it, like antique samplers from 1987 or whatever, and they have ten seconds of sampling time, yet they can make these masterpieces out of it. That’s dated technology. Why don’t they want a software sampler that has infinite amount of sampling time? Well, because they don’t have those same confines anymore, and I think it forces you to be creative sometimes. And having a kid forces you to be creative, definitely. And patient. Audience Member I wanted to ask you about how you got into arranging and more elaborate production, like studio production? I guess you started off with quite simple equipment as well, or basic equipment, right? How did you go from that to arranging all these horns and the different things that you do? Recloose My musical background is pretty rudimentary, so I don’t have a lot of training. When it comes to doing things like arranging and composing, I’m a novice. It’s one of these situations where you experiment, trial and error, and it can take you forever to arrive at your final result, because you don’t have those tools. You don’t know the shortcuts. It could be good, but it can be a pain in the ass, too. It can be good in the sense that you’ll do something totally different than someone that has been trained, but it can be very tedious as well. I don’t really see a big difference between arranging samples and arranging horn lines. I mean, it’s the same premise. It’s sound. Doing horns is just the idea of harmony and what you want to do. Do you want to keep all your harmonies parallel? Do you want some to have little tangents in... Here’s the main line in this. There’s all different ways you can do it, cascade the stuff. Have your main stuff over here, and then call-and-response. All different ways you can do it. Same with vocals. All just different techniques, but they’re all pretty much tied in together. You don’t have to use your sampling. It’s all just elements of production and arranging and composition. Toby Laing Well, OK. I’m going to go super deep on you now, bro. I want to know, what is it? Obviously, your reasons for making music maybe have changed over the years, from when you were younger to now. But I mean, when you go, when you finish doing your phone calls in the morning and it’s time to make some music, what’s some inspiration that you draw on? Does that change? I don’t know, there’s a lot in your music. On that last album, there was a reggae track on there. There’s all kinds of stuff coming out in your music. I just want to know if you even can describe what the source of it is. Recloose It’s funny where you find inspiration. I think if you want to remain creative and passionate about what you do, that’s the most important thing, is making sure you have access to inspiration. You can find that in a lot of different places. You can find it through just being happy in your own personal life, or spending time with your kid or your partner, or gong to the beach, whatever. That in itself is inspiring to me. Reading is inspiring to me. Especially reading biographies, Miles Davis, Quincy Jones, Thelonious Monk. Biographies are quite interesting, and it’s good to see what other people have gone through. I find Wax Poetics, it’s obviously, I think most of us are familiar with that magazine, very inspiring read. Well-written, well-researched magazine, if you want to learn about a plethora of crazy musicians. Then, obviously, just hunting out music and always challenging yourself with different types of music. I get quite bored listening to the same thing for too long. I go into these different phases, and that tends to be what influences me when I produce. At the moment, we’re getting a little bit older, and I’m finding myself being more and more nostalgic and looking back to my childhood years. Good old days of Fruit Loops and Saturday morning cartoons and Prince. So that’s a good segue into this little rough track I’m working on here. It’s real corny, it’s rough, but hopefully it’s funky. This’ll be the last thing, I don’t wanna drag it on too long. (music: Recloose – unknown / applause) Cheers, thanks guys.

Matt Edwards (Radio Slave)
A man of many monikers, UK producer and DJ Matt Edwards has gone by Matthew E., Rekid and Radio Slave as a solo artist, and as Quiet Village and Sea Devils in collaboration, but he’s best known for his extensive remix work and running of the Rekids label. From remixing Kylie Minogue to bringing Nina Kraviz to the world, Edwards is as much a talent as a talent-spotter in the world of dance music. How does he do it? Find out in this talk at the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy.
Hosted by Gerd Janson Welcome. We’ve got a man here who is a big hard to categorize, like almost everyone these days. He has a finger in almost every pie. He recorded under various monikers, like Rekid, Radio Slave, and, last but not least, there’s this famous project called Quiet Village. So he’s a producer, DJ, and a record label owner. His name is Matt Edwards. Please give him a warm welcome. [applause from audience] Maybe we start with the usual silly question: how did you get into music, Matt? Your mom was listening to Stevie Wonder? Matt Edwards I was really lucky. I grew up in South London. Like Greg yesterday, I was totally exposed to the whole electro scene. The first 12" record I ever bought was “Planet Rock.” I grew up in a very multi-racial society, multi-cultural society. It was very easy. There was lots of import shops. Throughout my teens it was really easy to buy a lot of 12" records. There’s a huge pirate radio station scene. Gerd Janson Which was always very important for London, right? Matt Edwards Yeah. In the ’80s it was very big. It died off in the mid-’90s, but in the ’80s it was all about jazz, funk, and electro and soul. I guess I was a soul boy when I grew up. Gerd Janson You went out dancing, too? Matt Edwards Yeah, we used to go to these underage soul gigs where there were people like the Cool Notes. You’d hear records by the S.O.S. Band and all that sort of stuff. Kids would turn up and breakdance. Gerd Janson But no alcohol? Matt Edwards No alcohol, no. Gerd Janson From there on? Matt Edwards From there on, I was really lucky to be exposed ... A lot of my friends would go into a lot of the clubs in London. I had one of those life-changing experiences going to the Milk Bar, which is a very famous club in London. Hearing DJs such as Danny Rampling, who back then was actually quite good and other DJs such as Pete Tong, who probably everyone knows. He’s known worldwide, but back then he was a very eclectic DJ who would play reggae next to funk next to hip-hop. Gerd Janson That was also the music Danny Rampling played at the Milk Bar? Matt Edwards Danny’s was more of a serious night. It was much more, I guess, serious. It was the Italo house and a lot more American house. I think he was one of the first DJs to bring over Tony Humphries. In that period in the early 1990s, you had famous clubs that... On a Wednesday, you had Rage, which was the famous hardcore club. Gerd Janson With Fabio and Grooverider. Matt Edwards On a Thursday, and then you’d be able to go back out on Saturday and also on Sunday. There was loads of things happening. This was before the sub-genres, before drum & bass. It was a real melting pot. Everyone went to the same clubs. Gerd Janson And you danced your nights away all week? Matt Edwards Yeah, for the whole of the ’90s. Gerd Janson Maybe you have an example of one of the most pivotal tracks. Matt Edwards I don’t know. Do you want me to play some old stuff? Gerd Janson Yeah. Matt Edwards Okay. Gerd Janson Were you already a DJ back then? Matt Edwards I started DJing around 1991. By then, I’d already been buying a lot of records. We were getting more and more into American house music. This is one of these records. It had already been out for years, but it was a big record at the Ministry of Sound. (music: Fingers Inc. – “Mystery of Love (Mystery of Dub)”) Gerd Janson That was Fingers Inc. – “Mystery of Love.” Matt Edwards Mystery of Dub. Yeah, that was one of the records we were hearing, which was actually quite old. Again, in the early ’90s, a lot of people were playing records from the past, especially people who got back into playing a lot more American house music. Gerd Janson It’s pretty different to the image being attached to house later on, like all of those super clubs and dancing around, your hand back. Matt Edwards When we were first going out, we were lucky to experience a lot of those people like Pal Joey, who were making house records that were around 115 to 118 BPM, which is one of the reasons, for me, the whole Rekid thing started, which was to make records that were much, much slower. Gerd Janson Rekid is one of your projects, right? Matt Edwards Yeah. That’s that crossover between house music and hip-hop, a much more 4/4 but still very slow. Gerd Janson Maybe you want to show us also one of those? Matt Edwards Yeah, of course. This was one of the records that influenced me to start making the Rekid stuff. This was one of the major influences. This is J Dilla. (music: J Dilla – unknown track) That was one of my favorite J Dilla tracks. Unfortunately, he died this year, which is, I think, a real great loss. Gerd Janson It is. Matt Edwards He really crossed over. He really made records that didn’t define one genre. In that record, there’s an Italo disco record that’s slowed down, there’s loads of different samples. It’s amazing. Gerd Janson It is, and it got you into doing that kind of slow groove. Matt Edwards Yeah. When he shows that you can take so many different influences from so many different types of music, and you can make it sort of slow. Is it four to the floor? Is it house? Is it hip-hop? Is it this? Is it that? Gerd Janson You're not into pigeon-holing at all. Matt Edwards No, not at all. I was going to play you another J Dilla track, which is even more like a house record or like an electronic record, this thing from BBE. Do you know BBE? Gerd Janson Yeah, the English label. Matt Edwards Yeah. This is the “Big Booty Express,” which is another great J Dilla record. (music: J Dilla – “B.B.E. (Big Booty Express)”) Gerd Janson It sounds even more like cosmic disco. Matt Edwards Yeah, totally. I think it’s crazy that he was making stuff like this. It’s so electronic. I really think it shows that there’s a lot more to hip-hop than just sampling old funk records, and that you can make great electronic music. Gerd Janson What is your take on the whole sampling thing? Matt Edwards I love sampling, especially with more of the Quiet Village stuff and some of the record stuff. We try and choose or pick a lot of more electronic records as well, especially from Europe and also from places like Turkey. I look further afield than just American funk records. Gerd Janson Not just sampling James Brown over and over and over and over again? Matt Edwards No, but that’s not to say ... I’ve been starting listening to James Brown again because it is amazing. Gerd Janson I didn’t want to say anything bad about James Brown. Maybe you could show us, then, what the Rekid stuff sounds like. Matt Edwards I’ll play a cut off my album. (music: Radio Slave – unknown track / applause) Gerd Janson How would you describe your style then, ketamine house? Matt Edwards I don’t know. I guess it’s a sort of hypnotic. Joel coined the phrase of heartbeat music. A lot of people in London were calling it smack house, which we won’t get into. It’s very hypnotic. There’s loads of hip-hop tracks that I think are very hypnotic. It’s the same with what’s happening with a lot of music, especially minimal house. Things go on for a lot longer. As my friend always says, keep it boring. Don’t change it. If it sounds good, just let it go. Gerd Janson That’s where you see the cross links between all of that stuff? Matt Edwards Yeah. It’s all about a great groove and keeping things going. There’s a split between two camps where you get a lot of people these days who want to change everything all the time. That’s more apparent these days, French producers or labels like Ed Banger or Justice. People like that, where it’s very quick. Then you’ve got the German producers who keep it going. Gerd Janson They’re very in the same groove for a very long time. Matt Edwards Yeah, for a very long time. Gerd Janson That whole kind of minimal house or techno that got prominent out of Germany in the last years is also very influential for you. Matt Edwards Yeah, very. I mean, I’ve really loved that scene. I mean, yeah, there’s some great records. It’s definitely going back to being more sort of house-lead, rather than glitchy and stuff. But yeah, no it’s really good. Gerd Janson With another of your projects like Radio Slave, you are a bit more up-tempo right? Matt Edwards Yeah, I was going to play you guys this, I’ve done this remix , I did two mixes as part of the job, so I did like a record thing and a Radio Slave thing. But I guess it’s what demonstrates more sort of dance or stuff that I make. I also have the influence one might be using, some sort of hip-hop sounds, or the way that you sample stuff in very much the same way as producers such as Dave Taylor work, from Switch. A lot of editing, a lot of sampling. Gerd Janson Before you played it, you could maybe tell us what got you into producing. Because you were telling me you had tried it in the early '90s but you weren’t too satisfied with yourself? Matt Edwards Making music, for me, in the mid-'90s was very difficult. I come from a graphic design background and was always used to being very hands on with making stuff or designing stuff, and I found it very frustrating as just being like the director or producer. It wasn’t until 2001 that I actually could start making music myself, and that’s what led to the Radio Slave thing, which led to the Rekid thing. Part of being so frustrated with the remixes that were coming out at the time. Gerd Janson On major labels right? Major artists? Matt Edwards Yeah, which is what... Maybe I play it, I can re-edit, but I was always fascinated with re-editing from the ’70s and ’80s, people like Walter Gibbons and that whole way of taking the best bits of records or making tracks that are three minutes much longer. In the late ’90s a lot of record labels lost their way because they always thought, if I get this guy to remix it he’s going to make the song better, when maybe the actual original song is good on its own. Gerd Janson It just needs a little rework. Matt Edwards Yeah, yeah totally. I can you play like a reedit I’ve done recently. This is like a reedit of a ’60s track. The track’s amazing, it’s about this guy Jacques Dutronc, and hopefully we’re going to do something with it, but it’s... (music: Jacques Dutronc – “Les Cactus” Radio Slave remix) Matt Edwards That’s a pretty simple re-edit. You can tell where it’s been changed. It’s sort of to make a two minute track into a five minute track. Gerd Janson What’s your general take on all of that re-edit culture going on right now? Matt Edwards I like it. I think it’s been abused, especially when a lot of the original records are so good. A lot of people are making money out of it, especially the people who are setting up bootleg labels just to release records that you can buy. You can go on the web and... Gerd Janson You can just search for them. Matt Edwards Yeah, you can find them, the originals, which are equally as good. Gerd Janson What constitutes or justifies an edit, then? Matt Edwards I don’t know. That’s the reason we started the whole Radio Slave thing, really. It’s really about extending stuff for the clubs, as much as that old school aesthetic of making a pop record into something that’s much more playable in an intro and an outro. Gerd Janson Like what Shep Pettibone did with Ketchup Boys. Matt Edwards Yeah, exactly. I think that the same rules still apply. A lot of people, maybe people who aren’t so knowledgeable about the music, they tend to cut out some of the best bits. Joel and I have just done this Quiet Village re-edit... Gerd Janson Joel is your partner? Matt Edwards Yeah, in Quiet Village. We’ve just done this Osmonds re-edit. We were in New York and we were digging for records. It was the WFMU Record Fair. We go there every year just to buy records. We were in this place in Jersey City, and Joel found this Osmonds 12", which is this promo only thing. No one knew about this record. One of Joel’s friends passed it on to someone else. Suddenly everyone knew about it. It was on DJ History. Gerd Janson Which is like a message board where stuff like this is discussed. Matt Edwards Yeah. Then suddenly someone has done a re-edit. They had cut out all the vocal and it just loops out the intro. Gerd Janson That’s not a good thing? Matt Edwards No. I could play you ... The actual track is amazing. It’s just one of those things where I think sometimes producers or DJs don’t understand that it’s sometimes great to hear the whole song. You want to hear the whole song. I think people have maybe forgotten about that as well. Gerd Janson With the Osmonds, especially, you think it’s what we had with Greg Wilson yesterday, like DJs covering up the records? You think it’s a good thing to keep some stuff under the carpet? Matt Edwards Sometimes. This record in particular, since we found it and essentially it was posted on DJ History, we found out someone did a re-edit. Another famous producer has now done a record that is using the bass line and the strings and stuff. In that respect, sometimes it’s best to keep things to yourself. I’m a great believer of sharing music, but sometimes maybe, yeah. Gerd Janson There is an exception to the rule then. Matt Edwards No, I don’t think so. The Osmonds thing is a great track. I think it would surprise a lot of people that they made an amazing, almost electronic disco track. Shall I play it? I have to find it [searches through record bag] (music: The Osmond Brothers – “I, I, I”) Gerd Janson You were talking about people setting up labels for their re-edits. Matt Edwards Yeah. Gerd Janson You did that yourself, too, right, for the Radio Slave stuff? Matt Edwards Yeah, sort of. For a while I was doing a label that really had no direction. It was just putting out 12"s. In the last year, what we’ve done is, me and my brother-and-law, we’ve set up a proper label. We’re now signing artists and we’re looking at developing young artists, especially in the UK. Gerd Janson You would recommend a business plan if you want to set up a label? Matt Edwards I mean, when I was younger I guess I had no idea, and I always looked at things on the creative level. But I would entirely recommend if you’re going to start a label, that you do it properly, by the book. Because you need to keep it going, you need to make money. Everyone’s trying to do you over. Gerd Janson What does the book say? Matt Edwards I don’t know. It’s just the whole thing about setting up a business. It’s millions of miles away from way I come from, just one of these people, I guess he’s just more creative who just got right on a power record. I don’t care if it sells I just want to do it. It’s worth investing the time properly. Gerd Janson How would you recommend to do it then, maybe? Matt Edwards How? Gerd Janson Yeah, or would you recommend to everyone who’s making music and things, I have to put this out? Matt Edwards I guess the first thing is finding a good distributor, and someone that you can trust, and make sure you can get paid. That’s the hardest thing in the record industry, is actually getting money back once you’ve invested the time. It takes a long time to actually get your money back because there are so many ways for a distributor, or if say you’re signed to a record company, there’s a million and one excuses for them not to pay you. That’s one of the reasons we set the label up ourselves. Gerd Janson Then you’re in control of... Matt Edwards Yeah, so that we have complete control over everything from the artwork to the mixes to the manufacturing and mastering, it’s very important. The whole thing. Gerd Janson How much time does this take away from actually making music then? Matt Edwards I’m lucky, I actually have a partner who does a lot of the business side. That’s one thing I would recommend, if you are a very creative person, try not to do it by yourself. Try and find someone who’s got more of a business head, because it is very difficult. Gerd Janson You noodle away? Matt Edwards Yeah, totally. Gerd Janson Yeah. Maybe you could talk a bit more about that Radio Slave stuff? Matt Edwards Yeah, like I said before, the Radio Slave thing came about from frustration of not being happy with a lot of remixes. I was really lucky that one of my best friends is this guy called David Dorrell, who was part of MARRS, “Pump Up the Volume,” and he’s still active and involved in the music industry and managed this band Bush, who were big in the States and stuff. I did this remix, Kylie gave it to him ... Gerd Janson Kylie Minogue? Matt Edwards Yeah, he gave it to Pete Tong and Pete Tong played it, and the whole thing started from there. I guess this is around the time that whole mash-up scene started. Gerd Janson Like 2ManyDJs? Matt Edwards Yeah, that whole thing. To begin with it was kind of cool because there was a breath of fresh air, where you had before, people wouldn’t sample or wouldn’t use rock records. It wasn’t a done thing, it was not fair. Labels were still stuck in this whole progressive house thing. Then suddenly all these new guys came along, like Richard X or Soulwax and brought all these different, you know, these old references, especially a lot of European, sort of disco and sort of new wave references. That was good, it was good time, and I think it’s made a lot of difference because it’s brought a lot of young people back into dance culture, that were lacking in the late ’90s. Gerd Janson Young people are important for dance music? Matt Edwards Yeah. I can see that totally. It wouldn’t work without young people. I went to Pacha in Ibiza, I think it was around 2000 2001, and it was like going to a club full of just old people. Everyone was in their 40s and they were listening to some really boring music. It had no connection with what was happening with 18 year-olds and 19 year-olds. Really, it’s all about getting young people to go into dancing. Nightclub culture. That’s what it’s about. Gerd Janson Has it changed? Matt Edwards Yeah, I think it has changed. I think a lot of the kids who came through from listening to indie dance music and now discovered black music, black dance music, house music. It’s all good, I think we’re in a much better place than we were five years ago. Good music in general. Gerd Janson And that keeps you also inspired to go on. Matt Edwards Yeah of course, yeah and that’s good, because I think for a while dance music needed to be sort of indie dance remix and such, this or this that and the other. Whereas now I think it’s branching out on its own. Dance music is its own thing, it doesn’t need this indie connection with dance and stuff, and that’s good. Gerd Janson Can you show us what you did to Kylie? Matt Edwards Do you really want to hear Kylie Minogue? Yeah? If I can find it. I’ll have a look for it. Gerd Janson I mean, we’re in Australia. Matt Edwards Yeah, why not? Let’s have a look. (music: Kylie – “Slow (Radio Slave Remix)”) The first one I did, so I won’t play that one, sorry. I can play you something else. Gerd Janson Do you have that Kate Bush thing with you? Matt Edwards Yeah, I got the Kate Bush thing. I guess this works off the same template. I’m a big fan of Kate Bush and unfortunately she never ever did any remixes. I don’t think she’s ever been remixed, and I was really into her new album. If you haven’t got it I thoroughly recommend you buy it. Yeah, this is on the same sort of principle as buying an album, getting it back home and then put it into Sound Forge and then playing around with it. (music: Kate Bush - “King of The Mountain (Radio Slave Remix)”) Matt Edwards I guess that’s like a real typical example of a, it’s like a mixture of a re-edit and a remix where you don’t have any parts. You have to use exactly what you’ve got from the record. And that was quite interesting because I think the original of that record is I think like 70 BPM. I had to time-stretch it, double it, and then bring it back down to about 130 so that it worked. Gerd Janson You are fond of computers. Matt Edwards Yeah, unfortunately without computers, for me it wouldn’t ever happen. I mean I guess maybe it’s easy for me in some ways because I got this design background and I’m really into these, I guess they’re like collages. I can work with computers so easily. Gerd Janson You’re not one of those analog crusaders? Matt Edwards No. No. I mean, I use a PC which I’m one of the minority when it comes to making music. But I find using software is really easy and Cubase and stuff. That’s a good example of a crossover between a re-edit, a remix view. That’s pretty much the whole song in its entirety and then chopped to make it longer with an in track and out track and literally just some beats and stuff. Gerd Janson When you play as a DJ are you actually able to put all that different kind of stuff into one night that you are into? Matt Edwards It depends. It depends. Sometimes I won’t play any of my own music. I mean, I’m such a record fiend. I buy lots and lots of music every week. There’s always other people’s records to play. I’m a massive music fan, a lot of modern producers always blown me away and really humbled me. I always think, “Shit. I’m not doing the right thing.” Gerd Janson You’re fond of computers, but even founder of vinyl still. Matt Edwards Yeah, totally. Yeah, I’m a great supporter of vinyl. I’ll keep playing it, I think, and buying it. Gerd Janson You don’t think it will vanish these days with all the new technology? Matt Edwards One day when we’re old guys, we’ll have no vinyl left. No, I think people still buy it. I think it’s become like a luxury item, especially like Whatever We Want Records, these other labels that are very much more art driven, the prices are going up because it’s becoming much more of a luxury thing. Gerd Janson And a collector’s item. Matt Edwards Yeah, and already a collector’s item, especially doing it with the pressing. I mean, you’re lucky these days if you can sell over, on a regular release, over 2,000 records, whereas 6 or 7 years ago, you’d be looking at about 5,000. Gerd Janson Whatever We Want Records is a label that puts out the Quiet Village stuff with Joe Martin, right? It’s packaged quite nicely. Matt Edwards Yeah, no, it’s package has always been very well designed, original pieces of artwork and stuff. Gerd Janson You think that’s important also to have a record label like that. Matt Edwards Yeah, I’m still a great believer. I come from the school, when I was kid, it was great to buy an album and actually see at as a 12x12 inch thing. Now I can’t by MP3s. I’m not into it. I only, just before I left to come here, I lost four years worth of photographs from my laptop. Gerd Janson It’s a pity. Matt Edwards Yeah, and that’s the same with music. If you have it on your computer, and all your music is on there, unless you back it up and back it up, you’re going to lose it. Gerd Janson The surface feel of vinyl. Matt Edwards Yeah, of course. Gerd Janson Maybe you can show us one of those Quiet Village. Matt Edwards Yeah, I was just going to play one more re-edit, if that’s cool. I was just going to play this. This another one of those DIY sort of jobs that actually in the end came out which is quite rare these days, but it’s a Paul McCartney track called “Temporary Secretary.” (music: Paul McCartney – Temporary Secretary (Radio Slave Re-Edit)) That’s an example, that was just a re-edit that I did. That’s all it is. That actual track is exactly like that. I think the track’s actually 133 BPM. Gerd Janson That’s pretty freaky for Sir Paul. Matt Edwards Yeah, and that’s off his, I think Paul McCartney 2, and all I did was literally cut the whole track up with time and put a beat there. Luckily at the same time, there was a, I think it was Parlophone that released his compilation, and they ended up pressing up which is pretty mad, really. We got the go ahead from Paul McCartney to release it. It did 500, one-sided 12". That’s the thing. I think if you got ideas, there’s still so much old music out there that people haven’t discovered or they’re discovering. I think especially with major artists, I think they quite like it. They have their ego massaged by these young kids coming along and sampling it and stuff. Their egos are very into that. Gerd Janson Yeah. Good for you. Compared to Quiet Village. Matt Edwards The Quiet Village thing is totally different. This a project that I do with my friend Joel Martin which is he released records, three records now on this label called Whatever We Want. DJ Harvey releases lots of stuff by Thomas Bullock using A.R.E. Weapons. This is much more of a cinematic side to what we do. It draws references to Joel and my obsession with guys like Vangelis and soundtracks. Gerd Janson Matt Edwards Yeah, Krautrock to a certain degree, but I guess it’s a real love of soundtracks, and we’ve actually started work on an album in January which is going to be quite nice. Gerd Janson What is your take on the hype around that stuff? Matt Edwards It’s good. I mean, I guess, I really think that downtempo music is going to have a real resurgence next year. In the mid to late ’90s, in the mid-’90s you had artist such as DJ Shadow who’s very experimental, and you had people like Air, Zero 7. Gerd Janson This went all into coffee table. Matt Edwards Yeah, it became very coffee table, and you had all those [inaudible] compilations, and the whole scene became so diluted. I think it lost its way. That’s not to say that people haven’t been doing it since, but I don’t think it’s had the reaction from the press and media. Trends come and go. The same with house. The way that something goes electronic and then it gets some more life back. I think there’s going to be this resurgence for downtempo music, sure. Gerd Janson It can be done in a positive way. Matt Edwards Yeah, and much more of an edgy way. Definitely, I mean, there’s a couple of tracks that we’ve done before that we’ve released, I think would give you a good example of the kind of tempo and mood. Gerd Janson Would you describe it as Balearic? Matt Edwards Yeah, definitely. I think it is Balearic. I mean Joel and I both, we’re massive collectors of that scene, and we’ve always been fans of the Balearic sound. Gerd Janson And what is the Balearic sound? Matt Edwards I knew you were going to ask me that. It’s incredibly hard to define because Balearic music can be a pop record, it can be a rock record, but primarily, I guess, it’s this mid-tempo sort of chugging, sort of druggy. Yeah. Gerd Janson Yeah, I guess. Matt Edwards Druggy sound that came about in the mid-’90s, sorry, mid-’80s. Gerd Janson When all the English people were traveling towards the Balearic islands. Matt Edwards I think from what we’re seeing now and from people like Daniele Baldelli and all these other DJs, I think a lot of people have realized it was happening without England. Gerd Janson Yeah. Awesome. Matt Edwards Yeah, well not completely. It was always there, this scene or this sound, which fits in between very slow and club music. I can play this one. This is the first record we ever did for Whatever We Want. (music: Quiet Village – unknown track) Gerd Janson That was a nice example of the Balearic sound. Matt Edwards Yeah, I think that was the first record that we made as Quiet Village. That was the kind of sound we were trying to achieve, was this slow disco dance. I mean with the record thing is much more sort of... Gerd Janson Electronic? Matt Edwards Or hip-hop. Sort of has much more hip-hop edge. This is much more, yeah as you said Balearic. Gerd Janson Floating. Matt Edwards Yeah, floating, yeah, and trippy and stuff. It just draws references where it’s that sort of sound, you know where the sound is between soundtracks and almost disco. In the late ’70s there was a lot of that stuff that was made. I think everyone pretty much made a disco track. I was going to play you like another example of an Ennio Morricone record that is basically he made a disco record and it’s pretty much been a great influence on John and I. (music: Ennio Morricone – unknown track) That’s a great example, I think, of someone who wouldn’t be associated with disco making a disco track. Gerd Janson That’s where the inspiration comes from for... Matt Edwards Yeah, that’s one of the people, but yeah. Gerd Janson Yeah, Joe Bataan told us today that when you’re turning 30, you should know what you will be doing for the rest of your life. Matt Edwards Right. Gerd Janson Can you see yourself going on like this? Matt Edwards I hope so. I hope I can keep... Gerd Janson Producing records, playing records? Matt Edwards Keep making music. I don’t whether I want to be in the foreground as much with DJing, because DJing is pretty... It’s... Gerd Janson Ain’t what it used to be? Matt Edwards No, no it’s quite fun. I mean I can tell you now that the clubs are much better than they have been in years, especially in Europe. I think they have a great scene. There’s a lot great clubs in Germany and stuff. Gerd Janson Panorama Bar. Matt Edwards Panorama Bar. I think it’s very hedonistic times but as a working DJ, you know it’s a great a job and very proud to do it. It does kill you slightly as well. Gerd Janson With all the bad things happening in nightlife? Matt Edwards Just with the schedule and just you know, constantly turning. But no, it’s good. You get to experience a lot of different cultures and also you get to buy records in a lot of different countries. Gerd Janson That’s why you do it. Matt Edwards Yeah, especially in Eastern Europe and stuff is great for buying old records and stuff so that’s always good. Gerd Janson What are the places in Eastern Europe to buy old records? Matt Edwards I’m not going to tell you. Gerd Janson You have to keep it as a secret. Matt Edwards Yeah, Budapest is really good. You find a lots of good old records as well at good disco in these places and that’s great. Gerd Janson Maybe we should open it up for... Matt Edwards Yeah, yeah of course. Gerd Janson Do you have some questions? One, two, the mics are coming. Audience member Hey, hello you mentioned that you would bring a song into Sound Forge during your affair at the Sound Factory. What do you do once you put it into... Matt Edwards I usually only use Sound Forge as a recording tool and I tend to just edit the sounds. Or I’m sampling in Sound Forge. I really like it as a program or as a piece of software. Yeah, that’s really good. I’m looking to find new things I’m comfortable with. I’m not sure whether I want to become part of the Mac family and only use Logic as a sequencing tool – this, that and the other. I think that can be a bit restricting. I don’t know, you do get a certain sound. It’s whatever you’re into, I think it’s all about ideas. At the end of the day it’s all about what’s in here and that’s how you’re going to make music. Without that you know, you can use lots of different things, but unless you have the ideas. Yeah, no Sound Forge is the one for me definitely. Audience member As a producer and record label owner is there some legal advice you’d like to share with us or any important thing or issue that we should know? Matt Edwards I don’t know. As a producer I would always suggest that if you can, it’s always great if you are a creative person, if you can find someone who is going to help look after you to a certain degree. Maybe not in a managerial thing to begin with, but if there is someone who could look after you, whether it’s your friend who you know who is good with business. You can get very lost, and I found for the first three or four years that I didn’t know about putting money away for this, for tax, or for certain different things. You can end up, you know, you think, “Oh I’m making loads of money!” Then suddenly you’re not. Suddenly you owe people loads of money. It’s important. Audience member I have two questions. One is, is there something for [inaudible] is there a point where something becomes kitschy? Matt Edwards Kitsch? Participant Is everything [inaudible]? Matt Edwards I don’t know. I really like pop music as much as any other type of music. I think a lot of people, they won’t buy into popular culture because they want to be really underground. But you got to remember the reason people are signed to major labels is because they’re bloody good at what they do. I try and check a lot of albums by people, maybe people think they might be completely cheesy. There’s some amazing producers out there and the reason that they’re working with these artists on a major label is because the fact that they’re so amazing. I don’t know. I always surprise myself by the albums I buy. Maybe I’ll buy Britney Spears’ album just to hear one track by one producer, just because I want to hear what he’s doing. It might be completely crazy. You never know. Audience member Yeah, and making contact with [inaudible]? Matt Edwards Did I get in contact with Kate Bush? We tried to, but it’s really difficult. Gerd Janson She lives in a cottage. Matt Edwards Yes. She’s a real reclusive and she smokes loads of dope and I don’t think she’s [inaudible] do that really. Audience member [inaudible] Matt Edwards With the Quiet Village thing, what we’re actually going to do next year because we’ve actually signed the deal with the album. We said we’re going to actually replay everything. I would go along the lines, and don’t quote me on this, but if it’s really obscure then you can probably almost certainly say you can get away with it. If you’re pressing over say, four thousand records than you have to really start to worry. But a major label isn’t going to take any notice of you if you’re only pressing up a thousand records or doing small runs. In fact, the whole bootleg culture, say with like Kate Bush or whatever, it’s actually great promotion for them. Sometimes they love it. They love it when guys will do like a bass mix or drum & bass mix of a track because it’s great promotion. It means they don’t have to pay a remixer to do it for them. Audience member [inaudible question about digital reveue] Matt Edwards We’ve got a digital partner. We’ve got Beatport and DJ Download that we work with. Maybe I’m just old but as a consumer, as a company, I have to get involved with this whole digital thing. It’s just really important. It’s a great way, especially for companies that have already been established, it’s a great way of selling a catalog because it’s a great way to not invest money in new music but to sell a lot of old music as well. But no, it’s great. If that’s how people want to buy music then I’m all for it. But I’m just really old fashioned and I love vinyl, I love the smell of it. I love the jackets that they come in, the designs. Audience member As far as your revenue is concerned, are you making as much selling...do you have a chart of how much you’re actually making from selling records and how much you’re making from resources on the internet? Matt Edwards It all depends on the deal that you have with the partners. I think with iTunes, I think you, unless you’re saying thousands and thousands you’ll earn absolutely nothing. But with Beatport yeah, it can be a really good way of gaining revenue. I have quite a high dealer price. It can be good. Obviously with vinyl, vinyl’s incredibly expensive to manufacture and you have to pay for the artwork and bar codes and all this stuff that you don’t need with selling music digitally. I’m sure that I will start to buy it, but hopefully not for a few years anyway. I hope that answers your question. Cool. Gerd Janson Any more questions? We’re done, I guess. Matt Edwards Yeah, cool. Gerd Janson Thank you very much for being here.

Mo
Though born in Düsseldorf, Mo will forever be associated with Berlin’s electronic scene through club nights such as Electro and Panasonic, as well as the Elektro Music Department label. At the 2004 Red Bull Music Academy she discusses her youth, arriving in Berlin’s freewheeling party scene during reunification and her time spent in the famous Hard Wax record shop.
Hosted by Nick Dwyer Over the last few years you’ve been working for a company called Handle with Care, and as you were saying Handle with Care is a company that looks after manufacturing. People have made their track in the studio, but there’s this big grey area between having a track finished in a studio and then seeing it on the record shelves. And that’s where your company comes in. We’ll talk about that later on, but let’s listen to a track just so people can get a nice idea of where you are musically. Mo Well yeah, actually, I thought maybe I’d just play the first record that we released on our label Elektro Music Department. What was started in ‘94, so it’s 10 years old. Nick Dwyer And this is a track by yourself and Klaus Kotai? Mo I didn’t listen to it before, so I’m not sure which. (music: Kotai + Mo – “E. H. Tranquilizer” / applause) There isn’t much happening, you know? [moves record forward] The thing is it’s very minimal. Actually we got some respect for that, because at that time that kind of minimal stuff wasn’t very popular, but for us it was an aesthetic necessity. Nick Dwyer When you say you had support, was this just in Germany or outside also? Mo Pretty much outside, and I’m still getting a lot of response to our label. That was release number one. This was maybe ‘96 and it was release number six, so you can see we didn’t release a lot. (music: Kotai + Mo – “Silencer” / applause) I want to play the other side because we were achieving our own style. At that time our equipment was basic, it was mainly our synthesizer, which was a Korg. [Our studio] was like a Korg park. Nick Dwyer How did both of you work? Were you more the engineer or was Kotai? Mo No, it was completely democratic. Often I was coming up with an idea, like this track I had the word “silencer” in my head, which I liked because of the meaning and the sound, so we started playing around with it and decided Kotai should just say the word “silencer.” Often I was taking care of the bass. I was the Korg specialist. We were just switching, jamming. Often I was arranging and putting it together. Nick Dwyer With the minimal sound that you guys were doing, what were you listening to at the time? Mo I wouldn’t say anything really influenced us. We were very respectful towards Daniel Bell, Rob Hood and Panasonic, who were friends, so sometimes we found ourselves getting close to their sound, and then we’d go, “Ooh, no!” This was something that could happen. I’m sure that happened to them too. You should never follow someone else’s ideas. (music: Kotai + Mo – “Boys in the Backstreet” / applause) Nick Dwyer This is 1996, the sixth release on your label. And this was made in Berlin, but Berlin wasn’t always your home, your place of birth. Mo No, I was born in Düsseldorf. Nick Dwyer Tell us about Düsseldorf. Mo I was starting to party in the late ‘70s – I was quite young then – and that was the time when the electronic music was happening, like Kraftwerk and La Düsseldorf and Neu!, and also punk started. Both were quite massive at the time. Nick Dwyer Obviously, Kraftwerk are from Düsseldorf. Was there great awareness of electronic music because these were your local boys? Mo They were just part of it. It was not a big deal at that time. It was kind of a movement. For example, La Düsseldorf, which probably none of you know, they were as popular as Kraftwerk at that time. So there was a club called Ratinger Hof, it was just all white and metal and neon light on top, so it was really bright inside even when the party was on. And they were also having fashion shows, late ’70s, early ’80s. Nick Dwyer There’s a lot of artists there, a lot of galleries there. Düsseldorf always had a history of this art background. So there was a great symbiosis of the music and art coming together? Mo Definitely this was always happening. There was also some aesthetic thing going on all the time. For instance, the Ratinger Hof originally was done by the girlfriend of Blinky Palermo – I don’t know if you know him – like a minimal modern artist. There was another place before where Nam June Paik was having a TV wall. There was stuff like that. At the same time punk was happening heavily. This street that the club was on, you couldn’t pass through if you weren’t looking punk-ish, they’d throw bottles at you, it was really dangerous. If you went there wearing a cap you’d be hit by a beer bottle. At the same time, the Kraftwerk guys would come there in their suits and be respected. Nick Dwyer And you were studying art yourself in Düsseldorf? Mo I studied art, painting. Nick Dwyer Were you doing anything musical in Düsseldorf? Mo I’ve always had the desire to create, because if I don’t do it, nobody will do it my way. This is something I still feel, whether DJing or producing. Nick Dwyer You were DJing at this stage in Düsseldorf? Mo Yes, then it was just art student parties. I was even playing music from tapes. It was a wild mixture of all styles. Nick Dwyer 1991 in Germany, everything changed. Obviously with the collapse of the Berlin Wall, there were all these opportunities. Tell us about this time. Mo Actually, the change was in 1989. I came to Berlin in winter 1991, because I wanted to visit a friend. I was already planning to leave Düsseldorf because I’d finished my studies and I was so impressed by this historical moment in the city that I decided to stay there. It was just a visit but from then on I didn’t leave. It was a culture clash because of the people from East Germany, because for me as a German, we were speaking the same language, we both called ourselves Germans, but we had a completely different background and a different mentality. I was immediately living in East Berlin because I thought, OK if I’m already here, I want to be where it’s happening. This was winter, Berlin winter, close to Siberia, lots of snow, really cold. I was walking outside to go to the store, to get some toilet paper, something you’d just quickly grab and go back. And outside there was a queue waiting, in the middle of this cold winter, snow up to here. [points to waist] I thought maybe they’re waiting for the shop to open, but the shop was open. And there was a woman inside, a cashier, two people walking around buying stuff and the rest waiting outside. I didn’t understand why they were queueing so I went inside. I thought they can queue if they want, I’ll just get my stuff and go. And I went inside and the woman told me you need a basket. So I said, “OK, where are the baskets?” And she said, “There are only two and they are already in use.” [laughter] This was the system, and everyone was waiting to get their basket. And there was some logic in it because you only need one person to be in control of the shop because there was only two baskets. So this was something I’d never experienced before. Nick Dwyer This was the time you moved to Berlin and so did a lot of artists from all over the world, because you had this free space and there was this big squatting scene. Mo Especially in the central part of Berlin, there was a lot of empty spaces. They were old buildings and in East Germany people didn’t want to live in old buildings. It was cold, everything breaking down. So a lot of these buildings were empty, flats with wallpaper peeling off, stalagmites, you could tell that this place wasn’t inhabited since Second World War. You could just go there and throw parties. Everything was so confused, the police didn’t know what laws should be enforced. East Berlin policemen all of a sudden were wearing West Berlin uniforms and they had to look everything up. Like, “What is the law for someone riding a bicycle on the sidewalk?” If you were throwing illegal parties it was very easy because there was no one after you, you know? Nick Dwyer So what became known as the Berlin techno scene, the great vibrancy from that was born out of this whole East Berlin thing. You could stay open till nine without anyone saying anything, you could sell liquor and no one would know. Mo There were parties, like in one cellar where you had to go right down and it was filled with water and there were bridges made out of wood you had to cross and there was this big soundsystem and it was full of people. But it only lasted two weeks, and then it was onto the next location. Nick Dwyer At what point did you think, “I can do this better,” and start throwing parties yourself? Mo It was just because I was into the music and into dancing so there was a point where I wasn’t satisfied with what I heard. I knew some people throwing regular parties at a small venue and I became their resident. And then I met Daniel Pflumm, the visual part of our label, he had opened a bar where he was selling T-shirts and DJ tapes, and he asked me for a DJ tape and then I came to his place. We threw a party and it worked and from then on we used it as a club, and this was called Electro. This was from ’92 to ’94. After some time I also started to work at Hard Wax, the record store in Berlin. Nick Dwyer For people who don’t know about Hardwax, it’s a bit legendary, yes? Mo It was the first techno store, techno and reggae, and it was run by one of the Basic Channel guys, Mark Ernestus. Nick Dwyer Normally, you wouldn’t associate techno and reggae internationally in a record store. Mo They are definitely a lot into reggae. They go to Detroit and Jamaica, that’s the two levels they are working on. So, yeah. Because I was working there, I met a lot of people, so I could get almost everybody to play at our club. Nick Dwyer What was the music policy? Mo It was just to give another view of what was happening. Rob Hood, for example, sometimes he did a hip hop set because he’s really into hip hop. DJ Hell, Electric Indigo, Air Liquide was playing live, Jimi Tenor was playing live. Everything was happening on a really low-budget level, they weren’t getting any fee, there was no entrance fee so we didn’t make any money out of it. But the atmosphere was so good and people were so into it, everybody wanted to play. Nick Dwyer Were people travelling all over for this club? Mo I’m sure some people came for the club but most of the people performing were local because we couldn’t afford to buy them a ticket. Dave Clarke was playing, Christian Vogel. It could even happen that somebody famous was playing and there was only ten people. Nothing was planned. Sometimes it was completely full and 50 people would stand outside because the whole place was maybe half the size of this room. 60 people was nice, 100 people and it’s too crowded. Nick Dwyer This club finished in 1994. This was the time that Elektro Music Department started? At first what was the role of Elektro Music Department? Was it to put out your friends’ music or the stuff you began producing yourself? Mo No, it was our own music. Because of the Elektro club I met Kotai and we started producing our own music and it immediately worked. The idea of starting a label was already there but we didn’t know what to release on it. Should we just release stuff by the DJs we were inviting to play? But nothing really worked. So then we had our own music and decided to release it. Nick Dwyer The fourth release was by Peter Ford, Baby Ford. Mo No, TripleR. Nick Dwyer OK, but you had other people doing stuff as well? Mo Yes, but these were friends. Peter Ford did release something on the label, together with Kotai and Baader, so there was some cooperation, but mostly it was just us. Nick Dwyer The label is still in existence? Mo It’s still in existence, but it has kind of passed. Nick Dwyer When was the last 12” released? Mo The last thing was this CD released last year. Nick Dwyer Together with Kompakt. Mo This was distributed by Kompakt. Before that it was Neuton, but we changed. Nick Dwyer Did you do any other club nights? Mo We started Panasonic from ‘95 to ’97. The concept was we were inviting producers and they were presenting themselves in whatever platform they liked. We also had producers’ nights. I have a very large record collection, so we would have, for example, a night of Leo Anibaldi, a famous early ‘90s techno artist from Rome. And so it was very intense because of this. It was not just party music, but the sound of one person for the whole evening, it was really thick, you know? Nick Dwyer Did you want to encourage new producers and give them a platform or was it for already established producers? Mo Well, it was just friends. People would sometimes approach us, but normally it was friends. The scene in Berlin is still growing but even at that time it was quite big. Nick Dwyer How are things in Berlin now? I could reel off several people who’ve moved to Berlin. I’m sure you know the whole Richie Hawtin story, the list goes on, that whole “I’m going to Berlin, the streets are paved with gold”-thing. Mo It seems if people are thinking of moving, they move to Berlin. Compared to some big cities it’s still quite cheap. You can find a way to make a living, a studio is affordable. Some other cities are just insane. I like the city, the architecture, really wide streets, a lot of parks. It’s a big city but you can still make your way very easily. And then, of course, I have so many friends there by now, I’ve been there for 13 years. Nick Dwyer The last few years you’ve been involved with this company called Handle with Care. It’s a bit of a grey area. You make your record, you want to get it pressed, but there’s this whole process in between, it’s got to go to a pressing plant, mastering and so on, and it can get really confusing. What’s the whole history behind it? Who started Handle with Care, and what was the ethos behind running the company? Mo It was started five years ago by a woman called Silke Radecki. She used to run Neuton distribution, so she learned her job there, then moved to Berlin and the idea is to help people with their releases. She was also supported by friends. Perlon was one of the first labels. Nick Dwyer What areas does Handle with Care look after? Is it just manufacturing, publishing? Mo Sometimes people just call us and say, “I want to put my music out.” We can give advice. For example, if someone doesn’t have a distributor, which we don’t do, we can give any advice. What we regularly do is pass the master onto a mastering studio, work with several studios, in England and Germany mainly, so we choose which ones to use with the producer. Nick Dwyer You say Perlon was the first to get involved and it’s now expanded to what, 500, 600 labels? Who are your clients, who are you looking after? Mo Me personally, I’m mainly looking after English-speaking labels. We usually take care of underground labels. I can give you tons of names, but probably you’ve never heard of them. The bigger ones are Bpitch Control, Gigolo, Perlon, Mental Groove, Hefty, Third Ear, the stuff of Marco Passarani, who actually invited me here, which is Nature and Pigna. All over, you know? Nick Dwyer Musically, all styles as well? Mo Yeah, we’re doing jazz and heavy metal as well, but 99% is electronic music. Also, Honest Jon’s, reggae. We don’t really care what kind of music it is. Nick Dwyer So what kinds of processes are we going through here? Say, they finished it in the studio and their mate is a really good engineer, does it go through another mastering process? Mo Yes. Nick Dwyer Tell us about the process from there to there. Mo You have your master CD-R, should be either data CD-R or audio, could be also DAT, could be different formats. You have your music and you give it to us. You don’t know which mastering studio to use. I talk to you and you tell me what kind of music it is. Maybe you say it’s for the dancefloor and it should have some power, and it should have some EQ-ing on the highs. So I talk to you about the different studios I would suggest in your case. Say, the Exchange is a big studio in London. So I would send it there. And you should supply all the titles, whether you want it on 45 RPM or 33 RPM. Maybe you tell me it’s three tracks, so I ask, “Do you know which one is the A-side and which the B-side?” Then, if either side is longer than ten minutes, then it’s definitely on 33. If it’s only seven minutes or so, then it can be done on 45. Nick Dwyer What’s the limit you can get away with without losing sound quality on 33? I hear it’s around eleven minutes, but my old Star Wars album I got when I was eight years old is 45 minutes long on one side. Mo You can have about 30 minutes in an LP format. But then it’s really tight and the volume is pretty low. Then I would advise you to use DMM direct metal mastering, because if you’re cutting on lacquer, the good thing about lacquer is the grooves, you can cut really deep into the material. The stylus of the cutting machine can go really deep. And you can use wide space and this makes it sound more voluminous. If you don’t have that space and you have to go with really short-distance loops, then you should use direct metal mastering because the sound will be transferred one-to-one without losing anything. I’d talk to you about this. Normally, when people come to us they’ve not been talking to anyone. Nick Dwyer Now it goes to the mastering house before it goes to the plant, they master it, cut the mastering lacquer and then that goes to the plant? Mo To start the pressing you need the music to be transferred into something that can be used as a stamper. You have your track on CD-R and you need it on vinyl. So the mastering studio would listen to the music, see how long the track is, how far can we go up to the center, because the closer you come to the center the more resolution you will lose. The mastering studio will take care of that, tell you not to come too close to the center or something. For example, if you have one track with delicate heights and the other is more bass-y, you would use the first track outside here because the resolution is better, it’s just a physical thing. This is something the mastering studio should take care of, and then you have your music on a lacquer. Nick Dwyer What exactly is a lacquer? Mo It’s bigger and inside there is metal and on top an acetate. It’s very delicate. When we receive this lacquer in our office, it’s in a big box. Nick Dwyer Is it the same as a dubplate? Mo It’s similar, but the dubplate can only be used 40 times and then it’s just off. This lacquer will be sent to the pressing plant and they start the galvanic processing. Nick Dwyer Can you explain galvanic processing? Mo It looks like a chemical laboratory; actually, it is. They receive the lacquer and put it in a machine where it will be galvanised, with silver on top. Your lacquer afterwards will be destroyed. Some people say, “I want my lacquer back.” But it doesn’t exist anymore because it will be looking like this. You can even play it – you shouldn’t because you will damage it. Then after the galvanic process the grooves will all be outside. This is called “the father,” then you do “the mother.” You can play the mother but it’s made of metal. Then you’re doing a stamper of the mother, so the grooves are coming out, and this stamper will be placed in the machine. You do one stamper for each side, you make a positive of it, then a negative, then another positive. So you have a bottom and a top. These machines look really old, I think they’re still the same as in the ’40s and ’50s. So there is vinyl granulate that is really hot coming into this machine. The paper labels are already in the machine on top and bottom. Then it’s pressed. The vinyl is already inside and will be pressed with the stamper. Then there is a knife that will cut the edge. Nick Dwyer With the advent of CDs a lot of people have been saying for years that vinyl will die, blah, blah, blah. There were stories about EMI closing their UK pressing plant. Are these pressing plants sustaining enough business to maintain a living and keep open? Mo There is another French plant closing down, and another one in Germany who told us just last week that they stopped doing vinyl. So it’s definitely not a growing market. For us, we as a company are growing. It definitely doesn’t die. I don’t know how long it will stay like this but at the moment it seems like it’s still continuously growing a bit. Nick Dwyer How many plants like this are there in the world? More than a hundred? Mo Oh no, no. In Germany, for example, there are two right now, which we are working with. There is one in Netherlands. I think there’s one in England still, Curved Pressings, but I worked with them once and I think they were into weed a lot. It was taking very very long so we don’t use them anymore. Nick Dwyer A friend of mine was making a record and he got them pressed in Czechoslovakia. There wasn’t much awareness in New Zealand of where to get records pressed, but he did some research and got them pressed there, then there’s all these people in New Zealand getting their records pressed at this magical pressing plant in Czechoslovakia. Mo Our first record this year was done there. We had our first three releases done in Czechoslovakia. We always went there and passed it onto them. There’s one in Czechoslovakia, one in Romania and one in Poland I’ve heard, but we’re not working with them. Not because we don’t want to but because the ones we work with are sufficient. Nick Dwyer What dictates which plant you work with? The sound factor is taken care of from the master lacquer. So is a different plant going to affect the sound or is it just cost and shipping? Mo Well, it can affect the sound. It depends how they do the vinyl. My customers are mainly divided between a pressing plant in France, MPO, and another one in Germany, Pallas. Pallas is using more graphite parts in their vinyl so it’s softer. If you have more delicate sound, like ambient, then it could be advisable to use Pallas vinyl. But normally my customers are from the dance scene – DJs – so it’s good that the vinyl is harder and more resistant, for taking in and out of the sleeve and so on. Mainly it’s cost calculation. For German customers it’s good to use a German pressing plant because shipping is cheaper. Usually with a customer we give them estimates. Let’s say you’re doing 1,000 copies and you’re planning a repress of 300 units within the next couple of months, then another 300 units, then MPO would be better for you because they are cheaper on smaller pressings. Nick Dwyer My friend back home, let’s use him as a case study, he’s only pressing say 500. Now because of the 500 or so labels that Handle with Care deals with, it doesn’t really matter how many you’re pressing up of a different track, it’s the fact you’re pressing up lots of different tracks that secures you a lower rate, yes? Mo We’re working like a broker, so we have a key account at these pressing plants, and from time to time we’re working with new partners and we can tell them, “OK, you tell us you want 1.20 euro, but we can get it here for 86 cent, so what shall we do, you know?” Of course we are dealing this way. Nick Dwyer What’s the preferred choice of format. DATs, CD-R or MP3? Mo No, MP3 not at all. It’s advisable to come up with audio CD-R or data, but then you should ask what data to put in. Actually, there is one studio we’re working with, Dubplates & Mastering, who have a really good homepage. Nick Dwyer That’s the Basic Channel guys? Mo Yes. So if you want to know what format to use, how to provide it, what can be done, and even if you want locked grooves cut, check their homepage. Nick Dwyer Is it difficult to do a locked groove? Mo No, it just needs a certain specification, which needs to be followed really carefully. I think it’s something like 133BPM for a 33BPM groove, and it needs to be 1.8 seconds. But this is something you can check on the Dubplates & Mastering website. Nick Dwyer Now, correct me if I’m wrong, but Q-Bert and the Thud Rumble guys have perfected the skip-proof groove. It’s not skip-proof but the groove doesn’t run in a straight circle, it zigzags out, so if the needle jumps it will still jump into the same place. Are you familiar with that? Mo What are you talking about? Nick Dwyer Thud Rumble, it’s a hip-hop label that does battle records for DJs and they’ve perfected this format where the grooves run in a kind of zigzag all the way round, so if the needle jumps it will be at the same soundpoint when it comes back in. I’m probably not describing it very well. Someone mentioned a glassmaster, what’s that? Mo That’s a stamper that you use for a CD. With a CD you can give us a CD-R already mastered, so everything is already in order as it would be on the final CD, the sound levels are adjusted. You would need someone to do the pre-mastering. Then we pass it on to the pressing plant and they do the glassmastering in the glassmastering studio. It’s the same as with the vinyl but not as many steps, not as complicated and it doesn’t look like an old fashioned chemical laboratory, but more hi-tech. Nick Dwyer So, you don’t just look after vinyl, it’s also CDs, DVDs, the whole works. Anything a label needs, they go to you. What about, for example, some guys want to get 50 test pressings done to hand out to DJs. Not necessarily being a client per se... Mo Well, immediately they would be a client, if they do it with us. It doesn’t matter. For 50 white labels I would tell you, the mastering will cost around 340 euro plus galvanic processing and three test pressings another 170 euro, and then 1.20 euro per white label. And then there would be shipping, and that would be it. Nick Dwyer How much is it per unit? Mo Per unit? Nick Dwyer You said €350 for the mastering. Mo €350 for the mastering. Then there is shipping lacquers to the pressing plant which is another 20 euro or so. If you only want three test pressings, then the shipping is free with MPO. This is why I mostly use MPO because I usually deal with foreign customers and it’s better for them to get the shipping for free. It would be, uh, [calculates sums aloud] 520? Nick Dwyer 520, that’s all you’ve got to pay from mastering through to pressing. And from there, 50 test pressings you said 1.20 euro each. Now what if I want 500 how much is the cost going to come down, and then what about for 1,000? Mo [laughs] I’m really bad at prices. It depends. For example, if you have some vision of what the printed label should look like. Then we provide the specifications and then we hope you have someone at your side doing the graphics who knows what he or she is doing. So sometimes it takes time. Then, if you have a two color label, or let’s say one color, black and white. Then you send us the graphic files and we send it to our developer and they’ll be sent to the pressing plant, because in France they have a print shop inside the factory. Nick Dwyer So, not all these plants offer artwork service for the sleeves? Mo No, the sleeves are always done at the printers. It depends on what kind of sleeve you want and then we’ll say, “OK, in their case we’ll use this printer because they are a better option.” Nick Dwyer So I’m pressing up 500, how much more am I going to pay going from that normal sleeve to that? Say, I’ve got a great picture of me as a baby and I want to put that on the cover too. Mo If you only want to do 500 copies, if you’re planning to do some money on it, I’d advise not to use your own sleeves, but to use standard sleeves. This is a standard disco sleeve, inner sleeve. [gesturing at record sleeve] There you don’t have manual packaging, they come out of the machine into the sleeve. Manual packaging is people standing at a high table doing it by hand, with gloves on. Nick Dwyer So the process gets drawn out? Mo For this manual packaging you have to pay five cent and four cent for the paper bag, so it’s already nine cent extra. The cost of a disco sleeve, I’d have to check myself. Of course, if you’re using a standard sleeve, this one here is CYK, four colors, so you need four films, which will be sent to the printer. You would need at least 600 sleeves for 500 vinyls because some will get damaged in transport and at the pressing plant. During manual packaging something can happen. So, if you’re only doing 500 copies, it’s very expensive to do a sleeve of your own. Nick Dwyer Do you make new labels shy away from fancy artwork because it’s expensive and they need to keep costs down? Mo If someone is just starting, I would tell them, of course. Unless they have a lot of money they’ll have to count and calculate really tight. Some people do it because they love it and they don’t care, so they want a fancy sleeve even for 500 copies, so I don’t stop them. Nick Dwyer If someone has made a track and they think it’s going to be the next big thing, they want to press up 5,000. Would you sit there and listen to it and say, “Go with 500 and then repress”? Mo No, no, this is something they would have to discuss with their distributor. Nick Dwyer Most labels these days, are they just pressing in batches of 1,000 and re-pressing? Mo Yes. Nick Dwyer What’s the turn around time from you having the master to the finished product? Mo If we receive a master, which is done properly – not one with a lot of problems – then two weeks. Then, once you approve the test pressings and we receive the graphic artwork according to our specifications, another two weeks. Nick Dwyer Once I get my test press back from MPO, what am I looking for? Mo First you have to check that it is your own track. It can happen. [laughs] Not very often, but it happened to me personally in Czechoslovakia. Then you check for crackling noises in case they didn’t do the galvanic process properly. If you tell us there are crackling noises that shouldn’t be there, then I’ll call the pressing plant. Immediately, they will make another test pressing just to make sure. If that crackling noise is still there or even if it crackles in the same place that proves there was some dirt, or something was wrong with the stamper. So either they’d do a new stamper, or sometimes they have to admit... It can happen to the best pressing plant. It doesn’t happen very often but it can happen that they destroyed the original part, so everything has to be done again. Nick Dwyer That’s at no extra cost to you, the pressing plant take care of that? Mo This is something that we take care of. We make sure that whoever’s responsible will cover the cost. You may lose time, but that is something you cannot help. Nick Dwyer This is another reason why it makes sense to come in with you. Say I’ve just made the best bootleg ever, some old Prince track, so it’s sample-led but I just want to press up some cheeky white labels, can I come to you for it? Mo We also take care of mechanical rights. This is the first question when you ask for performer invoice. We would make sure mechanical rights are cleared. Nick Dwyer What are mechanical rights exactly? Mo Every country, except for the States, although they do have associations connected to this worldwide organization, normally. Let’s give an example from Germany. If you’re a German artist planning to produce and spread your tracks among a few labels it would be advisable to register with GEMA, the company for mechanical rights in Germany. Nick Dwyer Every single country has a different company. Mo In England it’s MCPS, in Italy SIAE, in France it’s SESAM, SUISA in Switzerland. This actually works really well, if you’re coming to us as a customer, and you say, “I want 500 copies of my track done, I’m a registered artist.” Then you’d have to fill in a form. You can register yourself and have GEMA send us a fax to us with the confirmation that this is done. Otherwise, write down your name and artist name under which you’re registered with GEMA, the names of the tracks, the length of the tracks, who was the writer, who was the producer, the quantity to be pressed and the price it’s to be sold at in the shops. Nick Dwyer What does it cost to register with these companies? Mo In Germany it’s 50 euro a year. Nick Dwyer Do they also look after money from radio plays? Mo Yes, they are. In Germany there is another association, which is like a publisher, GVL. GEMA is also taking care of this in a way but it is a big bowl and all the radio stations put in whatever they have played and normally it’s like, say, Prince is having this amount [indicates large amount], Madonna is having this amount [indicates large amount] and then some underground labels get this amount [indicates small amount]. If they claim that they played your track, your money will be passed onto Prince because he’s on top. This is something that’s not really working because people don’t always announce what they play. Nick Dwyer In the clubs, if you get a track played you are supposed to get paid for it but because it’s such a grey area and no one writes down what they play it doesn’t happen. Mo In clubs usually they have to pay a fee to those associations, but since they have no playlist the money goes to those who are played the most. If all the clubs would fill out the forms saying what they played then the situation would be changed, but I don’t think it will happen. Nick Dwyer You guys have direct links with just GEMA? Mo We deal with GEMA and GEMA contacts those other companies across the world. Nick Dwyer So say, for example, someone comes to you from a label in Siberia, you would make sure all their mechanical rights are covered as well? Mo It depends, if there is a company like this in Siberia, then we will contact GEMA and pass on the information we have and the artists, then they’ll look to see if there’s a partner company in Siberia. If not, then they will see if you are registered anywhere in the world. But if they don’t find you then they’ll say there are no licenses to be paid. So, if you are the label owner producing your own stuff, you won’t need to pay anything but also you won’t get anything. If you are a label owner releasing some stuff by a Siberian artist, then you won’t need to pay anything and the artist won’t get anything. But, if he would be registered and you are just the label owner, then you’d have to pay and the artist would get it. Nick Dwyer What about compilations? A major label picks up your track for a compilation, you guys protect the artist working with GEMA? Mo We can give some advice but we’re not a publisher. All we can do is make sure everything to do with the pressing is done properly and legally. Nick Dwyer So going back to my original question, if I come to you with my wickedest new bootleg that’s like a Nas beat and a Prince vocal, you guys wouldn’t be happy pressing it? Mo Well, if you can prove Prince agreed with it, then there’s no problem. You’d have to clear it in advance. But, if you just say, “OK, I won’t tell them it’s Prince, I’ll just tell them it’s me.” We don’t listen to your music – I just told you [laughs] – we pass it onto the pressing plant. They have someone going through every single release, checking it carefully. They will find out and they will inform us and say, “You told us everything was legal but it cannot be. On the label it says Nick whatever and it’s Prince.” So everything would be freezed, you’d have to pay for your whole production but you wouldn’t get your records. Nick Dwyer But someone walking into a record shop, there’s millions and millions of bootlegs released all the time. If there’s someone at the pressing plant with their eagle eye watching over things, where are these guys getting their bootlegs? Mo I don’t know. [laughs] Nick Dwyer Not MPO or Czechoslovakia? Mo I don’t know. Nick Dwyer Any questions? Audience Member I’m very into hip-hop and I’ve got hundreds of records where someone has taken an acapella from one record and an instrumental from another and stuck them together and put them out. I know people have done it all over the world. In order to be able to do that, because it’s a creative thing in hip-hop and artists don’t do it to steal music, they do it to show other people how well these records go together. So in effect they’re promoting the artists. So if I wanted to do that, is it impossible unless I’ve got a friend working in the... ? Mo I mean, for us, we don’t care as long as nobody is complaining. I know there are records we did with samples where the original artist is aware of it, and many of them like it, not because of promotion, because they like the track. If no one makes a problem, then it’s OK. All you have to do with us is fill in the form. You don’t have to say, “I used this sample blah blah blah,” just that you are the creator of this music and all relevant information. This is what counts for us, not the content. Sometimes, especially lately, we got fascist music and since we are not listening to it, we just pass it on. And then the mastering studio says, “Hey, this is no good, please listen tothis. We are not going to do this.” This kind of music will definitely be stopped. Nick Dwyer When you say fascist music, you mean anti-political sentiment? Mo Yeah, I mean, Nazi songs. Some pressing plants that weren’t so bothered by it were getting into trouble for doing it. If you are self-confident and you think it’s OK to use the sample, then do it. But if it’s not OK, then someone might come up and say, “It’s not just using a sample. This is a bootleg of Prince.” Then it will be stopped. Of course, you can fill in something that’s not true and we won’t be able to check it, but if it’ll be found out at the pressing plant. But what you’re talking about, there’ll be no problem. Participant Do you charge a set fee or a percentage of what the record makes for your service? Mo What we are doing is, you pay the whole production to us. This is it. There’s no extra fee of, “OK, this is going to be a major hit and we want our profit.” Participant How long can a sample be before you have to license it? Mo First, this is nothing to do with us. We’re not a GEMA or anything like it. There is a rumor that says three seconds is okay, but as far as I know, it’s not. Then again, if nobody is complaining, if you’re using it in your individual way and there’s no harm in it, then there’s no problem.

Plastician
Chris Reed’s career began thanks to a cheap pair of used turntables and an interest in the sounds coming out of his native London, including UK garage. By the early 2000s, Reed had graduated to Rinse FM, then a leading pirate station, and to making his own beats with an ear for a sound that was becoming known as grime. His early productions attracted the attention of Aphex Twin’s Rephlex label, who featured him on the first Grime compilation, and he went on to release with Soul Jazz, Boy Better Know and Planet Mu as well as his own Terrorhythm. As attention around his work grew in the mid-2000s he eventually renamed himself Plastician. Sitting down at the 2004 Red Bull Music Academy, Reed shared details of his personal journey through grime and how to bring DIY sonics to the next level.
Hosted by Nick Dwyer Known to most of the world as Plasticman with a C and not a K. Plastician That’s right. Nick Dwyer Rather than talking about what you do, we thought we’d just kick it off with a tune from yourself. What’s this? Plastician This is a release I had called “Hard Graft,” which was ... I think it came out in 2002, 2003 sort of time. Not that long ago, but I think it was my third release. I’m just going to play it for you now anyway. (music: Mark One vs. Plasticman – “Hard Graft”) Nick Dwyer For a lot of people that sound, that whole style of music might be very foreign. For people that don’t know, what are we calling this? Plastician At the moment, people are sort of labeling it as a new genre called grime, which sort of evolved from the old UK garage scene when it started getting a little bit dark. People have labeled it grime. It’s a totally new kind of music that’s coming out of London at the moment, and it’s starting to spread around. Nick Dwyer If you had to describe to your grandmother what grime was all about musically, how would you tell her? Plastician I suppose it’s like energetic, dark, mainly instrumental because most tracks are made with the intention of perhaps an MC to spit lyrics over the top of it or... I don’t know. It’s quite high energy, dark stuff really. Nick Dwyer When you say that, you’re talking more about the whole dancehall concept, we’d say rhythm culture, and people come out with a rhythm and MCs toast over it, and it’s kind of evolved from that? Plastician Yeah, totally. It’s the same concept, yeah. Nick Dwyer Without a doubt in modern electronic music, I don’t think there’s been any more genre that’s been more confusing for people. In the last five years you’ve seen the speed garage thing, the UK garage, and 2-step. We had breakstep, then there’s grime and sub low and eski, and it’s all a bit mad really. What’s the difference, and what’s up with all these people calling their stuff different things when... Nick Dwyer I don’t know. I think it changes so much that everyone’s trying to stick a pin on it, and say, “This is what it’s called.” Someone will go, “Well I don’t want to call it that. I’m not calling my music that, we’re going to call it this instead.” It just got so confusing for everyone that someone had to come along and go, “Let’s just call it grime, and that’ll do,” sort of thing. It’s gotten to that point now. Nick Dwyer Everyone sat there and went, “OK, we’ll call it grime.” Plastician Yeah. I think... I don’t even know if everyone sort of... It’s not even an official name. It’s what most people call it now. Technically, it’s not even the proper name for it. It’s just what a lot of people would call it. Nick Dwyer If someone says to me, “I make sub low,” just go, “No, you make grime.” Plastician Yeah, basically. Sub low is a sub-division of grime, but there’s no point in trying to pigeonhole it anymore. It’s such a small scene that hasn’t really reached its full potential yet. There’s no point in trying to pigeonhole it even more. I think if you just stick to grime it’ll be all right. Nick Dwyer Where did the word grime come from? Plastician It basically got... When the whole thing switched from UK garage, and it became quite MC-based and dark, you would hear MCs on the mic saying, “Oh this one’s grimey,” or someone would go, “Oh that tune’s grimey,” then it got... DJs were going, “I don’t really like grime, this grimey stuff.” The garage DJs would get on the mic and say, “We don’t support grime.” It just stuck really. It just took a few people to start using the word and... Nick Dwyer If I was to look up in the dictionary the word “grimey,” what would I find? Plastician Dirt. Nick Dwyer Dirt? Plastician Dirt, scum. I don’t know. Nick Dwyer What you were saying before, I don’t think you need... genres evolve so much, and with all these different names, what I think would be cool is for a lot of people also, the word garage conjures up the US images of garage. Plastician Yeah, totally. Nick Dwyer Maybe we can break down over the last six or seven years what it’s evolved from, and with some tunes just to give people ideas. Plastician Yeah, definitely. I’ve got some old garage tracks as well just so you can see the difference, how it’s kind of changed over the years or like this whole industry standard. Nick Dwyer First of all, at what point did the UK producers take the old US version of house and garage, when did the UK producers start picking up on that, and why did they pick up on the name garage? Plastician I’m not too sure to be honest with you. I think it was like, at the time it was like when jungle and that was starting to fade out a little bit. People wanted something new. Again, this was exactly how grime kind of split from UK garage. It was like the drum & bass scene split a little bit when the old vocal thing started coming in and the MCs were starting to get on the mic. People were like, “Oh that’s not how I used to like it.” Then garage came along, and people were like, “Yeah, I want to get on this.” Then that got ruined as well. To them anyway, it got ruined. I mean it’s, everyone’s always looking for something new. I think that’s why everything evolved. It’s just a continuum. Everything just carries on moving. Nick Dwyer Nice, what’s this record we’re going to listen to now? Plastician This is an old track, let me just check that I’ve got the right side of it. An old garage track actually. Nick Dwyer Which is on Locked On? Plastician This was on Locked On, which was a big garage label. Nick Dwyer It kind of spawned out of this record shop called Pure Groove. Plastician That’s right. In London, and they were on the label. This is an industry standard track. This basically is like garage as we knew it when it first arrived. (music: unknown) That’s garage basically. That was what it sort of spawned from basically. That was garage. Nick Dwyer Speed garage or UK garage? Plastician Hmm. Nick Dwyer Speed garage is a naff journalistic term that Mixmag came up with sort of thing. Plastician It was like a bit of a mad one. Speed garage is kind of a bit more bass driven than that. That was a bit more like house, a bit more US style. Speed garage was a bit more bass driven like the 187 Lockdown and that kind of stuff. Nick Dwyer There were a couple of remixes that Armand Van Helden did ... Plastician Yeah, definitely some of his stuff. Nick Dwyer For you, growing up, what was your entry point into this music, and underground music in general? Plastician To be honest with you, living in England. I think England is like, the whole country’s brainwashed by the UK charts. I didn’t actually get into underground music until quite later on. I was probably about 15 or 16 when I started listening to jungle, and I was into it but not as into it as a lot of people were and a lot of my friends were. I was checking for new school break stuff. Some of the old breakbeat stuff, and the sort of stuff people were breakdancing too. I was just checking for old stuff. When I left secondary school at 16, I went to college and started listening to pirates and I was listening to garage at about probably the age of 16, which is about five or six years ago. Not that long ago really. Nick Dwyer For you, what was it initially about garage that made you go, “Damn, that’s me. I’m feeling it.” Plastician I suppose at 16 or 17 you start thinking about going out and getting drunk, and at the time that was the music that was played in the clubs, and it was like, “Yeah, I quite like this music.” When you’ve had a few drinks in there, it seems even better. It’s like you’re going out with your mates, and it was like, “Yeah, I quite like this stuff,” and started buying records and got into DJing almost straight-away as soon as I started listening to pirates. I thought, “Yeah I quite like this.” Nick Dwyer If there was one point that was a bit of a catalyst to going, “Right, I like going out and rocking out to it, but I want to be playing it. I want to be making it.” What was it for you? Plastician It was the opportunity I had to buy a set of decks off of my mate. I thought, “Why not?” He had them going all dirt cheap, I thought I can’t really take up that. I’ve got to take the opportunity. I might as well have a go, and if they’re cheap. I think I paid 150 pounds for a full set of decks and turntables and it had a mixer and everything. I just haven’t looked back since really. I just got right into it straight away. Nick Dwyer So for you, obviously the DJing came before the production. Plastician Yeah. Yeah. Nick Dwyer Was it out of necessity that the production side of things started to kick off? Plastician When I first started I totally... Like even now really, I’m not really a musically-minded person. I just know what I like musically. I remember a mate of mine telling me, “Oh yeah, you’ll start making tracks soon.” I was like, “No, I will never. I haven’t got the brain for it. I don’t have a clue how to use that equipment.” It just got to a point one day I was DJing and listening to pirate radio, I had been on a pirate at the time, I think I might have just left the pirate station at the time. I was listening to a pirate, and there was a DJ on there who was quite a big producer at the time, but wasn’t the greatest DJ. I just thought, “Do you know what? This is really annoying. I’m a better DJ than this guy, but I’m getting absolutely nowhere.” I thought maybe if I start trying to make some beats and I get lucky, I’ll get a set on radio and that. Low and behold... Nick Dwyer It did. Plastician It worked, yeah. Nick Dwyer When you talk about pirate radio, I’m pretty sure everyone in this room knows a bit about pirate radio, but for UK music and the evolution of UK underground music over the last 20 years or so, pirate radio has played a pivotal role. Just how important has pirate radio been for garage, and what kind of role does it play today, still? Plastician It’s massive. There’s god knows how many pirate stations in London getting hit by the DTI [Department of Trade and Industry] every couple of days. But they’re still going. I saw a list on the Internet actually, somebody actually took time to go through the dial and say, “This is a list of all the pirate stations,” and there was over a hundred pirate stations, on rotation or sort of on and off. Taking time on and off the air waves. But the station that I’m on, Rinse FM, has been running for ten years now. Kool FM still runs, and they’ve been running from back in the jungle days as well. So it just plays such a big role in bringing forward the new music. Nick Dwyer If you go back to like the mid-‘90s, every single pirate in London and up north, was all jungle, all jungle. Then when the garage thing came, they’re kind of saying that all these pirates are now with garage on pirates everywhere. Break down musically what you’re hearing on pirates these days. Plastician I reckon 90 percent of it is grime. Garage, grime. The traditional UK garage is almost gone now, so there’s a couple of stations what will play it all day long and nothing else. And then there’s other stations what might play a little bit of garage during the day, and then at night time it’s pure grime. And there’s actually now a couple of stations which play 100 percent grime, MCs on every set, kids, everything like mad. Them one’s are mad though. They go on and off all the time because the kids hit up the studio and sooner or later someone finds out where it is and they’re having trouble staying on all the time because there’s so many people in the studio all the time. Nick Dwyer It is still as bad as it used to be to point with the DTI, if you get busted, like 50,000 pound fines. I remember a guy that was sort of playing pirate and he had about 50,00 records and they ran to his house and confiscated all of his records. Is it still that bad that they actively? plastician Yeah, they can literally take whatever they want. If they find you in a pirate studio at a time when you are broadcasting, they can take whatever they want. There is no law to say they can’t walk in your house and take all your records, your decks, anything... Do you know what I mean? Anything caught in sight as well, anything in the building that you’re broadcasting from. Nick Dwyer I mean musically from that whole scene you know the one person that has amazing international success is Dizzee Rascal. Now, with someone like Dizzee Rascal, and there has been a few other names obviously like Wiley and all that have started to crop up over the last year or so, without pirate radio would we be seeing people like Dizzee? Plastician No, definitely not. The commercial market in the UK is really, it’s so, you’re spoon-fed it. Do you know what I mean? There’s no one will come through unless there’s a hype on them. The whole Pop Idol thing, these people aren’t... do you know what I mean? Half of them aren’t good enough to be on television and to be singing. They’ll get signed by a major record label because they have been on television for the last six months. Do you know what I mean? They last ten minutes. Then there’s actual people like Dizzee trying to come through. If it weren’t for the hype you got on pirate radio and playing at raves and stuff, the majors wouldn’t have listened. He could have sent them a million demos and they would have just been like, “No, what they hell is that?” Do you know what I mean? It’s too weird. Nick Dwyer Just quickly going back to the Dizzee thing. How is he perceived within the garage community, and is there a certain element of Dizzee’s done a lot of good for the scene internationally? Plastician Yeah, totally. I think there’s some people in the scene are split. There’s more intellectual people within the scene are really pleased for him, to see that he’s doing stuff and he’s really sort of pushing boundaries lyrically and with his sound. He’s totally representing, he’s opened the door for people like myself to come through and show what I’ve got to offer. Then you’ve got the more narrow-minded people who are, like, they used to go and watch him at the raves and they used to listen to him on pirate and now because you are not going hear Dizzee on pirate every Saturday and he’s not coming and mashing up all the raves and they are like, “He’s selling out and he’s not street anymore, he’s not real.” It’s like, “Get a grip man. What you rather be doing? Sitting in a record shop on a Saturday just chatting to people or going and flying out all over the world and playing your records, playing your music to thousands of people?” I know what I would choose. You know what I mean? Nick Dwyer The track you just played was a UK garage thing. Should we play another bit now that’s kind of, you know, plots out the course of evolution for the music? Plastician Okay, yeah, cool. After UK garage there was 2-step which was... which was slightly... slightly less dance-y but a little bit more R&B sort of styles going on. Nick Dwyer And the name 2-step came from, just, you know, just the beat. Plastician Just like the way the beats were sort of like, yeah. Get this track on here. (music: Genius Cru – “Waiting” / applause) Nick Dwyer Who was that by? Plastician This was by Genius Cru who actually, they had a commercial release of a track not long after that. I think this is 1999, 1999-2000. They had a release in the charts. Nick Dwyer "What Is It Called?" Plastician No, that was More Fire Crew. Genius Cru had “Boom Selection.” And they had another track called “Course Bruv.” Nick Dwyer ‘Course bruv! Plastician That label actually, this label Chronic put out some of the early So Solid stuff before they got signed as well. So it’s quite a big 2-step label. Nick Dwyer Musically with 2-step we’re kind of dealing with the same kind of bass hits and vocal edits as the 4/4 stuff you were playing before but now the beat pattern changed. Plastician The beat pattern had changed, it was just skippy beats and the bass was more punchy whereas like the 4/4 bass was a bit more subby, a bit more rolling. This was a bit more punchy and a bit more in your face. Nick Dwyer So in terms of that four to the floor sound, you know, people like Todd Edwards and all that. Is anyone actually still doing that in London? Plastician There’s a few. There’s a few people. It’s like music, music’s never going to die totally. There is always someone in the world who’s going to be doing something, it’s never going to totally fade away. So there’s a few guys, there’s about a handful, literally a handful of producers like Matt Qualified, MJ Cole’s still doing UK garage. Karl Brown is producing stuff with El-B under El-Tuff. Karl “Tuff Enough” Brown and El-B are producing under the alias of El-Tuff. They produce quite soulful four-to-the-floor garage stuff. Nick Dwyer But essentially, the garage scene as we have known it ispretty much non-existent. Plastician Yeah, it’s pretty much non-existent. I think it was when the first couple of grime tunes came around all the kids loved it and all of the old garage people were like, “We don’t, we don’t like this.” And a lot of the people involved with garage at the time were like, “I’m nothing to do with this grime, I don’t like this stuff, I’ve had enough of garage now if that’s the way it’s going...” So then half of them people went on to doing funky house and then you’ve got the other half of people who were like... When the girls left, a lot of the Friday night drinking crew went out to Croydon and got mashed up and went and raved up to some garage. When the girls leave the scene, they left it as well. So they moved on to listening to some R&B, again getting brainwashed by what was being played on Radio 1 and Kiss FM and stuff like that in London. It’s the UK way of being brainwashed by what’s getting played on commercial radio. Nick Dwyer One of the things that was kind of, you know the symbiosis with the garage scene was the screw face element. It was that bad vibe. A few stabbings at Ayia Napa here and there. Plastician Yeah, yeah. Nick Dwyer When did that element kind of, because that element really did give the music a bad name, didn’t it? Plastician Yeah. It was when it got commercial and it was cool to go out and rave to garage. It was such a bling. It was like the UK’s hip-hop scene basically, it was like, how you can go out and sort of buy champagne and go out with all your gold on and it got a bit boring. You know what I mean? That’s when going out became, you sort of had to watch what you were doing, thinking, “Am I going to be all right in this club?” It got really moody and that’s about the same time as the girls started leaving, the girls don’t like seeing fights and stuff like that. Not happening, then. That’s when it started to go downhill. Nick Dwyer You were talking about before, one of the first grime tunes that came out, that was probably labelled grime, was a track called “Pulse X.” You’ve got that here? Plastician Yeah. Nick Dwyer What year did this come out? Plastician This came out, I think 2001, 2002. Bout then, yeah. Probably 2001 like. I remember the first time I heard it, it was at a Big Apple Christmas party. Nick Dwyer Big Apple was a record shop? Plastician Big Apple was a record shop in Croydon and they specialize in garage from 2-step to four-to-the-floor garage, it’s always been one of the main stockists in London, definitely in South London the main one. I remember they had a Christmas party and they had Heartless Crew booked there and Oris Jay and Hatcha played there. At the time it was still quite garage-y. It was starting to get a bit dark, a bit experimental. This track, even when it started to get experimental, it was just like, “What is it?” It’s a mad track. It’s totally different to anything that’s been played at the time. Nick Dwyer Were you producing at this stage? Plastician At this stage I was dabbling in production, I’d just got FruityLoops off the internet and was messing about with it, trying to fit beats that were terrible but still, you’ve got to start somewhere, you know what I mean? Nick Dwyer This tune is one of the tunes that made you go, “Oi, damn, that’s...” Plastician Yeah. I think this kick-started the grime scene. Because it’s such a simple track, there was thousands of kids in London like, “I really love that tune, but listen how simple it is I’m gonna make a tune like that.” There was a period of six months where you were hearing some poor, poor tracks man. I was probably one of the culprits as well, listen to this tune, it’s terrible like. Nick Dwyer At least you can admit it to yourself. Plastician The whole thing of it was, someone’s made a track, everyone would be like, “Mate, that’s rubbish.” Yeah, but it’s as good as that, or sounds like that, it’s like, “Come on, give it a rest, give it a few months, you’ll be all right.” This is “Pulse X,” this is what kick-started it all. (music: Musical Mob - “Pulse X” / applause) Nick Dwyer This is around the same time there was another label that was being banded about which was 8-bar. Plastician This is it. When this track came out, obviously there was no such thing as grime. Everyone was like, “What is that?” You know what I mean, all the garage people were like, “That’s rubbish.” All the kids and people like me were starting to get into what was starting to get a bit darker in garage. That came along and it was like, “Wow.” It’s a pretty cool tune. I really liked it. Everyone called it 8-bar because it just changed every eight bars. That even became a little genre for about six months, then it turned into grime when it got a little bit more like, “You can’t have every tune that changes every 8 bars.” Every tune sort of thing of what’s going on. Nick Dwyer One thing that we all first notice when we look at you, you’re not an old fellow at all, are you? You’re a wee man. You’re 22 years old. Plastician That’s right. Nick Dwyer Funnily enough, with that scene, you’re pretty old. Plastician Yeah, it’s a young, young scene. Nick Dwyer Tell us how young. You were playing me a tune before that you’re about to sign from someone who’s 14 years old? Plastician Yeah, that’s a kid, from Milton Keynes in England. It’s a whole young crew of kids. There’s even now... Nick Dwyer Dave’s old stomping ground. Plastician Yeah man. Milton Keynes in there. We have the grime crews like Roll Deep and N.A.S.T.Y Crew, Boyz in da Hood and all that. Now it’s got to the point that there’s these kids coming through, and they’ve got like, a b-team, the younger kids, the youth team, they call them “Younger Nasty” and “Roll Deep Youngers” and the “Wile Out Ones.” Kids are 12, 13 years old getting on the mic, MCing, going pirate radio, DJing. The first ones to do it, funny enough, was So Solid Crew. One of the DJ’s younger brothers, Skipping Frost, and they were eight years old, they used to go on Delight when So Solid were on pirate radio. Eight years old. Bout 12 now, quite good DJs, but 12 years old. They’re playing grime, there’s loads of kids, man. There’s station called Raw Blaze and I know about half the people on there are under 16. Have to take bunk school to go and do a set, texting all their mates in school like, “Listen to me on the radio,” sneaking out lessons on their mobile phones. It’s such a young scene. It’s good though. If you’ve got youth, it’s got longevity. There’s a big future for it. Nick Dwyer The one thing you touched on before, it’s a pretty funny thing. You’ve got old school guys on the Dream Team and all these boys, who they were there when speed garage broke, and they got the Radio 1 shows, MC Creed, and they were living the life, getting all the column inches in all the magazines. They’re feeling like stars and all of a sudden it feels like they felt their whole scene was robbed by a whole bunch of 14 and 15 year olds. Plastician Yeah, it was like we were saying the other day. Nick Dwyer Tell us about this committee thing. Plastician They got together. When stuff like this started to come about in the garage thing, a lot of the old guys got together, and they were like, “We can’t let...” The Dream Team, Creed, and a few other guys got together, it was like, “We can’t have this music. This is ruining our scene, our beautiful scene.” They got together and actually had a meeting and set up what they called the UK garage committee. Actually started saying, “We refuse to play this on our radio show on Radio 1.” The DJs who were playing legal radio, “We’re not going to support this. This is rubbish. This isn’t us at all.” Lo and behold, a few months later, they lost their shows, nobody wants to listen to what they’re playing anymore because people were waiting so long for garage. It came, finally. A lot of people liked it. Everyone who didn’t like it, just moved onto something else like R&B or funky house and really, the only people left in garage now are like the DJs. There’s no sort of punters who would just go check it out, like they’ll still go out raving to it, the few people that go out raving. There’s a scene of DJs. It’s really close-knit now. This UK garage committee totally flopped, man. They used to make a living out of DJ garage... Nick Dwyer One of the beauties it seems with the whole grime scene is you’ve got all these young kids who, it seems, FruityLoops is a program. You’re dealing with a whole lot of people that maybe they come from the projects, the ends, they don’t have a lot of money, they can go and get a cracked version of FruityLoops and then be making beats. Plastician Yeah. That was it. When this track came along, it was like kids just hearing it, and they were just like, “I can do that.” They all downloaded FruityLoops or Music Generator on the PlayStation and stuff like that. It was just whatever you could get ahold of, young kids would get in it and they were having a go doing beats like that basically. There was a good six months of a whole genre of stuff like that. Half of the scene was getting annoyed with it and half the scene was trying to get involved with it. Then it was like a cleansing period I think, anyone who was trying, most of the people who were [inaudible] out of it then are still here today doing tracks but on a more advanced sounds. Perhaps not in terms of equipment they’re using, they’re still using the same equipment, but they’re using it more properly, and they’re using it better and getting better sound out of it. Nick Dwyer For you, when you started FruityLoops, and still to this day FruityLoops. Nick Dwyer Yeah. I’ve used Cubase and Reason at college, I’m currently at college studying a music technology diploma. I went to college when I started, I’d had about seven releases, I just thought, “It’s going really well and I’d like to try and make a career out of it.” I thought, “I want to go to college and actually learn something musical and get a bit of a paper, that says you can actually do some music.” So yeah, I’m at my college now. Nick Dwyer Something to show your mum. Plastician Yeah, keep her happy, keep her quiet. Nick Dwyer We’ve got another track, a remix I’m sure a lot of people in this room are familiar with, Alter Ego, and a track called “Rocker,” it originally on Clang, part of the Playhouse family, and it’s kind of a crossover. They just got signed to Skint. You’ve done a remix... Nick Dwyer Yeah, I’m going to try and find that for you actually, it’s sitting here somewhere. It’s a guy called Andy, he got in contact with John at Big Apple Records in Croydon and he was just really interested in what I was doing and got in contact with me and said, “Do you want to have a go at doing a remix for us?” Of course I didn’t turn it down, I thought Skint’s a really well-respected label worldwide. It’s good to know that these people are starting to find out what you’re doing, you know what I mean? It’s really good when you hear that these people are... It just goes to show how quickly it’s all spreading, sort of thing, at the moment. Let’s see, it’s right here. This is the track here. This is a remix I’ve done for Alter Ego. (music: Alter Ego – “Rocker (Plasticman Remix)” / applause) Nick Dwyer Is grime, is it kind of some set beat pattern that it follows? Plastician No, not at all. As long as you got energy and a nice fat, the bass is normally quite fat and warm as compared with some other genres of electronic dance music. It’s just like quite a fat sound. Some of the stuff that are made for MCs sounds a bit more hip-hop oriented. With string patterns and stuff like that. There’s loads of different sounds going off in grime. It’s all sort of based around 140 BPM though. So there’s no strict beat patterns as long as it’s moving, basically. Nick Dwyer You hooked up with Rephlex? You got signed to Rephlex. Plastician Yeah. Nick Dwyer How did that come about, man? That’s a pretty cool thing. Plastician Yeah, the track that I played at the beginning came out at and then, a few of the like, electronica shops in London picked up on it, they were like, “This is quite interesting. I might be able to shift some of these.” And Grant [Wilson-Claridge], who helps run the label with Richard D. James, picked the record up and he really liked it. And he came in and I played a gig in London at a night called FWD>>, which kind of is a night that supports the kind of music that we’re playing. It’s like a whole night of it, Plastic People in London. And Grant came down and checked it out and I played this set and he really enjoyed it. And he got in contact with the guy who put the night on to get some beats off of me. And yeah he was really into it and he picked four tracks he really liked, picked another couple of artists and he did the same with them. We all had about four tracks each on this triple-pack LP. Nick Dwyer Which was called... Plastician It was called Grime. Nick Dwyer And Grime Two is coming soon, I believe. Plastician That’s right. Grime Two is due for a release next month, I believe. And that’s technically, it’s not grime. Nick Dwyer Right. Plastician Technically it’s another genre called dubstep. Which is like, garage just... you know what I mean? The continuum never ends. And that’s it. Nick Dwyer Now I mean, you’ve dropped the name so we better give an example. Dubstep’s another name that’s been kind of creeping into the sub conscious recently. People like Horsepower Productions and all that. Define dubstep and can you give us a bit of an example as well? Plastician Well, I’ve just picked this one up. Big Apple Records, actually own a label and a lot of the stuff they put out is dubstep. There’s a few guys like Horsepower Productions. Label called Tempa, I don’t know if anyone’s heard of it. It takes influences from old dub reggae but it sort of like fuses it with 2-step beats and stuff like that. Some of it’s quite like, quite ethnic, like bongos and stuff like that, there’s loads of different examples. Nick Dwyer And so you as a grime DJ, per se... I mean you play a lot of dubstep. Plastician I drop the ol’ bit of dubstep but to be honest with you there’s a deep. Hatcha is probably like the dubstep DJ and another guy called Youngsta at Rinse FM. Them guys properly are pure dubstep. So I leave them to play all of the big tracks and that, I just try to pick out a couple that I like and I drop them. This is a track which came out on Big Apple Recordings via Skream. Get to the end of that track. This is a track called “Skunk Step” by Skream, which is pretty dubstep. (music: Skream - “Skunk Step”) So that’s dubstep which is kind of like similar, fits in nicely with what we’re playing in the whole grime thing but it’s technically, you know what I mean? If you want to get deep, it’s not really anything like it at the same time. And another artist called Kode9 who is pure dub, like some of his tracks don’t even have beats and stuff like that, it’s pretty deep. He plays at FWD>> and stuff like that. It all just kind of, it all just sort of merges in somehow. People are just picking up on whatever they can, sort of thing, saying “whatever.” Nick Dwyer Now this is what I thought you were talking about. Historically any kind of new music that emerges has its epicenter, be it Paradise Garage and the Warehouse or breakbeat hardcore had Rage at Heaven, jungle had AWOL, broken beat’s got Co-Op. Is FWD>> kind of like the epicenter of grime? Plastician FWD>> is weird, it’s hard because a lot of people in England even are getting confused. They’re calling like, the more technical grime, they’re calling it FWD>> beats and people are getting confused. Because FWD>> is more of music-based night, whereas like more of the grime nights are for like, more MC-based stuff and like lyrical clashes and stuff like that. FWD>>‘s more like a night to do more with the music, so it’s like, you can come and play the same tracks that they’re playing at these MC nights, or Eskimo dance and stuff like that but at FWD>> it’s more to do with the music. So it’s like, you can drop the same tracks, it doesn’t matter, but more people are there to listen to the beats than dance to it. Nick Dwyer Yeah. Now when you’re talking about the whole clashing thing, I mean that’s something that especially with grime, has kind of risen up and shooting along at the same speed, is this whole warring thing. I don’t know, it kind of just seems really self-defeating. Plastician It’s mad, yeah. Nick Dwyer What’s the whole deal with the warring thing that’s like, “I’m gonna clash you.” Plastician Yeah, it’s really mad. There’s like DVDs coming out now of like, studio time fights on the mic and stuff like that. But it’s mainly staged like, the MCs sort of sort out between themselves, like, “Right, me and you are going to get up on the mics, start cussing each other’s mums and that, get off the mic and then shake hands” sort of thing. But on the DVD, it’s like they’re all in their face, telling them they’re going to beat them up and that. And it’s mad. It’s like the MC. I don’t know it’s really weird. It’s kind of like hip-hop but a bit more aggressive and a bit more blatent. Nick Dwyer The problem is a lot of people don’t, a lot of young people watching that, looking up to these guys as kind of somewhat idols. They don’t realize that it’s all for show and a lot of people take it seriously, yeah? Plastician Yeah, I’m sure the kids definitely. A lot of the kids don’t know that it’s fake. It’s like watching wrestling, when the kids are young they think that wrestling is real and they find out. It’s like, grime is the same. It started this whole MC culture, the MCs go and they like stage a show, like, “We’re gonna go and get everyone excited by starting telling everyone that like, ‘your mum slept with him’ or something like that.” It’s mad, but... Nick Dwyer The other thing you were talking about as well that’s kind of mad is, you know, at any kind of musical event, a big tune is a big tune purely on the fact that it sounds good. It’s got a wicked bass on or whatever. But you might have you a tune that’s a pretty average tune but it might be big at one of these, let’s say, lyrical nights, because someone checks a certain lyric or something. Plastician My first ever release was signed purely on the basis that an MC got on the mic on one of DJ Slimzee’s sets on Rinse FM years ago. Nick Dwyer Who’s Slimzee? Plastician Slimzee is, at the time, he still is like the biggest DJ in the darker side of garage and grime. And he was the one who sort of brought grime through the more commercial garage nights, he would get booked and he’d play like a set full of dubplates. And yeah, I gave him a track and this is before I had anything released and he cut it onto a dubplate and he asked if he could have it exclusive and I said, “Yeah, you can keep it for a while.” Then he had an MC called Riko on his set and Riko got on the mic just as the tune started coming in and he starts cussing this guy from another crew called More Fire Crew and this was quite early in the whole clashing thing. It was quite unusual to hear it on the radio. So when you hear something like that, there was such an excitement and there was big talk about ... On the internet loads of kids going on, “Who heard this? Who heard what he said about Nico from More Fire Crew?” It happened to be my track and the kids were like, “What was that tune that was playing when he was spitting. That was a big tune.” Nick Dwyer So purely on the fact that he was dissing someone else? Plastician Certainly, if he’d have gone home and then like, the kids had all sort of, turned their radio off, I probably would have never got the track signed in the first place. It’s mad. Nick Dwyer Now another thing you’re talking about with dubplate culture, obviously, especially, very much a UK thing with jungle and with garage. You know, DJs were playing pure plates. And if you were a DJ that was carrying weight you had to be drawing pure dubs. I mean with the advent of these things, how’s dubplate culture been affected? Plastician In grime, not so much, because it’s such a young scene. I was saying, there’s not many DJs who can use them. It’s such a funny, such a young scene, and the young kids nowadays are just like, lazy. See this? [touches turntable] They like that. And then see that [points to CDJ] and they’re like, “What? It doesn’t move around,” so they’re just like, confused, “I’m not touching that, I’m going to stick to this.” So they’re spending all their pocket money saving up for like 30 pounds for a dubplate and they’re cutting, like, on a 10” rec dubplate which is supposed to hold like one track per side. They’re like, cutting three tunes of about one minute long on each side, it’s like, “Come on.” The quality’s like, rubbish and they’re going home well happy, they’ve got a bag full of dubs but like each one’s about a minute long and they’re all really poor quality. Nick Dwyer I mean, for yourself, are you playing much dubplates, 50-50 kinda? Plastician Yeah, I don’t really cut much anymore but I cut occasionally. It depends. If I’ve got a track that I know might never come out and I want to play it in the club. There’s actually a new cutting studio in Bristol in England that cuts dubs onto PVC. It’s like no metal at all and they weigh less than a record. I’ve got one here. Nick Dwyer And you don’t have to pay 35 quid for a... Plastician It cost about 35 pounds. It’s like plastic. It’s not got an acetate inside it. OK, no more dubplate. Nick Dwyer You miss out on that dubplate smell, though. Plastician Yeah, but it still smells nice. It’s like, have a smell of it. Nick Dwyer Everyone can have a go later on. We’ll pass it around. Plastician Pass it around. Don’t scratch it, though; it’s quite a good track. Nick Dwyer Should we get in another track quickly, and then I think you’re going to give us a little bit of FruityLoops session? Plastician Yeah, I get this Wiley track on, to show you the MCing side of the grime thing. Nick Dwyer Also, you’ve just done a remix for High Contrast, drum & bass producer. Plastician Yeah, I’ve just finihed it now. The version I’ve got is the uncomplete finsih but we’ve got enough of it to show a good... Let’s get this track on here. This is Wiley. He’s just been signed to XL, and this is a track called “Take Chances,” I believe. (music: Wiley – “Take Chances” / applause) Nick Dwyer It’ll take me a few days to figure out the lyrics. Plastician The whole tune is war, pure war. Like, don’t come step to me with your attitude, because you’ll get beaten up basically. Nick Dwyer It’s part of the success of the insular grime, and even prior before that with the UK garage thing. As soon as you add an MC to the mix,. with the comparisons with hip-hop, blah blah blah. The first time where UK, and especially the youth, they felt like this is our own music. Plastician We were having a chat back home about it not long ago. A lot of UK acts who are doing stuff like this are making the mistake of then putting an album together and putting hip-hop on it. I think the reason Dizzee has done so well is because he’s come with something that nobody’s heard before. People all over the world are like, “This is amazing. What is this stuff?” There’s so much of it that people wouldn’t even believe. If you came to London and went in a record shop, and saw the amount of different kinds of grime there are and different MCs and how many artists are involved, it’s just mad. Nick Dwyer Is white label culture rife? People just purely press up, say 250 whites. Plastician It’s getting better. This is a release that came out recently. This is a pure grime release, as well. It was a big track, a big rhythm for the MCs and stuff like that. It’s got a full artwork sleeve. For me, that is one of the first ever grime tracks to have a full color sleeve. It’s just mad. They’ve even gone to the extent of getting labels done. Nick Dwyer What you were saying before with someone like Dizzy who has kind of taken it to the world. With anyone in UK garage, all your Dream Teams and all that, sure, they were the biggest thing in the UK, but no one knew. They never played outside the UK. With grime, you’re starting to play outside England. Plastician Last weekend I played Brussels and to two thousand people at a big even there called the White Night, which is an all-night event that goes on all over the city. They have different nights. I played Amsterdam a few weeks before that, and Austria the week before that. Nick Dwyer You toured the States with Todd. Plastician Toured the States with Todd, yeah. He was here the other day. Yes, I think the Rephlex thing has totally open doors, as well, for me personally. Dizzy’s sort of paved the way for the rest of us to follow in his footsteps. Nick Dwyer I’ve got to ask, with the name, have you had any angry techno fans on your door? Plastician It’s quite funny, actually. Nick Dwyer No call from Richie Hawtin? Plastician No, funny enough, no. Apparently he doesn’t know about me, but nothing’s been done. John Peel, he’s got a show on Radio 1 in the UK. Plays quite a lot of my stuff, he’s a big supporter of what I’m doing. Every time he plays one of my tracks, he always says, “Plasticman, with a ‘C.’“ Now, when I meet someone, they’ll be like, “Oh, you’re Plasticman with a ‘C,’“ like it’s part of my name or something. Nothing really has come back. If anything, people have been like, “Yeah, I think that’s cool that you did that,” sort of thing. It’s the whole grime law, “We don’t give a shit what you’re doing. This is our thing.” It’s the whole grime attitude. It’s almost like I did it on purpose, but I didn’t. I honestly hadn’t heard of Richie Hawtin when I started, and I think I’d had about three release before I’d even heard of him. Then I had a second other release before I heard any of his tracks. Nick Dwyer Something you said, within the whole grime scene, like a lot of other musical genres, people are taking influence from here, there and everywhere. Grime producers, they’re just feeling grime. Plastician We’ve pure got the blinkers on, man. We don’t have a clue what is going on in the world outside what we’re doing. It’s why it sounds a bit weird compared to most stuff that’s going on, because most of the stuff is like, I might hear that track, and think, “I like that track. I want to do one similar to that.” I don’t sit there and listen to techno and that and think, “I’m going to use those mad sounds in a grime tune.” Like, the whole Rephlex thing, and getting this remix work from labels like Skint and Low Recordings, and the tunes that they’ve given me to remix, I’m sort of sitting there thinking, “These tracks are actually quite interesting. It’s something I can bring into my sound.” It’s good. The way that more people are getting involved with it is just bringing my music forward, as well. It’s really cool. Nick Dwyer Should we go into one more track before we go into that? Plastician Yes. This is, it should be anyway, the remix that I’m currently working on for High Contrast. It’s just finished now, but this is a unfinished version you’re going to hear. (music: High Contrast ft. Nolay – “Angels & Fly (Plasticman/Plastician Remix)” / applause) Nick Dwyer Interesting with the vocals this time. Plastician To be honest with you, I had tried once before with an a cappella of a guy, who I know that MC’d. It’s like for me, at the moment, it’s still what I’m actually learning, as well, to record and master vocals myself. I don’t have the equipment at home to do it, so I’m purely just doing it at college to get a feel for it. If someone can give me a decent a cappella, which has already been mastered with ad libs and stuff, I can run away with it. That track there was originally 174 BPM, I had to time stretch the vocals down to 143, I think I produced that track at. It was a long process, but it was quite enjoyable, getting involved with doing vocals and then running them into FruityLoops, and time-stretching them and cutting them into little bits so they fit, because FruityLoops doesn’t... It’s not like Cubase, you can’t just drag it and time-stretch it. You actually have to cut it to pieces and start putting it here, there, and everywhere on the drum machine. Nick Dwyer With your setup at home, what are you running? Obviously, as you say, you’ve been using FruityLoops, but what about the sampling? Plastician Sampling, I just use Cool Edit, or Soundforge. I just download samples off the Internet. I just search hard for them. I might hear a track on the radio and think, “That’s clean. I’m going to go buy a CD, cut some of it, distort it out a bit.” You can get samples from everywhere. Sample CDs, even. I’ll buy samples and get them off of friends and stuff. It’s like building up a good library. If you’re going to use FruityLoops, it’s really important that you get a good library of samples. Because the stuff they give you when you’re first there, unless you’re amazing with synths and stuff like that on software, you’re going to find it difficult to come out with a nice sound. The drum kits in that are pretty old school. Like the 808 kit is about all you get and a few samples on top of that. Nick Dwyer What about plug-ins, you’re mad on plug-ins? Plastician Yeah, to be honest, that’s something that I’ve only recently come into play. I was purely samples. Every track was just like, WAVs. I was just using WAV basslines, WAV drum kits, WAV instrument hits, and messing about with them and playing them in different keys and putting them through effects units enough to make them sound like something else. Since going to college like last year, starting last year at college, I’ve sort of liked learned how to use VSTs and sort of like gotten loads of them using just whatever I could get my hands on. I would just have a go at it. I’m starting to pick things up now so the whole thing is like, I don’t know, like a learning curve. There’s definitely people in here who’ve got much a wider knowledge of software, bass synths. I have never used a hardware synth in my life. Nick Dwyer Right. Plastician Ever. I like the TS-404 and the old version is really like manageable, you can just turn it into all sorts of sounds. Nick Dwyer Does anyone in this room use Fruity Loops or has used it? Plastician It’s more or less a drum machine. You know what I mean? But you can put all sorts of things and you can get some good stuff out of it. I mean I have just been messing about with a loop, getting a loop together and let’s just mute a few of these channels. Yeah just to show like just load... [shows FruityLoops on computer screen and demonstrates music] See, that’s like a four-bar tune as opposed to an eight-bar, sort of. But that was like how our eight bar tracks were being made, basically. Someone was coming with like two eight bar loops and just pasting it through the entire track, and that’s kind of what kick started the whole grime thing, really. Just going to play this Wiley track actually, to sort of emphasize what I was saying about the whole square bass thing and the slide. This was Wiley’s first sort of instrumental release, with this kind of sound. This is what he calls “Eski beat,” which is kind of like his version of grime. It’s technically grime, but he just wanted to name it. This was a massive track. This sold about, I don’t know – it still sells today. (music: Wiley – “Eskimo”) So that was like Wiley’s take on grime, and that whole square bass sound was like the biggest track at the time. It was quite soon after “Pulse X.” It wasn’t long after the first. Well it was one of the first few grime tracks to come about and that was big. He started his own version of grime, what he called Eski beat, I’ve got a track here, which is a new one for him, just to show people do still make eight-bar tracks, even now. This is a track by Wiley. (music: Wiley – “New Era”) That’s eight bars all the way through, it just keeps changing. Wiley’s quite clever, like we was saying about them, how a track can get big from like a MC saying certain lyrics over the top of it. Wiley always makes the tunes, and like, that track, I don’t know if you’ve heard of that track “Wot Do You Call It?,” it was in the charts. That tune got big because he staged a clash, and made the tune, and he made all the MCs involved in this great clash, like, “Do a version of it.” Every time you heard a clash on the radio it was over his tune. All the kids were like, “Oh, that tune,” and they’re always killing each other over them. Yeah, it got massive, and this is the same. This track here, he made originally for the More Fire Youngers, the kids of More Fire Crew. It got quite big, and then he went on to 1Xtra on the UK Garage Weekend and brought a Wiley showcase. He brought loads of MCs from east London down, and basically made this tune, and made everyone just gun each other on the mic. It’s just quite a big tune now. There’s like a massive sort of bootleg culture in the whole grime scene, where, at the moment, there’s a thing on the internet called DC++ where you can put files on, and download them, and that kids are getting older tunes like this on CD. This is unreleased, at the moment. They’re getting a hold of these on CD, like burning them as MP3s onto their computer, and then they’re putting them up on DC++. It happened to me with this track that’s only just come out. I heard a remix of this track before I’d even released it like, because kids were downloading it, and cut up, bootleg versions of it. Nick Dwyer Is that worrying you as a label head, just like... Plastician Yeah. Nick Dwyer Kind of seems like it’s rife throughout the grime scene. Plastician Yeah. People, this is the whole dubplate culture, like people want an exclusive version of a track. If they can’t get it, they sit at home, cut it up, and make one. They don’t care what the producer thinks. I’ve heard bootlegs of my tracks all over the place. People even have to cheat to send me one. I’ll be on MSN messenger and a little kid will come up like, “What’s up blood? Here’s this tune, have a listen of it,” and it’s like, got all my samples, all over it. I’m like, “Mate, are you joking? What’s going on there? Are you going to release this?” And he’s like, “Nah blood, it’s just a dubplate.” But then I find out someone else has got it, going, “Yeah, I cut that tune that kid sent me,” and there’s like a million people playing this bootleg version of my tune that I haven’t authorized. Nick Dwyer For you, what’s coming up next? You’ve got like your own label. Plastician Yeah, I got releases in my label. I got about six releases lined up on the label over the next, trying to get one out each month. Nick Dwyer And the label is called... Plastician It’s called Terrorhythm, just like an independent label. I’m sorta signing these purely grime stuff. Just all sorts, like I put out a release with Mark One and myself called “Fight” and then, this one is a three-track EP by me, I have a track on it called “Cha” which was quite big, and here, the next one is another one from me and after that I’ve got that track by the young kids from Milton, and I’ve got a remix of one of my tracks that was on the grime album done by a crew from Bedford called Macabre Unit. Bookings are really taking off at the moment as well. With the whole grime thing, internationally they are starting to come in now as well. Nick Dwyer Are any DJs outside of the grime scene, like say for example in America, who play more eclectic mixes, are you finding out that they’re playing grime? Plastician Yeah. Nick Dwyer Are you finding producers popping up, you were saying before there’s some guys in Australia that have sent you tunes. Plastician Yeah, people are just starting to, starting to take off now. I played a night in London called Rebel Bass, which was at Electro Works in London. It was a good night. I went there a couple of weeks later, there was another night, same night, but they have more electro DJs on. I went there, and I was walking around, and there was electro DJs in room two playing like “Cha” and stuff, and I was like, “No way.” The guy, he was here from DJ Magazine in the week like, he’s a producer on a label called Low, which is an electronic label. He knew my stuff, and he knew who I was when he got here, so yeah, people in other genres are starting to stand up and take note. Which is the difference between grime and the whole UK garage thing. They didn’t really want to know. Nick Dwyer Chris, thank you very much! Plastician Thank you!

Title: Michael Reinboth

Michael Reinboth
Michael Reinboth established Compost Records in 1993 after bumping into fellow music enthusiast Rainer Trüby at his club night Into Somethin’ in Munich, Germany. What started off as a launch pad for friends’ music grew to become one of the most prominent dance music platforms in Germany, proving that a true sense of funk can be found the world over. Linking the global jazz massive wasn’t exactly a piece of cake, however, as we found out during the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy in Cape Town. Michael Reinboth had to learn the record trade by himself, from scratch. That’s why he advocates making independent record labels a family affair.
Hosted by Heinz Reich There was a certain moment in history when this guy was suddenly to be seen in each and every magazine in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. He was declared “minister of entertainment” for a big international cigarette company. How did that happen to you, Michael? Michael Reinboth [laughs] Ah, you start with the shit story! The background of this was similar to the Red Bull thing. This cigarette company was looking for so called ministers: for music and nightlife, which was me, and for fashion, art, science, etc. We started to organize similar events like here in 1988 or something. These events were advertised and sponsored by a cigarette company. We did lectures, we did parties. As minister for music and nightlife, my job was to invest money to sponsor cool parties. The guys in the industry didn’t have a clue of what should be supported or not. So they developed this concept of the ministers. In a way, this was a good thing. On the other hand, it was just advertisement for the cigarette company. Heinz Reich Nowadays, Michael Reinboth stands for the label Compost Records. We would really love to hear some anecdotes of your life. You are 44 years old. Yesterday you told me that you started DJing in a time when DJing was not about packing your record bag and going to a club. How was it back then? Michael Reinboth My first DJ gig was in 1980. Back then, the discotheques had records of their own. Friends of mine, like [DJ] Westbam have exactly the same background. You went to the discotheque and picked up the stuff that was already there. When you start to work as a DJ in a club like this, you don’t have a clue what the collection has to offer. You are suddenly faced with several thousands of records. I wasn’t really happy with this situation so I was the first DJ who brought his own records. They were packed in a plastic box which I had to carry several kilometers. The problem was I didn’t have that many records at home. Therefore I tried to get a job as a music journalist since I wanted to get promo copies from the record companies. Many people in the music industry started with writing about music, as this is a pretty good way to get promos, to get known. So I took my plastic box with records and walked three kilometers with this box to the discotheque and played my own stuff. Heinz Reich Let’s talk about the social status of a DJ at that time. Being a DJ, you sometimes earned less money and surely got less respect than the waiters. Michael Reinboth I played for drinks, I didn’t get money in the first place. The only good thing was that I could buy records for the discotheque. The boss gave me some money and I went to all the shops and bought the records I liked. One day, we had the Oktoberfest in Munich, somebody from the Kashoggi[[ family approached the DJ booth and said, “The music you’re playing is great. We need these records you have here for our discotheque in Dubai.” I played soul, funk and the electro, hip-hop stuff of these days. The good thing was, that I had a list of all the records. I had to keep this list for the bookkeeping of the discotheque. With this book I went to a record store and bought all the stuff on the list. Then I sent all the records to Dubai. They paid me huge amounts of money for that. These were the first big earnings of my DJ career. Another income was selling cassettes, which I recorded when DJing. Heinz Reich And still he is very humble and modest. He told me that he doesn’t consider himself as being a DJ. He says, “What I do is not really mixing records. I’m more a selector.” It seems that many of the people of your generation have this approach to music still. Michael Reinboth Yes, that’s true. This is also a part of Compost’s philosophy. I try to pick up or select interesting records, quality stuff, rather than doing the technical things. I have been DJing for 23 years now, but I have never really dealt with technique. I’m a really bad mixer. My strength is my wide range of music styles, my knowledge about records. So maybe you don't want to call me a DJ, hopefully selector. Much like a Jamaican soundsystem selector. Heinz Reich You’re not only a selector. You are also an incredible collector of records. How many vinyls do you own? Michael Reinboth Oh my god, I’ve never counted them. Roughly 60,000 or 70,000. That’s not too surprising when you have been collecting records for more than 20 years. And I get sent many promos, of course. And the shit ones I don't keep. If I’d kept them, it would be probably double. Heinz Reich After your career as a journalist you became mainly a DJ. Who were the most interesting people you met as a DJ? Michael Reinboth During the ’80s I did various parties in Munich, like Soulful Shack and the Into Somethin’ club night. Into Somethin’ has been running for 12 years now. We invited people like Gilles Peterson or Seiji, sitting over there, Joe Claussell or Kyoto Jazz Massive. At these parties, I also met a lot of people who’ve been producing music. There I became friends with many of the original Compost artists – Rainer Trüby, Fauna Flash or Beanfield. So all this happened within these club nights. Heinz Reich The meaning of the word “compost” stands for a place where you throw away those parts of your waste that can be re-inserted into the circle of nature. Why did you choose Compost as the name for your record label? Michael Reinboth My first premise was to find a name, which has not been used already by another band or label. I thought that I had found such a word with compost. But some years later I should learn that there was already a fusion funk band from the '70s called Compost. But I didn’t know them back then. I liked the syllables of the word compost – com and post. Com as in dot-com, very modern. Post means to send something, moreover you can read the syllable post like in post-structuralism or post-modern. I considered these elements modern. And from a friend I heard, that there’s an American witch circles, positive witches, they were calling themselves Compost. It comes from the Middle Ages; people feared that a compost heap might explode because of the chemical interactions inside. I thought, “Wow, that’s a good name for a label that is blending the ingredients of jazz, soul, electro and techno, using samples. If these ingredients interacted in a way that they might explode, it would be magic.” Heinz Reich Which records on Compost were the most successful ones in commercial terms? Michael Reinboth At the beginning, this was the Future Sound of Jazz compilation series. Rainer Trüby’s Brazil compilation Glücklich, Brazil fusion music was also very successful. These compilations brought us a bit more money in that we could invest in other projects. The biggest success came years later with Jazzanova. Trüby Trio did also very well. The success of Jazzanova made it possible to sign new acts like Koop from Sweden, who proved to be another highlight in our label history. And they’re still selling in good quantities even in these hard times. Today, we have a catalog of more than 160 releases and 20 artists. Heinz Reich How is a record label to be started and run? Michael Reinboth The first step is to find a name for your label, of course. You should search the internet in order to find out if a domain is still free. If you should run into a label from the ’70s with the same name, you better stay away from that. They might approach you after 30 years and claim that this label name is theirs. The registration of your label name will cost you roughly 500 Euro in Germany. If you want to register the name for the whole of Europe, it will cost you in between 5,000 and 10,000 Euro. This registration will be valid for ten years. You can choose various categories for your registration. It’s wise to register your label name for merchandise as well. Telecommunication and media consulting are other categories. The next step will be to find a distributor for your label. This might sound silly, but it’s true. It happened that friends proudly showed me the test pressings of their first record. I said, “Sounds great, so what is your plan?” They asked me to help them because they couldn’t find a distributor. The music industry is currently in a recession, so it’s very hard to get a distribution deal. But it is very important to talk to a distributor before you start anything else. Present your demo and the idea of your label and see if there’s a strong interest from the distributor’s side. If that’s the case, you can start negotiating a contract and eventually sign it. Don’t press the quantity of records you or the artists have in mind. This figure should be defined by the distributor. Talk to your distributor and find out how many records they can sell. Your distributor will pre-sell your record to the shops and chains in their domestic country and to their partner distributors in foreign territories. No distributor is able to collect orders directly from retailers in foreign countries. Audience Member Imagine this scenario: You have good tracks and talented artists whose names are not known at all. You believe in these tracks, as the response is excellent. But there is no distribution. Michael Reinboth My advice is to send out maybe 20 CD-Rs to the distribution networks you know of. You can get names and addresses of distributors easily at events like Midem, where you get a guide listing most distribution companies from all over the world, or you talk to people running a label. They can name you the distributors they work with. Send out your CDs with a letter and do not forget to mention the name of your label. If you tell somebody that you are planning to start a label, but don’t have a name for it yet, they will not take you seriously. Selling records without having a distributor is a very hard business. You have to sell your records directly to the shops. And then you will have the problem that you won’t get your money immediately. The shops will take your records only on consignment. This means that you have to wait for your money until all these shops have sold the stock. Distributors work the same way, but the whole process will be easier for you. Until circa 1998, it was possible to press a quantity of records or white labels, sell these to some shops or distributors. But in the last few years the situation has changed dramatically. The distributors have stock problems and are clearing their warehouses. Nowadays, they will not buy your records anymore, not even a hundred copies. There are still some small labels left handling their business this way. But in most cases this does not work anymore. The other thing that really helps a lot is getting quotes and reactions from these people really helps a lot. If you can offer quotes from well-known DJs, DJ Hell or Gilles Peterson or Joe Claussell or Mad Mike [Banks]. If you have these connections it will help very much. It will be easier to convince the music business people. These quotes work like recommendations. It’s all about good contacts. When you are unknown, it’s incredibly hard. Audience Member A few years ago, maybe 10 years ago or something, it was popular for people to make their own white labels, like 500 copies and shop them around to a record store. Do you think that that's still a relevant test or beginning to start a label? That would be a first step just so you learn about record pressing or demand? Michael Reinboth Until 1998 or something, it was possible to press copies, maybe even 5,000 copies. But that’s changed dramatically in the last few years. At Compost, we get demos or mp3 files each and every day. For us, it’s impossible to listen to all of them. Always bear in mind: Ten thousands of tracks are made per day worldwide. So you have to be creative and find ideas how to present yourself. The best way will always be to approach people you already know. At least you should think carefully about the question: Which people may like your music? Audience Member What is better? Trying to license your music to an already established record label or releasing your tracks on a label of your own? Michael Reinboth This option is always to be taken into consideration. Try to go both ways. When we started Compost, we sold a few records on vinyl. At the same time we tried to get compilation deals. We asked record companies to help us out as we needed a little bit more exposure. With an interesting song, you will find a licensing partner. One thing that people also wonder about is if you are allowed to do a cover version of a song without asking for permission. Yes, you can cover any song. You don't have to ask anybody. But you are not allowed to change the lyrics.

Mixologists
For Beni G it all began with acid house. Before the turntablist bug bit him bad, that is. Coming up, he kept his ears open to new music. And if there’s one thing about London, it’s that there’s always the flux and flutter of new sounds. Reggae, rock, broken beat and 2-step all curried favour, finding their way into the mix. On hip-hop radio show The Boombox, Beni met his match in DJ Go. The rest, as they say, is history. From DMC and ITF titles, to spots in drum & bass clubs, the Mixologists keep things versatile as they explain during this lecture from the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy.
Transcript: BENI G I am Beni G. He is…. GO I am Go. BENI G As you know, we are the Mixologists. Today, we give you a little flavor of what we do, like a little bit of what we do in the clubs. Well, sort of what we're doing in the competitions, in the DMC. GO Stuff that we have done a couple of years ago. BENI G Yeah, like some of our favorite routines we’ve been doing not just in DMC but at showcases that we really like. Just what we do on the turntables. Kind of a general, kind of anything, really. Excuse my color, I fell asleep in the sun yesterday, so I am not embarrassed talking here, but I am just quite red [laughter]. We are going to start off with… At the moment, what we do when we start off, for the last couple of months… A friend of mine produced a beat. We always have an intro beat that we always come on with when we first start a show, when we scratch over. And at the moment, it is this particular beat and we have done it special where we kind of tailor to each club we are playing to. When we get the chance to get in the studio, we just change the name of where we are playing. So, it is like a special intro for each place we are playing. So, obviously, there is one for Cape Town. So, we are playing it for you. We play off CD because there is no vinyl of it yet. And this is how we start our show normally. It’s like a scratching sort of thing. Just like a question and answer scratch between the two of us. (music: Intro scratch routine / applause) GO That is not how it was meant to be. It jumped a bit. BENI G Yeah, we played something to the wrong beat. But anyway, that’s kind of a little taste of what we do. We do lots of different sounds, just influences of what we have grown up with. Like, drum & bass sounds and hip-hop things and just some weird shit to it, you know, that we like. And we sort of built routines with them. Yeah, that’s kind of, like I said, a sort of team routine, but we would kind of make it a bit more complicated for battle and stuff. GO With battling, the fashion changes a lot. One year, the shit that you are doing can be really dope. Next year, everyone else is on something completely different, and I hear, "That shit’s wack," and all that lot. It is like a process of discovery, really. Like people finding new techniques all the time. And the technique that is hot that everyone is kind of, "Yeah, that is really good and stuff." BENI G Yeah, and what we tend to do when we are practicing for a battle, we practice and if it sounded good to us we were like, "Fuck it, we are going to do it anyway." You know? Because being in London, there are so many sorts of music that we are influenced by and listen to -- not just hip-hop and not just drum & bass, you know? There’d be dancehall, reggae, we like garage or 2-step or some broken beat or… GO ... broken beat is the lick, innit? BENI G Yeah, it’s so much different music, like some rock stuff or some guitar shit and we just put it in the routines too. But yeah, as long as you are on your own sort of tip, you know. You do your own sort of flavor, then that is what really matters. The worst thing is when DJs step up, and you’ve seen somebody else doing it five times before and technically the DJs might be good. They can pull that off, you know? But it is totally tiresome to hear someone that you know it’s not quite their own sort of thing. I mean, hopefully to a certain extent, we... GO It’s cool to learn techniques and stuff, but a lot of people are just taking the same shit that has been done before. That is kind of weak. BENI G As well as that’s the team stuff, we also have like a single routine each, which is also personal favorites that we like to do. We have routines, solo routines that we really like, and we like to mess about, we just like to show off at shows. So we just show some kind of scratch routine or juggle routine, and this is how it goes... (music: DJ Go scratch/backspin routine / applause) (music: Beni G scratch/backspin routine / applause) So, that’s a little solo routine. Guys that are watching videos and seeing the DMC or go to the DMC… that’s what they do on an individual basis. AUDIENCE MEMBER Is there anything specific that you are better at than each other, or do you basically just split it up equally? GO We kind of know our strengths and weaknesses, you know what I mean? AUDIENCE MEMBER What are they? GO Secret, man! [laughter] BENI G Go is the king weed smoker. GO I used to be. BENI G It just naturally happens these days. If we are doing something, and if one of us can’t quite do it and the other person can, we are like, "Let me try it." And if it works better, the other person will go, "Cool, that is your part." And if it works out that Go could do better at one more thing, I was like, "Cool, that will be your part," and I will come up with something different. So, yeah, we do have our strengths and weaknesses, but it just naturally filters out when we’re doing routines and stuff. GO I am not very natural, but I love it. BENI G: [laughs] Joke! Yeah, anything else before we do something else? Cool! We do a four...? GO What we are into at the moment mixing in the clubs. We’re just going to show you what we do when there are four decks. BENI G What we do when we play with four turntables, we like to do it a little bit different to make sure we do something which is entertaining as well as not just playing records. Like, I play two and then Go plays two. We do that sometimes, but also we like to mess about it a bit when we are both playing together. And what we are just going to do now – it’s not hip-hop. This is a drum & bass sort of thing. Normally, we do it in the mix so it is not quite mixed in, but we did a rough level check. Normally, we would be mixing it with all these sounds. So, we play you sounds that are going to come out and explain to you what we do and what we would do at a show. And we hopefully do it. So, this is the beat that we are going to play so you know what everything is individually, and then you can hear what we will do together. (music: routine samples) So, this is just the track itself, which we mix in. And so on. And then [music stops / laughter] we are just playing the sounds for you to understand what kind of sounds we are using. [Go cuts in the intro of the track and plays a piano riff]. That is one. OK, this is [Beni G plays a distorted rave sound]. This is how it might sound altogether. (music: Mixologists routine / applause) Cool. So, that gets from one track that we are playing to the next track, which was that one that we heard with the crazy bass. We are doing a little of what we like to call teasers. These are tracks in the drum & bass scene that everyone knows, so we dropped little parts of the track that people know – the remix over the top and drop the next track in. And then, because we do it on four turntables, we can move it real quick, so while Go is mixing, I am mixing my tool as well. So, as soon as he is done, I can get in with my teasers or my scratching or my next record really quick. One advice is that we got this go-to-go move between the turntables and records really quick. GO It just gives us an edge over a DJ that is playing on his own. Like, you can’t beat it, when it is four decks and two DJs going on just throwing different ideas into it. It makes it easier and more fun to dance to it, especially if you ‘re pilled. [laughter] BENI G So, yeah, when we do the hip-hop stuff, we do a similar sort of thing. We use the four turntables not just as, say, the whole time mixing a record, mix a record, mix a record. You know, there’s time when it’s nice, when the crowd just want to hear the record play. And we're not doing this the whole time during a two-hour set. It would just drive us pretty wild. The DJs would just let the record play and stuff. So, we kind of get the balance of giving them a little bit of what they want to see as well as this kind of mixing and let the party party. You know, because that is what we want – people to go home and be happy, you know? So, we take what we can do in the battles, and we move that into a club sets. GO I will show you. BENI G Yeah, sure. GO It is really simple stuff. BENI G So, what we do is we just have little things that we really like. People dance to it and like it. So, the Missy Elliot track… (music: Missy Elliott – “Work It”) GO Instead of hearing that... (music: Run DMC - "Peter Piper") BENI G Instead of hearing that, Go does a little something between the turntables, and he will just drop it. So I might take the kick [drum] of a record, I will take any sort of kick, but it will be the record that is currently playing, like a hip-hop tune, and at the right point, we look at each other. I’ll get a kick and we will show you. So, if you just might imagine this. This not a record obviously. This is like a sound. Imagine this is the record playing and will catch the beat [both beatjuggling]. It's just what makes it interesting. It's fun for us as well because sometimes it gets a little … we don’t want to just always mix records, we want to kind of mess around. A lot of stuff … we’ll be in the club, and we got sort of ways we might like to link up between the two turntables, and we are just freestyling when we are playing out, and we do something that works very well, we’ll be like, “Yeah, that was dope.” We try it at the next show. Any questions up until now? Somebody? GO Somebody asks something, man! AUDIENCE MEMBER How do you set everything up? BENI G How do we set everything up? Just the same way you set up when you set up two turntables and a mixer. So, it’s the regular turntables into both line channels – eh, phono channels, and it’s exactly the same on that side [points to Go’s side] and then we normally have two outputs to the P.A. AUDIENCE PARTICIPANT [inaudible] BENI G Not normally, no. We try to get two outs. If there is another mix ... if there is no two outs to the PA, we run it through another mixer in the club. And then the turntables, which we normally run into either lines; so we can go between turntable and CD or vice versa on either side. If we don’t have two CDs, we just swap it. We have been making beats for the last of a couple of years. It is really hard to put all your energies into what we do battling-wise and in the clubs as well as spending loads of time in the studio. So, now the balance is… GO Beni is being real modest here. He’s been making some killer, killer hip-hop beats at the moment. I am really into my drum & bass where I’ve got some guy that’s helping me engineer. And it’s like a step. You use the battling for a name out there, then you play in the clubs. Then the next step is really just to make records. I think that’s the same with just with every battle DJ out there apart from the people who are right on the top like Q-Bert, who just scratches and can live off that. Just like a progression, you know? BENI G Yeah, we do some collaborations with some hip-hop people and some drum & bass producers. You know, get those bubbling. And when it’s right, we don’t want to put something out just for the sake of it. We recently put out a mix album, which is out on DMC. It is a mix compilation with tracks that got licensed. That’s on CD format only, so it’s a DJ mix from us. But our own productions, when it is sort of ready, we want to make that it comes out and people are like, "Yeah, that’s dope!“ Because a lot of people do ask us something if we are putting stuff out and whether we got stuff. Because of that, we want to make sure it’s pretty damn good, you know? But we love it -- being in the studio. Being that side of creating that way is as fun and enjoyable as being creative on the turntables. GO Just trying to find a way that you don’t have to sleep and be up 24 hours and just do what you love all the time. But unfortunately, I have to sleep, you know? BENI G We was going to show you a few techniques. I don’t know if people really want to know about specifically scratching, we don’t have to because it might be a bit like… GO A bit geeky and a bit boring. Beni’s into transforming, flares... BENI G Maybe we'll just show you a few techniques. Nothing that will send you to sleep, hopefully. Just a few things, just to get an idea of what basic techniques you can do scratching-wise. Maybe we show you drumming first. Go will show you drumming first. A lot of turntable routines within team stuff as a foundation, you’d always have one turntable, which might be the drums and one turntable might be the basslines. It is like a track. One turntable might be the melody part, and so on. You can break it down in however you want to and how many people you have got in your team. So, the foundation of a lot of turntable music and tracks is a kick [drum] and a snare [drum]. So, Go will show you some basics with drum techniques. (music: The Honeydrippers - "Impeach The President") So, really, it’s up to the DJ himself what kind of rhythm you want to drum in. Then you can do some scratching. Maybe I’ll do some cuts on top of a drum to show you how we might mess about and do a few different drum patterns, and then I’ll breakdown with a few cuts for you and stuff maybe. Should we? GO Alright! (music: Afrika Bambaataa – “Planet Rock” and Fab 5 Freddy “Change The Beat” / applause) GO Beni’s going crazy there. He’s double time transforming. Show them double time, double time transforming. BENI G Maybe we should show some basics stuff. We are getting into it a bit. This is a basic, basic scratch. That’s the first scratch that, even if you don’t know how to scratch, you just scratch anyway, you Baby Scratch. You do it when you are cueing up when you are getting ready to mix it in. Yeah, just literally that with no fader involved. It is like a 'zuguzugu' scratch. And that is what is the foundation of a lot of scratching. [Go does a baby scratch] From Baby Scratching you can… ah, I'll just show you [scratches]. Just by opening and closing the fader, you can just keep the Baby Scratch and make it lots of more chopped up, which gives a rhythm. You guys might be wondering why we use our cross fader backwards. It’s just like a technique in scratching called the Hamster Scratching technique. You scratch in reverse instead of how you normally DJ by pushing the fader out that way, and the sound is playing, you push it away from you and it plays. And all the scratch mixers have the facilities to switch around. Go will show you the step off, which is chopping the sound, which is just… [Go chops the sound fast] The sound that was called chops, which is when you take the first part of this sound which we’re both using, and you just hit the first part of the sounds. That very initial [plays only the first part of the effect]. See, the sound is like a waveform. It is the very initial bit. That is a kind of old school chop. That is a little bit more advanced than the Baby Scratch. From the Baby Scratch, it normally is a scratch called The Transformer, which before that… I’ll just explain what it is. Baby chopping is the original scratch – sounds that a lot of DJs use and it is chopping the sound into little pieces. So you let the sound play forward and you chop it into little segments on the fader and the you can do it in reverse as well. So, OK… [transforms the effect forward and backward linear, then transforms it in a more complex rhythmic structure]. That was like a few variations. GO Props to Ready D over there, the king of transforming. [applause] BENI G There’s loads of ways you can permutate and take it. But the basic is, you take the sound and you sort of split it into little bit forwards and backward. Just do what you want. Scratching, really, for me … I don’t tend to stand here ... I am not the master or anything. We just do what we like and what sounds good. Some techniques are just going so far. GO But it just helps to know the techniques because you can then piece together the sounds that are your head. BENI G Yeah, but once you have got all the basics, you’ve got your Baby Scratching. You’ve got your Transforming, and a little bit more we can show you. A little bit more complicated, there is the crab scratch, which Go shows you [scratches]. It is basically just [Go scratches again] Clicking the fader with all three fingers. You get a kind of crab walking sound, and that’s a very popular scratch with a lot of DJs. It is quite easy, but it’s a sound that’s good to use. And once you have got all your scratches and what you want to learn, it is just a matter of how you cut them and put them into order. You might drop into this and come back into a Transformer, and that’s your style. You know, your style is how you piece it all together and how you perform. Go just wants to show you a one-click flare, which is basically the opposite of the transform. It’s kind of complicated to explain, but instead of having [places one hand on the crossfader] It took me a long time to understand it, but instead of chopping the sound with the fader off, you start with off, so it’s off and then the fader comes out, so you can hear the sound and then back off so you don’t hear the sound. The fader starts in the middle, so the very first sound you hear is the sound if that makes sense. So, you start with it ‘on-off-on’ instead of ‘off-on-off’ [Go demonstrates a one click flare]. So, you get that real wavy sound as opposed to [imitates sound] like a straight chop with the transformer rose up and down ’cause you are hearing different sounds of the same part, but giving to you in a different sort of way. I don’t even understand what I am saying now, but I hope you roughly get what we're trying to say. It was invented obviously by DJ Flare. It kind of semi-revolutionized scratch techniques because you can do so many things with it. GO Because it sounds really fast in between scratches that don’t sound too fast. And it gives you a little buzz when you hear it, you know? BENI G Yeah, instead of doing a flare, it’s going ‘dit dit dit,’ it’s like ‘dibbedi dibbedi dibbedi.’ And that’s easy to do. It is just like a straight chop. Once you get it, but put in between the two and it just adds to your repertoire and what you can do. People are just taking that technique even further past that way we learned as well. GO Does anyone just want to jump up and mess about? BENI G Just for people that don’t know, twiddle is another scratch technique. It is basically when to twiddle your fingers like that one on the cross fader [Go shows a twiddle Scratch) and it gets the same sound as a scratch called the two-click flare, which is similar to the flare, which is a flare, but we'll show you how you to do it twice – so twice flaring forwards, twice flaring backwards. And if you don’t understand what the flare is, Go will show you what it is [Go shows a flare]. So it is that ‘dibedidib’ forward, ‘dibedidib’ backward. A single click flare is ‘dibedib dibedib dibedib,’ like forwards and backward. I don’t know if that’s helping [smiles]. Probably not. GO It is kind of like an illusion because you get the sound chopped in the middle rather than starting the sound like ‘did did did did did,’ you are cutting the sounds in between. So you are hearing, you are hearing more sounds. BENI G Yeah, but it is called an illusion scratch. Well not quite, but you know it does give the impression that you got it so fast, but you do have quite more technical scratches, though. GO If you guys have internet, there is a site called Asisphonics that kind of breaks it all down with the graphs and stuff on it. BENI G Yeah, it is crazy. There are so many techniques now. You know, it goes over so many people’s heads. People have taken new levels of scratching. It’s a crazy art form in itself, you know. Just like raw technique of scratching, like DJ Qbert, for instance, is obviously pushing that. It just depends where you want to take it. For us personally, we want to use it in a way that people can still enjoy what we do inside a club and still appreciate what we can do skill-wise as well. We always like to make sure we are still up on it and still practice when we can. But, we are not so crazy on it that we used to be like, “We have to sit for five hours a day at home and make sure I learn a specific scratch.” Yeah, when you are learning anything you have to put that dedication and that time in, so... AUDIENCE MEMBER What do you think is the most innovative thing at the moment? BENI G At the moment, for me, I don’t know about you [looks at Go], but for me, it is not in the moment, but a technique that was introduced quite recently. I am sure you guys know The Scratch Perverts… a technique called feedback. They just use the technique, which so many people use in single routines. That routine where you basically create a feedback loop within the mixer and what it does is gives some crazy… I mean, if you guys got two phono [outputs] to a quarter inch jack, I can show you. We actually don’t have one. What it does, you just take an output... Where the mixer is coming from an output, you put it like to an input. And it just makes a feedback loop, so just get a feedback sound. You don’t have any records to do it, either. You can do it with no records. And you can also, if you put it through a line, you can scratch with it as well or you can cut it. And it is just a noise that your mixer is not making. I am sure the guys have got a lead and we’ll show you. Touching the EQs on your mixer contains the sound of it as well. It is crazy. GO It bends the pitch of the feedback.

Patrice
Patrice went to boarding school in South Germany. Come holiday time, he would hit the highway and drive to Hamburg, hooking up with heads there, and connecting with the city’s nascent hip-hop scene. That’s how he found an agent and had his debut EP Lions released in 1999 when he was just 17. As we found out at the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy, Patrice is well versed in testifying to his emotions thanks to his father, a political activist and poet born in Sierra Leone, while the sweet cadence he infuses into his reggae-soul helps the message transcend language barriers.
Hosted by Torsten Schmidt Well, this morning it’s, as you can see in our ever on going series of old and seasoned gentlemen, we have another very experienced one over here: Patrice. [applause] So, speaking of age and experience and wisdom, success: What is it, and can it come to you too early? Patrice Yes, it can. Definitely. Well, I’m 24, and I’m a musician, singer-songwriter, and I’m living successfully in Europe. I’ve done a lot of of touring, up to now I did three albums, one mini-album, I toured with several people. That’s about it. Torsten Schmidt How would you cope, let’s say tomorrow, if you were playing at a cafe on your own? Would you be able to do that? Patrice Definitely. I mean, that’s how it started out. When I opened up for people, it was just me and the guitar. It was quite a rough experience before learning how to do it; our tour was like in big arenas. That’s when she was at her peak and it was just me and a guitar on this big stage. And a lot of people. It was quite an experience. I was so nervous, the first time I played before Lauryn Hill, that my foot was shaking. I mean, about this much [imitating]. And I had to somehow adjust to the stool I was on so that I wouldn’t shake so much. I was quite nervous. Because you have to remember, her whole band was watching me as well, they were on the sides. Ron Marley, the Marleys, was a little intimidating. The first group I opened up for - that’s how I got started opening up for people - was The Black Eyed Peas, who have now blown up big time, but before they weren’t that known. And that’s also interesting: if you work with people and you play in small clubs and then all of a sudden they blow up, and you really feel happy for them. Torsten Schmidt So probably before we pass through the procedure of that biography stuff, why don’t you just play a song and let the music do the talking and then we go to what you came here for in the first place. Patrice OK, yes, I’m better at that. I’m better at playing songs. (music: Patrice plays "How Do You Call It") Patrice I just had some ideas and I just wanted to realise them. There was nothing other than the feeling or the wanting to do something creative and express myself. There was no other real reason other than that. Torsten Schmidt When did you come up with the language you’d write in? Your first songs, in what language were they? Patrice They were in English. All the music I listened to, all the music I liked was in English. So it didn’t come to my mind to write in German. The other day I worked together with this guy from England. His name is Cameron McVey, he is the guy who wrote “7 Seconds”. And I learned something from him because he would just go into a newspaper, for example, look up a sentence and use that. I don’t know, somebody would say something across the road, and would just pick it up, and add this to the thing from the newspaper. Basically, using a stream of consciousness and associations and stuff like that. Because if you check out “7 Seconds,” for example, it doesn’t make any sense, the song is just words. I think a good songwriter is a sensitive person who instinctively knows what it takes, and who processes the skills to express it, and has the style to make it sound cool. Torsten Schmidt But style, that’s probably like ideas. Is that something that you can train in or is it given to you? Patrice Style is [something you can train] in a way; I would look at what other people did and try to do it differently, for example. But I think that everybody naturally possesses his or her own style. You just have to learn about yourself more to find your style because I think everybody is different. And the mistake a lot of people make is that they are too inspired by other musicians. Torsten Schmidt Where does deliverance fall into this? Because when you have someone like, let’s say, an easy example, Frank Sinatra, it’s probably not necessarily his voice, but knowing exactly when to pause, where to put the cadenzas and all that kind of stuff. And even when you redo old versions of songs that you already recorded, and change these things around, is that an extension of the style? Patrice Yeah, it’s part of the style but all those things basically go together. I think those pauses and melody lines are really up to your feelings, what you feel like doing. You cannot really learn it, you just feel that there needs to be a pause right there, and that's where you will leave the pause. Really and truly you just have to try and be sensitive because I think good songs, they write themselves, you just follow the idea and let it talk to you. Torsten Schmidt So under which circumstances do they write themselves? Patrice Well, any circumstance. If you are just silent and just try and really go into yourself and just receive. Torsten Schmidt Looking at ideals of how an artist works, when we sat yesterday on the rocks in Camps Bay, in a kitschy artist notion way, that would have been the ideal situation to write a song, looking at the 360 degrees of cinemascope, clouds and light and whatever. Patrice Well, there’s different scenarios. I mean, that is one way, but I’m not the type, for example, that sits down in a room with incense and starts meditating, necessarily. It's one way, yes, but you also can write great songs when you are in difficult situations or when you are in a room where there are just grey walls, like in a prison. I mean, I haven’t been in prison but, you know, the greatest music was created by sufferers. The greatest music is sufferer-music. I think you should put yourself in uncomfortable situations because that’s when you will really start working and you have to come up with something, you are really under pressure. And I think, one of the main factors that kills artists is comfort. A lot of artists that start out as great people, but after they find a certain degree of success, they’re getting worse and worse. And, as I said, sometimes you have to make yourself suffer, like, for example, you let the person you love quit you or something. So, you have to remember, it’s basically for a “greater good” because a timeless song lives forever and you basically keep your legend alive like that. Sometimes that’s okay, if you suffer a bit. So, let’s write a song. Torsten Schmidt So, where do we start then? Patrice [picks up the guitar] OK, does anybody have an idea, or which formula do you want to start with? Do you want to come up with the words first or the melody or...? Audience Member The words first. Patrice The words? OK, do you have any idea? You could come up with any sentence or...? Torsten Schmidt Hundred Rand? The local currency. Patrice Hundred Rand? OK, OK. Torsten Schmidt [holding the microphone for Patrice] This is going to be my special workout then. Patrice Yes, well, I mean, you got a lot of things here but you don’t have a mic stand. Torsten Schmidt Someone get a mic stand, please. Patrice OK, but nobody has no melody idea. I’ll just play some chords and you tell me which chords you like, OK? I’m going to play some of my standards first. [plays guitar] Right now, what I would feel like doing in this moment is, I would put the chorus twice at first. I would start with the chorus, then more chorus, and then I would come with a verse, a short one, about 8 bars, and then I would go back to the chorus, which is very simple and straight up. It’s basically what people would expect, but sometimes you can even give the people what they expect because there’s nothing wrong with that, if you feel like doing it. Sometimes it’s not so great because you have to keep the tension in a song. In order to keep it exciting, sometimes you need to put some surprises in there and give people something they don’t expect, which is another factor, tension. And building the tune. But this is about what I would come up with right now. Torsten Schmidt In a lot of the songs you say a lot of pretty nice and pretty personal things. Sometimes in front of a lot of people and they’re things in a way, not all of us would probably have the heart to say them, just in a one-to-one situation. Is this, once you crossed that barrier, is it a lot easier? Or how do you cope with putting these intimate things out there? Patrice I think that's what it's really about. I also think music really lacks this. I think people don’t really show themselves when they are on stage or when they do music. The other day I had a real great experience, I went to a Ursula Rucker concert and she was really just like showing herself. And when you went away after the concert, it was like you really got something. It’s not just entertainment, you haven’t just been dancing and having fun. No, you really took something with you. It really enriched me. I don’t know, I don’t have a problem with saying those things because for me it’s basically some sort of poetry. A primitive one maybe, I don’t know. It’s just the way I feel. Torsten Schmidt So, let’s say you are in a personal situation yourself and your girlfriend would go like: “No, Patrice, don’t give me that. You've sung that about two hundred times. Come up with something new.” Patrice Well, when I’m in a situation like that, usually I wouldn’t... I think, for me it’s a lot easier to express certain things in my songs, than in real life. Torsten Schmidt So it’s because of that virtual scenario? Patrice Don’t know, it’s just like that. I don’t have a problem with expressing myself in a song. But sometimes it’s hard to express yourself when you are in front of a person, you know? Torsten Schmidt If we come back to our “Hundred Rand” story, I mean, we had one line there, probably a second one, what would it take to get it to a three minute song? Patrice The “One Hundred Rand” thing? Torsten Schmidt It needs a little bit more work. Patrice It does, yes, true. Torsten Schmidt Would we look for rhyme words now, or how do we go from here? Patrice I mean, right now what I did was a lot of freestyling. You know, some stuff wasn’t so great. But sometimes you need to do a little bit more thinking, when it comes to the lyrics. I mean, melodies I find quite easy to find. It's just the lyrics sometimes, in order to really say something, you need to think about it. I would put the chorus first. Then come up with the verse, maybe an 8-bar verse. Then come back with the chorus, then do something like an instrumental part in which there would be no singing. And then come back with the verse. Add some elements to it, vary it a little bit, like don’t follow the same melody line like in the first verse part, but vary it a little bit. And come back with the chorus, after that maybe do like a bridge, and then come back with... Torsten Schmidt So we are talking arrangement here, but you said you would need to think a little more about the words. Want to help us in this room? So shall we give the words a bit more of a think then? Patrice OK, no problem. Torsten Schmidt How would you go about it? Would you still strum the guitar and think about the words while they’re being added, or do you sit down, under a tree, with a little note pad? Patrice It depends. I mean, I think I would do a little bit of thinking without strumming the guitar. In a situation like this, where I better come up with something, I usually come up with something. It’s just that you have to overcome your laziness almost. OK, let’s do it. So we were saying “a hundred Rand.” I started out saying: “They want to buy my soul for a hundred Rand.” Can you pass this microphone stand? Torsten Schmidt But who would be in a position to have to be in the danger of selling a soul for a hundred Rand? I mean, that’s about 10€. I mean, that must be a person who’s not exactly in your position. Patrice Yeah, but everybody has to work for a living, and has to survive. Torsten Schmidt We have a person, that’s working for a living, that’s a good start as a setting. Patrice I think most people are. We have to work in order to survive. And a lot of times we have to do work, that isn’t very fulfilling, but we have to do it in order to make some money. I mean, a hundred Rand is just an exaggeration, but just to show people for how cheap we have to sell our soul sometimes. So to look at it in that way: “They want to buy my soul...” then... Torsten Schmidt Pressure. Patrice And then: “Not a soul around in this no-mans-land”? What about that? Is that okay? Torsten Schmidt Do you decide beforehand, whether you will end up on an uplifting or on a rather depressing note? Patrice Not really. I mean, we’ll see: “In this no-mans-land, nobody to give me a hand.” What about that? What did we say? Audience Member One-man band. The one-man band, I know, I know. It fits this situation but whether it fits the song is the question. [Audience Member speaks, inaudible] Torsten Schmidt Are you at some stages afraid of words which might sound too cliché? Patrice Of course, yes. Torsten Schmidt As in which ones? What are the ones you are trying to avoid? Patrice Right now? Torsten Schmidt Right now and in general. Patrice It’s not about clichés, I mean, every song has a kind of concept. Like, right now when I started writing this, I didn’t really know about the concept. But now I think the concept would be, that what we have to do basically, is to survive. And we sometimes have to compromise our ideals and principles. If you understand what I mean. Torsten Schmidt But, what do you know about compromising? I mean you... Patrice Come on, trust me, I know about that. As you work with other people, you always have to compromise. Let’s say, especially when you work with people that have different interests. Sometimes when you work with record labels, you have to compromise. Because you have some weird A&R people walking into the studio, trying to tell you how to do things. You have to listen to them, which is already a compromise or you have to give them the feeling that you are listening or that you are respecting their view, stuff like that. Or, let’s say, sometimes you play gigs, people told you one thing, and then you show up at the gig and it’s a whole different scenario. And you are just playing because the people came to see you. That’s also a compromise. I think everybody knows about that. Audience Member In the beginning you were saying: “Gonna sell my soul for a hundred Rand,” maybe it could be a possible option to come back, when you do the chorus in the end, so it could maybe be a kind of happy end, or maybe some turnaround point. Now it’s like, “You wanna buy my soul.” Because in the very beginning, when you sang it the first time, it was like “sell.” Patrice Yes, exactly, that was it. Torsten Schmidt So, what do we got there now? Patrice The paper is quite small but I would say: They want me to sell my soul for a hundred Rand, Not a soul around in this no-mans-land, Today is a day, I won’t pretend,
Not again... There is this mountain to climb, Heavy load on my back. I put my shoulder to the wheel I feel, Must put myself back on track, The town in the valley, held to my left. This is my homecoming, There ain’t no turning back. And then, chorus again. And then: They wanna buy my soul for a hundred Rand, And there’s no soul around in this no-mans-land. But today is the day, I won’t pretend, No, no, no, not again. As far as I remembered them. OK? (music: Patrice plays the untitled song in its entirety)

Title: Prince Paul

Prince Paul
Fellow innovator Steinski called this man “the closest thing hip-hop has to a genius.” By the age of ten, Prince Paul’s pals were comparing him to Grandmaster Flash. He had to convince them otherwise, and has been challenging people’s preconceptions about hip hop ever since: from his scratches in Stetsasonic to his groundbreaking production with De La Soul and Handsome Boy Modelling School. Heads should take note that rebellion and money were never the focus – even hip-hop itself wasn’t the focus. As he says during this lecture at the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy, “the focus, that was always the music.”
Hosted by TORSTEN SCHMIDT Let’s welcome our man Prince Paul here. Prince Paul Thank you, thank you. Well, I feel still like hugging the microphone. That’s hip-hop for you. I should hold it like this [in a proper microphone position], right? TORSTEN SCHMIDT I mean, you are the guy who is producing, so you should tell us how we should hold it. Prince Paul Yeah, hold it like this. [holds the mic upside down to his mouth] That’s when you gangster… TORSTEN SCHMIDT How did you get the name Prince Paul? Prince Paul Prince Paul was given to me because they said my regular name – that was DJ Paul – was boring. You don’t want to say, “DJ Paul” on the microphone, you know? I’m a humble dude, but I was forced on that whole hip-hop ego thing. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Since when do you DJ? Prince Paul I’ve been DJing since I was my son’s age [pointing his finger to his son sitting in the audience], that’s him right there. Actually, a little younger than him. When I was ten years old, I’ve heard, I was the fake Grandmaster Flash of my day. And when you’re ten or 11 years old, that’s pretty traumatizing. That’s why I’m here today, it’s to prove the world that I’m not the fake Grandmaster Flash. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Being the fake Grandmaster Flash, who came up with that name then? Prince Paul That was back in school. For me DJing started or hip-hop, it wasn’t called hip-hop when I started, I was like my son’s age. I was like ten years old. Hip-hop for me is a lot different from what people see out here now, especially the commercialized side of it. When I was coming up it was more or less DJing in the park. MCs rarely had any substance to say. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So when you were the DJ it wasn’t like that? [posing in front of Paul] “Hey, where’s the DJ? I’m the rapper!” Prince Paul The DJ was the primary focus. That’s why you had Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five, Grand Wizard Theodore & the Fantastic Five, Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince. It was like that initially. That was the era where I was from. It was a lot different back then. It was all about having fun, you battle people and you did your thing. But it was basically going out to see people dance. As opposed to now, it’s just a little bit different. Well, it’s a lot different. I think once the money gets involved, it changes a whole lot. Coming from Long Island, actually first time I heard hip-hop was in Brooklyn. And that’s when it was actually filtering out from the Bronx down to all the boroughs. What I learned in Brooklyn, I brought to Long Island. TORSTEN SCHMIDT You say that you’re DJing forever, can you tell us a little bit about your first record player? Prince Paul Maaaan, I tell you, my first record player, if you really want to get old school, was a Mickey Mouse record player with the hand that was the needle. I remember being five years old and I just bought James Brown’s Hot Pants and “Groove Me” by King Floyd. That was my first turntable. TORSTEN SCHMIDT You’re trying to be really musically correct here. I mean, it takes other people 30 years to come up with those joints. Prince Paul My first DJ set was really makeshift because my family didn’t have a lot of money, so what I did was I took a component set that somebody threw out and used its turntable. So what I did, I took a component set... For those who don’t know, component sets are, you have your turntable, your radio and your eight-track player all in one. It was an old one that my family had, I think the radio didn’t work on it. And I took another cheap turntable, I think it was a Lafayette, and I used the balance knob as a mixer to go between the component one and the other one. For those technical heads, I put everything mono, so the balance going left for one turntable, left and right for each turntable. It went through the center and that was how I mixed. I had no cue, but I thought it was pretty ingenious for a little kid! I amazed myself [smiling] – and my friends! That’s how I became the fake Grandmaster Flash. TORSTEN SCHMIDT I mean, the cue system wasn’t even invented back then, was it? Prince Paul Nah. Not that I can remember. A lot of the mixers that I remember back then, were up and down [volume], no cue. It was the big knobs, I think was like the mixers that I remember. Man, now looking back I feel really old because a lot of things really weren’t around back then. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Why does it seem that everyone has had the same mixer back then? Prince Paul Because they only made a handful. Since DJing and the whole culture has built up so much, of course there is competition. Just like you have a billion MCs and DJs now, I guess you have a billion mixers because it’s catering to that demand. So back then, I think, there was Numark, Gemini. There was a company called Clubman. GLI came a little later. There were only like four or five mixers. Gemini just really came out. And a lot of the mixers were like big pieces of sheet metal, with giant faders. Once the crossfader came out, everybody was like, “Oh my god, he’s got a crossfader!” You run to the guy’s house and “oooohhh,” take pictures of it… Things were such a big deal back then, because everything was like a mystery. Where now – not to shoot down what’s going on now, I don’t want to seem like the bitter old school guy – but I think the cool thing back in the days was that everything you had to go and search it. You had to invent your own stuff. For example, now you can go to the internet, which is great. You can go look in magazines and read up on people, which is really good. But then, when it was in its early stages you had to invent things. I think that made a lot of things crafty as far as like the equipment. I guess that’s the reason why somebody eventually made the cue. I think Grandmaster Flash was credited for making the cue. A lot of things that’s on the mixers now you just didn’t have. TORSTEN SCHMIDT When you talk of this age of mystery and when not everything was at your fingertips, so to speak, I mean, covering up your records was a big deal back then. How anal was that? Prince Paul It was incredible. I have to compare now and then, so you can really get a gist of what’s going on. Now you have breakbeat records and compilations out there and everybody can buy a ton of records. Back in the day, you had to research and really look for your breakbeats. For example, if you found a record, say like Billy Squier’s “Big Beat,” I don’t know if you are familiar with that breakbeat, it’s like, [Paul beatboxing]. Everybody wasn’t just buying those records, like now maybe a 50 Cent comes out, everybody buys it. Billy Squier – no b-boys really buying it. So, if you found something that was so sacred, you want nobody else playing that record. You want that everybody comes to you, to your parties to hear those records. Immediately you go home, you erased all the labels. But the thing that messed a lot of DJs up, and how I got a lot of breakbeats back then, is, they would erase the labels, but they would be stupid enough to keep the jackets. So, me as a kid, I went to the block parties and I watch ‘em. And I looked for the records in the back and you see the record up like that. And I took a little pad [and began to write the names down]. Not that I could afford to have those records but I knew what they were. It was me and Biz Markie, actually. We were going to these parties and started to write down stuff. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Do you still participate in that discipline these days? Prince Paul As far as like beat collecting? I don’t know, the cool thing about it then was the fact that you tried to get something that nobody had. I think now people are fanatically beat collecting and I lost interest in it. I mean, I still try to get things I don’t think people have. But I don’t DJ like that anymore, where I go out and play beats. People are not apt to listen to new stuff like that any more. You play new stuff and people be like, “Ohhhhh” [leans back with a skeptic and disgusted face]. And only a hand full of beatheads in the front be like, “Oooh, that’s incredible!” TORSTEN SCHMIDT And, as we all know, beat nerds are really the ones that really get the party going. Prince Paul Oh yeah! Even for production I don’t collect as much. My tastes are obscure anyway, so I kind of have a different collection than most people. TORSTEN SCHMIDT You just mentioned a big name there, Biz Markie. Can you tell us a little about the people coming from Long Island around that time? Prince Paul You know what is amazing is a lot of us, we played together with no ideas of ever making records together. For example, I used to DJ for Biz Markie, he came up as Busy Bee back in the days when I was in the 8th grade, that’s like 14 years old. I used to run into Chuck D and Flavor Flav, which was a little further out from me. Eric and Parrish, who is EPMD, I used to see them a lot. Rakim, his name was Love Kid Wiz, he had a group called the Love Brothers. Him and Freddie Foxx, whose name used to be Freddie C. A group called the JVC Force. There were a lot of us back then. We battled each other in little parks. Records was really so far-fetched. Like, who makes records except Fat Boys and Sugarhill Gang? We weren’t really into it for that, just for the competition and for the love of music. And then later on, when you see people that you grew up with doing tours and making records, that was totally amazing. “Wow, you make records too?” I remember one time Flavor Flav had me in his show called MC DJ Flavor Flav Show. It was out of Adelphi I think. He was doing a little bit of everything. I think it was him and Bill Stephney and Hank Shocklee, the whole Bomb Squad, they had their little show. We sat down, I just joined Stetsasonic, and Flav said, “Maybe one day we will go on tour. Ha, ha, ha, ha. How far fetched is that?” Next thing you know is, that were on the Def Jam tour in 1987, with LL Cool J headlining, Public Enemy and Stetsasonic opening up and Eric B and Rakim, Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, Whodini. And in some cases it was Kool Moe Dee, Run DMC and KRS-One on a few shows. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So, even without trying to sound not too much of an old bore, that’s what they still call the golden age of hip-hop. Why? Prince Paul I think a lot of times when people refer to that era as the golden age because a lot of it was just gut. It just was less marketing into it. Rap wasn’t proven back then. Nobody knew really what it took to make a gold record. OK, Kurtis Blow came out with “The Breaks,” Sugarhill and so on. So once in a while a hit came out. But your whole intent was to show a new style or something different that you have to offer to the music. I think a lot of creativity came out because you were trying to differentiate yourself from everybody else. It was just organic as opposed to now. OK, this is a marketing scheme, this is how you’re going to dress, this is how you’re going to look. This hip-hop appeals to down South, this hip-hop appeals to up North, this appeals overseas, this appeals to whatever. TORSTEN SCHMIDT And don’t forget about the Dirty South in there. Prince Paul Oh yeah. I think as far as that being the golden era, diversity was the whole thing. TORSTEN SCHMIDT It was a different concept. What would a night like that, a line-up look like look like? What would a live performance look like back then? What was the difference in getting down on stage? Prince Paul The whole thing back then was always just trying to prove yourself. A lot of times you played to crowds that didn’t know your records. So everything was based on your performance. Even before we made records, it was like, OK, a crowd comes in and everybody wants to be entertained. And you don’t have the power of the hit record to make it happen for you. So you had to go out there and you had to show the people something. You had to show them that you are talented, or you had a rhyme skill or you could DJ in a certain way. And I think that was really the whole gist of what the performances were. That’s why a lot of times you hear people, when they refer to the early ‘80s, even late ‘70s to the late ‘80s, “Oh, the shows were so incredible.” Everybody had to prove themselves, where a lot of times now people base themselves on whatever hit they have. TORSTEN SCHMIDT When you went out of the five boroughs [of New York], how was it like? Where did you go on the tour? Prince Paul The tours back then went everywhere. What was really cool was, you had a package of hip-hop artists as opposed to now because of insurance situations and the quote-unquote “violence in hip-hop.” I guess I can’t say R. Kelly because he’s kinda controversial too. Let’s say now you built a tour with N’Sync and Nelly opening up because it’s a safe thing. What I think what was cool is that it was entirely hip-hop. Everybody was coming together, underground stuff and the popular stuff. LL Cool J was probably the most popular dude then and, yeah, it was his tour. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Was LL Cool J the first one to take his shirt off? Prince Paul Well, that’s a good question. I’m a dude, I wasn’t really paying attention. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So what’s this whole thing of hip-hop and homophobia coming to speak of it? Prince Paul I don’t know, I haven’t ever dealt with that. You got to ask somebody else. Next question. [laughs] Audience Member I have always been curious because I have the 12” of “Go Stetsa,” and on the flip side “On Fire.” I didn’t see any credit for the scratching and I wondered if you did the cuts on that. Prince Paul Yeah, I did do the scratching on that. Audience Member Dude, that was ahead of its time. That was an inspiration. Prince Paul Thank you! Can I say something about me and DJing real quick? People might know me as a producer for the most part, but DJing was always my first passion. I am a lover of music, not just hip-hop music. Some get into it like, “Hip-hop this, hip-hop forever.” I don’t take hip-hop seriously. You can hear it from my records. But I take the music very, very serious. As much creativity as I try to put in my production as being a DJ back then, I tried to do the same thing. Like you said, but I don’t like to be bragging, “I was ahead of my time.” But on a lot of the records back then, I tried to prove that there was stuff that nobody was doing or stuff that could be invented. The first single we were doing was “Just Say Stet” and I did some scratches. I was breaking down the syllables of James Brown’s “Funky,” “Make it fun-ky-ky, fun-ky-ky…” [imitates the scratch] You know, people weren’t doing that back then and I took pride in that. I was doing the crazy scratches, kind of back and forth and chopping it up with the fader. That’s where I take most of my pride being a DJ. I love DJing! And I invented the “LL Cool J scratch” too. You can put that on film: That “LL Cool J is hard as hell” scratch, that was me, that was my scratch! Everybody that was at that battle when I battled Easy G, that how I’d won and made it to the semi-finals. I work really hard in what I do, and I really love what I do. You know, sometimes the money is great, but the credit lives forever. Audience Member On the Stetsasonic track “Talking All That Jazz,” did you replay that Lonnie Liston Smith “Expansions” on the keyboard? Prince Paul Yeah, I had my friend Don Newkirk play that. I actually produced that song and I never got production credits. I looped up the beats on there and I had my friend Newkirk coming to play the keys. I was really young back than and had no idea of what a producer was and what songwriting was. All I knew was, “I’m in a studio, I’m gonna have fun.” Later in the years, I looked at the writer credits and it just had Daddy O’s name on it. And I was like, “Damn, how did that happen?” They were all getting this big checks and I was like, “How did that happen?” I’m riding around in my Pinto and he’s doing pretty good. Audience Member On De La Soul’s 3 Feet High and Rising you used many samples of different popular music. What was the fallout from that, in a legal sense? Was it quite intense? Prince Paul Well, let me get you a little pre-history on that. Even to this day, when I make records, I just make it strictly for the love of the music. Back then we sampled from everywhere, but we were smart enough to give all of the samples to the label, saying, “OK, this is what we used.” It was their decision not to clear certain things because we used a lot of obscure records as well. They looked at one record, like George Clinton, “Me, Myself and I” from Funkadelic and say, “OK, we’re gonna clear this, but we’re not gonna clear that other record, because nobody knows this.” Obviously everyone knows about the Turtles lawsuit. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Who are the Turtles in the first place? I think there are so many people who’ve heard about them first time through being sampled. Prince Paul Erm, I don’t know. [laughing] TORSTEN SCHMIDT [also laughing] Did you ever get paid for that? Prince Paul You know, because the record got popular. The label didn’t know the record would get that popular. Tommy Boy hadn’t had a hit record at that time since “Planet Rock,” and meanwhile it’s 1989. I guess, they were like, “This is like any other record.” I remember them saying, “Press like 100,000 copies – if that!” The record did a lot more than anybody expected, so that’s were the lawsuit came in. And the record label wasn’t really prepared for it. But for me, despite the lawsuits, it was still enough for me to make a profit. It was enough to make a down payment on a house and I bought my mom a house, which was nice. But the main focus was not money, it was just the quality of the music. So, regardless of what we sampled or regardless of the lawsuits, it was the final outcome that was more important. We didn’t make that record thinking we’re going to make this unique record, sell all these units and we’re going to be rich beyond our wildest dreams. It was the fact that we stand for a certain thing and that is to be yourself. That was what the whole album was about. Not to rebel against all the gold and the other things that were the cliché of hip-hop back then. We were just like, “This is where we come from and this is our style.” Hopefully we would get a show or two out of it and make a dollar or two. But that was never the focus, it always has been the music. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Speaking of the music, you have being compared being too close to the Ultramagnetic MC’s at that time. How the hell did that happen? Prince Paul I played the rough demo of “Plug Tunin’” to Daddy O, who was the lead MC of Stetsasonic. And I remember him saying, “No, I can’t work with them, they sound like the Ultramagnetic MC’s.” He kind of shut me down. That’s why I put De La Soul together because in Stetsasonic I was just the DJ. I hate to say just the DJ, but that’s how I was treated. Plus, I was a lot younger then those guys. A lot of times when we were going to the studio and I said, “Hey, I think this’ll be cool,” I remember I would literally get my hand slapped off the board. I was 17 or 18 at the time. You start to second-guess yourself. Well, maybe I am wack, maybe that idea was stupid, or whatever. I started De La Soul to prove to myself and that I was right, I had to try those ideas. Maybe within that circle of Stetsasonic, I wasn’t a star, but in my own neighborhood I’m the only guy who made a record at that time. So those guys looked up to me, which was good at that time. Because it gave me some kind of opportunity to mold them into what I wanted them to be. The record did well and this proved to myself that dreams really do happen. So those ideas weren’t as stupid as I was told. I went out and proved it. And later on it got pretty crazy, because there were jealousies in the group and stuff. And as time went on, maybe one reason why De La Soul and me separated later was because the early three De La records represented more me and my quirky sense of humor and personality as opposed to what they wanted to represent and they were kind of outgrowing that. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So finally they got rid of the “abusive” producer? Prince Paul Nah they didn't get rid of me. We had a nice mature conversation in my house while working at Stakes Is High, which is the fourth album, and we were just butting heads, you know? I wanted to go out with the production style in the way of just having fun. But since Buhloone Mindstate didn’t do that well they felt that it was time to have another good hit record. Since I cannot promise a hit record, because the first record we did we just did it for fun. I never knew how to make hit records. I knew during the production of Stakes Is High, it was a good time to step back and let them do their thing. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Can you tell us more of the actual production process doing 3 Feet High and Rising? Prince Paul People at that time were not really into layering samples. They had usually one main loop, maybe some scratches. When we produced, we used pitch-shifting and we made samples fit through that technique. We put our music in key. When we heard a certain bassline, we pitch-shifted it to make it fit with some horns. That enabled us to layer a whole lot of sounds on top of each other and make it sound like they belong together. That gave us a little edge. I didn’t know too much about equipment or technique in production, it was just asking questions. I think that’s the best thing in production when you ask yourself questions, “Can I make this go backwards but only the snares go forward?” And then you start to find out the answers to those questions and that, I think, enables greater production. You see a lot of people say, “No, that’s impossible.” But when you constantly work on those questions, it can make your productions far more advanced than most pepole. So that’s what we did when we worked on that album. We asked the engineer how to do that and learned about the pitch-shift. Or filtering. Filtering was new back then. We also brought a lot of different records together to sample from. It was a competition almost. DJing and hip-hop is competitive anyway. Everybody came up with really great source material and we combined it and you hear on that record that all our influences were different. Back then everybody digged records from the same places. Obviously, James Brown got some funky stuff. When you see an Afro and a band, “Oh, that has to be funky.” You know, I’m a ’70s child and in the ’70s, the radio played a wide variety of different music in those days, so we were exposed to a lot more. We grabbed from all these different places. Almost anything and everything that was good. We also listened to Afrika Bambaataa, that helped a lot. Technically, he was never a great DJ, but his records were incredible. He played everything from a Mickey Mouse record to Lynyrd Skynyrd to a James Brown record. It was just a wide variety. TORSTEN SCHMIDT When you switch on MTV these days and see some person from the UK doing a cover version of a quite popular Hall & Oates song “I Can’t Go For That,” which you’ve sampled, has the whole thing come full circle? Because I’m pretty confident they’ve heard it first rather in the sample than in the original version. Prince Paul People tell me a lot of times, “Sampling is not creative, can’t you play a lot of stuff over and blah, blah, blah.” But I come from a DJ era and DJs play records. So, the sound that we liked was on that record, so we sampled it. We as producers and artists were never at fault for sampling. If it was so unlawful and so forsaken, the label should have said “no” and the lawyers should have said “no.” But everybody was seeing money coming in, so that’s why it wasn’t stopped. The finger that gets pointed is always the artists. Well, we don’t know any different. That’s where we come from. As a DJ I played Billy Squier’s “Big Beat,” I sampled it. I played the Honeydrippers’ “Impeach The President,” I sampled it. A lot of us don’t play instruments. But as far as hip-hop is concerned, it’s based on two turntables and a microphone and that’s it. So, if there’s anybody to blame, blame those who put out those records. Those, who have the power. They’re the ones who put the record out. And I get a lot of flack for that. I didn’t get the bulk of the money, the label did.

Ready D
Ready D was born in District Six, Cape Town. At the age of ten, during the height of the Apartheid Era, his family, together with thousands of other so-called “coloured” families, were forcibly removed from District Six to the Cape Flats – a desolate township on the other side of Table Mountain. As he tells us direct from the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy, he was constantly surrounded by gangs and poverty, before hip-hop and breakdancing culture began to infiltrate the nation. Eventually he was able to visit Liverpool, England, where he got turned on to what a DJ was capable of. On returning to Cape Town, Deon acquired his first pair of Lenco turntables, and this hip-hop lover progressed to become a national champion and international DMC battle competitor – making music that helped to express the struggles and passions of his community along the way.
Hosted by Shaheen Ariefdien He is a producer, MC, b-boy, graf-artist. He is kind of the all-rounder in South Africa. He is old, old-school defined. [laughter] I think both of us are regarded by a lot of heads as part of the pioneering generation of hip-hop in South Africa. For the first generation of hip-hop heads, it provided us with an opportunity to express ourselves in our terms with something that we could identify with. It is something where you didn’t need to be rich, didn’t need to own stuff in order to be accepted. And the very first two clubs at the time were a place called Teasers and then later the Bass. Ready D We encountered hip-hop in the form as we know it in the early ’80s, early as 1982-’83 I would say, and hip-hop predominantly. And also because how we have been divided and pushed into certain areas, obviously, we were only operating or traveling in the Cape Flats because you couldn’t travel over into other areas or just cross the road. We were heavy into the b-boy scene at that time and hip-hop was pretty much on the streets, apart from being out on the streets out in Mitchell’s Plain and other areas. We brought it into Cape Town because it was a central place for crews to meet from all over the Cape Flats in fact. And also for some weird reason there was lot of white kids into b-boying as well. It was a good opportunity for us to take out the white kid, you know? Just to let get them know, “Look at you, you know. You are fucking us over and one way we are gonna take you out with the windmill or the headspin or some shit like that.” [laughs] So at a certain degree it became very, very personal. And also the white kids were the guys that had sponsorships, the money. They were always looking good, always dressed well. The sneakers would match the tracksuit pants and the pants would match, and the hair was nicely combed and blow-dried and all that. And we were the scruffy kids coming out of the Cape Flats and, “Well, fuck this, we got nothing but we got moves.” And after coming into the city center, where all the events take place, you always used to battle. All over the city center, all over the streets. And some friends of us, who used to be in the punk rock scene at that time told us about this club called Club Teasers, which was a punk rock club, they had the Saturday punk rock sessions. And they told us, “Look, you guys got to come to this club, come and see because this is like some next shit.” And we didn’t know what punk rock was all about. We just knew these guys with the heavy spikes and the hair standing like this. [points to his head] And for us it was a trip. “Fuck, let’s go and see what this punk rocker stuff is!” For us it was weird. For people coming out of our community, dressed up all in black, painted faces and being into this punk rock thing and we were very, very curious. We went into the club, started b-boying and everybody was cool. The punk rockers, they were cool, everybody was very, very cool. At first they allowed us about ten minutes to b-boy. And more and more b-boys and b-girls heard about this. And then it became 20 minutes. And then it became a half an hour and later on in that year we found a way to actually creep behind the decks and play our own music. And because of that, the scene became big. And from there, we had “thrash bash” sessions and most of the punk rockers that came were predominantly white kids that were into the scene. And with hip-hop and the whole punk rock scene merging, there was obviously a get-together in those hardcore days. I think that was the only club and the only movement and the only scenes for some weird reason that was actually bringing young black and white kids together. In that sort of environment and from there it just grew and grew. And it blew up and it blew up. Teasers closed down and moved to another venue, became known as the Bass and that was a really popular venue. And at that point in time I would say, 1986-’87 as we are moving on to the ‘90s, hip-hop started coming through with its black consciousness phase, where Public Enemy came out. You had X-Clan coming out, you had N.W.A. coming out, just to name a few. And one of the songs that really stood out, which became an anthem song, was a song called “Fuck tha Police” at that time. So we had like white kids out there like, “Fuck the Police! I am proud to be African! Fuck white people.” And we were like, “What the fuck? You are white,” you know? [laughs] “Why are you saying this?” But at the end of the day it was the music. It was the music, there was no color issue at that time and we were all in there thrash-bashing, jumping, going crazy with the punk rockers and everybody was just having a good time so that was really a very powerful force coming through by the merge of this two different styles. Shaheen Ariefdien At the time the anti-apartheid movement abroad was very active and at the time they called for a boycott for South African goods but also for people coming into South Africa. Whether it is artists, musicians, they were not touring South Africa. So it was very, very, very difficult to get hold of any kind of music that wasn’t really crappy British pop. Like, on radio you would hear Rick Astley and Kylie Minogue and just Stock, Aitken and Waterman shit. So if you wanted anything else you really, really had to dig. Ready D In our b-boy crew we had one kid, one white kid. And we got lucky because he had to sign up for the conscription campaign, which means that young white boys have to go and fight on the borders. They had to go out do their patrol in the townships. They just had to do these things under the previous government’s law and so forth. And with him being involved with hip-hop, I think he was probably one of a very, very few white kids who actually had the guts to go out into the townships at that point in time. And there were certain times that the cops would actually stop us and they’d interrogate us about this white kid walking with us in the townships, especially at night because we did a lot of shows at nightclubs up in Mitchell’s Plain. And what they did make us do was actually b-boy there on the ground. And his specialty was doing the kneespin. And they actually made him do a kneespin on the tar road until his knees bled. [laughs] And those are the things that the cops made us do if they would catch us out on the streets at night. And all we were doing was just coming home from the club, walking home. Obviously, at that time we didn’t have transportation or anything. And this kid decided he didn’t want to be in South Africa no more because things were building up and so forth. We were amongst a few fortunate kids who had somebody like this in our crew who travelled abroad because his parents were originally from the UK and he used to send us a lot of the music and the tapes at that point in time. And if one tape landed in our hands, the whole other Cape Flats will have that one tape, it would get duplicated and that’s sort of how the music spread. Later there was another DJ called Resano who was amongst the first two hip-hop DJs who would dash the crowd in the clubs and spin the discs. And this kid A-Ski as well. He used to send us a lot of the vinyls. And also at the venues some other kids, whose families went into exile abroad as well. And that’s how a lot of music crept in. Otherwise in the previous system, you would never ever in your whole life be able to get hold of a Public Enemy record. When “Rapper’s Delight” came through, that was cool. It was sort of the anthem of so-called young colored men because they could not get a lot of work in the cities before to work for the big international companies. And they used to travel abroad on these ships and this is how these kids brought in the music as well. So the music sort of found little gaps and little places to come in. And obviously, a lot of stuff was sent through as gifts. And it was sent to other addresses, it was not sent directly to a Mitchell’s Plain address or nothing. It was sent to some white person’s address. This guy Alan, his family and we just go and pick up the gifts or pick up the music on that side. And that’s how the tapes started circulating around the townships. Shaheen Ariefdien Yeah and also people had pen pals. I don’t know if you guys are familiar with Word Up! magazine, a little old crappy so-called hip-hop magazine. They had a pen pal section and kids just wrote to them from Germany or New York or whatever. And kids would write to them, “Send us shit, send us shit! Any shit!” So that was the great thing back then because we listened to hip-hop from the UK in the early ’80s, from Miami. So everything from the early, early MC Shy D, 2 Live Crew to Sir Mix-A-Lot to everything we could get hold of from the East Coast, West Coast. We didn’t really give a fuck where it was from. One of the favorite groups at that time was a British crew called Hijack. They just had two wicked, wicked DJs. You know, like crazy. And for us – because we were so isolated – “East Coast / West Coast shit, what is that?” – it doesn’t make sense. If it’s good, it’s good. Looking back, that was really what created a vibe. That you had people from different backgrounds, different musical tastes coming together. And the hip-hop heads, because you didn’t hear it on radio, everyone dissed it. It wasn’t on television, it was given absolutely no respect because it was kind of the poor man’s music. My father and his partner at that time, they had a little eight track recording studio. An R8 Fostex machine, a little grey thing. It’s a small machine but it’s a really nice machine. At that time it was a S-10 sampler. You could only find Roland equipment in the country at that time because of the cultural boycott and so on. So they made a lot of fucking money off musicians. And the S-10 sampler was a four-second sampler with four banks. And you really can’t sample any loops into that with like one second. So what we used to do – because he had a turntable at the time that had 78 [RPM]. So if you wanted a piece of a loop you would just sample it, like for this one second, 78 wrrrt, you know? Catch the thing and then play it like right at the end [of the keyboard]. So if you play it at C4 it will be like trrrr because of 78. If you slow it down it actually would [human beatboxing a hip-hop beat], you know? And then cut it up from the kick and the snare, really crappy sound. But that’s what we really wanted. So the very first thing I could remember recording one song live with just samples and cutting. What was that thing called on Wu Style? We took the James Brown sound that was like [imitates the Moog intro of Fred Wesley & the JB’s “Blow Your Head”] the Public Enemy sample and just looped a little piece of that. So you had four seconds, right? You had a drum loop, that bass sound, a guitar riff from some old South African record, a conga-type jive thing and a horn sound. And all we did was press record and played the thing live. Because we weren’t shown how to sequence this thing, you know? There was no one really around at that time to guide us with hip-hop. Audience Member What was the name of your crew? Ready D The first crew that we set up was known as the City Kids. It was the b-boy crew that later on became known as the Ballistic Rockers because of the song by this group called Newcleus called “The Wikky Wikky Song (Jam On It).” And somewhere in the break, this little funny voices said, “The beat goes on with the ballistic funk,” and that’s why we came up with the name. “Oh Ballistic, that sounds unusual, it sounds cool, it sounds different.” So we used that name as Ballistic Rockers. And the weird thing is, we were b-boying and doing our thing and about a year later we only heard that this whole thing we are doing out here’s going to become known as hip-hop or b-boying and the music as well. Just for some instinctive reason, we felt the style of dance fitted with the style of music because both were completely unusual. And the first time that we have actually seen all the elements of hip-hop together was in Malcolm McLaren’s video called “Buffalo Gals.” You had the Rocksteady Crew and the World’s Famous Supreme Team DJs scratching on the decks and all that. And we could relate to turntables because of our whole environment. We grew up with music and all those sort of things but for us, we thought this is a new form of gymnastics done to music. And also because we’ve been influenced by kung-fu movies and all those things and we were always that type of kids, doing flic-flacs and doing all the crazy stuff. For us it was cool, it was natural and also the characters in those videos, you could immediately identify with them. And after the Ballistic Rockers we eventually became known as the Prophets of da City. Shaheen Ariefdien Part of the reason was to not only utilize the typical hip-hop sounds, which were funk records and jazz records and dance records, whatever. But also to track down South African music and African music in general to see how we could play around with that. Audience Member What were your, I guess I could say, pipe dream of getting signed or putting something out at that time? What were your expectations when you were cutting your first record? Ready D Man, for me this mutual friend that Shaheen touched on earlier, I heard through him that he knows this guy. His dad got a recording studio and I thought, “Damn, this is my meal ticket.” I got to get hold of this guy because, you know, there was “Rappers Delight,” it was Kurtis Blow, it was all sort of these things. It was Run DMC and all those sort of things and my thing was: I wanted to get into the studio, make this record, I wanted to be rich and famous immediately. I wanted to be on the stage and go, “Everybody say hooo! All the ladies shake your ass!” – that sort of stuff. And then I hooked up with Shaheen. We are going to sort of back draft now, this is before Public Enemy, about a year or two before Public Enemy, am I correct? This is before Public Enemy, X-Clan, when hip-hop met with the black consciousness movement. So that was my pipe dream. We eventually hooked up, I spoke to Shaheen, he was like, “Cool, let me take this shit to my father, play it to him.” I don’t know what happened there but they came back and agreed, “Now it’s cool, we gonna put you in the studio, you do the record and this and that.” And hooking up with Shaheen, he was the one that was very, very hardcore LL Cool J-inspired battle MC in the Bass club. And we decided, “Your lyrics is dope, you are part of the crew.” And then getting into the studio, my bubble bursts right there because Shaheen was talking some other shit that I wasn’t down with at all. He was like up on some political shit because he was an activist in school. For me, I wasn’t interested in politics, I wanted people to go, “Hooo,” and he was, “No, no. Fuck the government,” and all this shit. I was “hooo” and I go, “Why fuck the government, what’s going on?” Things are cool up in Mitchell’s Plain. We had house parties every weekend. I am there DJing at all these house parties and the girls and all that stuff. All that made sense for me. And he is like, “No, no. There is a rally coming on and this and that’s happening.” And I am like, “No, no, no. Wait, wait, you know? I don’t understand this whole politics thing and this [Nelson] Mandela cat that you are talking about. I don’t give a fuck about this Mandela guy. I don’t know this guy. He doesn’t love you.” I didn’t see him before because being on school and all that, we weren’t taught these things. And for some very weird reason, we ended up with our very first gig. Then it was myself and Shaheen out there. I think it was an anti-drugs rally, set up at the Muslim community in Cape Town. Shaheen Ariefdien Was it the first one? In conscription campaign! Ready D In conscription campaign, yeah. This organization set up this gig in Protis, to sort of voice opinion about how unhappy they were about sending kids to the army and so on. So I mean, ironically, this became our first gig and we wrote the song called “Fuck the Government” and I am up on the stage with Shaheen, still not understanding what I am saying because I still needed to make the girls go “hooo” and all that sort of stuff. And then the second gig came and that was the anti-drugs gig. So with all these events with a conscious nature attached to them – and at the same time we were sitting in the recording studio, and I think it dragged about a year and a half before we actually released the record – and then Public Enemy came along. And that’s what really kicked me, basically kicked me in my glory left, right and center because now I love Public Enemy. I needed to understand what these guys were saying. And at the same time listening to while being educated as well. And you know, just time went on and Prophets of da City would touch on some of that. We were forced to educate ourselves outside the school boundaries about truly what was happening on the political arena. Because at that time I didn’t understand why the cops are smacking me up and down just walking up the street. “Eight o’clock. Why are you not in the house? Why are you walking here?” Buff baff. They kick you in your chops. Back home and you ask yourself why. I am just going to listen to a new hip-hop record. And we were sitting there all night and analyzing the music, that’s all we were into at that time. With Prophets of da City we recorded three albums up until the point where we actually went into the first democratic election and this album [shows the CD] called The Age Of Truth is our third album, which started causing a lot of trouble for us in the country and also in the Western Cape. The other thing that you guys will pick up as well is also the heavy Public Enemy influence as well because we were really inspired by the Bomb... Shaheen Ariefdien Ready D The Bomb Squad with these layered productions, just with a whole lot of different sounds. They just used to kill with a lot of other sounds. So obviously, we were heavily influenced by that and taking it and putting it into sort of our own context. (music: Prophets of da City – “United We Stand”) Shaheen Ariefdien The intro of two tracks have got these vocal samples of Nelson Mandela. At that time that was an absolute “No, fucking no!” His slogans at that time were very, very popular with the student movement and the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, like, “An injury to one is an injury to all, united we stand, divided we fall,” it was a chant underneath. So from the get go, when you play the album, there was an indication of what you can expect. The second thing, so you have the slow vibe is, we sampled marimba sounds and programmed it in a hip-hoppy type of way. (music: Prophets of da City – “Divided We Fall”) That worked well for the live show, because the b-boys at the time were incorporating things like gumboot dancing, pantsula, other South African forms of dance. Which for colored kids at that time – because we were taught to not embrace our African roots – also caused a whole lot of shit inside of South Africa. Ready D This is a song called “African, Very African” and what happened at this time, this song wasn’t intended to be on the album. But at that time we were sitting in the recording studio and that was the day that Chris Hani was assassinated and... Shaheen Ariefdien He was a member of the ANC but also the Communist party and they needed to get his ass out of the way somehow because he made a statement that the success of South Africa, this new South Africa, will be determined on how the people on the margins, the extremely poor, how they will be incorporated into South Africa and not have to suffer again. That just meant a lot of shit to a lot of people. Like, “What did he mean by that?” And so he was assassinated for that and it was on this day where we were just programmed something and just put something together in the studio at the time. (music: Prophets of da City – “African, Very African”) Ready D At that time in the Cape Flats, in the world of segregation, being black and colored and all this and that, hip-hop was really a very, very strong force. So it broke down and stripped down the whole color issue. People didn’t see color at that time. It was all about skills at that point in time because we were all into b-boying and b-girling. So it was cool when people would see you come through your area with your tracksuit and your cap and your sneakers, they knew you were cool. They wanted these guys that were doing this dance on your heads, you know? So you didn’t encounter a lot of trouble and people just wanted to see you dance. Because at that time it came through it was very, very exciting for people because of the visual appeal as well. And also just, I think, the music blew people away as well. Because at that time, we were only influenced by like Euro pop music predominantly and by what came in from the States. Because growing up in this colored areas and also if you look at the history, and what Shaheen mentioned about advantages and disadvantages and so forth, obviously our parents and some people in our families had jobs so they could afford to buy a hi-fi system or whatever. And also the music that used to heat that community or stuff like reggae, funk, soul, jazz, blues and also traditional type of music known as cape minstrel music, or people wanted to call it “coon carnival music.” And what was going on in the sort of like black areas or like black parts of the township, they were into totally different style of music. You know, the more traditional gospel, mbaqanga music and just different sounds. That would lead us on the way to kwaito music. And the one song that really made a huge impression and impact on the scene was a song called “Planet Rock” by Afrika Bambaataa. And we know, just in terms of modern electronic music, that song lead on quite a huge history, just for music in general. And the next song we want to play is a tribute that we did to Afrika Bambaataa and also to “Planet Rock.” At that time he was saying stuff that we could feel and identify with. We just found that it was very important to do this track. And with this track we sampled “Planet Rock.” We called it “Planet Cape Town” and we also put a lot of African elements in it. Just a way to demonstrate to the people, we are trying to express ourselves in the way that we know best and also we are proud of our music, our heritage and everything else. Because at that time we were taught to hate everything that was African. So this was just another form of rebellion as well. And also just to sort of push the DJ to the forefront as well. So this is a combination of all these elements, “Planet Cape Town.” (music: Prophets of da City – “Planet Cape Town”) Shaheen Ariefdien This here is “Wild Stylz,” inspired by the movie Wild Style, the hip-hop movie that also played a really important role in our life as well. It’s kind of a getting to understand the vibe of the culture. It’s coming. (music: Prophets of da City – “Wild Stylz”) Audience Member You were like the first battle DJ out of South Africa. Could you please tell us what year you were in the DMC? Ready D Yeah, I competed in the DMC twice in... Gosh, I think it was ’98-’99 if my memory serves me correct. One in France and one out in New York, that was only two times that I went abroad for that. But previously the battles that used to take place, I would say to a certain extent, I was more this kid that was out there in his room, scratching and playing for his friends. And what happened is, when we used to buy records in the stores, all the big name club DJs were always out there. They were the guys that had the money, they bought the records and everything. And these were the guys that were laughing at us kids buying this hip-hop music because they used to diss us for buying this music. All the DJs used to rush to buy the latest house records and we were out there, looking for “Planet Rock,” looking for this and that or whatever, you know? Because we had a couple of independent stores that came up, that started servicing all these guys and a lot of stuff that hit the Billboard charts obviously came through. And we were the guys that used to order that underground hip-hop music at that time. And for me, one of the reasons for going out into the clubs and battling against these DJs were all personal reasons as well. “Fuck you! You got the club. You are in the club, you got money, you got gigs, you got girls.” [laughter] And me with my Lenco turntable, you know, practicing on an amplifier. My mixer used to be a big round knob on the amplifier and that’s how I used to practice in the beginning. It was a turntable in a wooden case. Shaheen Ariefdien Balance was with coins all over, so the shit don’t jump. Because when we press here, the thing jumps up on the other side. Ready D The needles were jumping as well. It was in this wooden box and springs and we had to stick like wooden wedges right around the turntable to prevent it from moving around. So it was that sort of scene, you know? And also I think I only owned about four or five records at that time, that I could say was mine that I bought out of my own pocket besides being borrowed, you know, from this other kid, DJ A-Ski. The white kid we were talking about that was in the crew back then. And obviously, he wouldn’t let me enter competition using his records because he was crazy at the time. I might just mess up his records, so that was the only records I used in quite a few competitions. And for some reason I own two copies of “Al-Naafiysh the Soul” and up until today I still use that same song, mixing and scratching as well.

Title: Mtume

Mtume
James Mtume’s discography is as peerless as it gets. From crafting iconic LPs with Miles Davis, to sought-after spiritual jazz, Mtume’s jazz chops are undeniable. But it was Mtume’s transition from jazz pioneer to R&B master, in his own group Mtume, that really set him apart from his peers. Mtume straddled these two worlds with ease, putting some consciousness into the club, and turning the sex appeal sanctified. Teaming up with Reggie Lucas, the duo were an unstoppable force through the ’80s, penning such hits as Stephanie Mills’ Grammy-winning “Never Knew Love Like This Before” and Roberta Flack’s “The Closer I Get to You.” There’s a reason Mtume the band has been sampled countless times: Mtume has consistently lit the way for future generations, on how to do it legit.
In this lecture at the Red Bull Music Academy Tokyo 2014, Mtume opens up about his history, sampling and the fluidity of art.
Hosted by Jeff “Chairman” Mao All right. Welcome to the lecture today. We’re very excited to have our guest. He’s worn many hats over his very storied career, be it as a musician, band leader, producer, songwriter, composer and activist. Won’t you please welcome Mr. James Mtume. Mtume [applause] Thank you very much. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Thanks so much for being here today. Mtume Thank you for inviting me. I mean, this is really a pleasure and an honor to be able to address the participants, and it’s good to see you again. Jeff “Chairman” Mao It’s great to see you as well. I mentioned you’ve worn many hats over your career. I wonder if you, of all those different roles, do you view yourself as any one more so than the others? Mtume No, no, no. Actually, I don’t. That’s a great question. If you’d have asked me which one did I get the most out of, or felt the most joy from, it would be composing for television and film because you’re alone, you’re in the basement and you’ve got to create the backdrop of a scene. The trick in scoring is to never let the music get in the way of a dialogue, so it becomes more of a wallpaper, or, in that case, sound paper. When I had the opportunity to do an urban show called New York Undercover, to compose for that gave me great joy because it was a chance for me to put an urban sound on television that had never been done like that. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You had done film scoring as well for motion pictures? Mtume Yes, yes, sir. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Well, I want to sort of play one track, sort of, not randomly, but picked from within your career just to sort of reset our ears as we settle into this. Some of you may be familiar with this, but from the band which bears your name – Mtume Which band? Jeff “Chairman” Mao The band that bears your name. Mtume. Mtume Okay. [laughs] I’ve been in a few. Jeff “Chairman” Mao This one was a favorite of a DJ some of you guys might have heard of named Larry Levan and it goes like this. (music: Mtume – “So You Wanna Be a Star” / applause) Jeff “Chairman” Mao Okay. So what was that we just listened to, a little piece of? Mtume Wow. You took me back with that. I think that was the second Mtume band album. I can’t mention that band or that track without giving homage to who I feel is one of the great, great female voices in music, Tawatha Agee, who’s our lead singer. I was part dealing with a transition. I’ve had several transitions. I started out with avant garde jazz if you listen to my first couple of albums. It was all acoustic avant garde. Then with my five-year stint with Miles Davis, we were doing exploratory improvisational funk electronically. This album... The club scene was happening big in New York and that was kind of paying a little homage to that before I had moved on to “Juicy Fruit” and the other stuff. That was also probably the last project I did using big arrangements, strings and horns. Because after that, I went into more of a neo-minimalist approach. Less was more, maybe using – how do you take three or four instruments and make them sound like ten? Jeff “Chairman” Mao You mentioned big orchestration and bigger arrangements. Mtume Yes, sir. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What’s involved with something like this? I mean, you have the Mtume band – Mtume Yes. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Which is, how many pieces is the band at this point? Mtume Which incarnation? At that incarnation? Jeff “Chairman” Mao At this incarnation, yeah. Mtume It was, I think, seven of us. I think seven of us. Jeff “Chairman” Mao That’s already a decent number. Mtume Yeah. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Then on top of that, you have brass – Mtume Yeah, because what I was doing then, those Mtume albums, like I said, those first couple of albums, they were done in between all these other projects my partner Reggie Lucas and I were doing. I was doing Stephanie Mills, “Whatcha Gonna Do,“ Phyllis Hyman, Lou Rawls, The Spinners. If we had six weeks, I’d say, “Okay, let’s do an Mtume album.” This was my last album like that, because after that I said I would do no more production. It was one day I actually sat down to play. I had a project and tears came to my eyes. I didn’t understand what it was. This is important for a lot of you guys who are writers. I realized what I was playing sounded like everything else I had done. Emotionally, I didn’t know how to cope with that. Then it hit me. They talk about writer’s block. I had writer’s blockade. It was like, when everything starts to sound like the last thing you did, it’s time to move on or move out. That was the last album I did with that musical frame of reference, horns and strings, much more sounding like something else. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Right. That was a very successful sound for you as a producer. Mtume That was the reason why we were still doing it. Eight or nine gold and platinum albums. A Grammy. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Let’s go back a little ways. You are from a musical family. Where did you grow up and can you describe your musical environment coming up? Mtume Yes. I was born and raised in South Philadelphia. My biological father is Jimmy Heath from the Heath Brothers, the famous jazz Percy and Tootie Heath. The father that raised me was James “Hen Gates” Forman, who was also a very famous, in the Philadelphia area, pianist. He was a jazz pianist. At nine and ten years old, I’m at the house, quite often, maybe at dinner, there’s Dizzy Gillespie, there’s Thelonious Monk, there’s John Coltrane. Now, I’m not going to sit here and lie to y’all, like I knew how deep that was [laughs]. Like, shit, I’m nine! But I did know there was something very, very special. Lalo Schifrin would come by a lot. Sonny Stitt would stay at the house when he was working in Philly. I had a chance to be around that. I always say my front ground is jazz. It’s not background, it’s front ground. Out of that, I moved into other forms and variations in music. I grew up in jazz. I was going to the clubs at fourteen. Putting a little mascara, you know. I couldn’t get no drinks, but I was sneaking in. This is true talk. This is Red Bull, right? I also grew up with R&B. As we talked before, I’m listening to Marvin Gaye and maybe that weekend I’m going to hear Yusef Lateef at Pep’s. I grew up with both. The first time I realized my musical tastes were a little different than the rest of the kids? I remember I was in sixth grade and everybody had to bring two records. I brought Frankie Lymon, “Why Do Fools Fall In Love,” and then I brought Miles Davis. The kids, everybody, was really getting off with Frankie Lymon. When they put Miles on, it was like Dr. Death had come in the room [laughter]. Then it was that I realized jazz was an acquired taste and I was very fortunate to have been born in that environment. It’s almost like having both worlds to draw from. Jeff “Chairman” Mao When did you start playing yourself? Mtume Like I said, my dad, Hen Gates, was a jazz pianist. Now, remember, at that time, McCoy Tyner was coming around the house, taking lessons from my old man. Lee Morgan, I remember Lee Morgan very well. The piano was always there. I just naturally started playing and I found out I could basically play anything I heard. Not anything, of course. I wasn’t dealing with Beethoven [laughs]. But basically, I could figure out chords. I had an ear, and I just started playing around the house. My mother was also a big inspiration. She was very much into the jazz singers, Lady Day. She could actually sing very well. Dinah Washington was my sister’s godmother and we would go a couple of weeks each summer and stay up at her crib. There was always music around. I started playing like that. Then my uncle, Kuumba, Tootie Heath, bought me a conga and that opened me up for the percussion. The piano, playing the piano and also playing percussion... Harmony and rhythm was the same thing to me. Jeff “Chairman” Mao They’re actually quite similar in a lot of ways. Mtume Yeah. Piano is a percussive instrument. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Now you left Philadelphia. Not to pursue music, though. Mtume No [laughs]. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What were you doing? Mtume I had this horrible revelation my father introduced me to. When I was growing up, I just knew... The greatest basketball player back then was a guy named Elgin Baylor. He was the forerunner to Miles and MJ and Dr. J. I just knew there was no way I wasn’t going to get a basketball scholarship. Then one day, I was down in the basement, in my sanctuary practicing, and he said, “You know, man, you ain’t gon’ be tall.” It was like, “Oh, shit!” [laughs] You’re going to have to figure out how you’re going to go to college. I was a swimmer, actually. I got to college on a swimming scholarship. As of now, there’s not many black swimmers, so imagine what there was back then if you’re talking about early ’60s. I had those experiences of going to a swimming meet and when I walked in, watching all of the umpires run into a corner to decide if I could get in the water. I remember a meet that some guys were throwing matches, fire, on me. You develop a backbone. So, I had a political consciousness. Plus, my parents were very much involved in the Civil Rights Movement. I ended up going to California on a swimming scholarship and ended up dealing with the black activism during the sixties. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Where did you wind up going to school? Mtume Pasadena City College. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Okay. Near Los Angeles. Now what was going on in Los Angeles as far as activism at that time? Mtume Well, if you remember, I went out in ‘66, summer of ‘66. For anybody trying to figure it out, I’m 67, so some of this stuff goes way back before a lot of y’all were even thought about. The Watts Revolt had happened. You have to understand. In the country at that time, it was activism all across the board. You had the young white students who were dealing with the war. You had the Black Panthers. I was with an organization called US organization, that was a cultural organization. We created something called Kwanzaa, that’s still celebrated today. There was a different temperature in the country, and we were all pretty much coming out of a college movement. Obviously, I migrated to that and then one thing fell apart. The organization fell apart and then I was asked to come back to Newark, New Jersey by a gentleman named, a dear friend of mine who just passed, Imamu Baraka. He asked me to come back to help on the Ken Gibson campaign, which was the first black mayor elected on the east coast, so I came back for that. Then I met this guy named Miles Davis and the rest was [laughs], it was over. It was about the music. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Right, but you did get into the music and work on the music previous to joining Miles as well. Mtume Oh, yes. Yes. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Just to give people an idea where your music was at that point, you were still playing piano or percussion at that point? Mtume Yeah, both. I always played both. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Right. Let’s hear a little something from an album that you worked on. (music: Herbie Hancock – “Bunia” / applause) Jeff “Chairman” Mao OK. That’s kind of a family project, correct? Mtume Yes. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Alright. Mtume That was Herbie Hancock on piano, my uncle, Tootie Kuumba on drums, Buster Williams on bass. Don Cherry was on trumpet and Jimmy Heath was on sax. The song was called, “Kamili.” I wrote that for my wife. That was my uncle’s album, but he called me and he knew I’d been writing and he gave me my first shot. It almost tears me up to think that he had that much faith. He said, “I want you to write all the music.” Jeff “Chairman” Mao Right. Mtume I said, “But it’s not my album.” He said, “Yeah, but it’s going to be your music.” That’s the way it kicked off. Being in there, showing Herbie Hancock, “Here’s the chords.” [laughs] That was a great experience. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Now, when did you become known professionally? I guess beyond professionally, as Mtume? Mtume I purposely never wanted the connection with the the Heath name, not because I had a problem with my bloodline. It was that I always had this thing about siblings or children who were born where one of the parents is famous in one field or another. I didn’t walk in anybody’s shoes, I wanted my own sandals. I usually kept that out, even when I signed with Epic. They were like, “This is great for the PR.” I said, “No, no. I want people to know me for what I accomplish. Then they can make the connection.” But I would say it started getting known when I went back to New York. This is a really interesting story. I don’t think I’ve ever said this publicly. Every young musician fantasizes about who they wanted to play with. This is the honest truth. I had three names I wanted to play with and it was in this order. First was McCoy Tyner, second was Freddie Hubbard, third was Miles Davis. None of whom I’d even met. I get to New York, two weeks as I’m in New York I get a call. McCoy Tyner was getting ready to record next week and he wanted to know if you can do the album. Number one, that was number on the list. Number two, Freddie Hubbard calls. I work with him and while I was working with Freddie Hubbard at a place called the Vanguard in New York, Miles Davis came to hear me. I didn’t see him, but he sat in the corner and everybody told me he was there. Two weeks after that I got a call. Miles Davis. He said, “Man, what are you doing for the next nine months.” He said, “We’re getting ready to go to Europe.” I said, “I’m down.” I guess it was around that time. Jeff “Chairman” Mao With Herbie Hancock – this is kind of as a side note, out of curiosity. He had the Mwandishi group. Was it true that you gave the names to all the players in that group? Mtume Yeah. Herbie and the group were very interested in culture and Swahili. Every time they came to town I would go hear them, then one day I just gave them the names. They wanted names to translate for the group. Mwandishi was his name, it means the writer. Jeff “Chairman” Mao All the other players had their names as well. Okay, back to Miles. Miles says, “Come join me in the group.” What was your first impression of Miles? Mtume Shit, I mean... Miles and I had a very, very, very, very close relationship. As a matter of fact, in his autobiography he talks about how he loved me like a son. We would talk because we’re both insomniacs. I don’t go to sleep until 3 or 4 in the morning, even now. We would talk music, we would talk about concepts. I would call that my introduction to zen. Learning what you don’t play sometimes is more important that what you play. Sometimes leave something out, don’t finish the statement. Like I said, “There’s no such thing as a mistake if you learn something.” OK? These lessons ... You know silence is sound because it’s air. You know what I mean? You learn that and you apply that to understanding melody. You begin to understand, “Okay out of these ten notes I could use, what’s the two that implies the other eight?” It’s the appreciation for abbreviation. Most people musically they talk in paragraphs. Learn how to talk in quotations. Take your music and reduce it to its highest goal. It’s like people who talk too much. You know what I mean? It’s just too many notes. Why? At a certain point I can’t digest all that anyway. What’s the ones that really matter, especially to song writers. The secret to songs is melody. Everything else is under that. At the end of the day, that’s the tip of your iceberg. You got too many notes, if I can’t hum your song, it ain’t a hit. Everything is a nursery rhyme at the end of the day. But you got to make it your nursery rhyme. Jeff “Chairman” Mao How would you describe the music you guys were making in the Miles Davis group at that time? Mtume Improvisational funk, using electronics in a way that it had never been used. I joined the band in ’71, we recorded an album in ’72 that really set the stage for a whole new musical movement. But the critics who were too arrogant to ask what we were doing decided to write about something they didn’t even know, they didn’t even have a vocabulary. I always say it’s like inviting Kool-Aid drinkers to a wine tasting contest. They didn’t even have the palate. But they were writing about it. I just appreciate YouTube. My son and I were talking about this on the way over. That’s my son Fa and my granddaughter, Aya, right here, she’s eleven. [applause] She’s also our security guard. [laughs] Taking this very complex musical idea and pushing the music, pressing the boundaries. To me that’s always what it was about, pressing the boundaries. That’s one thing I find, I’m not going to say boring about a lot of contemporary music but certainly repetitious. People are scared to take chances. You don’t move music by standing still. You got to move music by believing in what you’re doing and not being afraid of criticism and trying something. There’s an old African proverb that says, “To stumble is not to fall. It’s really just to move forward faster.” Some of you all will get that later, but you understand. You don’t really fall, you stumble but that’s pushing it, there’s not enough push. That’s why I’m so happy to see what you guys are doing here. This is very important. You have an opportunity to really hone your craft and share it with other people who are on the same creative level. That’s very important. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Let’s take a look at you and Miles Davis and some of the rest of the band in Tokyo. (video: Miles Davis Live in Tokyo / applause) Jeff “Chairman” Mao You used to come to Japan every year? Mtume Yes. I think the first trip I came to Japan was with Miles, I think in ’72, no later than ’73. Then I’ve been back and forth several times, Sonny Rollins, Roberta Flack, my own band. But that man, just to see that, that’s a lot of memories man. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What’s the most Miles Davis thing that you recall about Miles Davis and working with him? What were rehearsals like? I mean, you know. Mtume No, no, no, no, no. No rehearsals. [laughs] There was a reason, the reason I responded like that. I was like one of the young guns. I’m one of those guys, “Man, we got to rehearse. We got to rehearse.” He pulled me to the side... I mean when I say no rehearsal, I think maybe during that entire five years, maybe we rehearsed three times. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Three times? Mtume Yeah, maybe. Miles pulled me to the side and said, “Look.” I mean he used much harsher language, but it was in a very fatherly way. He said, “Look,” he said, “Man, I pay you to rehearse on stage.” It took me a minute to understand that. He said, “I don’t want to ever overcook the meal.” I had to think about that, and then I understood what he was saying. Every night I want this to be an adventure. He said, “Because if you start rehearsing this ...” Now this is for what we were doing, because every night you don’t know where you’re going. Your musical antenna always had to be really sharp. But he wanted an adventure every night. You start rehearing, you start finding yourself playing certain patterns that you know work. It’s like a signer who can sign high notes. “Okay, I’m going to get them right here.” And everybody goes, “Oh.” You know? You don’t want preconditioned thoughts in your head. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Was that the same with the recording process as well? Mtume Yeah. You never knew when you were going to record. He didn’t like to let you know. You get a call the day before the recording. I remember we came in one session and he had some music written out and then he had it in colors. B flat minus seven and that’s in blue, C sharp and that’s in yellow and orange. You know you’re with somebody who’s really there. You don’t really want to feel square and ask. If I’m here, then he obviously thinks we’re hip enough. So we kind of figured those colors represented feelings. What is blue to you? That would determine the inversion of the cord or rhythmically how would you interpret red?
Like I said zen stuff, man. I tell you one experience that was one of the most overwhelming experiences I’ve ever had. We were playing in Lebanon, and it was during the time the Israeli and the Lebanese were having physical struggles. I mean it was war. When we played, the President’s son came to hear us. We’re surrounded by about 100 [or] 200 soldiers, machine guns and everything because you know. You know that took the music somewhere. After we finished we’re in the dressing room, it was like a tent, and all of a sudden we hear this [imitates people speaking quickly] and all these guns cocking. I’m like, “What? We going to get it here like this?” And this Arab cat runs through, he breaks through and he falls at Miles’ feet, Miles is sitting in the chair and he starts crying. This is the honest truth, he says, “Now I can die.” He said, “Man, I never thought I’d live to see you.” He said, “Your music saved my life. I was going through some difficult periods and your music ...” You know we all trying to be hard, but everybody started to get that little water, you know? Then I looked at Miles and he teared up. It was showing me that you never know who your music’s touching and you never know the effect your having on people. To hear somebody fall at somebody’s feet and say that, it made me respect what we were doing and what all musicians do even more. Because it was a direct connection with how music affects people. I didn’t mean to get that... It was an overwhelming experience. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I can’t imagine. Now there was also a lot of, not just running through a take from start to finish with Miles, it was editing. Is that something that you were aware was going on at the time when you’re there? Taking all these different pieces and putting them together to make it something new? Mtume I was aware but I was not aware to the extent that that was being done by the producer, Teo Macero, who himself was a great saxophone player. Then I found out that they were doing things like, back then we’re talking about ’72 [or]’73, Miles would take Teo some cassette tapes and that would be edited into some of those songs. If your listening to On the Corner, some of those are a combination of four takes, and you never hear any difference. It’s seamless, it’s seamless transition. But he was a genius in taking things and migrating them into other things, just pieces here and there. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Right. I just want to play a little piece of something just because it’s so different from the stuff that came immediately after from the Miles Davis group. Just a little piece of this. (music: Miles Davis – “Rated X”) Jeff “Chairman” Mao Now you’re laughing a little bit when we’re playing this, what’s going through your mind? Mtume Man, I’m flashing I mean... We didn’t get to the crazy part. [laughs] First of all there was so many things that we were mixing into that broth. You know, I guess, Miles had bitches brew and we were the broth. We were all big fans of P-Funk, James also Stockhausen, [John] Cage, Stravinsky. That’s Miles playing those cords. Jeff “Chairman” Mao There’s no trumpet on this track? Mtume No, no trumpet. Matter of fact, we talked about that and he said he just got into the rhythm and we were just all hitting it. He said really was no room for the trumpet. That was another thing about Miles, he never forced anything. Now what lead horn player do you know wouldn’t play on a track? Yeah, it was always about surrender to what the music required. A lot of that, like I said, is funk. He’s got all his dissonance and a lot of that is Stockhausen, yeah that influence. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Now in the band with Miles is a guitarist by the name of Reggie Lucas? Mtume Right my partner when we started out, yeah. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What happened, how did the Miles band come to an end and what did that the Dudley Two? Mtume As most things, like marriage, it came to an end, you know. What story you want to pick? It’s like... We were on tour with Herbie Hancock who had his big record – Jeff “Chairman” Mao Head Hunters. Mtume Head Hunters. Right, thank you. Miles got sick, and we only did two concerts, two shows, together. At that time, nobody was clear about when he was going to come back and it ended up being what, five years? I think we all made the right decision. [laughs] Reggie and I had been experimenting with writing. Pete Cosey was the other guitarist and Michael Henderson pursued huge success in R&B. Al Foster was the drummer, Dave Liebman was the sax player, extraordinary saxophonist. We started writing, and I joined Roberta Flack. Roberta had been calling, she was a big fan of Miles and she also appreciated my playing very much. I was confronted with two offers and I had to make a decision, Weather Report and Roberta. I said well, “Weather Report came from where I came from.” I said, “I want to do something different.” I decided to go with Roberta. It was the best decision. While I’m with Roberta Flack she called me and said she needed a guitarist. At that time Reggie was living in Chicago. I said, “I know one,” so Reggie came and joined. To make a long story short we’re in the middle of recording this album called Blue Lights in the Basement. We took a dinner break. I was kind of bored anyway.Everybody left to go to dinner, I had been messing around with this melody so I told Reggie to stay and I sat down at the piano so I was like [imitates melody] It was something called, “The Closer I Get to You.” When everybody came back, I gave them their parts, and I just wanted to put it on a tape. So we were listening back, and Roberta comes back. She says, “What’s that.” I said, “The Closer I Get to You.” There was no such song, I just felt a moment, you know what I mean? She said, “Can I record it?” “Sure.” She said, “You got the lyrics?” I said, “I no, I left them at home.” I just did the thing. [laughs] When you feel, “Hey man, this might be a shot.” We recorded it I told her I could get the lyrics back to her in the morning. I wrote the lyrics in the back of the car on the way back to the house. Obviously, I wasn’t driving. [laughs] Jeff “Chairman” Mao That would have even be more impressive. Mtume I got it to her, and I suggested that she do a duet with Donny Hathaway. That hadn’t done anything in a long time. That record came out and we did about five million units. That’s when my writing career started in pop music. Jeff “Chairman” Mao It sounded a little like this. (music: Roberta Flack feat. Donny Hathaway – “The Closer I Get to You” / applause) Jeff “Chairman” Mao I want to know at any point did somebody say to you, “Okay I just heard you doing this other stuff, it’s a little bit different.” How did you get to doing this, what prepared you to be able to do this because it is so drastically different from what you were doing immediately before or more or less immediately before professionally? Mtume I’ve always been of the persuasion that art is like water and it takes the shape of whatever you pour it into. Musically, I don’t have any boundaries of what I pour it into. When I’m doing avant-garde acoustic music I’m there, you know what I mean. It’s also about the ability to be open to transition. I’ve always felt that most artist get locked into the quick sand of sameness. You understand, just doing the same thing. You’re not following... I’ve always followed what my ear was telling me.
I’ve never lied to the music and the music never lied to me. You just have to be open, I guess that’s the best way to explain it. Its interesting. Nobody’s ever asked me that, quite like that but that’s the truth. It’s just, this is where I’m at now and I never go back. I pretty much try to burn the bridges, so I don’t even have an opportunity to go back where I came from. If I cross that bridge, I burn it. Never give yourself a chance to look back. That’s always easier, looking forward is always harder. That’s a great question, I hope that answer is sufficient. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You and Reggie – Mtume It is drastic. Jeff “Chairman” Mao It’s drastic. It’s more drastic because of how we – Mtume You’re right, it’s drastic. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I mean you and Reggie become a production song writing team. What was the sound that you guys were going for together? Mtume Well, what had happened when we first hooked up... We started actually messing around writing when I was with Miles. I was doing more of lyrics and melody, Reggie was doing the music. When Reggie moved to Chicago that’s when I said, “Okay, ‘The Closer [I Get to You],’ is the first example, this is where I want to take it.” I’m doing the constructing where we going with the sound, the actual sound. What I wanted to do was develop a sound. Again, I come from the belief... Knowing who you are and having your own signature is the most important thing to do as an artist. Sounding like somebody is... You should be slapped in your face, okay. There’s the three stages I talk about, the creative sequence. The first stage is imitation. I don’t care who you are, where you come from, I don’t care if you’re a musician, poet, you a painter, sculptor. There’s somebody that you see and you say, “Damn I want to do it just like that.” You pretty much imitate, that’s your first guide. Then somewhere along there you develop, what I call a passage to emulation. What do I mean by that? You still have that other person, that is your main influence but you’re starting to find a little bit of yourself. If you’re fortunate enough you go to the third stage, innovation. That’s when you establish who you are. That’s the result of all those things that go through your funnel. I wanted to put a rhythm section together, that was created for the specific purposes of going after a sound. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What’s the key to maintaining a good partnership, musically, with somebody? Mtume Success. [laughs] It’s an old saying, success needs no explanation, failure can never be explained. You don’t stay with something so long if it’s a failure. If you rolling, you stay with it as long as it’s feeding you, and I don’t just mean economically. I mean it’s feeding. All partnerships usually end with, you’re no longer nourished by the music that you’re producing so you got to go out and go to the next level. Jeff “Chairman” Mao All right let’s just hear a little something, a little – Mtume We didn’t have a fallout. We had a grow out. Sometimes [extends his hands in opposite directions] you dig? Jeff “Chairman” Mao This is another thing from that era with you and Reggie Lucas. (music: Stephanie Mills – “What Cha Gonna Do With My Lovin’” / applause) Jeff “Chairman” Mao What’s your strategy with dealing with vocalists? Do you have a go to philosophy, that you adhere to that works, or is it a case-by-case basis? That’s Stephanie Mills by the way, I didn’t say who it was. “What Cha Gonna Do [With My Lovin’].” Mtume Well I think one of the keys that you need to establish, is what kind of voice you pull toward. Which one are you drawn... I’ve always been closer to the female voice. I feel that. An important thing to understand with a vocalist, don’t over produce the vocalist. Be a guide because a lot of times, a singer can get stuck, they don’t know where to go. Be there for that. But you got to know what you’re doing – you know what I mean – if you’re guiding somebody. But don’t get in the way of an artist. When an artist is free to do what they do best, that’s when you get the best performance. When you trying to [bring structure to] every line – no. The thing is here’s the line and sometimes you have to adjust. Maybe the melody you had in your head doesn’t work with that artist. You heard it perfectly when you’re doing it, but you not the recording artist. At the end of the day, to answer your question, what you go for: what feels right. Sometimes what you wrote is not going to work when you record it. I can’t tell you how many songs I thought were great, and then the next day you record it you say, “What, am I kidding?” You know, don’t get in the way of your artist be there to shape and direct where they’re going. A lot of times people, you know, they’re frustrated artists themselves. You know, “Say it like this.” No, it don’t work like that let them be free, let them be free. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What are your recollections of working with Donny Hathaway and Phyllis Hyman? Two supremely talented but obviously tortured, artists. Mtume It’s very interesting you bring that up. As a matter of fact, as soon as I get back to New York, there’s a cat from Holland who’s doing a documentary on Donny. He’s in New York right now, and I’m going to put my part on it. That’s very heavy for me because the last two songs Donny Hathaway ever sang were two songs that I did. “The Closer [I Get to You]” and another song called “Back Together Again.” As a matter of fact, that’s the night he died. I know he killed himself that night. We recorded his song and it was a Saturday night. He had a breakdown in the studio and as a result he couldn’t continue. I said, “It’s cool, Donny, we’ll finish it Monday.” About five o clock in the morning, which would have been Sunday morning, my phone was ringing. You know when it’s early like that, you know that’s weird. I picked it up, and it was someone crying and I said, “Who is this?” And she said, “This is Roberta.” She said, “Mtume, Donny’s dead.” It’s strange every time I hear “Back Together Again.” I’m both proud that he was such a great artist and that you had the opportunity to do a couple of his songs. Donny was troubled as was Phyllis Hymen. Donny didn’t leave a note. Phyllis did leave a note and a dear friend of mine, Kenny Gamble, Gamble and Huff, he called me. And when he had the note, he read it to me. She was really troubled with new artists coming along and she felt... I mean, if you can imagine this. She felt she was too old. And I’m like, “One of the greatest voices ever...” But people have their own insecurities. And she ultimately took her life while she was in the middle of a week of performances at the Apollo Theater with the Whispers. Jeff “Chairman” Mao But you have other recollections of working with Phyllis though. What kind of stands out? Mtume First of all, the voices. I always say everything’s about the voice. Phyllis had one of the most interesting tones for a female. She had a low register that just ran through you. I enjoyed it because she cussed like I did. She was a sailor. “F you.” I said, “Yeah, F you, too.” There’s a section on one of the songs, “You Know How to Love Me,” where she sings this long note and I had to do it over and over until it was right. So right after that she said, “F you.” I said, “Okay, cool.” So she strolls out. I say, “Let’s take a dinner break.”
So while she goes out, I have one of the cats go out and get a dozen roses, tie them around the microphone. She comes back. I say, “Okay, we ready?” She said, “Yes.” She walks out. I had the lights out in the recording [booth] where the microphone was. I put the lights on. She standing in front of the roses and she broke down crying. I mean, that’s the kind of sensitivity it was. I just loved her. I loved her, man. Phyllis was great. Mtume Is it tough to resolve these kind of conflicts in the studio? I mean, everybody here is working together in close proximity. Mtume Yeah. I’ve never had... [laughs] Thou speaketh too soon. [laughs] I had one bad experience. The studio is where you check your ego at the door. That means for the producers and the artists. And I had one bad ... I’m not even gonna mention the name because it’ll probably make me mad again. But he was a drag. Just one. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Alright. So that was the only unresolvable situation. But – Mtume I quit. I quit. Jeff “Chairman” Mao But hopefully everything is resolvable at some point. Mtume Oh, I know. That’s the happiest place in the world to be, in the studio. The one thing I never worked... If I’m working in the studio, I never allow guests. The artists’ guests or my personal guests. Anybody. They have to wait outside. Because if an artist is singing, she’s looking from that room looking into the control room and if you got these people sitting there, it turns into a performance. You see, you can’t help it. If I’m singing, it’s a performance because we made a connection. So you take that out, and everything is here. It’s like being under a microscope, and I’ve always felt you get the best performance when there’s no audience. We’re just in there, just me and the engineer. That’s how I’ve always worked. Everybody has their own way. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So then you mentioned a little bit earlier how Mtume, the band, formed. Can you, as a sort of a thing when the other sessions weren’t happening, what did you envision for the band Mtume that was different from what you were doing on these productions? Mtume Well like I said, the first two albums were just, “Hey, let’s do an album.” We had this deal. I had to fill it. I had to deliver an album. I didn’t take the band serious until, as I talked earlier, when I had that moment I had to confront. I was doing the same thing. And at that time, I decided I wouldn’t produce anybody else. I didn’t produce anybody. I said, “I’m gonna take a year, put another band together, find a studio.” Because the studio is the other musician. The studio is a sound. And an engineer... And I took off a year. I only worked in one room in New Jersey, a place called E.A.R.S. And that was the Juicy Fruit album. And I didn’t do anything else.
And that’s when I found out what my vision was for the band. I really didn’t have a vision. I had just a reason to fill a contract. But on that album, I said, “No. We’re going to do this, and I’m going to do it.” I didn’t think, “I’m going to change the direction.” But I said, “I’m gonna do something where it’s a new sound.” Again, like you said, not radical, but it was definitely a departure from everything else that was out there. So, I take the record to Epic. They’re into... “We can’t put this out.” I’m like, “Why?” They said, “It’s too slow.” Because they were dealing with beats per minute. I don’t know who came up with that madness. [laugher] Beats per minute? I said, “I write from my heart, not from my head.” And they said, “It’s too slow, but the other thing, it’s risque.” Now, you gotta take yourself back. This is 1983. That’s “Like a Virgin” now, with some of the stuff that’s on records now. But at that time, they didn’t want to put it out. So this is what they did. This was their negotiation with me. “Alright, okay, we’ll put it out since you’re insisting. But we’re not gonna release it for daytime play.” So it was only initially released for night, after 12 o’clock formats. After one week they were getting so many calls from around the country. They said in the report they kept getting was, it was probably the first record that anybody remembered where you knew the song by the beat. So obviously they did finally have to acquiesce to get in that money. It wasn’t like they loved it. They hated it. But money heals all things. [laughter] So obviously I become one of their favorite. But that was that story. So when I hear that line... Oh, also I got sued, I forgot, by Juicy Fruit gum, Wrigley’s. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Right, so what happened there? Mtume Keep this right here, don’t let that out of the room. So, I get called in, I have to take a deposition, right? So roll in, I forgot, some big, huge, humongous law firm in New York. And I go in. So I’m this black guy walking in amazed at one of the longest tables I’d ever seen, with all these elderly white guys sitting around, and I’m taking a deposition. So it finally gets down to, I knew ultimately it’s gonna come to this. “Well, Mr. Mtume, what do you mean by you can lick me everywhere?” So I knew I had them then. So I rolled back. Well I said, “Obviously it’s not about gum.” [laughter] I said, “It’s about oral sex.” And you should have seen the looks that came... I don’t think anybody in that room was under 70, you know what I mean? [laughs] But that’s the great story I have. I don’t think I’ve ever told it public. “What do you mean by you can lick?” I mean, what kind of question is that, first of all? [laughter] So that’s why I laughed, y’all.. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So how did the beat come to be, then? Mtume What happened, as I said earlier, I was working... we were just dedicated to this album. So we had finished one of the sessions. It was about two in the morning. Everybody left, but I had this thing in my head. So I sat down, and the LinnDrum had kind of just came out and it wasn’t really being used that much in R&B. So I just sat down. [mimicks the beat] And I said, “That feels interesting.” So I laid it. I didn’t quantize it. That’s why it’s slightly off. It has more of a human thing to it because sometimes when you quantize, to me, something being exact is not cool. Because the humanity is sucked out. So I recorded like that. I called everybody back to the studio. So the guys get back at about three in the morning. We laid the track. Tawatha was on tour with Roxy Music. She was in Europe. She had two days off, flew her back. We recorded... I’m writing the lyrics as she’s recording them. And got her back on a plane so she could meet Roxy Music and finish. And that’s how that went. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So how did you take to drum machine hardware as a percussionist yourself? I guess this is what’s even more interesting as record for you personally is the drum machine is the thing that’s pushing this record through. Is that counter intuitive for you as a musician because you’re used to doing it yourself with your own hands? Mtume Not at all. Again, be like water. That was the shape I was pouring it in. I’m not threatened by a technology. I welcome it. I digest it. But I also try to humanize it. When you just depend on technology, but you have no musical understanding, that’s the first thing you lean on, is making everything perfect. It’s like, I can do this all day. The trick is, do I know how to do that? To make it lean, to curve the thing. It’s a combination of intuition, intellect, and technique. You gotta know what those things are. But if you’re just sitting at a machine and don’t know those other intricacies of what it is to deal with music or any art form. So yeah, no. I’m not threatened by technology. If that was the case, I wouldn’t use lights. [laughter] Jeff “Chairman” Mao Well that was always the counter-argument to the radical Miles Davis music as well, right? Because the critics were like, “Why are you playing this dissonant electric music? Why isn’t Miles playing acoustic music?” Mtume Because that’s where he was, and that bridge was already burned. You see, sometimes people are really offended when you move on. It’s like a relationship. How dare you? [laughs] You moved on. But if you don’t follow your instinct, and your intuition, then you never know what the... You never experience the joy of really being creative because you’ll be stuck in that quicksand, scared to do something different. And the least of all, I don’t care what anybody thinks. If I think it’s cool, try it. That doesn’t mean you don’t listen to other opinions, then that’s arrogance. But I mean, like I said, too much now... If I can [digress] just for a second. Branding. People don’t talk about the music somebody’s creating, they talk about their brand. And somebody suffers when that happens. And who suffers more often than not is the listener and the fan because you’re going to get the same bullshit in a different cup, in a different package. “Oh, but because that’s so-and-so it must be good.” What? No. Is it good based on the fact that it’s good? So you see a lot of stuff. People put out the same album 12 times over and everybody’s, “Oh, the new so and so, oh it’s great.” Why? You scared to have an opinion because some of the stuff is really bad. Some of it’s really great. But you’re branding. And like in boxing, I see this. Right after music, boxing is just my second favorite thing in the world. But I see fighters who don’t fight to defend the title, they fight to protect it. So your brand. So you don’t fight Pacquiao, OK? But then the whole boxing game get turned ... Because it’s about the best meeting the best. And in music, that’s starting to happen. Branding. That’s why you only have two or three major stars. When did that happen? I knew 50 great female singers, 50 great saxophonists. What is this thing we got? One or two of this, one or two of that. When did that happen? Branding is a dangerous thing because it puts brakes on the creative process because you know you can sell by just putting it out because your name. No, you have to earn the right for people to love your music. [clapping] Jeff “Chairman” Mao You mentioned at the top of the conversation that scoring was one of your passions. This point in your career, the technology and scoring came together a little bit, and it sounded a little like this, right? (music: James Mtume – “Bigger’s Beat” / applause) Jeff “Chairman” Mao Mtume That’s from the film Native Son. It’s called “Bigger’s Beat.” Mtume From the film, Native Son, it’s called “Bigger’s Beat,” there was a scene that he’s walking down the street in the ghetto, back in the late ’30s. Jeff “Chairman” Mao It’s a period piece, you have this, you know... Mtume Yeah, music to me, music is timeless. I hate the idea when a film is, takes place in one period and the composer feels like he’s got to compose music from that period. I find it much more interesting when you mix periods because music translates in to anytime. Jeff “Chairman” Mao How did you find this experience of doing the score for that film? Mtume Fun, fun. Big fun, big fun. Just being alone by myself. I think on that one I was using a Fairlight [CMI]. The Fairlight had just come out and like I said, as I moved on to do a television series. I had everything set up in my basement because technology was accessible like that then. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Now, the funny thing is, I mean, a lot of us know this from a different source. Not necessarily the soundtrack to the film. I only knew this and I think maybe some others as a record that Kid Capri used to spin back and forth at the beginning of of tapes and stuff like that and it was like, “Oh, OK, what’s this?” You know? Mtume Yes. Well, you know, that’s a very interesting point. One of the first, the first rapper that came to me was Grandmaster, Grandmaster Flash. We knew each other, and he came to me about that track and he told me something that I never forgot. He said Mtume, he said, “We sample your stuff, he said because your music is holey. He said I don’t mean like religious holy. It’s got a lot of holes in it.” And what he meant was what I was talking about earlier, space, you know. He said there’s a lot of things we can take, you know like after Biggie did “Juicy,“ that like opened that up for a whole new generation who had never heard the original. So then you have the sample of the sample being sampled and sampled. I call it Sample Simon. [laughs] But anyway, yeah, for some reason the cats took to that. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Yeah, the cats took to this one. Now obviously Juicy has been sampled. Sampling became something that emerged as a very important part of hip-hop in the mid and late ’80s and you became a part of the conversation about the ethics of sampling. What was your stance at the time and how did you get pulled in to that conversation? Mtume Okay and I’m glad that you brought that up because I can clear that up right on Red Bull. It was a misconception. What happened was I was doing a radio show, and it was called Year in Review on KISS FM in New York. We were talking about the events that happened a week before New Year’s Day, so I said the most turnabout thing that I heard, I was driving in the car and this has only happened to me a few times in my life, that something came on the radio and I had to pull over to the side. It was a song called “Bring the Noise.” I had to hear who is this. It was like Thelonious Monk. How can these guys be playing in all these different keys? I’m thinking somebody’s playing, because you know, again I wasn’t familiar as most of my generation with sampling. So on this radio show, I mentioned the most, the deepest musical thing I heard was this group Public Enemy and this song “Bring the Noise.” Then the subject came up about sampling, and I said my problem with sampling was you can’t take somebody’s music and just rap on it and call it your song, no more than I can take a rapper’s rap off and call it my song. In other words, pay the people who are providing the music. If you’re not creating the music, somebody is. I mean, if James Brown got a penny for all the times he was sampled, he would never have to perform again. He never got paid. That was my point with sampling. You must pay if you’re going to use somebody’s music. Why should they not get paid? Daddy-O from Stetsasonic, we are great friends after this, but we was going at it. He put out this rap called “Talkin’ All That Jazz.” That’s about me. “I’m gonna knock you out,” you know. He completely misunderstood what I was saying. First of all I said Public Enemy and Hank Shocklee and the Bomb Squad, that was some of the most creative stuff I had ever heard. As things happen, it got macho, I felt myself out on a limb because nobody from my generation was saying nothing and like I tell people, I don’t mind being out on a limb, I’m just scared of saws, you know what I mean? I defended it, but it got a little out of hand but I was never against sampling. First of all, how hypocritical could that be of me? I mean, as much as “Juicy” and stuff like that has been sampled. But I was saying at that time, they were not paying the artist that they were sampling, and I didn’t think it was right. Does that clear that up? Jeff “Chairman” Mao Yeah, you became, sort of known as the anti-sampling guy. Mtume Yeah, and that’s not true at all. It became that because nobody else, first of all, was speaking up. There was a great divide that happened in the black community generationally when hip-hop was coming in to full bloom. It was a divide between the older generation and the younger. I’ve always sided with the younger because I felt my generation didn’t leave a proper blueprint, and they were not supportive. Sampling became almost this lightning rod. I became the target, but like I said, I’m a big boy, my skin ain’t thin. My point was you must pay the people who’s music you are sampling. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Things had changed by the time “Juicy” had come out then, too. Mtume Oh yeah, right. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What was your impression of Juicy when you heard it? Mtume I loved it. First of all, I was honored that the next generation or an artist from the next generation... Because it’s about the music first and foremost, had it sold or not. I was just like wow they felt that good about it. I remember when I met Biggie. I was doing New York Undercover at the time and I was up at Uptown having a meeting with Andre Harrell and Andre said, “While you are here, Puffy needs to talk to you.” I said well tell him come on in. So Puffy came in and he said, “You know I got this artist named Biggie and I want to do ‘Juicy Fruit.‘” So I said, “Cool, this is how we’ll do it. There wasn’t a a long conversation. “You get 50 Cent, I get 50 Cent.” We did a page contract, very simple. If this is the music and you’re the rapper, boom. Then he brought Biggie in and we met. I took to him immediately, he was a sweetheart. That’s how that started. I was honored. Jeff “Chairman” Mao How did the New York Undercover scoring come in to your life? Mtume That was that urban show about two cops. One black and one Latino working in New York, shot in New York, real New York themes. I thought it would be a very interesting challenge. Andre Harrell, but more importantly, Dick Wolf, Law and Order and all that were the executive producers. Dick pretty much was running it. I got the gig. It was a little difficult. When I brought the theme Dick didn’t like it because actually he never wanted me, Andre brought me, he wanted his man Mike Post. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Mike Post, yeah, Hill Street Blues. Mtume Yeah, Hill Street Blues. He said he didn’t like it, so I said OK. Then someone over at Universal Studios television department said send it over to us, send us a DAT. That’s when we did DAT’s. She called me back in about three hours and said, “Mtume, I just took it to the head of Universal Studios. He said he loves this, this is where we want to go, and he said, ‘Oh and by the way, tell Mtume thank you for ‘Juicy Fruit.’” [laughs] Again, you never know. This guy had to be 80, you don’t know who’s listening to your music. Like I said, I was able to put a sound on television that hadn’t been heard. I think the most progressive sound before that was Miami Vice. Jeff “Chairman” Mao We are talking the mid–’90s at this point. Mtume, the band has stopped. Mtume Yes. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Why did you stop the band? Mtume It was time. You always got to know what time it is, you know. You always got to know what time it is. It could have gone on but then I would have been right back at that point I told you. I never wanted to experience that again, sitting down, trying to write some music and you’re not doing it from here. You’re doing it because you have a formula that you know, you can still reach X amount of people, and that’s not the reason to create music. I never started like that and I didn’t want to finish like that. Everybody in that band went on to have very successful careers, especially Tawatha, she works with everybody, I mean the [Rolling] Stones, Dave Matthews, Lenny Kravitz. Phillip, my keyboard player is a principle at a school and runs the music department. Everybody went on to do something, so I felt good about that but to continue doing something artistically and you are lying to yourself – and if you are lying to yourself, you know you are lying... never lie to the people that believe in your music. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Right. Now you did step a way a little bit, for some time but then you also mentored and produced some artists of the ’90s as well. Mtume Oh yeah, I did. Jeff “Chairman” Mao A few different people. This is one of them who you did this track with. (music: D’Angelo – “Girl You Need a Change of Mind” / applause) Jeff “Chairman” Mao Who was that? Mtume D’Angelo, my man. Jeff “Chairman” Mao This was just a one ... was it a soundtrack or a cover? Mtume Yes, he called and asked me to produce that track. It was an old Eddie Kendricks track. It was for Get on the Bus. Yes, Get on the Bus soundtrack. Jeff “Chairman” Mao He’s mentioned you as a mentor of sorts. Is it fun just this experience of working together or... Mtume Well, actually no. I had forgotten this, and he reminded me. When he was doing his first album, Brown Sugar, I was in the studio next door. He came over when he found out I was there and he was having some difficulties navigating through some parts. I actually did that with him and helped him through. Then there was another time I was in the studio, so there was a couple times. Before that I always told him, you know when we would talk, you’ve got something special and you’ve just got to keep pushing, keep pushing and he reminded me of it. He’s always been one of the young cats that I’ve always felt very close to. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What did you tell him that day? Mtume Don’t be scared to be you. That’s the only thing that you can tell any artist, because, you know what, when you say that there’s certain truths that you got to face. Maybe you don’t have it. You know a lot of people are great in the mirror. But at the end of the day, you got it or you don’t. If I don’t have it at least I... if I’m going to go down in flames, it’s going to be with my own matches. I don’t need you to light me. Be you and if it happens, great and if it don’t, think of something else. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Right. You did step away from music, is that fair to say? Mtume Yes, absolutely. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Why? Mtume I didn’t feel it. I didn’t feel it. That’s a delicate place to be. That doesn’t mean that I won’t, look, I might wake up tomorrow and feel it. That thing doesn’t leave you. More importantly, you leave it. The thing, or as Miles used to say, the thang, the thang is always there, but you got to surrender something to bring something to that. What you surrender, there’s no room for BS. You have to be committed to that. The other thing, you and I talked about this, I mean, we sit up here talking man. We went through damn near 40 years of music, easy, and I played a lot of different types of music. It’s not like most people spent pretty much their career in one or two genres. I haven’t done it all. There’s no such thing. I was a musician. Then I said I wanted to be a writer. Then I said I wanted to produce. Then I said I wanted to put a band together. Then I said I wanted to score. I think, for me now, something I would love to do, I would love to do Bonnie Raitt. Something just that would pull like all of it, it’s been here or here. I’m not really touched by... I appreciate what I hear but I would need a challenge. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Right. And you’re return to activism as well. Mtume Yes. The last 20 years I spent on New York radio on a political talk show called Open Line. All the politicians came through. I’ve traveled on several delegations to Cuba, Libya, Sudan, Ghana, South Africa. Pretty much, that’s the water, that’s the shape that... When I say I left music, I just started pouring it into some other things. I think, as you and I were talking earlier, I think right now the first interview I did of any serious consequence was with you and Red Bull, when my son hooked it up. This is the second one. I haven’t talked about music in 20 years. Not like this. I feel, at this age, I have a lot that I can give. You know experiences, or how this goes, how that goes. It’s time for me to give that because, you know, once you split, that’s it. He was cool but he didn’t leave us any information. I used to always joke with people, they say, “Methuselah lived to be 900,” and I say, “Yeah, well what else did he do? Yeah well he lived, but what did he do?” “Oh, I don’t know that.” I’m glad to be here and anything that I can do to and be of help to about, you got it. I’m about giving this information to the next generation. That’s what it’s about. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Before we open it up to questions, I just wanted to know if you thought there was a... through all the different facets of your career, the different phases, is there was a thread that you see that connects them in some way? Jeff “Chairman” Mao If there is any thematic fiber in my career, or that one thing that you could point to, that goes back to what I said earlier: I never lied to the music, and the music never lied to me. When you’re finished with a phase, move on. Move on. That’s the only way you expand the music, and being open. I’ve never been one of the old heads that was, “That ain’t nothing because it’s new.” You don’t understand it. Well then learn it. I’ve never been threatened by something new. That’s what I live for. I live to be inspired by something I haven’t heard. How else do you grow? That’s why we got too many midgets. We got too many midgets in the world right now. They don’t want to grow. Yeah, midget music. [laughter] Always be open to the next thing. I have an 11-year-old granddaughter. She might come up with something next year that I’ve never heard, and you know what, I’m going to be right at the crib, “Ayah, how did you get that sound?” I come out of jazz, and you have to understand in jazz everybody shared. That’s the other thing, everybody shared. I had a problem once with some rhythms, odd time signatures. I called Max Roach, a master. You don’t have that now. These cats hold on like they got the secret to cancer. You know what I’m saying? “How did you get that symbol sound?” or “What cord did you play?” You don’t grow the music by the music by doing this. [holds his hands to his stomach and crouches] You grow it by that. [spreads his arms apart] If you don’t get anything from what I’m telling you, everything I arrived at, I arrived at because somebody showed me something that I could add to it, but you got to share. That’s what I love about when we’re taking the studios rooms. You guys are working together. You’re sharing. It can’t grow by itself. It grows with expanding the sphere of information. Bam, there it is. Jeff “Chairman” Mao There it is. [applause] All right, who has a question for Mr. Mtume? Please wait for the microphone. Audience Member Hey man, nice to meet you. Thank you for being here. Mtume Thank you. Audience Member I have a bunch of questions to ask you of course. “Rated X” sounded amazing on the speakers. Everything sounds incredible. When you were working with Miles, [John Coltrane] obviously passed away in ‘67, did he express anything... I mean, you said he had a very close relationship with him, did he express anything – Mtume No. No. Not with Trane. Audience Member No, with Miles. Did Miles ever express to you anything about Trane? Mtume Oh, that’s a great question. I’ll tell you one story Miles told me. When he knew Coltrane had to leave the band, they were playing a gig in Philly, and Miles said ... because you know Miles never stayed on the stage, when he finished his solo, he walked off the stage. He said he thought it was the corniest thing for someone to do a solo and stand there. He just got off the and he said... this was after the Kind of Blue album and they were playing all blues, and he went and sat at the bar and was watching Trane, and he said, “It just kept building and building.” And Miles said he sat there, and he had a drink, and he just started crying, at the bar. He said the reason he started crying, he said, “He’s got to go. This band can’t contain him anymore.” He cried because he knew Trane had to leave. One other quick caveat, Trane played one night so long, the cats on the band was like, “Okay man.” You know, because he was trying to find it. So Miles said, “Why’d you play so long?” Trane said, “Man, I didn’t know how to get out of the song.” So Miles said, “Take the horn out of your mouth.” [laughter] Jeff “Chairman” Mao Who else has a question? Wait for the microphone. Audience Member Hi. Mtume Hi. How are you doing? Audience Member Good. Thank you so much. It’s been wonderful. Okay, this is going to be a little bit hard for me because I have to make the connection. Okay, so you were talking about writer’s block in the beginning... It’s kinda going to be a couple questions. How old were you when that happened and were any of your peers experiencing the same thing around the same age? And how did you come out of that, like, did you ever have writer’s block again or was it this extreme realization for you? Mtume It was a revelation. I had to be 30 something. I don’t remember which part in the equation of ’30s, but it was somewhere in there. Let me answer the next... Did any of my peers experience it? I’ve never had that discussion, but I know they have, because if you’re in this long enough, you’re going to experience that. If you don’t experience it, then that says more about you. You know what I mean? That means that you’re not trying to go somewhere. You’re not challenged by the fact that you’re not moving. You get out of it simply by burning the bridge. Starting over. I’m not going to use those cords. Or I’m not going to use that band structure. You got to change something about the environment that you create in. Some people go away, but I always say there’s no exit from your mind. I could go somewhere else and write, but that doesn’t change the fact that I’m challenged. That’s what I did. That was that period where I said, “You know what? No more production. Let me concentrate on finding a sound for myself.” That’s when I had my greatest revelation musically. Audience Member That’s cool. Thank you. The other part is, so Miles Davis, when he played Woodstock, he saw all the other bands getting more into funk or... he saw what the audience was reacting to and he knew he needed to make a change – Mtume That’s not true. Audience Member That’s not true, okay. Mtume That was a quote [Wynton] Marsalis made on the Ken Burns talk, I know where you got it, and I hated it. I loved Ken Burns, but I hated it because they used two people, Wynton Marsalis and Stanley Crouch, who are diametrically against what Miles is doing. Wynton a lot less now, but at the time Stanley Crouch... as a matter of fact, I debated Stanley Crouch. It’s on YouTube, on the subject of Miles and the electric period. I gave him an electric spanking. [laughter] Because a lot of that stuff them guys have been saying – you have to understand Miles character. Miles wasn’t about, “You dogging me, that’s okay, because I’m going to give you more by responding to it.” He never said anything, but we had those conversations and how he felt. I knew where you got that, right, but that’s not true. Miles was evolving. It’s very interesting. Two things always happened when Miles made his musical change. He changed music maybe about four times, not just at himself, but the direction of music, three or four times. The two things you look at, he changes his woman and he changes the way he dressed. I’m not even trying to be funny. If you listened to Around Midnight, and those pieces, Milestones, and then you go to the next period Miles in the Sky, he’s dressing differently. By the time we get to Bitches Brew and On the Corner, because he was changing. It had nothing to do with sitting up watching Sly Stone and them and saying, “Oh, I’m just a trumpet player.” I think that’s how it was said. No, It was honest. See, again, if you change because you’re changing to try and get an audience or you’re trying to... That’s not real change. That’s adaptation. There’s a distinction. He didn’t adapt. He changed. That’s metamorphosis. Audience Member Do you know if there was ever any frustration for him in any of those changes or if it just seemed pretty seamless with him? Mtume No. I never... and we had hours, thousands of hours of conversation. You know, because I’m like a sponge when I’m around them cats. I remember, just quickly, I remember when we were in Brazil. The road manager came and got me, knocking on the door. It was maybe two in the morning. He said, “Look man, Miles needs you right now.” He said, “No, just come.” I didn’t know, so I put on my clothes and I went up. Miles was in the corner crying. He was actually torn, torn. I went over to him and said, “Miles, what’s happening?” He just looked at me and said, “All my friends are dead.” That ran through me. He’s in the corner lamenting. He said, “Coltrane, Cannonball [Adderley], you know, Fats Navarro, you know, all the cats. Wynton Kelly. Paul Chambers.” And he had survived, and that’s what he was... “Why me?” I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to go off but that’s the kind of... No, he changed out of the need to change. Not, “Oh man, I need to get some costumes and plug in.” No. Audience Member I’m sorry, one more question out of curiosity. You were talking about sitting at the table with Dizzy Gillespie and stuff, I was wondering if you ever had any experiences with Thelonious Monk or what was your take on his character? Mtume The first time I met Monk... First of all, I think he was the most unique human being I’d ever been around. A lot of people said he was crazy. No, he was just on another sphere, well, the Thelonious sphere. I think he’s one of the true geniuses that we produced. A lot of people don’t know the extent of Monk’s musical knowledge. I mean, Monk was in Julliard, I think in ‘41. Do you understand? This stuff just doesn’t happen. Monk grows out of – he knew all of this music. Then out of that? Again, innovation. He came up with something. He was the architect for the chord structure in bebop. Audience Member Yeah, he’s very, very spiritual. Seemingly [laughs]. Thank you so much. Mtume Thank you. Jeff “Chairman” Mao All right. Who’s next? Audience Member Thank you. Mtume Thank you, sir. Audience Member I’m fascinated by your interest in Swahili culture – Mtume Yes, sir. Audience Member – because last year I was at a music show and I found a Herbie Hancock record. I saw all the Swahili names – Mtume Yes, sir. Audience Member – and I just wanted to know what prompted that? Mtume Like I said, I was a member of US Organization, that was a cultural nationalist organization. A lot of times, because I had relationships with these cats, when they come into LA to play, a lot of them would come over. We would have these sessions on Sunday, discussions on Sunday. Sonny Rollins would come through, Yusef, and then Herbie and them came through. They started coming through every time they were in LA, and Herbie and I really connected on the cut you played [on] Kawaida. We just were tight and then his band, I got very close to them. They came one day and just wanted some names. They came with what they felt their best quality was, and we just sat down and went through it and they’ve used it. It’s just vibrations. Audience Member Cool. Thank you. Mtume Thank you. I hope I’m not boring you. Some of y’all might need a break. Go to sleep or something, I don’t know. I’m over here talking too long. I’m sorry. [laughs] Audience Member Hi, sir. Mtume How are you? Audience Member I’m good. Thank you for sharing your truths and your stories with us. My question is in regards to cinema and scoring. Mtume Yes, ma’am. Audience Member Basically, the cinematic soundtracks, they got this super-clean quality to them – Mtume I’m sorry. Super what? Audience Member Clean. Mtume Yes. Audience Member – and just super quality and real life is not super quality. Coming from a jazz background, do you ever get frustrated by it being so clean and not think to yourself and maybe if we’re pushing to do something different, why not make that guy walking down the street sound like that guy walking down the street – Mtume Yeah, yeah. Audience Member – really with the music. Just that way. Like, that experience as opposed to this escapist fantasy of what the viewer thinks of this guy walking down the street? Mtume Right. I think that’s an excellent question. For me, and I can only give you what I feel, like I said, you don’t have to be locked into the time zone of the film that you’re watching. Musically, you can go anywhere. I’ll give you a perfect example. Star Wars. Okay? What was that? Was that future or was that old symphonic? [sings] Dun din dun, din dun. Okay? That worked, for some reason. You’d be surprised at things you’ve already digested that are examples of what I’m talking about, but it’s not enough of them. It’s not enough of them. You know the ones I hate? I hate to see movies that were shot in another century and the music? Why you composing like that? It’s also about being, again, that word, open. Music is as virtual as anything. You can put it anywhere if it’s right and if it works. That’s the key. If it works, it’s right. Why not try something? How about stumbling a couple of times? You stumble a couple of times, you’d be surprised what you stumble on. I do think there’s this worship of exactness that’s really a drag. We worship that. Cats go to school, learn how to play Coltrane’s solo on “Giant Steps.” So what? I can play every note. Okay. That’s what he did. What can you play? We’re starting to, what I call, Mac music. We take these things and we just become carbon copies. Somebody’s great because they can play like Sonny Rollins. That’s not a reason to be great. You’re a drag, to me. You’re just plain copying. It’s like those paintings that you could buy – I don’t know if they still have them – paint-by-numbers? When you follow the numbers, you come out with a portrait or something. You didn’t paint it, you followed the numbers. It’s copycatting. Too much copycat has been able to slide by as legitimate music and legitimate artists and they’re not. They’re copycats, but y’all need to say that. The problem is, the public that knows is scared to say something, because then you’re dogged. “Oh, you’re playa hating.” No, I’m not. This shit’s not good! It’s not good. Y’all need to say more of that because too much is let by because celebrity worship. You gotta just call it out because it won’t move forward. Mac music. Five million served, nobody satisfied. Audience Member Cool. Thank you so much. Audience Member I just had a question about when you stopped doing big arrangements and orchestration. You were talking about go to another place and minimize. When you’re writing those really minimal riffs, like the bass line in “Juicy Fruit,” is it a matter of sitting down and working over this riff until it becomes exactly every note is perfect, what you want it to be, or is it something where it just comes out the first time or is it different all the time? Mtume Well, for me, and like I said, everybody’s different. That’s a great question. For me, it was like coming from the big orchestration stuff to neo-minimalism. I mean, “Juicy Fruit,” there’s only four instruments playing, maybe five. You mix it so it sounds bigger than what’s actually there. You can personify instruments in the mix. In some ways, it’s more challenging to come down, because now, the bass line’s gotta match something. If we took Juicy, the bass line’s really not a bass line. It’s more of a guitar line. [singing] Doo doo, doo doo, doo, doo, doo, bap. Doo doo, doo doo, doo, doo, bang. Doo doo, doo doo, doo, bop. Doo doo, doo doo, do you see? Then you got, little nursery rhyme. Dee, dee dee dee-
Okay. Chords. Chords. Everything’s riding on the inversion of that chord. If I play a different inversion on those chords, the melody doesn’t work. It’s very, very intricate. Audience Member Did you take a lot of time perfecting each of those riffs? Mtume Yes. I mean, I want to make sure I understand. Take a lot of time. Audience Member When you’re writing. Mtume What’s a lot of time? Audience Member I don’t know [laughs] Mtume No, no, no. I’m not trying to be funny. I’m just – I’m trying to make sure I’m answering your question. If I told you I wrote it in one night, is that a lot of time? Audience Member Um, no. Mtume I had been thinking about it for weeks. See what I’m saying? Conceptually, even though I said that I laid that drum pattern down, things really kind of opened up, but I had been working off those chords and that sound, I’d been in there a year. Audience Member Uh huh, but consolidated it in a night. Mtume Exactly. Exactly, and there’s no reverb on that album. That was the first album I ever did like that. Audience Member That’s so sick. Audience Member How are you, sir? Mtume Yes, sir. How are you? Audience Member It’s a humbling honor to be able to communicate openly with you. Mtume Well, thank you very much. Audience Member I find it perfect that you touched on this whole copycat thing because our good friend, Vince Wilburn has made us aware of a band, Mostly Other People, that made a verbatim- Mtume That’s the name of the band? Audience Member Mostly Other People Do The Killing is the name of the band, and they’ve made a verbatim copy of Kind of Blue. Mtume Oh no! Audience Member You haven’t heard about this? Mtume No, sir. Audience Member The Miles Davis Estate is vehemently opposing its release and not supporting it at all, but NPR has taken the liberty to showcase it and highlight it. Mtume Now, let me make sure I’m clear. They did the record and everybody’s playing all the exact notes and everything? Audience Member The drummer, every single thing. Every single thing. To the point where, the NPR show will play both recordings and swap between them – Mtume And that’s really cool? Audience Member Undiscernible difference – Mtume Oh my goodness! Audience Member – between the two. I just find it very crazy that you had just mentioned that. Mtume Yeah. Audience Member That’s what’s going on right now and this band, they really don’t understand why people aren’t getting it, why people don’t dig it. Mtume [laughs] See, why do that? Why do that? I mean, unless you was doing this for Miles, but that’s not what Miles would’ve wanted. I can’t even repeat on this mic what I know he would say. Then what are you doing? What are you doing? If it’s getting to that, that’s kind of scary. Audience Member All right. One other question – Mtume I don’t even like the title of the band. Audience Member Right. I didn’t like it – Mtume I ain’t even with that. Audience Member Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mtume I don’t even have to listen to it. I can’t even get past that! Other people, what? Killing, what? [laughter] Audience Member My other question is more of a technical question, in particular, regarding the mix of Juicy Fruit. You may have been asked this before, especially since it’s your first non-reverb record, which is kind of a groundbreaking concept – Mtume Yes. Audience Member – because we use reverb to hide imperfections, so to speak. But when everything drops out in the background vocals, you can lick me anywhere – Mtume Everywhere Audience Member Everywhere, excuse me. I’m a little nervous to ask you this question. Mtume There are some places you won’t lick. [laughter] Audience Member No, no, no. I’ve been wanting to ask you this question for twenty years. The vocals get apparently louder. Almost to the point where you wonder, was that intentional? Mtume Yes. Audience Member Okay. Mtume Yes, sir. Audience Member You just solved a mystery that is – Mtume That’s a legitimate question, because when it drops out, usually you can drop stuff out and then it’s there. I put that in your face. Audience Member I was thinking, maybe it’s a limiter. You pushed it. Mtume I raised that. I want you to hear that. Audience Member That’s very heavy. I want to commend you for that. Thank you. It’s a great pleasure to talk to you. Mtume Hey man, it’s my pleasure. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Alright. Who else has a question? Audience Member This is a little bit convoluted, so bear with me. And thank you for being here as well, I should say to start off. Mtume My granddaughter loves your shirt. [laughs] Audience Member [laughs] Glad I could be of some service here today. When you’re talking about your use of the LinnDrum and it’s technology being a –I feel like this language is crude– but a human extension of your body – Mtume Yes. Audience Member – then earlier, you were talking about the many trips you made to Japan with Miles. That idea in Japan in traditional art is very prominent, the idea that technology is an extension of the body. Was that something you’re absorbing consciously, then, on those trips? Was that something that came through later in your work or is this just a more universal concept for you? Mtume I think it’s a combination of both. You’re raising a very interesting question for me. As I think about it and ponder what you’re saying, yes, very definitely. You have to understand the context. That clip that you saw that was played? That was 1972 or ’73. You can watch that now and it makes sense. This was completely off the wall back then. Not for the listeners. The people that would come, the young? They would be like, “I’ve never heard anything in my life like that.” The critics? “This is bullshit. Miles done lost his mind.” We had these two things, but I’m watching the guy play the trumpet through a wah wah pedal. Do you understand?
Just that alone, and we’re all electrified. All this is happening. My drums were hooked up. I had phase shifters and all. I had the same equipment the guitar players had. I could go [makes electrical sound] and all of a sudden, you watching me play the congas and they sound like something else. We were forging ahead. I must say, I’ve never been asked that question, but definitely. Remember, not just coming to Japan, but that was a working band. We were traveling all over. The idea that we were all these guys committed to this sound, you just have to be open. You’ve just got to be like this [spreads his arms apart] and then find out if you’ve got it, or not. Again, because, ultimately, that question will be answered. You can only run but for so long, then your ego gets tired, then you’ve got to say, “Yo, maybe I don’t have this.” That’s a great question. Thank you. Audience Member Can I ask you another question? Were you more, as far as your drumming and percussion, were you more in the ’60s more on the Elvin Jones side? Mtume Where do you get these people, man? That’s a great question. That’s a great question because nobody has ever asked me that.
I approached the instrument very differently. I don’t like conga players because, I feel, again, they’re so locked. Boom-boom-bop, boom-boom-bop, all that stuff. First of all, the cat that I come out of was a great percussionist, named Big Black. He used to play with Hugh Masekela, and Dizzy Gillespie, but the people that I molded my sound after was Elvin Jones and Tony Williams. so for you to go there, because most conga players don’t play ... I mean I can play in 5, 4, 7, I can do all that, and play it approaching it like a trap drummer. A guy told me once that I was scrambling eggs, he said, “But it’s the way you scramble them,” and Elvin was... you just play through it, modernize the instrument, modernize the approach. So, yes, I molded myself after Elvin and Tony Williams. Audience Member Were you into Rashied Ali, at all? Mtume Absolutely. I’ll tell you I was avant-garde, man. I’ve played gigs with more cats that was on the stage than was on the audience. Do you know what I mean? I mean it’d be four of us on the stage, and two of them in the audience, but you play to them like it was 2000. I really played that stuff. Some of it I don’t even believe, when I think about it. This one guy we used to play with, named Cailo Cailo, for some reason the student unions loved him in LA, so we used to get all these gigs. He was a trumpet player, but his thing was taking bottles, and busting them, onstage, and the place would go crazy. Glass flying. I said, “What am I doing?” Glass was flying all past me, but I was out there. So yes, I loved all the cats. Audience Member Right on. One more quick question. What was it like for Dave Liebman and the Band, in the ‘70s, with all you guys? Was he like part of the crew, or was he more kind of like on his own? Mtume No, he wasn’t ... you mean on his own like ... like was it apartheid? Audience Member Yes. No. No, no, no. Was it like everyone was cool? Was everybody like friends, and stuff? Mtume No. Dave, look, I loved his playing. Dave never really bought into that sound, but he fit so well. He enjoyed playing it, just like Keith Jarrett loved it. He just lied about it, when he got out of the band, talking about, “I had to play this electronic ...” You look at YouTube, you look, he’s just smiling. That’s one other reason I’m glad of YouTube, because he was a liar, and he was exposed. But Dave played his butt off, and I loved the way, but Dave was still coming more out of the traditional bebop. The rhythm section was totally behind trying to fulfill this dream, and this vision that Miles had. Audience Member That’s what I meant. That’s why I ask, because you guys were really far out, and he had more of a, I guess, per se, traditional; but he was very chromatic, still, in his playing. Mtume Dave is a bad man. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Sorry to interrupt. How did you and Al Foster maintain the sonic space, because he’s the drummer, you’re the percussionist; how did you not get in each other’s way? Mtume When Al first joined the band, Al was not there. Al came in right after On the Corner, and Miles had a meeting with me and Al, and what Miles did, he switched the roles. He said, “You follow Mtume.” I was the one that was free to play superimposed tempos, like sometimes we’re in four, I might play seven against it. I was totally free, and what he said was he said, “You’re my Tony.” He was talking about Tony Williams. If you see, he had me next to him because we were playing off of each other. I could have never had that experience playing. I mean it’s Miles, and he’s giving a percussionist basically the direction to take it wherever I wanted to go. That’s another great question. I’ve always appreciated Al, because Al’s a hell of a drummer. But Miles was clear, he just wanted the two and four. Jeff “Chairman” Who’s next? Audience Member There was a time when Local 802 and 47 were trying to stop drum machines from replacing people. Any comments, any thoughts on that whole era, that whole time? Mtume Stupid. Audience Member Stupid. Mtume Stupid. See, first of all, you don’t fight technology – you embrace it. It’s like fire, it’ll burn you, or you learn how to cook with it. But you cannot avoid it. Technology is real. Everything is a combination, as I’ve always said, of art and technology. So why would you fight reality? As we speak, everything is moving. The world is actually moving right now. We don’t feel it, but it’s on an axis, moving slowly, but everything is in motion. If you close yourself off to anything, how do you grow? Like I said, she’s going to hear something that none of us in this room can imagine. What will the kids 30 years from now hear? Maybe music will just be [taps his hand on the table] and we’ll all go, “Damn.” [laughter] Audience Member How do we stop these crazy old men with huge funds? How do we stop them from imposing on our creative way of life? Mtume I don’t think you have to stop them. Look what you’re doing here. Look at Red Bull. I don’t know, they might be some crazy guys, but look what they put together. It’s where you’re coming from. This, to me, this is an extraordinary situation, and I was so happy. This is the man that quells my angst, because usually I get bored with interviews because they ask you stupid questions, “What color socks did you have on yesterday?” But – Jeff “Chairman” Mao I’m going to cross that one off the list, right now. Mtume [laughs] But, again, they cannot fight change. Don’t let that affect you. Are you a musician? What do you play? Audience Member I play drum set. Mtume You don’t play oboe. [inaudible comment from audience member] Mtume [laughs] I’m just teasing. Audience Member I’m a producer, firstly. Mtume Follow it, man. It’s all this. [places his hand to his heart] Jeff “Chairman” Mao Who else has a question, in the back? Can we pass the mic, please? Audience Member Thank you, so much, for being here. It’s like the most insane body of work, ever. Just two things you touched on very briefly in the beginning, but the club scene, in New York, and things, and I’m just wondering if you can share any stories from there, like, Larry Levan was brought up. Were there any DJs that you were looking for, and how was that whole movement for you, obviously coming out of this sort of jazz background and things like that? Mtume I knew Larry, and then you had the Tunnel. There was a couple of different places. I was not a club guy. I went out occasionally to get a pulse to what people were listening to, but I was kind of at odds with the club scene because it was just getting, you know, New York had become so homogenized, man, and it was really effecting R&B. So, again, I wasn’t joking about beats per minute. We were really, it was getting ... I hated that bass line. Doon-dah, doon-dah, doon-dah... aw, come on, man, and everybody was doing club records. You know, “Juicy Fruit” broke in the clubs. What’s the joint up in the Bronx? Disco Fever. I remember when we finished the mix, a gy named Scott Folks, who worked at Epic, we finished the 12”, he called me, on night. He said, “Man, I want to take you to this club. I want you to see the people’s response to ‘Juicy Fruit,’” because I never thought ... that’s the last thing I thought, was people would dance to it. He said, “Okay, I’m going to pick you up.” I said, “Well, what time, at 9 or ten?” He said, “What?” He said, “I’ll pick you up around three.” I said, “What do you mean?” He said, “Three in the morning.” He said, “It ain’t even really happening until then,” and he said they usually play “Juicy Fruit” around somewhere between four and five. So I went with him, and I was just overwhelmed by the response because, again, when you’re creating something. Anybody that tells you, anybody tells you they know what a hit is, is a liar. You don’t know. You can only hope that what you felt, and you put in that record, translates, and other people feel the same way. Because if anybody knew that secret, they’d put it in a bottle, and sell it. You just know what you feel good about, but the club scene I really couldn’t comment, other than Disco Fever, and that was more hip-hop. Audience Member Another thing, just like when we were listening to “Juicy Fruit“ earlier reminded me of a track from Dr. John that he’d been playing at jazz set like a year later, in like 1984, and he obviously came from more of a blues background. Was he someone that you were familiar? Mtume Dr. John? Come on, man. Yes. Professor Longhair, Fats Domino, Allen Toussaint – come on now. You’ve got to go to all them schools, you know what I mean, with your ear. I’m a nerd when it comes to the music. It’s jazz, funk, R&B because the more you know, the more you can put in your box. Andd then when you put your thing on it, you’ve got more to draw from, it’s more information. Audience Member I think when I said “familiar,” I mean I obviously knew that you had probably have heard of him. [laughs] I mean is he someone that like... I’m just trying to piece it together in my head. You’d sort of followed a similar path at that time with the drum machine, like embracing that kind of technology. Was that something that you were aware of? Mtume The first time I used the drum machine was actually in 1980 or ‘81 on an artist that we were doing, called Marc Sadane. That was the 808, the Roland 808; so I had been messing around. Also, I was always into the synthesizers, the Fair Light, stuff like that, that was coming along, all the polyphonic synthesizers. If you listen to all my records after with Juicy on, I’ve just always been, how do you not deny it, so I’ve just always been tried to be in tune with that technology, always. Audience Member Thank you. Mtume My man. You all know I’m old. I’m going to have to take a nap, after this, man. [laughs] Audience Member On the subject of technology, you guys were talking about how you enjoyed Stockhausen’s work, and I have a hard time picturing something further apart than Stockhausen’s workshop at the WDR, and, let’s say, Yusef Lateef playing at the [Village] Vanguard. How did you guys actually appreciate it, or what was the environment you would actually consume this music in? Mtume Same environment I would consume Parliament Funkadelic; same environment I would consume Sam Cooke; same environment I would consume Modern Jazz Quartet. There is no separation, and that’s a great point you’re making because, for me, I’m shocked you would think it would require an environment. It’s all one. Like I said, I can put up “Tear the Roof off the Sucker,“ and then put on Stravinsky, “Rite of Spring.” What’s the difference? Audience Member Word. On that note ... Mtume Yes, you feel me? What’s the difference? Audience Member That’s you saying it. Mtume There you go. Audience Member You also mentioned Parliament. You had some heavy good duty cats on personnel, on Juicy Fruit, like Bernie Worrell was playing on there, as well; sax player, Gary Bartz. What was the contribution of these people to the song? Mtume First of all, I played with Gary Bartz in the NTU Troop. I played with Gary for about five years on and off, and he’s one of my favorite alto saxophones, period. Bernie Worrell and I became very good friends, and I actually started using Bernie on a Stephanie Mills project. These were not cats that I just called; these were cats that I admired, and I knew what they could bring to what I was trying to accomplish. Those were the connections on those, and I think you should always try to have heavyweights around you. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You produced Gary Barts, too. Mtume Yes, I forgot about that. I actually produced Music is My Sanctuary, I think. I forgot the name of the album. Jeff “Chairman” Mao “Keep Going On,” right? Mtume Yeah. That song was on there. Audience Member If you’re trying to work with heavyweight cats like that, is that work for hire, or is everyone having a share in the proceedings? Mtume They were never in the band. The key components in that phase of the Mtume Band was Tawatha Agee, who was our lead singer, myself, keyboardist Philip Field , and bassist Raymond Jackson. But I would occasionally use other cats who were friends of mine, and also great musicians. Audience Member On the subject of heavyweights, though, for someone who has lived in the era, Smoking Joe, or Cassius Clay? Mtume I’m from Philly. Audience Member That answers that, I guess. Mtume Of course, I’ve got to give Joe, but Ali. Not just because of his boxing prowess, but because of what kind of man he was. I lived through that period when he was castigated for his position on the Vietnam War, and the three most productive years of his life was taken from him. So we’ll never know how great he really would have been, but what he left us was enough to study. Man, Ali. But Smoking Joe, man, you’re causing, I’m having a little confusion, man, because that’s hard. That’s hard. He was a great fighter, man. Audience Member Thanks. Can we get some COD? Mtume Oh, my God. Can we deliver? Jeff “Chairman” Mao You asked for it. (music: Mtume – “C.O.D. (I’ll Deliver)”) Mtume You know, as that was playing, there’s something I wanted to mention, also, to those of you, as songwriters, and future producers. Find out what your timezone is. What I mean by that is we all write with a specific tempo that we’re most comfortable with. My tempo is mid-tempo funk. I mean I know that. Some people can get a higher tempo, or a slower tempo. Try to get in tune with what your tempo is, and that will speed your writing, and also improve it, and push it forward a great deal, because you don’t have to start messing... there’s a lot of it you’ll leave out. Like maybe I’m not a good ballad writer, so maybe I should concentrate on this. Find your internal tempo. That will be very helpful, as a writer and a producer. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I think it’s going to be the last question. Anything else after this, you can come up informally. Audience Member First of all, thank you so much for this inspirational lecture. I had one question. I heard the other day we had a lecture from Marley Marl, and he was saying about “Juicy” that he thought it was great, that his name was dropped in that song, and that new generations were exposed to him. So I really was wondering what your opinion is, or like your thoughts or view on that song, specifically, how new generations get introduced to your music. Do you think it’s like a good thing, or on the other side that people will only know, specific generations will only know about your music from that song? Mtume That’s a great question. No, I was never ... I was always just honored and pleased that another generation was open to anything I created. How can I say it? I don’t take my music personally, and I know that might sound strange. I’ve always been of the opinion the music doesn’t come from you, it comes through you. Audience Member I feel you. I feel you. Mtume You know, and just be glad that your antenna is high enough to pick up that signal, and you can present that music. I never think of... Because there’s too many great people that are out there that I came up under. So that would be ridiculously arrogant, so, no, I never... I’m just grateful that somebody appreciates it. If it only sold one copy, I would be thankful for that. Audience Member I can imagine. Thank you. Jeff “Chairman” Mao We are very grateful that you were able to join us today, so let’s all say thank you to Mister James Mtume. Mtume Thank you. [applause]

Title: Mannie Fresh (New Orleans, 2011)

Mannie Fresh (New Orleans, 2011)
Southern hip-hop wouldn’t sound the way it does without Mannie Fresh. The Nola representative earned his stripes on the local DJ circuit in the late 1980s, before going on to become the primary production force behind the Cash Money Records empire. Laying down the entire beat palette on multiple LPs for B.G., Juvenile, Hot Boys, Lil Wayne, and Big Tymers, Mannie Fresh sculpted the big, bangin’, and brassy sound of the Southern bling-rap movement at its boldest and brightest.
In a public conversation in New Orleans, Mannie Fresh discussed Nola rap history, his time with Cash Money Records, the effects and aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and more.
Hosted by [applause] Jeff Mao It is our very, very… Our pleasure to welcome a legendary producer, DJ, New Orleans musical legend, Mr. Mannie Fresh. Mannie Fresh Thank y’all. Jeff Mao What’s up, sir? Thank you for being here. Mannie Fresh Man. Thank you, thank you. Thank all y’all. Jeff Mao I see everybody’s been sitting in the room has been listening to some of the
sounds coming from this little machine over here. What have we been listening
to just in the last few minutes? Mannie Fresh Some of them was just some beats I did this week that’s what I was playing
earlier that came out my MPC [Music Production Controller]. And I got a collection of beats, I don’t know,
probably over a year. That’s on here. It’s probably about 200 beats right
here. I did maybe, I think, ten this week or whatever. I was amped about this. Jeff Mao So a sneak preview of some future hits. Tell us, what do you usually work on?
What’s your preferred machinery? What’s your preferred method of creating? Mannie Fresh I kind of don’t have one machine that I stick to, but I like vintage machines.
I kind of do the [E-mu] SP-1200, first MPCs, the EPS. Jeff Mao Still? Mannie Fresh Yeah, still. Jeff Mao After all these years, still? Mannie Fresh I’m computer illiterate, basically. I don’t get the new programs. No
disrespect to them. I’m just not a Fruity Loop guy. [laughs] Jeff Mao What is it about, besides the fact that you don’t want to deal with the
computers, but what is it about the sound of those machines that appeals to
you? Mannie Fresh The SP-1200 is an analogue machine, I don’t know, probably 12-bit, so it gives
you that real grimy, grimy sound. It can’t be duplicated. Everything today is
digital, is clean. And some songs, they need that. And for me to program, I actually
got to touch something. I can’t click on nothing. I got to touch it to feel
it, you know? Sometimes I’ll even use electric drums and MIDI them up to the
drum machine just to have that real drum feel. It’s pretty much on how you was
brought up. I was brought up programming with a drum machine. This era is a
different thing, it’s your MacBook and some headphones. Jeff Mao So, I guess you sit down, you decide you’re going to make a beat. What’s the first
thing you do? Mannie Fresh Wow. Most of the beats are, to me, is what I’m feeling that day. It’s an
expression of what I’m going through that day. If it’s gloomy, the beat will
probably sound gloomy. [laughs] If I’m happy, then the beat will probably sound happy.
You know how some people, I guess they have their little creative thing or
whatever. I kind of sit down everyday and do beats, so it’s really on what’s
going on with me emotionally. That’s what my beats turn out to… Put it like this,
I can’t wait until I run out of money, then go back in the studio. A lot of
cats, when they start recording it’s like, “OK, I’m out of money so now I
need to go do something.” It’s pretty much my job is what I love. I do it
everyday all day. You know, I’m in front my drum machine. It’s pretty much an expression
of what I was going through that day. Jeff Mao Do you start with a rhythm track first, or do you have melodic things in your
head that, figures of things that you decide you want to put down? Mannie Fresh The crazy thing, a beat could start with me in the middle of the night. I’ll
have a bassline in my head and get up and record it and go lay back down and
then finish it tomorrow. It’s not really, like I said, it’s not a process. I
can’t say I start with drums first or I start… I can have a hook in my head and the best thing I could do is probably write it down so I can remember it tomorrow and then start from there. The whole song might
come together. Some of the songs, to me, that’s been the biggest hits… The
biggest hits for me probably came together within five minutes. It was just
that I was listening to something and I was, “It need one more song,” and it
just all came together. I really don’t think I have a process. It’s just, I
don’t know, it’s madness. That’s all I can tell you. [laughs] Jeff Mao When we talked to Walter [Ramsey], obviously, a lot of the conversation
focused on the lineage and the history as far as New Orleans music with the
brass band and everything like that. It’s definitely also very true in your
family as far as your background. I wonder if you might talk about that a
little bit, how you first got into music. Mannie Fresh Well, my dad was a DJ, a street DJ. My Christmas gifts pretty much was
instruments. I got turntables, mixers, stuff like that. For years I never got
it. I was just, “What is that?” And I guess somewhere around 12, I got interested
in it, started messing with turntables, started messing with mixers, guitars
or whatever, keyboards. From there it just took off. My background is a
musical background. And even the heritage of this city is crazy as far as
Kermit Ruffins or whatever. We
went to high school together. We had band class together, and none of us
really took band class serious. We just was in there just doing what we do. It
was just kind of like, “OK, this is what you like.” I actually even tried to
take piano lessons, but it was more so of somebody trying to teach me Bach or
something and I’m just, “I don’t get it.” So that didn’t work for me. It was
like, “If I’m going to learn this, I’m going to learn it on my own.” I just
think even this city is the soul that go with it. It’s kind of like you’ve got
to have your own elements and everything got to be in place. That’s all. Jeff Mao When you say your father was a street DJ, what sort of stuff was he doing? Mannie Fresh When hip-hop came along, my dad was one of the first people that played hip-hop here. I just remember back in the day, my dad would bring home Battle of
the DJ trophies. I’m like, wow. As I got older he started bringing me on the
gigs. The first thing I fell in love with was the groupies. [laughs] I was like, “Wow,
I think I’m going to be a DJ.” [laughs] I’m not going to even say, music
kind of got my interest first. It was just all the attention that the DJ got.
It was like, “Wow, the party can’t rock without the DJ, everything is focused
around the DJ.” And it’s kind of like, I was, “Well, you know what? That’s the
spot where I want to be at in life.” Jeff Mao What sort of stuff was he playing around you when you were a kid? Mannie Fresh Marvin Gaye. Mostly soul. I could go on for forever with that, on Cameo, R&B music, Run DMC. I remember when “It’s Like That” came out and we had
the 12” and my dad played it and I was, you know, literally cursed. I was,
“This is the greatest sh-- in the world.” He was, “What you just said?”
[laughs] The crazy thing is you can ask anybody who was a neighbor in this
city that knew my dad, knew my family, they would be like, “Yeah, they threw block
parties all the time.” Anything that was hot around that time he played it. It
was just music from the ‘70s to the ‘80s, whatever went on, up until when,
like I said, when hip-hop first jumped off, it was kind of like I got
introduced to it through my dad. Jeff Mao What neighborhood did you guys…? Mannie Fresh In the Seventh Ward. Jeff Mao I guess then, when did you first start doing your own parties and becoming a
part of the DJ community? Mannie Fresh Junior high school. I would say my first time doing parties or whatever I was
in junior high school. It was kind of like my dad explained it to me, how
contracts go and just kind of go out there and fish around. I was kind of
doing it around my house, doing block parties. My first gig ever was a house
party. We had mad equipment already. I’m not going to tell you it went great,
because it didn’t. It’s nothing like having a reality check of somebody going,
“You suck!” [laughs] That kind of put me on game right there and made me
want to get it together even more so. I would say, truthfully, my first gigs
was in junior high school. I started with house parties. Jeff Mao When did you turn the corner when people didn’t come up to you and tell you,
“You suck!” Mannie Fresh I just thought you could just play records basically. I get it. You’ve got DJs
like that. It’s like, OK, hip-hop came along and you had all these DJs, like
Grandmaster Flash, that was doing breakbeats and that’s what the crowd wanted.
They pretty much wanted that show. It’s like, OK, you’ve got all this nice
equipment. You’re dressed the part, you got your glove on and all that. Like,
you going to be badass, and you’re just dropping one song after another.
[laughs] I just got, like I said, a brutal reality check of, “You know what?
You got to get your timing together, your skills and all that, it’s not just
playing records.” Jeff Mao Tell me about New York Incorporated. What was that? Mannie Fresh New York Incorporated was established by, of course, a guy who was from New
York, and they actually moved to New Orleans. They was one of the premier DJ
groups, light show, everything. I just pretty much had speakers, turntables.
New York Incorporated came with it. They had the ultimate light show. They had
all the breakbeats. I really never knew where some of these songs came from or
whatever. The guy, Denny D, who was the founder of New York Incorporated, when
he first came down, he introduced us to transforming and all that. We didn’t
know nothing about that. We just kind of was, “I can blend two records or
whatever.” All that was phenomenal. I remember around that time, it was this
group called Jam Patrol, Rockers Revenge. I’m just naming y’all New Orleans
history of DJ groups. Let me see who else? Brown Clown. A couple of groups or
whatever. But everybody decided to have this DJ battle for whatever who would
be street supremacy. This was probably in the early ‘80s, and New York
Incorporated was just getting established, but the guy, Denny D, he won the
competition, and that was my first time actually seeing him but I wasn’t with
New York Incorporated. But, after seeing everything that he did, I ain’t going to
even lie, I went home, copied it, bit his style or whatever, learned how to
transform, did all of that. I kind of got my little street cred was I was from
there, I was just going around just taking on anybody who wanted it with me.
It kind of got the attention of New York Incorporated. They were like, “This
young kid, he pretty much can do everything.” So New York Incorporated seeked
me out, and next thing you know, I was rocking with them. That went on for, I
don’t even know, probably ten years, ten years strong in this city. Jeff Mao Were you known as Mannie Fresh even back then? Mannie Fresh Yeah, I’ve been Mannie Fresh forever. Fresh is even cool to say now again.
[laughs] Jeff Mao It came back, it’s been so long. Mannie Fresh It came back. Jeff Mao One thing I read was an interview with you where you talked about your setup
back then doing parties, and I guess it was the prevalent style, not just a DJ
DJing with two turntables but with the 808 and the keyboards as part of
the whole thing. Very much like how old school cats in the Bronx used to do
with the beatbox and stuff. Can you talk about that a little bit, how that
came into being? Mannie Fresh I just wanted to have something different from just the average DJ. If you see
a DJ, normally you see just two turntables and a mixer. I was, “What could I
do to bring another element to the game?” So I wind up getting the 808 and I
had this Moog keyboard that I got from my dad. The only thing I did all the
time was practice basslines. Pretty much I knew any song that came out, I
could play the bassline to it. I was like, “I wonder how this would turn out
at a party, if I ran beats off my 808 and ran some basslines with a hot
synthesizer.” The next you know it just caught on like wildfire. It was to the
point where people stopped asking me to play records. It was more like, “Can
you turn on the beat box and do that thing that you do?” Like I said, it was
the new element, and it kind of changed the hip-hop of New Orleans. It made a
lot of other DJs look into it where, it’s instruments, now you’ve got to go
hard. You can’t just bring turntables. I think that element right there even
gave me, I guess, the guts and everything to produce because it turned into
people going, “Man, we like what you doing. Why don’t you try to do your own
thing?” Eventually, I started making up my own basslines, making up my own
little music and my own drum patterns, and it just turned into producing. Jeff Mao What was the first record that you produced? Mannie Fresh Wow, man. I would say [Gregory D]. That was “Freddie’s Back” in ’87, ’88, I
think. Jeff Mao And who is Gregory D? Mannie Fresh He’s a New Orleans MC, that’s one of the, I would say, legends in New Orleans
or whatever. How that came to be, I was in the studio working for a record
label and I was doing some scratching on records, because that was the big
thing, was just somebody who happened to be in New Orleans, and they was like, “We want some
scratches on the record. Can you do them?” So I did that. They asked me, “Do
you know of any MCs, anybody that raps?” I was, “Yeah, I know this one guy
that’s hot in the streets.” And Gregory D was hot at the time. He was kind of
notorious for rocking talent shows, and he always won the talent show, you
know, found him, went high and low to find him and brung him back to the
studio. They was, “Y’all want to make a record?” It was like, some kids who
never did that, I was like, “Yeah.” “You got a drum machine?” I was, “Yep, got
a drum machine.” The rest is history. That’s New Orleans history right there. Jeff Mao You guys actually formed a group then, you and Gregory D? Mannie Fresh Yeah, mm-hmm. Jeff Mao And put out a couple albums. Mannie Fresh Yeah, we put a couple, I would say maybe three albums. One of them was on RCA.
That was probably the first rap record to come out of New Orleans, first artist to be signed to a major label from New Orleans. Jeff Mao Even before that, though, the independent stuff that you guys did… Mannie Fresh Yeah. Jeff Mao There’s a track, “Buck Jump Time,” you don’t have that here. Mannie Fresh “Buck Jump Time,” there’s elements of second line [brass band parade music] basically and 808. I just
took a 808 and thought of, “OK, what could we do that incorporates this city
and the music that came from it?” “Buck Jump” is pretty much a dance that came
from New Orleans that, it goes with second line. I couldn’t even tell you the
date. I would say it was probably the early ‘90s whenever when we done this song, but
whenever this song came on in the city it was chaos. They went crazy. (music: Gregory D & Mannie Fresh – “Buck Jump Time”) When you heard that right there. Jeff Mao Let’s listen to a little bit of this. [music continues] So you’ve got the bassline from the sousaphone and… Mannie Fresh Well, the bassline was pretty much like, I mean, the drum machine that I was
using at that time had maybe, I would say, four seconds of sample time. The
bassline came from one little element, and I kind of had to make notes from
it. The horn came from, I don’t even know where I found the hit from, but it
was an SP-12 and the SP-12 used the Commodore disk drive that was as big as
this mixer [points to DJ mixer], and if you ever seen a floppy disk in life,
it looked like a sandwich, basically. [laughs] Jeff Mao What would you say is the birth of bounce music in the city? What’s the first
bounce record? Mannie Fresh Wow. The first bounce record… Well, I would say recorded probably would be TT
Tucker. But bounce was in the club way before he recorded it, and the elements
of bounce is kind of like, it’s old school New York hip-hop. It’s basically
kind of like an MC and a DJ and it’s two break records. From New Orleans is
mainly, I would say, 808 breakbeat records. That’s the choice, but it’s more
of call and responses, MC, his job is to rock the crowd and keep your
attention. It’s going to be riddles, it’s going to be rhymes, and it’s going
to be more so, I’m going to say something, and if you learn the song, if you
heard it enough, you know what I’m feeling and everything. It was basically
the elements of hip-hop, how hip-hop got started. It’s just that down-south we
prefer 808 beats. As a DJ, his timing, breaking down an 808 beat, two
turntables or whatever it is, just an MC, or some MCs. It was groups, as far
as when bounce first started, the elements was kind of like Grandmaster Flash
and the Furious Five. You come in, everybody got their parts on time or
whatever and all that. It took practice to do these songs, but it was just the
raw, raw elements of how hip-hop got started. But it was around before T
Tucker. He was the first person that I would say, I wouldn’t even say it was
on wax, it was a cassette tape that just floated around this city like crazy. Jeff Mao Now, the 808 was the key element to that, something that’s carried through a
lot of your music over the years. I guess, but for example, the sort of
records you’re talking about that came out of New York in the mid-’80s… There’s one
particular, I guess… Mannie Fresh Yes. The Show Boys. The song was called “Drag
Rap.” It was so popular down-
south that it was one verse in this where one of the MCs referred to himself
as Trigger Man, but we always did call the song “Trigger Man.” They renamed
the song “Trigger Man,” and the crazy thing is, I remember the guys who made
the song, when they came down in New Orleans, they didn’t know it was that
popular throughout the south, and they was kind of singing songs, actually
they got booked at a concert. It’s crazy because everybody wanted to know who
it was or whatever, so pretty much the whole city at the concert, they singing
all these songs, all the previous songs that they’ve done before this and it’s
kind of like you could hear crickets. The crazy thing is, nobody in the crowd
even knew it was them. They was just, “Well, who the hell is this? This just
some random group they put up here?” They go through three or four songs and
nobody is paying attention to them. And then when this song dropped, the club went
crazy. The whole spot, damn. I was, “Dude, this song, you can’t do no wrong.
You can sing this 12 times.” The nuts thing about this, back in the ‘80s and
the ‘90s, you had to play this record at least seven times, at least seven
times a night. You know what I’m saying? Really, you had to play this record,
and I’m not exaggerating, at least seven times. Jeff Mao The whole record or just the break part in the middle? Mannie Fresh The whole record. It kind of got into, OK, somebody flipped it over and
figured out, “Oh, the instrumental is even hotter.” [laughs] Jeff Mao Because it’s drag rap, it’s dragnet rap, right? Mannie Fresh Yeah. Jeff Mao It’s story rap. It’s kind of crazy. Mannie Fresh Yeah. From the relationship the song kind of grew. It went to Memphis. You know what
I’m saying? It kind of went throughout the south. It went from, well, even the
Midwest a little bit. It hit Saint Louis or whatever, and the song just became
this phenomenal sample. Like, if you was doing a bounce record, you had to use that
song. It was kind of like the crazy thing is the dudes who, like I said,
originally made it, never knew the song was ever that popular. Jeff Mao There’s a story of how you got into music that I kind of can’t believe, so you
have to confirm this. Mannie Fresh OK. Jeff Mao That you were going to college. Mannie Fresh Uh-huh. [affirmative] Jeff Mao What happened? You were supposed to be at college? What happened? Mannie Fresh I can’t believe you found that out. [laughs] Jeff Mao Where were you going? Mannie Fresh SUNO, actually. I was supposed to be in college and I had financial aid, but I
decided that I was going to go to California to make a record. I was, “You
know what? I’m just going to go to California and take my chances.” Packed up
my suitcase, nothing but records or whatever and a drum machine. For two
semesters my parents thought I was in college, but I was kind of like in the
crack motel or whatever. I took an internship at RCA, when I started
programming drums, with a drum machine or whatever, walked into a studio,
asked for a job cleaning up or whatever, gave me a job. I used to sit there
with my drum machine. And pretty much what used to come through the door was
country music, but I remember one particular time the drummer didn’t show up.
It was some country music or whatever. So I was like, “I got a drum machine, I
can program the drums however y’all want them.” They was just like, “Well what’s a
drum machine?” So I wind up plugging up my drum machine, doing like this one
beat. [beatboxes simple hip-hop beat] They was, “Wow, that’s close to
the drums. That’s all we need!” So for my next, I don’t know, probably three
weeks in California, I was programming country music. I was like, “It pays the
bills, I’m good with it.” [laughs] Jeff Mao Did those records come out? Mannie Fresh I don’t even know. I couldn’t even tell you who the artists were. I was just,
“What you want me to do? How do you want this to sound? Do you want a drum
roll? Do you want a tom?” Jeff Mao What happened then with the internship eventually? Mannie Fresh Eventually, well, my dad found out first, and being a true dad he was just
like, “Look, I don’t want to even be in this sh-- when it comes down.” He was,
“I’m going to let you follow your dream, whatever, but don’t say I knew, because your
mom is going to find out eventually.” It was kind of like how you have that
thing and your mom and them show up at school to check on you? That’s what
happened. My mom showed up at school to check on me and she was, “Where you
at?” At the time it wasn’t no cell phones or nothing like that. I heard from a
friend, he was, “Hey, your mom is out here checking on you.” I’m like, “Dude,
for real?” You know what I’m saying? I’m like, “You know what? I guess it’s
time for me to come home and tell her the truth.” I pretty much had to come
home, break it down. It was like, “You know what? I’ve just been doing
whatever my dream was. I really did not want to go to college.” I’m not saying
that nobody should take that for what it is, but I knew what I wanted to do in
life. I pretty much knew. It was more of, that was my parents’ dream. They was
just like, “You know what? We going to put you in school. Do this thing.” I
kind of knew. I ain’t going to say “Kind of,” 100% I knew this is
what I was going to do. This was it for me. Jeff Mao Now, was it through the internship that Gregory D got signed to RCA also? Mannie Fresh Yeah. On that internship, I met some good connections with RCA. At first it
started out with SWV. SWV was signed to Universal at the time and I did some
drum programming on that. At the time, the president was this guy named Skip
Miller. I kind of got close to him from everything that I was doing, from cleaning up to doing beats to whatever.
I was, “Hey, I’ve got a guy who I’ve been doing some songs with in New
Orleans. Would you give him a shot?” He was, “Hey, we’ll give y’all a shot.”
The crazy thing is even then I didn’t know about budgets, didn’t know how they
work or whatever, and they put us in the studio with some other producers, and
I pretty much already knew, with the other producers, everything that they was
doing or whatever. When I tell you how a session started out, I always say the
guy came into the studio on a skateboard and by the time we was finished he
was in a nice Cadillac. [laughs] He pretty much spent the whole budget for
the album or whatever, but, I didn’t know what was going on at the time, you know?
It was a learning lesson. I wouldn’t take nothing back that happened to me, in
all honesty. Jeff Mao I also read that you had wound up in Chicago at one point too, working with… Mannie Fresh Right after that I wind up in Chicago working with Steve
Hurley. Steve Hurley is kind of like the father of house
music, wound up doing some programming with him. It was more so, same deal. He
wind up doing a remix for me and Gregory D, and he was just, like, “Well, I
don’t think I can finish it.” I was, well, give me an example of house music,
what it is and what it sounds like. He sent me all these songs and all of them
had, [imitates 4/4 beat] “Doop, doop, doop, doop, doop-tss, doop-tss, doop-tss, doop-tss…’
I’m, “OK, another one?” “Doop-tss, doop-tss, doop-tss.” I was, “Anything else?” It was
like, “Doop-tss, doop-tss, doop-tss.” [laughs] I was, “All right, I can finish it up. I
can probably even put a few rolls or some snare rolls or something in it.” He
was, well, you know, “I got these other projects going on. If you could
program them drums real quick.” I was, “Man, honestly, I could do this in my
sleep.” [laughs] At the time that’s pretty much what house music sounded
like. Everything had that “Doop-tss, doop-tss, doop-tss, doop-tss.” There was nothing but a
909 and a clap on top of it. I learned a lot of business from him of, “Hey,
man, you’ve got to take care of your business. You can’t just do music.” At a
young age I was so in love with music, I wasn’t paying attention to nothing
but give me a drum machine and I love what I do. Even then it was big songs.
Steve Hurley was remixing Prince songs and stuff like that. I was just, “Well,
I’ll do the drums.” And I wouldn’t say he did anything to me or whatever, but I
just wasn’t paying attention to how big those songs were. I was just like, “Oh, I
love this. I’m just like the programmer or whatever.” Then when you get older
and you think about, “Wow, that was the purple dude song, it’s Prince!” [laughs] Jeff Mao From there you wound up back here? Mannie Fresh Yeah. Jeff Mao So you decided you’re through with school, through with the internship. You
were in Chicago. You came back home. Mannie Fresh Yep. Wind up here, started DJing again, back in the club or whatever,
doing my club scene thing. And eventually, started remixing. Basically
everything that was coming out. If I got a cappella to something, I put my own
version to it. It started catching on in the streets of New Orleans. It would
be like, “Oh, dude, you got the Mannie Fresh mix. You gotta get the Mannie
Fresh mix.” It was getting the attention of a lot of people. It was more so
labels and people going, “Hey, you should do your own thing, man, you’ve got
something.” Around that time bounce was starting to take off, and it was kind
of one-dimensional. It was just like I said, it was the birth of hip-hop. It
was just a DJ and some MCs, and I just decided to like, “OK, I’m going to put some
music behind this, put some breaks in it, scratching,” whatever and all that,
and I think that elevated it to a whole other level. Like, wow, you could
really take elements of this, and… Honestly, I was kind of listening to
everything. If you listen to “Back That Azz Up,” [by Juvenile ft. Mannie Fresh] it’s really classical music. Jeff Mao I was going to say. It had that kind of… Mannie Fresh It was kind of like that classic… I was, “Well, what can I do that…” I was
thinking that’s going to catch everybody, all around the board. I was like, “If I
put this 808 “Trigger Man” beat behind it and I put some classical music on
top of it, I think I’ll catch everybody and it will wind up being a
big hit.” Jeff Mao I guess that’s when you met up as far as the early days of Cash Money Records. Mannie Fresh Yeah. The first generation of Cash Money was pretty much more of DJ type
records. Cash Money was a bounce label before it was a rap label. It was just
all bounce artists, underground bounce artists from New Orleans, and the first
generation of it was more, like I said, it was DJ records. It was, let’s just
say I took an 808 loop and I found “Wishing On a Star,” [by Rose Royce] the beginning of that,
the music. I would loop that on top of a 808 beat, and it’s a hood classic,
and put some keys on it. The crazy thing about it was I was the digging-a-crate-type person then. I already knew nobody in this city ever heard that
song. You know what I’m saying? It was just like, “Wow, what is that?” Jeff Mao From the early days of Cash Money, what sort of artists came in that took it
to the next level of what it became? Mannie Fresh The late, great Magnolia Shorty. She was signed to Cash Money. U.N.L.V., this
guy Pimp Daddy, Lil Slim, B.G., early, he was signed. B.G. and Wayne were
signed… I don’t know if you kind of googled him, they look like, I don’t know,
smurfs or whatever. [laughs] They were signed to Cash Money since they were,
I don’t know, probably 12 or something. The early generation and the early
songs, just like I said, it was based on bounce music. It wasn’t really even
based on rap. This guy, Kilo G, he was a rap artist, Mr. Ivan, also a rap
artist, and I guess everybody was bouncing at one time in New Orleans. It just
got to the point where it was, “Dude, it’s just way overdone right now.” It
was, “What can we do? What’s going to be the next element?” B.G. turned out to
be a pretty good rapper. We was just like, “Well, let’s try a rap record, but we’ll try
to have bounce elements to it.” The first rap record that came out kind of on
Cash Money, was this song called “Uptown
Thang” by B.G., and the streets loved it. It took off. From there, it was just like, “OK, I don’t know about
this bounce thing.” But Juvenile came after him. And when Juvenile came, it was
more his raps were different from anybody else that was doing bounce music.
His raps weren’t that call and response type thing. It was more, he had a
story to tell. It had story form to it. It was like, “Wow, that brings a whole
other element to it.” It was more so of the 400
Degreez album [Juvenile’s third studio album], he pretty much knew those songs. It was like somebody came to you and they sang
all those songs to you. When he was rapping them to me, my wheels was
spinning, because I was like, “Wow, I’ve never heard nobody from New Orleans
with that kind of flow.” If you heard the song “HA,” you already know it was, damn,
I’m just looking at him, like, “Damn, wow, I’m thinking of a beat right now.”
I was, “Y’all got to sign him.” That just brung it to a whole ‘nother element,
because nobody ever heard that before. I think that’s, to me, on 400 Degreez
is well, I ain’t going to say most, but one of the, I guess, elite albums from
the south. When you think of artists from the south or whatever and you start going into
categories, like what would be ten of the hot albums, I would definitely put
400 Degreez in it. Jeff Mao Speaking of the roster and the artists on Cash Money who really took it to
that next level at that time, you know, with the Hot Boys [Lil Wayne, Juvenile, B.G. and Turk]; I
wonder, with the four of them, as a producer, just musically, what about each
one of them did you find distinctive? What did each one of them bring to the
table in terms of personality or style or chemistry to make that whole sort of
clique really and take off? Mannie Fresh In all honesty, it wasn’t really about the four of them that made it great. It
was more of a team effort that made it great. If you have team, like it feels,
there’s really nothing that you can’t do. It was friendly competition with
them. That’s what made the songs so great. It was kind of like if somebody
heard, if Wayne did a verse and Juvie thought it was, “You know what, man? He
killed me on that,” he went and rewrite his verse. Then Wayne came back and
said, “Well, man, why did he have to rewrite his verse? I’m going to rewrite
mine.” The friendly competition of it made it a great group, and I just think
even the elements that they brung, at the time you had Juvie, who was the
older guy but he was the lyricist. You had Wayne, who had, I don’t know, his
characters that he did and his sound effects were nuts. And you had B.G. who was
the streets. He had that street element that was crazy. You had Turk, the dude
who all the girls liked. You know what I’m saying? You pretty much had the
perfect group. Jeff Mao Well, on a track like “We On Fire,” or something like that, everybody rhymes two bars. It’s kind of an unusual structure for a hip-hop song. It’s usually more, you take a verse, you take a verse, you take a verse,
but it’s so kind of integrated… Mannie Fresh Even with that, it was kind of like, I came from the old school, even though
with me producing, and what I used to make them do, I ain’t going to say
“Make,” but I was, “Why don’t y’all listen to Grandmaster Flash and the
Furious Five, like Rock Steady Crew? Just kind of listen to how they go in and
go out; and how they have elements that make the songs so much hotter or
whatever.” Even when it came to the Hot Boys, I was, “How can we make four
guys sound incredible?” It can’t be, “OK, you rap, then I rap, then I rap.”
It’s kind of like, “OK, everybody’s seen that before.” But hip-hop kind of,
even though everybody had the element of what I said, the old school rap, we
forgot about it. So I was like, “OK, if I can introduce that back with new
beats or whatever, it would be hot.” It was more of me taking elements of old-school hip-hop, going, “OK, if I could put new beats over this and y’all actually get it…” Like I said, the rest is history. Jeff Mao I’m also curious to know, just from that time, No Limit broke nationally
before Cash Money. What was the dynamic between the two labels in Louisiana at
the time? Mannie Fresh The thing of it is, it was tension. I know you used “Dynamic,” but it was
tension, because it was the song that Cash Money put out, called “It’s An
Uptown Thang” and “[I’m] Bout It.” Basically, it was like
somebody come and visit you and took what you was doing. “Bout It” was hot in
the streets, but it was something that Cash Money created. It was more so of
Master P at the time was living in California or something, came down and
heard what was going on, and it was like, “OK, I’ll take that and I’ll go
back.” Next thing you know, we hear this song, “Bout It Bout
It,” and it’s nationwide and it’s like, “OK,
you’re not going to say thank you or nothing? You just kind of took that and
ran with it.” The good thing about it was it made everybody on Cash Money
angry and hungry. You know what I’m saying? It was like, “I can’t believe he
did that.” It made them want to, “You know what? The only revenge we going to
get is we going to have to get on the national level. We going to have to get
out there. We going to have to work twice as hard and make songs twice as
better or whatever, to get on that level.” Because when “Bout It Bout It” came out it
was like Master P was just a phenomenon or something. What he did was, I don’t
even know. I mean, y’all know Master P. Come on. Everybody was, “He couldn’t
do no wrong.” Anything that he said, it was just like, damn, Master P could
breathe on a record. There was the new Master P, and he’s just… [grunts /
laughs] He dropped something every day. The crazy thing, I guess, what
happened, just like I said, it was more so of he came to New Orleans, which he
is a New Orleans native but he wasn’t living in New Orleans at the time. He
came to New Orleans and pretty much bit off all the slangs and whatever, it
was more what Cash Money created, and just kind of ran off with them and made
bank. Jeff Mao At the time you’re doing all the music for all the artists on the label? Mannie Fresh Yep. Jeff Mao During those years, what’s a day in the life of Mannie Fresh like? Mannie Fresh I’m kind of still the same way. I’m a studio junkie. I would be, “What time
y’all getting to the studio?” That’s me. I’m at the studio. I’m the first one
there, the last one to leave. That was pretty much my life all the time. I
live, breathe music. If I’m not DJing, I’m in the studio. It’s kind of like
nothing really excited me to, I guess, lift my head up off of my drum machine.
It could be a murder going on in the room and they just be like, “He’s not
stopping what he’s doing. That dude programming drums. He not tripping.” Cash
Money sessions was basically a party all the time. The earlier Cash Money
sessions, it was drinks, girls, whatever and all that. I guess it never
distracted me, because I think certain songs kind of need that element, but
it’s really only you and I guess what your focus is. I was always focused on
what I was doing, and a day in the life of me is that. Jeff Mao Maintaining that pace of having to create that volume of music, you know,
doing entire albums for multiple artists at the time wasn’t something that was
difficult for you at all I guess then? Mannie Fresh No. Jeff Mao I’m sorry, go ahead. Mannie Fresh I would say, I guess a lot of cats might burn out on it. I’ve always said
this: When I stop having fun, then I’ll stop. As long as I’m having fun with
what I’m doing, I enjoy it. I guess fun brings creativity, and if you surround
yourself with good people, then you’re going to always be creative. It’s like
if something is negative in your life, you pretty much got to move it out your
life or whatever, or you going to start… To make a long story short, if you
hang around trash, you’re going to start smelling like trash. Jeff Mao Now, you also made the transition to appearing on records and doing some Big
Tymers [Mannie Fresh’s group] stuff. I guess tell us a little bit about that. Mannie Fresh Even that wasn’t purposely. It was just more so of, “OK, I’m just rapping
all of a sudden.” The next thing you know, I’m, “OK, I’m in front of a
camera.” I never set out to be that producer or whatever, “OK, I want to be
in the limelight,” or, “I want to be that one,” or whatever. I kind of look back sometimes.
It was earlier Cash Money stuff, and I still kind of look like the oddball.
[laughs] If you on a sofa and everybody else has got on 12 chains and you’re
just sitting in the corner like, yeah, [laughs] They’re like, “Well, what about you?”
You’re like, “Yeah, I want to save the ozone layer and the whales,” and
everybody else is like, “Yeah, my earrings cost 50.” [laughs] I would say I
never really set out to do that. It just came along with everything with
music. Jeff Mao But the Big Tymers were hugely successful too, though. Mannie Fresh Yeah, but the Big Tymers, even the raps that I was saying, most people were,
“Well, did you think of that or whatever?” I was, “No, I just said what I felt
that day.” You know what I’m saying? It’s like even right now if I go in the
studio, yes, there are some things that I’ll write down, but for the most part
I don’t write them down. I just kind of say what I feel. And I feel like
that’s the best songs anyway, you just being true to you. I’ve never said that
I could rap, never said I was the MC, but I’m good at rhyming. [laughs] Jeff Mao Of those years, what do you take from that experience of being with Cash Money
and helping build it to what it is still today, which is a huge entity in the
music? Mannie Fresh I don’t have no gripes with Cash Money, because Cash Money is pretty much the
label, and I know in my heart, it’s my DNA or whatever, to a certain degree, you know, I
helped build it. You’ve got to look at it. It’s like planting a tree. You
start with a seed, and then you grow. I look at it like a lot of artists that
I’ve done songs with early in their careers, they come from me. That’s good
enough for me, to know that, “Wow, you had a hand in that guy’s career.” He
started somewhere and you did your job. Look where he is right now. It’s kind
of like something that Jay-Z said, “If you really made me, then make another
one of me.” Basically, what that means is, I don’t really feel like I was a
one-hitter-quitter or whatever, because that could go on and on. After I left
Cash Money, Jay-Z’s first hit was with Mannie Fresh. A couple of T.I. hits was
with Mannie Fresh. I’ve done some big songs for some big people, and God-willing,
I’m going to do some more. I don’t have no gripes with them. It’s business.
That’s what it is when it came down to Cash Money. I was so in love with
music, and I’ve said it in interviews, I wasn’t paying attention to my
business, and I wasn’t really paying attention to what it was generating. When
it got time for it to count, it wasn’t like they stepped up and did what they
were supposed to do. Jeff Mao What kind of terms are you on with folks from the label nowadays? Mannie Fresh We speak, that’s about it. It’s like, “Hi, hello.” A quick, “Hi, hello.” Jeff Mao What sort of advice would you pass along based on that experience? Mannie Fresh I would say, definitely in this, you have to pay attention to your paperwork.
Don’t get caught up in that trap of, “I love music so much to…” Well, I would say
this, let me rephrase that. Don’t do homeboy business. Homeboy business is,
“That’s my boy, he would never do me that.” Yes, he would, because money is
the root to all evil. Some people can’t handle it. You could grow up with
somebody, and these are guys who, like I said, I grew up with, been knowing
them pretty much all my life or whatever, but when money came, things got
strange. And I say that to anybody: I can’t do homeboy business no more. I’d just
rather you just pay me for what I’m doing and I’ll give you what I owe you and
we good. Other than that, we can’t really talk about it because like right
now, there’s some guys in here that’s friends with somebody for a long time or
whatever and you’re thinking about doing something, but when it really comes
to you saying, “OK, I’m going to bring my attorneys in,” and they’re like, “Why you
got to do that?” Because you have to do that. That’s what it is. Jeff Mao Emotionally, how did you sort of adjust with that change in your career? Mannie Fresh I would say emotionally it hasn’t done nothing to me. It’s a learning lesson.
Everything in life is a learning lesson. On top of that, if you sit around and
pout about stuff, you’ll never be who you’re supposed to be in life. You’ll
never get where you’re supposed to get. So I just look at it as a stepping stone,
just another obstacle I’ve got to get over, and keep it moving. Jeff Mao I also kind of wanted to touch on one thing, just in terms of the way the
music was being interpreted at its height with that Cash Money stuff and the
stuff coming out of the south in recent years. For a while anyways, people up
north would get defensive or feel territorial about how hip-hop from down-
south had more or less taken over and become more or less the popular form. I
just wanted to get your thoughts on that, because you obviously have so much
reverence for the history of the music. How did it make you feel to have sort
of like, all the New York people, whoever, griping a little bit about the guys
down south coming up? Mannie Fresh See, what had happened was, [laughs] while everybody else was beefing, the south was
making songs about, I guess, partying or whatever and having a good time. The
east and the west were so busy with “I hate you” and “I hate you.” While all
that was going on, we started making records about, “You know what? Hey, we
just want to have a good time.” And good-time music just started taking off. I
don’t even see why nobody else can’t figure it out, what happened. They just
like, “Well, the south kind of just came through here and took over.” Even
right now you still kind of have those beefs from the east and the west. It’s
like, “Wow, if you all figure it out and stop beefing, it’s almost like y’all
can get back on.” The south is kind of like, the home of the independent label.
We know how to hustle, like our life depend on it. You know what I’m saying? We
going to talk you into buying records, if we’ve got to aggravate you to the
point of, “Hey man, buy this tape, buy this tape.” And we come from that, from
selling them out the trunk or whatever. Everybody else is looking for that
hand. They’re like, “OK, we need a label to do this and we need to get set
up, we need to do this and all that.” That’s like talking, I don’t even know,
gibberish, to me. If I go to a label and they say, “Well, we’ve got to set up your
video and we need this and we need that.” I’m like, “Why? Why do we have to do
that? We could just put it out and see what happens. If it don’t work, we
going to put another song out.” That’s kind of like the south model. We just
keep putting records out until something sticks. Everywhere else is more of,
they take it as, “Well, you’ve got to have the proper setup, you’ve got to
have somebody to work the record, you’ve got to do this, you’ve got to do
that.” That’s your job. You’ve got to do all of that. You’ve got many faces
down south. You’re the CEO, you work the record, you’re the DJ, you’re all of
that. [laughs] I think that’s the difference. Most people down south, their life
depend on, and the bills and everything else depend on, them selling them
records, so they’re going to find a way to make it happen. Jeff Mao I wonder also, just with this particular city, just with how S&P [Social Aid and Pleasure] clubs have that sort of tradition of community and people sort of
coming together; if that sort of just is something that’s also, around here
anyways, ingrained as far as people supporting local musicians and acts and hip-hop crews. Mannie Fresh That’s all down-south. I just gave y’all an example of homeboy business, but
we do have one good thing kind of like we’re artists in the south. We leave
the people who we need to leave out our conversations out. It’s kind of like,
if I went to David Banner, I could get a beat from David Banner. I don’t need
to talk to somebody at his label or whatever or nothing like that, because it
becomes confusion when I got to talk to who before I talk to you? He could
just tell me yes or no, and collaborations down-south kind of happen, “Oh, you
in my town, what you doing? Let’s go to the studio.” And that’s all it is. I’m
going to give you back that favor. “I’ll do your song, you do my song.”
There’s no paperwork or whatever, and that’s the good thing about down south.
You’ll have somewhere where, let’s just say I could probably never get a song
from Mary J. Blige without paying Mary J. Blige. She’d be like, “I don’t care
who you are. I need my money.” The good thing about down-south, and we really
care about our art, it’s just like if an artist fall off and you really like him, you’re
going to do everything that you can do to help him. You know, we really care. “Hey man,
you had a bad album? Anything you need from me, I got you.” Especially if I’m
a fan. You know, it’s like, OK, you’ve got elements from that guy too. You took some
of his elements to make your music. So I think we have that element. We have
that over a lot of other artists coming from the east and the west. We
actually don’t put the politics into when it comes to artists. Even around
here, I could go to Trombone Shorty, “Hey man, I’m in a studio.” I could go to
the Stooges [Brass Band], “I’m in the studio right now, I need some horns.” I could go to
the dude who’s shooting right now, they did my video. I just called them up,
“Hey, dude, I’m ready to shoot a video.” “Where do you want us to be at?” You
know what I’m saying? It’s real life. They actually really shot the video.
They was like, “Hey, give me this camera and we going to do it.” And I was like, “I’m going to
have the camera then.” And we shot the video. Jeff Mao Now, yesterday you told me you were on the set of
Treme [TV series], right? Mannie Fresh Yeah. Jeff Mao Tell us a little bit about your perspective on the show and what your
involvement is. Mannie Fresh Actually, I’m playing myself on the show, and what I was doing… Jeff Mao It’s not like somebody… Mannie Fresh It’s not a character. I’m actually playing myself on the show. The funny thing
happened was, if you’ve seen the show you know it has its serious moments and
it kind of has, every now and then it might have a little comedy in it or
whatever. But it was more so of, they asked me first to do… What did I have to
do first? Oh, an answering machine. Basically, it was somebody making a phone
call to me about getting a beat. They was just like, “Could you record yourself? How would
your voicemail sound?” I was, “Do you really want me to do it how my
voicemail?” He was, “Yeah.” But they had a script, and I kind of read it, and I
was like, “No, that’s not what I would say.” They’re, like, “Say it how you would
say it.” Basically, I want to say I said something, I’m just going to give it
to y’all raw, like what I said. I was like, “Yo, what’s up, this is Mannie
Fresh and your baby mama’s in the background.” I was like, “On the real, if
you’re calling me to borrow money, I think you should just hang up. If you’re
calling me and you owe me money and you’re not ready to pay me back, I think
you should just hang up.” I was like, “If you’re calling me to spend some
money, leave a message. Bye, bitches.” When I did it, the guy was, “Wow!”
[laughs] He was like, “You know what? We’re going to write you a couple more parts
in the show.” [laughs] Jeff Mao Yeah, you got the walk-on part. I asked Walter the same thing with the show.
As far as it portraying the experiences of people here, post-[Hurricane] Katrina, what was
the experience like for you? Where were you at the time? Mannie Fresh When that happened I was on tour in Canada. The crazy thing is I wasn’t really
taking that serious, because anybody around here could tell you, we done had
hurricane threats so many times until we just like, “You know what? We just
going to go get drunk. Nothing’s going to happen.” That was just the
attitude we had around New Orleans. Like I said, I was in Canada and heard on
the new or whatever, they was like, “OK this is going to be the big one. This one
is going to wipe New Orleans out.” I was just like, “Nah, man, we going to be
all right.” After the hurricane actually hit, I was, “Man, this sh-- is
serious.” So I started making phone calls, couldn’t get nobody in New Orleans,
so I go to the counter at the airport in Canada trying to get back home, and
this lady just killed me. She was, “New Orleans is wiped off the map.” [laughs] She
just made it gloomy, it was just horrible, like she was, “There is no more New
Orleans. Nothing. Everything is wiped off the map.” Jeff Mao I thought Canadians were nice. Mannie Fresh I was, “Damn, wiped off the map?” She was, “Yeah.” To make matters even worse,
she was, like, “Everybody drowned.” [laughs] By that time, me and the dudes
that I’m with, I’m like, “Damn!” So you start thinking about your family and
everything. I was, “Everybody drowned?” She was like, “Everybody drowned. The
city is wiped off the map.” I’m like, “Well, fly us anywhere close to New
Orleans.” We wind up flying into Dallas or whatever, and I’m thinking, “OK,
I’ll finally get in touch with my family.” They’re in Houston. I was, “OK, I’m
going to drive down to Houston or whatever.” I started making phone calls, you
know, as far as insurance stuff or whatever, checking on my house or whatever, and my car,
and they telling me the same thing. I was, “Yeah, I left my car at the airport
before I left.” Before I could say anything, the lady is, “The airport,
gone. Your car, gone. Where do you want us to send the check?” I was like,
“Damn!” Just like I said, I called on my house to check. I was, well, you
know, “I’m just calling, if I got to start a claim early.” They’re like, “Your
house gone.” I was, “Damn! Really? It’s that serious?” It really didn’t sink
in to me because, like I said, I was on the road and if you can’t see something… I remember finally when I
settled down, I was watching the news, and I see all these people stuck in the
Superdome or whatever. I was, “Man, it is real serious.” I mean, it’s
indescribable. I guess that’s when, to me, I would say that’s kind of a
turning point for me, because it made me realize that family before
everything, because you take things for granted a lot of times. Because at
that time, I was cool. Like I said, I had just left Cash Money. I had an album
out. I was in Canada. I’d done something they’d never done. I was touring
different places that they never been, so I was like, “Well, I’m happy. I’m making
good money and I’m doing this.” This happens and you kind of think that that
would never happen to you, nobody around you or whatever. Then you see certain
things, and I just remember feeling like this dark feeling over me by seeing
what was going on in the Superdome. And I was, “This is a city in the United
States and it’s getting treated like it was a third world country or somewhere.”
Nobody’s really coming to the aid, nobody’s doing nothing or whatever, and to
know people, where you could actually… Because pretty much everybody in this
city knows everybody, it’s a small city. When you’re watching the news and you
actually see a few people that you know stuck somewhere and there’s nothing
you could do about it. That’s like family to you as well. Like I said, it just
taught me a lesson right then and there. I’m like, you know what? If I could
live some more on this planet, I would definitely put my family before
everything. Jeff Mao How long did you stay in Houston for? Mannie Fresh Man, I actually still have a house in Houston. I wind up thinking that I was
going to live there. I was like, “Pretty much nothing to go back to.” The
silly thing that happened, me being in Houston as long as I was, everybody
will tell you here, we had kind of like this shut-out from New Orleans for
almost a month. They wasn’t letting nobody in the city or whatever. So I’m
thinking, “OK, I started my process. Everything is cool or whatever.” I
pretty much live on the outskirts of New Orleans, and when I finally get to go
home, I’ve already did my insurance claim and all that. When I finally get to
go home, I get to my neighborhood is trees blowing, kids playing, my house is
straight. Nothing really never happened. It was more so of I was like, “You
know what? I think I’m going to stay in Houston for a while.” I’ve kind of
been back and forth ever since, but this is home for me, and anybody around
here could tell you, you see me everywhere. I kind of float around. Jeff Mao From spending time here, how do you see things have recovered or coming back? Mannie Fresh You got places in New Orleans, dude, where it looks like the storm just hit.
If you visit it, they going to make it look nice for you. If you stand in this
area around here, it looks like a hurricane never hit, but if you kind of go
on the Ninth Ward or Seventh Ward or whatever, you would think the hurricane
just hit yesterday. There’s a lot of areas where it looks like, like I said,
it just hit yesterday. Everybody is, “Where the money went?” But that’s
Louisiana politics. Hey, nobody ever knows where the money at around here. Jeff Mao I guess, just as far as in recent years, you’ve said in interviews that you’ve
stayed a little bit low-key because of certain things, the adversity that
you’ve endured. I just wondered if you could touch on that at all. Mannie Fresh I guess pretty much with my sister getting, the violent way it happened, my
sister pretty much got murdered here a couple of, maybe two or three years ago
here, and I definitely right then and there kind of made up my mind that I was
done with New Orleans. But I always say through the help of just meeting some
young people here… Like, I don’t know, the Stooges, the dude, B-Mike, who shot my
video or whatever, his crew… They kinda, I’m just going to say it was more of a blessing.
They made me kind of rethink it. There’s still some positive creative people
here, but something like that will make you feel that way for a second. I
mean, when that happened, just think about it like this: When everything in
your life is going good, you kind of think that you’re untouchable. Well, you
feel that way, consciously. You don’t even know you feel that way. I kind of
had this whole thing of, life is great; you know what I’m saying? Nothing
can’t touch me. When that happened with my sister, it put me in a dark place.
I didn’t want to do music. I didn’t want to be nowhere around nobody who had
anything to do with New Orleans. Because what’s crazy to me, I felt like I
knew the streets. I know the streets. I know everything about the streets, so
it kind of was like, it came full circle of, it made me conscious of some of
the things that I was saying in rap songs and everything. Where I was like,
“Damn! This is the same crazy sh-- that I used to say in songs.” But you never
think it would knock on your door and come to you. It was more so of me
growing up and just… I don’t know. It just changed me as a person or whatever.
Put it like this: I’m at peace with it now. I could talk about it. At one time
I wouldn’t talk about it. You couldn’t even get me to touch a drum machine or
do music or whatever, because truthfully, my sister was my biggest fan. To her
I couldn’t do no wrong; anything that I did or whatever. It was just like
somebody’s who’s your soul and the closest person to you. If I had something… Put it like this, to hide, you know, because all of us have that, that was the
person who I confided in; you know what I’m saying? Not that it was right, but
that was the person who I could talk to, good and bad. To have that taken away
from you, it’s going to take some time to heal. I look at it like some of the
people, the newer people that I’ve met in this city, they’ve been a blessing.
They helped me get over that. That’s all I can say. Just from their words and
inspiration. Even if I’m on Twitter, I get people that say all the time,
“Dude, we miss you, what you doing, man? Come on, man. Get it right.” I see
people all the time that send their condolences, that send their prayers, so
I’m like, “You know what? It would be wrong for me to walk away from this city
just because [of] one person, or one bad seed.” The problem is this, pretty much
everybody in this city knows somebody in their family that died some kind of
way violently in this city. If nobody don’t speak up or nobody don’t do
something, that cycle going to keep on going. And to a certain degree I kind of
feel like I am the voice for the young generation, because I think I could be
heard a little bit more than they can. A lot of times to diffuse a situation
is just somebody opening their mouth, saying something. A lot of people are
scared to do that. I feel like it’s times where I’ve been in situations in
this city where it’s just, that’s all I have to do is say, “Come on, man.
Dude, that ain’t us. We ain’t got to do that.” And it goes away. So, it’s good and
bad. As long as your good outweigh your bad, I feel like, “Hey, you’re a
decent person to me.” Jeff Mao Sort of on that note, you’ve also said, as far as reassessing your priorities,
that you are, quote, “Too old for bling now.” Mannie Fresh Yeah. [laughs] Hey, if that’s your thing, do it. But I feel like at this point in my life,
there’s a lot of things I’m kind of… Mature. [laughs] I’m too old for that,
dude. On top of that, I guess, like I said, if it’s you, go do it, so be it,
but I don’t think I want to be somebody in a club where somebody’s like,
“What’s wrong with that old man? Why the fu-- you got on 12 chains and
three earrings?” [laughs] Jeff Mao Now, you obviously still produce and you have your label, Chubby Boy. Mannie Fresh Yes, sir. Jeff Mao Working with new acts and maintaining that obviously and working with other
groups and established acts as well, but you also, I guess, did you ever stop
DJing? Mannie Fresh Yeah, I did stop DJing but even more so now, I’m DJing more than I’m doing
beats. I’ve been DJing, man, that’s all I can say is, it’s been a warm
welcome. I’ve been everywhere. The crazy thing is, like I said, if I go
somewhere, they’re like, “Hey, we want you back two or three more times.” I
always say this, DJing is helping me understand what’s going on in music right
now, because I was kind of off the scene in my own little world for a second
or whatever, so to get back into clubs and DJ or whatever, I feel like I’m
falling in love with hip-hop all over again. Jeff Mao I know you played in New York about a month ago. Mannie Fresh Yeah. Jeff Mao I wasn’t at the gig, but I heard from a lot of people that there was a lot of
excitement around that gig, a lot of excitement. Mannie Fresh Yeah, man, the crazy thing is, it went down. I would say that was my second
time actually meeting Drake, and for him to come out and MC, I was just like,
“Wow, this has got to be something big.” When he first got to the gig, he was
kind of like, “Dude, I grew up on you. I love your music, da-da-dah,” and he
was just chilling behind me. He was, “Man, it’s killing me.” I’m like, “Here,
man, take the mic.” [laughs] Even to meet some people, I’m still a fan. Some
cats will play that cool role and be like, “Man, it’s all about me.” If I like
you, I like you. I’m a fan. Even with him I was, “Dude, I’m a fan of your
music. I love everything that you’re doing. Keep up the good work.” I’m
sitting there telling him stuff that fans I guess like do or whatever. I’m
like, “Man, number 13, go hard.” He’s like, “Man, what’s number 13?” Jeff Mao I do want to make sure that folks get a chance to ask a couple questions. I’m
sure that people have things they want to ask Mannie, so I’m going to open it
up at this point. Audience Member Who is Mantronix? Mannie Fresh [laughs] Mantronix was actually a producer from New York, and if you download some of
his music, I promise you, you’ll hear a lot of elements from Mannie Fresh.
Well, I kind of like took some of the things that he did, like he’s telling me
some of the songs, “Fresh Is The Word,” um, “Bassline,” but he was way ahead of
his time. This dude was way, way ahead of his time. But he was from New York.
He was one of the dudes who first did snare rolls, triplets with the hi-hats
and all that kind of stuff, but he was big in New Orleans. I don’t know if
nobody else got it, but we loved everything that Mantronix did. Audience Member A lot of people are familiar with undercutting DJs and stuff like that. I
didn’t know nowadays that recording budgets and stuff have been cut with major
labels. Do you deal with that at all? There’s all these young kids producing
off Fruity Loops and stuff where they can get something for free from somebody
else instead of paying, you know? Mannie Fresh Well, dude, I’m glad. I wouldn’t have thought of what you just said, but I’m so glad that
you asked that question that you asked, because, honestly, what’s going on is
you got like a lot of young producers right now, and DJs, but I’ll start out
with the producers that’s doing beats, that’s real talented kids, that the
beats are incredibly hot, but… They killed the game. That’s all I can say. They
killed the game by giving away music, giving these little cheap prices. You
know what I’m saying? If you’re thinking that’s getting you on, that’s not
getting you on, because basically what labels are doing, when they finished
with you, they moving on to the next kid that’s doing that. I mean, there’s no
loyalty in this. It never was with a label. Pretty much to say, “I’m going to
sell a beat for $500,” or whatever it is that you’re doing, art that took time
to perfect, somebody who I guess worked on their craft the same way you worked
on it and you’re giving it away for that? That’s nuts to me. To undercut
somebody is either they want it or they don’t want it. Good music is going to
stand up on its own. I don’t really feel like you have to say, “Well, if he’s
charging three, I’ll charge two.” That’s crazy. Either they want it or they
don’t want it. You’ve got to look at it, at the height of this, and this
wasn’t too long ago, I would say probably three or four years ago, you had
producers that were getting like 70 to 100 grand for a song, and now it’s
trickled down to $500. How does that happen? That’s amazing. Basically, I know
some hot producers, I won’t say no names, but what they charge for beats is
crazy. It’s like, “Dude, y’all pretty much killed the game.” The thing of it
is right now they going, “Well, who can I shop my beats to?” I’m like, “Well,
the labels done with you. They’ve moved on to the next person that they did
the same thing to you.” They pretty much was like, “OK, we’ll get some beats from
you right now because you hot. On the way out, we going to meet somebody else
and tell him the same thing.” And you got to think about it. This is some real
game I’m going to give you right now. Why would you give T.I. a beat? T.I. has
money, you know what I’m saying? You don’t have to do no favors for him. You
don’t have to do no favors for Lil Wayne, none of that. It’s not a good look.
Like, if a label tells you, “Oh, it’s a good look to do this song because it’s Lil
Wayne.” You’re like, “Fu--, Lil Wayne can afford this.” That’s not a good
look. It’s more so, “Y’all can pay me for this. This is a major artist. I’m
not going to give him nothing.” I’d rather not even do it, because it’s the
guys who fall for that that’s messing up the game. Because truthfully, you
have people that can afford, like he could have came out of his pocket and paid you
probably more than what the label would have paid you, but I refuse to let
somebody tell me, “It’s a good look or it’s gone,” I guess further my career
to give away something to somebody that’s already established. He can pay for
this. He’s already established. If y’all want it, y’all will pay for it, but
if you give it away, you’ve got to think about everything that’s going on
right now as a producer, as a DJ or whatever. A lot of people are not getting
the credit that they deserve. If you did a song that somebody tell you is a
good look but your name going to get on the next one, that’s bullsh--. [laughs] Audience Member You mentioned earlier that you work with Steve Hurley. Now, with the progression of
hip-hop, now it’s becoming a lot with house music; do you see yourself
following some of that transition? Mannie Fresh Yeah. A lot of my gigs are more so pop gigs right now. I’ve been doing a lot
of clubs that’s pop, and I kind of feel like truthfully, pop is going places
that hip-hop is scared to go right now. They have more to talk about,
basically. Hip-hop is one-dimensional right now. It’s more so of, “We’re going
to make a song about how rich we are,” sh--. This is like, “All right, damn,
somebody done that. We can’t keep doing that.” But, you know, you have
different elements of pop music that’s going on right now, so I’m open to
everything. I don’t know. If polka jump off right now, I’m in there.
[laughs] Jeff Mao Stay away from polka. They eliminated it from the Grammies, we’ve heard
earlier. When you DJ the gigs, do you bring your machines, do it the same old
way from back in the day? Mannie Fresh Yes, sir. Audience member First of all, I’ve got to say I remember Mantronix. All day. When I heard that
I kind of jumped, [looks around] “Who knows Mantronix?” One thing I wanted to ask and you
mentioned a lot of the young cats coming up, potentially killing the game,
whatnot, but yes, they are still talented. Three or five names, I don’t know,
that you feel, some young producers coming up, that you’re personally feeling
whether we’ve heard of them or not. Mannie Fresh I would say Drama. He does a lot of stuff out of Atlanta. Shawty Redd as well, he does a lot of stuff out of Atlanta. It’s some people who, I mean, I don’t think
get credit like they should get. You’ve got this guy, T-Mix, he did all the
8Ball & MJG stuff. He did some of Lil Wayne’s stuff when I left Cash Money.
It’s a lot of tight producers that own the dudes out of Houston right now,
Beanz N Kornbread. You’ve got a lot of them that’s tight. You got to look at
it too, what hip-hop, where it’s going at. If a group right now, like let’s
just say it was five people or whatever, walked in here right now, you
probably wouldn’t know none of them because it’s not marketed like that no
more. Like, even producers, it’s more so if… The people who I name right now,
if they were sitting on a sofa with me, you wouldn’t know them, because it’s
almost like that’s the way record companies want it to be. They don’t want you
to get too far, where you can start naming your price and doing certain
things and whatever. I just think it’s a lot of producers I know, just cats
that I meet that might play me some beats, and I’m like, “Wow, dude, you got
something that’s going on.” The people who stand out some kind of way, you
figured out a way to market yourself, you figured out a way to get yourself in
front [of] people to know you and what you’re selling. It’s almost like you’ve got
to sell an image as well as a beat. I’ve hung out with, like you saying, some guys, the younger
guys that’s supposed to be at the height of their game and we might go to a
basketball game and somebody’s, “You’ll take a picture with me?” I’m like,
“Take a picture with him too.” You know what I’m saying? Because I don’t want
him to feel like, “Who’s that?” I’m like, “It’s the dude who did such-and-
such, he did Waka Flocka [Flame].” They’re like, “Who is that?” You know what I’m
saying? [laughs] Audience Member Could you talk a little bit about your transition of your sound and how it
evolved from the Gregory D era to the bounce era to the Cash Money era and
then I guess ‘till now. Also, you’re sort of responsible for getting me
interested in rap in general. Mannie Fresh [laughs] I really wouldn’t call it transition. I guess some people say that or
whatever. It’s more of I kind of go with what’s going on. I don’t really say
it’s a transition or nothing like that. There’s more of, “OK, this is what I
think it should sound like, this is what it is.” ‘Cause truly, I haven’t
changed my drum kits in, sh--, a decade, you know what I’m saying? But they
still work. There’s some things that, if it’s not broke, don’t mess with it. I see
elements of me in a lot of songs or whatever. I look at it like this. I came
from, I guess, the generation of when you knew a producer. You don’t know that
now. I hear songs right now that are so scary, where it’s, “I thought I did
that.” You’ll hear sh-- like, “Damn, that sounds like I did it.” You’ve got to
check yourself, where you’re like, “Damn, that’s my hi-hats, that’s my snare
rolls,” and there’s no thank you attached to it! [laughs] It’s more so of, I guess
where I’m at right now, I’m not saying that I’m changing, but I what kind of
makes me not want to do the same song is, I keep hearing the same song. Even
though I know it’s what I do, it’s to the point where it’s like, “I don’t really
want to do that. I want to try something else.” You know what I’m saying? It’s
like hearing your hi-hats, hearing your snare rolls or whatever, even though
you know that’s your thing, if you hear 18 songs like that, I’ll try something
else. Audience Member Touching on what he [points to other audience member] said before about the younger producers, now that most
people are doing digital downloads and not buying CDs, not really reading
album credits, how do you see that affecting younger producers that are
getting on bigger tracks being able to grow their career without people really
knowing who they are, like back in the day, or even producers doing entire
albums for artists like they used to do? Mannie Fresh I just think that as a producer you’ve just got to work twice as hard. You’ve
got to figure out a way to market yourself, you know? The game change, it’s
the gift and the curse. The Internet is the gift and a curse. To a certain
degree, alright, you’re losing by downloads, but at the same time, you’re winning
because you can reach the whole world on the Internet. As a producer, you have
to figure out a way like, how can I stay in touch with people? If you’ve got to sit
there and, I don’t know, tweet messages all day or whatever you got to do to
get people to know you, you have to do that. You just have to work twice as
hard. You used to, when you made a big hit, it was a big deal, the producer that was
attached to that song. That’s not a big deal no more. People are just like,
“Well, nobody don’t really care about you. We just want a hot track or
whatever.” I think you got to brand yourself. If it was a hot song, there’s no
way in the world you’re not going to let me do an intro on it. I’m going to
kick, scream and holler. If you’re saying, “I’m doing this song for Michael
Jackson and y’all not going to let me put a Figgie Fresh in there, sh--, it
ain’t going down.” Audience Member So currently, who are you a fan of, unsigned or maybe a legend now? Who are you
listening to? Mannie Fresh I’m kind of old-school, dude. I’m not really even listening to music right
now. I’m not even going to lie to you. I’m a DJ, and I got to play songs, but
honestly, I’m not really feeling kind of what’s going on right now. I could
give you my reasons for it. At one time hip-hop was, you know, it was a
teacher. You had Public Enemy that brung you pro-black music, you know what
I’m saying? You had N.W.A., that was your gangster music. You had Slick
Rick, that was a
storyteller. You had Cash Money, that was your blinged-out, whatever. You had
different elements of hip-hop. You had Nas, that was the deep dude that taught
you certain things or whatever. Now it’s just so one-dimensional, so it’s
almost like you hear the same song. It’s like, “OK, I’ve heard that before.”
The next song I play is the same song. So it’s really like I’m just being honest with you. I’m not really feeling music right now. I pretty much, when it comes down to what I listen to, I listen to old-school rap. When
I’m by myself or whatever, I’m listening to some old-school rap. That’s what’s
going on with me. Jeff Mao I heard you also say, make an observation from doing some of the gigs, how a
lot of kids surprise you, which kids come up and recognize the old school
classics as opposed to the audience that you were hoping, maybe… Mannie Fresh Yeah. I could give you examples. I’ve done gigs where I’ve DJd and it’s, I
don’t know, Buzzard Nuts, Arkansas, somewhere, and I’m just like, “All right,
y’all not going to know none of these songs. I don’t even know how I got the
gig or whatever.” They telling me sh--, like, “Dude, play this, a B-side song or
whatever.” I’m just like, “Damn! Really?” You know? It’s shocking. You can’t
look in the crowd and know what somebody is going to like. You just can’t. Like I said, it’s been places where I was just totally shocked, whatever, where they was like, “Hey, we want you to do a Mannie Fresh old-school set.” I’m like, “Well, what’s a Mannie Fresh old school set?” They’re
like, “Bounce music.” Like I said, this is Buzzard Nuts, Arkansas. Bounce
music? And they know all the songs! I’m like, “Wow, this sh-- is crazy.” I mean,
it’s shocking to me, the people who… Even in New York, when I did the New York thing, they was
just like, “We kind of want you to do your music, do your set.” So even when I
did my set and I’m like, “Yeah, I’ve been to New York before,” did shows or
whatever, but I’m like, “OK, this is going to be some down-south sh-- that
only we would know.” The crazy thing is I play underground sh-- and they knew
all the words to it. It was just like, “Don’t even go nowhere else, stay down-
south.” It was amazing to me, because I’m like, “Wow, I’m in New York. This is
hip-hop, where it started from.” The crowd is like, “Don’t go nowhere else,
stay down-south.” I was like, wow. That was crazy to me. Jeff Mao Alright, I got one last question for Mannie Fresh, then we’ll wrap it up. Mannie… The
Asians want to claim you, man. Who’s Asian in your family? Who’s Asian in your
family? Come on. Mannie Fresh [laughs] I’m with y’all. Somewhere down the line, I got a couple of Asians
in my family. Jeff Mao All right. That’s what I wanted to hear. Ladies and gentlemen, Mannie Fresh. [stands] [applause] Mannie Fresh [stands] Thank y’all, thank y’all, thank y’all, thank y’all.

Maseo
Maseo of De La Soul sat down on the Red Bull Music Academy couch for Boombox’s 5th annual celebration of the life and music of J Dilla in Los Angeles. In his discussion with Cognito from Frolab, he discussed the art of the posse cut, sampling, meeting J Dilla, and more.
Hosted by COGNITO Yes, yes. So this is incredible, like, word? [laughter] Once again, my story kind of is the same thing. Maseo Let me first say my rebuttal to
Shaheed. God does
have a sense of humor. He made DJ Maseo. [laughter] COGNITO No doubt, no doubt. Word. Yeah, 1989, man. Three Feet High and
Rising. [applause] Once again, I’m 19-years-old, can’t believe what I’m hearing. It’s like,
“What? You all are talking to me.” This isn’t like listening to “The
Message.” I knew all the words to
“The Message” at nine-, ten-years-old, but I didn’t known what none of that
meant, but something about this cut right here, which I bet y’all didn’t know,
this is the man that produced it. (music: De La Soul – “Me Myself and
I” / applause) Tell me about that record, man. How old were you when you did that? Maseo I was actually 15-years-old when I was playing around with it on the sampler.
I had a Casio SK-1 sampler I
bought from Wiz Records and Tapes. COGNITO [sings] ”Nobody beats the Wiz!” Maseo It had the little four orange pads on it that you could play with the
different samples. You could sample four different compositions, and you had
to put it up to the speaker. There was no input to get real audio, so I put it
up to the speaker to get the sound I was trying to catch. It took forever to
do, but when I finally got it, it was on, put it down to the four-track. We
only really had three tracks to really work with, but put it down to the four-track, and I sat on it since 1985. I was 15. I was working with a different
artist at that time, a different rapper at that time. It was my uncle’s best
friend, lived around the corner. My uncle went to school, actually graduated
high school with him. They graduated high school with him and Prince Paul. I had moved to
Long Island around ’84, so ’85, things started really kind of picking up
behind DJing and I playing basketball around the neighborhood. Brooklyn cats,
we just get everywhere. I’m originally from Brooklyn New York where Ali’s
from, and trying to do that song for the other rapper, he didn’t like it, just
as much as my group don’t like it as well. He didn’t like it. Paul always
thought it was cool, but it wasn’t his project. We were both called onto a
project, me as just a new cat with new energy and Paul as the senior around
the neighborhood who was doing this thing with Stetsasonic already. The person
that signed the rapper - I don’t want to say his name - but the person that
signed the rapper, my uncle’s friend, he was my music teacher. He taught at
Amityville Junior High School and High School. He also wrote for Surface, and
he wrote for the Isley Brothers, and he saw the ‘surgence of hip hop growing
at that period in time, so he started an independent label and wanted to put
this guy out. We did a covered version of “God...,” not “God Make Me
Funky” but
“Seven Minutes of Funk.” It was
wack. Really, really wack. Really, really, really wack. Really, really, really
wack. Paul and I really connected behind this project. We went out in the car,
had to be two-three in the morning, one session, spending so much time working
on one record. He truly asked me, how did I feel about this? I was like, “Yo
man, I really don’t like it.” I was like, “I even told them I don’t like it””
but at 15, this was my opportunity to go to the studio, go further than the
four-track, and embark upon my dream. It wasn’t working for me, it wasn’t
working for Paul, and that’s where we really connected at that point. I was
like, “I really got some other stuff I want to play for you.” That was the
stuff I had been working on with… I call them Dave and Merce, y’all. You know
them as Trugoy and Posdnuos. Dave was Trugoy.
Posdnuos is Merce. These are my childhood friends. They were closet MCs. No
one knew they rapped. No one. Pos actually used to DJ a little something. Dave
used to do the human beat box. They used to be part of another group called EZ
Street, like a year prior to us really connecting, and Dave wrote the rhymes
for everybody, so did Pos, but Pos DJed, and Dave was the human beat box, and
he was really good. The turn of the guards came ’85, summer school. We was all
going to summer school. The school was right across the street from my house,
so we were done with class like by 11 a.m., so we piling up at my house. We
got together behind a mutual friend who was a fourth member of the group.
Can’t mention his name either. Sorry, folks. He was actually the person who
brought us all together. Really, when we heard Ultramagnetic [MCs], and I have
to also say when we saw Doug E Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew and Slick Rick, it was
featuring MC Ricky D at the time, and we was like, “Wow, a four-man group, two
DJs, Chill Will, Barry B.” That’s who me and the other cat was like. We was
like our own version of Chill Will and Barry B. But he became pretty
obnoxious, something that didn’t fit the followed and wound up X-ing himself
out. Paul didn’t want to work with him either, but when it all came together,
he was out the picture. Paul told us to come to the studio, actually come by
his house, and we had a meeting. Once I played him the demos, he was like,
“This is everything I’ve been trying to do with Stet, so I would like for you
all to come by my house, and let’s talk about this.” The first thing he said
out the gate: “We can definitely take this to the studio and clean it up. I
can’t make anybody any promises. I don’t know if you’re going to get a deal or
not, but this is definitely something I’m into creatively.” He was playing me
all the stuff that he was doing with Stet, and then when I played him the
stuff we were doing, he played me some stuff he submitted for Stet that was
getting turned down, completely up our alley. We hooked up. The guys was kind
of nervous, because here it is: they never rapped publicly. Never until this
point in time linking up with Paul. Me, I been DJing since I was 6-years-old.
I’ve been carrying records and speakers for other DJs trying to get my time to
shine at a block party, and I would catch it. Twelve-years-old, I got my first
shot on Woodburn between Wilson and Knickerbocker in Bushwick. That was my
first shine, twelve-years-old, being able to DJ a block party. Prior to that, the
best party I ever did was my mom’s housewarming party. That was off the chain.
I got to stay up crazy late, so I DJed. That was off the hook, ’82, that was a
great year. That was like I felt like my induction into hip hop. I felt like
I’m a part of this. I started meeting certain people. Stephanie Mills didn’t
live too far, and she was into hip hop. They was going to see Grandmaster
Flash, places I couldn’t go to. COGNITO Right. Maseo I was knowing people like her on a first-name basis. Gwen Guthrie, I got to
meet her before she passed, I met her in Quad Studios. That’s how long Quad
Studios have been around. I met her when I was 14. I mean, I’m like, “Ms.
Guthrie,” but she was like, “Honey, call me Gwen.” That was like real moments
for me, and I made my first $300 DJing, and I felt like I was in the business,
I’m in. COGNITO Wait. $300, what year was this? Maseo My first $300 DJing, it was ’84. No, ’85, Long Island. It was in Long Island.
Kool G Rap came to the party. He had just came out with “It’s a Demo” and all
of that, so he was getting around. Actually, DJ Polo had some family in our
neighborhood, so they were coming to all the backyard parties. Every rapper
was showing up to cookouts. That was the thing. Hip hop for us was on the
weekend, even on a mainstream level. It was only on the weekend. If you caught
it any other part of the week, it was late-night with the [World Famous]
Supreme Team, and if your mother caught you out, you in trouble. [laughs] So
the Supreme Team or Mr. Magic or even Dr. Dre from Original Concept, Big Dr.
Dre. These were our outlets for hip hop if we didn’t catch Red
[Alert] or Chuck
Chillout, or Marley [Marl] on the
weekend, and it was really late at night or wee hours in the morning.
Everybody came out to Long Island, to college parties, to promote whatever
they were doing, and when I saw G Rap at a party I was DJing, I was like, “I’m
on.” He came up to me, said, “What’s up?” I obviously was doing something
right. He was feeling me. He said, “What’s up?” Prince Markie Dee, another one
that was coming around early on, so these are people I got familiar with at a
very young age before I was even thinking about a record deal, moreso thinking
about getting ready for the weekend. My connection with Paul and hearing
Rakim come out, hearing
Ultramagnetic, of course, Run DMC, that’s when us as a collective said, “We
want to really take this serious and make records.” We were already playing
around making demos, but to actually want to get out there and pursue this as
a dream, it was those groups. It was really Ultramagnetic that was the
catalyst to wanting to be different and speak your own language. Let alone,
they still had the hardcore Bronx image, but Kool Keith was on something else,
man. That was the inspiration to be like, “Yeah, we going to be different.
We’re going to come out with our own language. We going to make you believe
what we believe.” COGNITO “Strickly Dan Stuckie.” Maseo Yeah, “Strickly Dan Stuckie” just mean, “Yo, that shit is fresh.” [laughs]It’s fresh. [laughs] COGNITO Around that time, with Three Feet High and Rising, there was another
particular song that… I mean, “Me, Myself and I” clearly is a song that put
you all on the map. Maseo Yes. COGNITO But there’s a classic on that album, and for that time period, to understand
that that album had more tracks than I think any other album in history as far
as I knew. Maseo To be honest, the record that truly put us on the map was “Potholes In My
Lawn.” COGNITO Well, yeah, yeah. Maseo That was the record that put us on the map. That was the first video, first
introduction into mainstream culture. “Plug Tunin’“ got us love in New York,
and the name De La Soul got us love with the Latino community. [laughter] Everybody thought I was either Dominican or Puerto Rican. Seriously. But it
was “Potholes In My Lawn,”and “Jennifer” had played a big role
in that also, because that was bouncing off of Jungle Brothers
“Jimbrowski.” Jenny was like the
answer to “Jimbrowski.” COGNITO I say that for me because living in DC, Virginia area, I knew those songs, but
it was “Me, Myself and I” that got the general public knowing. I think that
video and that song probably got more play than “Potholes” may have. Maseo Yeah, it did. COGNITO There’s also another song that I want to play right now that you all probably
didn’t know he had something to do with this. (music: De La Soul – “Buddy”/ applause) I want to ask a question… Maseo Thank you, thank you, thank you, salutations, thank you. COGNITO [laughs]What happened to the art of the posse cut? This particular song was
the epitome of a collaboration at that point in time to where we are today,
how people collaborate with each other. Other artists collaborate with each
other, but it now seems to be like, “Yo, B, I got this beat, I’m going to pass
you this in ProTools, you know what I’m saying? Spit 16 [bars] on there, get
back to me.” Maseo It’s contrived. COGNITO Right. Talk about the process of “Buddy.” Maseo It was a natural process. I did the beat, and we had been really just sitting
on it. I honestly just happened to walk in the studio one day, and to the
right of me was Mike G with a pad, Pos sitting at the mixing desk, Afrika’s in
the mic booth. I just walked in, and dudes is laying rhymes to my beat. I have
to take a page from Shaheed. That’s God, man, making that happen like that. I
just thought it was a cool track. I thought it fit what we were doing. I
didn’t expect it to be that. Later come
Q-Tip. That was that day,
and we all had really just met. A week prior to that, we did a show with
Jungle [Brothers] somewhere in Boston. We had been running to each other
periodically - [burps] excuse me, Guinness is hitting me. Right before we
came out with “Plug Tunin’“ we used to go to Latin Quarters a lot, and
everybody at that time was wearing something different or doing something
different, especially if you was an up and coming artist, you did something,
that signature of yourself. We made these plug clocks. The clock thing was
always something that was like... I mean, Flava [Flav] definitely took it to
the next level, but wearing the clock, wearing the pouches, that was something
that was going on in New York, just Flava epitomized it. We kind of snatched
that a little bit. We had these plug clocks, and we had the plug logo that we
were wearing to the club, and we would wear these sequined outfits, the Gumby
haircut. We just looked different from everybody who was rocking Kangol’s or
whatever. We looked crazy. Afrika sorted us out. Red [Alert] sorted us out. Of
course, Paul introduced us to everybody, and when everybody got hit with the
record, it was really more, that added the extended excitement. Afrika was
like, “Wow, we are like Mars, we kind of on the same thing,” and we were like,
“Yes, we are. We love the Jungle Brothers.” That was that moment of
communication over the music. Then the show came about, then the invitation to
the studio. Mind you, I didn’t know they were going to be in the studio. I
walk in. Mike with a pad, Afrika in the booth, Pos had the port, Q-Tip comes
later. We got this song called “Buddy.” Once the song was done, we immediately
start to perform it. I hadn’t even met Ali yet. That was the thing. I myself
hadn’t met him yet. I was still in school. Here it is, sorry y’all, but I got
left back because I cut school to record Three Feet High and Rising, so I
wound up graduating a year later than everybody else. [laughs] Pos had
already graduated, Dave had already graduated, and the opportunity kept coming
to make this record. I truly was getting ready to head to the military. I was
involved with a lot of street culture that I wasn’t very happy with doing
myself, so I was really about to go to the military, and I said, “If I’m going
to die somewhere, let me go get some medals and die. I mean, not die on these
streets around here.” But the Creator is who he is, man. This opportunity kept
coming. The gut feeling kept hitting, “You need to do this.” Even my last
year, they talked me into playing football. I quit playing football because
the dream was clicking. Every time I looked up it was clicking. I managed it
somehow. I was going to the club, meeting up with the fellows, then next thing
you know getting off the train, going straight to school. My mom didn’t have a
clue what was going on. Everything was definitely chaotic. Come on, 17, 18,
you’re trying to figure yourself out. You are going through these “identify
crises” trying to figure out who you are as a teenager. With this opportunity
presenting itself, it was scary, but we pursued it. Pos dropped college. Dave
dropped college. Here it is, I’m fumbling with high school, but my intentions
was always to finish, which I did. We did the album all through ‘88. Guys
waited for me to finish before we really hit the road. I’ll never forget Lyor
[Cohen] and Russell [Simmons] coming
up to the school, discussing my situation and presenting all of this press and
everything that, how well things were taking off, and mind you, there was even
a major improvement in my grades. I was tired. I used to miss my first three
periods, and mind you, behind missing my first three periods, I even had to go
to night school. I did all of that just to finish high school and pursue this
dream. It was a scary time but amazing at that point in time, kids just
following their dreams and not sure where this thing is going to go. Even when
you’re talking to the label, and they’re going, “Yo, this is really great
effort, but we don’t expect it to do well. We love this kind of music.” That’s
one thing I can say about Tommy Boy. Great place to create. Next to all the…
Every label’s wack, but this was the best of the worst, how I feel. We had our
freedom, but they didn’t anticipate any success, and I thought, “Okay, after
the release of this Three Feet High and Rising, I’m going to the service.”
But right after graduation, I was on tour with LL Cool J, NWA, Public Enemy,
Too Short, Hammer, 357, the list goes on. It was like the whole hip hop
ensemble. Everybody that existed in hip hop and that was somebody, whether you
had the hottest record out there at that time with no sales or you had the
sales, everybody was on that tour. COGNITO That ticket would be like $20. Maseo Shit, $20. $20. Now, it’s like $100 plus for one act at that. All of these
acts, and ticket would be like $20. Arenas would be packed. It was a milestone
in my life really next to going on tour with Tribe. COGNITO Word. So that particular album also brought y’all a lesson with sample
clearance. I know you spoke on this on the documentary that I had the pleasure
of working on called Copyright
Criminals. If y’all
haven’t seen it, y’all should check it out. Speak on what that did to the
whole soundscape of music. Maseo It created a new business, definitely. Sampling became a significant business.
When we first released our debut, we followed all the requirements to hand in
sample clearances and make sure things were dealt with. Tommy Boy was in
control of the administration. All we had to do is fill out the forms and hand
them in, but they were in control of the administration, so they felt like
certain things like “Transmitting Live From
Mars” was insignificant to clear
because it was just such a small skit. Who’s going to really pay attention to
something so silly as that? Well, that was the very first thing that came to
bite us. There was a public lawsuit out there from The Turtles for a million
dollars. We settled out of court for $50,000. Due to our miscommunication,
whatever the shuffle was, we end up going half with Tommy Boy on the bill, but
when it comes to sample clearances, you’re always at the mercy of the
negotiation, whoever owns the rights to it. There was a point in time where
different people didn’t want you to sample. There was a time Anita Baker
didn’t want anybody to touch her stuff. George Benson didn’t want anybody to
touch their stuff. [Steely Dan didn’t want anybody to touch the stuff, but he
didn’t realize we touched his stuff. That’s how obscure we were doing things
as well. He didn’t realize that we used his record, but we made it clear
because at the same time, we’re a fan of the people that we sampled from. A
lot of that music, we truly are into. We grew up on that. To want to give the
proper credit, that’s something we aspired to do. But by the label not doing
their just, we get hit with the legalities. At the end of the day, everybody
liked the fact that you’re a fan, but business is business. COGNITO: What was it like the day you met George Clinton? Maseo Oh, another milestone. One of my heroes in music. I’m a big Parliament Funkadelic fan. I went to the concert in 1976. My uncle and my mom took me and
my brother to watch the mothership land at Madison Square Garden. Twenty years
later, I’m in Central Park re-landing the mothership with George Clinton. It’s
amazing, and I had broken my leg that year. It’s like, “I’m going to that
show. I’m going to be on that stage, and I’m going to be part of landing that
mothership,” because to be at that concert when I was six-years-old and then
to turn around when I was 26, to be actually invited to be a part of that, it
was great. George became a really good friend. That’s Uncle George, straight
up. He and I, like, a lot of good times. I won’t smoke no weed with him though.
[laughs] You don’t know what’s in the blunt. [laughter] COGNITO Sho’nuff, sho’nuff. Maseo He had the nerve to look at me and say, “You young bloods need to stop smoking
that chronic. That shit’s too strong.” I was like, “Are you serious?”
[laughs] That’s a true story, I’m telling you. When we did the
Frank151 thing, and I was talking to him, aw man,
he said, “You and Snoop, you all need to stop this shit here. This shit is too
strong.” I was like, “Are you serious? All the shit you do?” [laughs] “They
didn’t had it like this back in our day.” I was like, “I get you, I feel you.
I’m not messing with you in your day. You own that day, we own this day, and
that’s our separation right there.” [laughs] COGNITO Ooh, man. On the production tip, man, once again you kind of have a similar
story and situation like Ali. Back in them days, a lot with the group efforts,
looking at production-wise, we wouldn’t have known who actually produced
certain cuts because maybe how Ali was saying that you were trying to make the
brand stand out in that sense. Maseo Yeah, I concur with Shah on that. The common goal was to be a group, and to do
everything to kind of poke the group. I don’t know if it’s like that for Shah,
but that was something I noticed Jay doing with Run DMC, although the group
was Run DMC, and Jam Master Jay, but he represented Run DMC, and to even hear
them even turn around and address Run DMC, the brand, the name, more as a
group instead of just two rappers, Run and D. They addressed it more as a
group. That still stands today, because here it is, Jay’s not here, and Run
DMC is not here, and that was a conscious decision and effort on their end to
dissolve the group, because their main man, who they felt held it together, is
not here. The common goal was to be that. There was no hidden agenda. There
was no, “I’m trying to do a solo thing. No disrespect, but it wasn’t a Brand
Nubian situation. All of those guys initially looked to do solo efforts but
then came together to do a group. We know [Grand] Puba come from other
situations. He come from Masters of Ceremony, so different thing. The common
goal was to be a group, always to be a group, and that still is the goal. COGNITO It’s an incredible testament with y’all, and in my opinion, I say this because
you all are clearly out of all the groups in hip hop from that era, y’all are
undefeated. Like, every album has been incredible. You all are what? Twenty-three years high and rising now? Never broke up. Maseo Something like that. COGNITO Never broke up, and no one’s ever pursued solo situations. You remained a
group, and that’s something that needs to be… Maseo It’s not a fairy tale. It’s a gift and curse. I call it the gift and curse,
because something that is you recognize to be so great, it’s really hard to
pull together. Not everybody’s on the same page at the same time, especially
when you know your role and people around you look at it to be powerful, but
in some respects I’m powerless because I can’t rap for him. I can’t rap for
him. I can’t make him like a certain beat. I don’t know when the stars are
lining up for him today to want to make music, so I got to be patient. And
then being patient, yeah, the clock of business is ticking, because now our
childhood dream is a full-fledged career, and we can’t really operate like this
anymore. That’s the curse. That’s the true curse, but when it finally
connects, and if you notice, De La, come on, we don’t put out records as
consistent. You’re dealing with true artists. You can’t rush art. If the
painting ain’t right, you can’t put it out yet. There’s something missing.
Don’t quite know what that is, but when it hits me, I’m going to put it up
there, and then I’m going to put it out. Not quite comfortable with it, so I
don’t care what deadline the corporation has. Trust me, I could sit here and
be a hypocrite to what I’m saying, because I understand the duality of the
relationship. There’s music business, and then there’s music art, and I’m
playing both sides of the fence. As the one in the group who had way more
responsibilities than everybody else, I’m like, “We got to get this paper,
man!” [laughs] You just can’t rush the art, so when it comes down to it, the
ultimate curse is that you’ve got to wait for the art to be solidified, and
not everybody’s on the same page, so it’s that waiting process. You just
continue to pursue the magic. COGNITO That’s a nice way to segue into this next cut that you happened to produce. (music: De La Soul – “Ego Trippin’ (Part
Two)” / applause) Maseo Salutations. Salutations. Salutations. COGNITO That was a sure-shot banger right there, and shameless plug, thank you all for
reppin’ OG Fro t-shirt in that video. [shakes hands with Maseo] Maseo It was hot, man. COGNITO Got to set it off, you know what I’m saying? Respect, you know? You have such
a character about you that we kind of got to live out through a lot of these
albums, and then you had your time when you started to do your own thing. You
started an independent record label, Bear Mountain, and what was it about that
time in your life that made you realize that it was time to take another
creative endeavor helping other artists, which y’all seemed to already do
anyways because you all put us on to so many different artists, from the Mos
Def’s to being on “Buddy” with Latifah and Monie Love? Maseo I’ll go fight for the part of A Tribe Called Quest. First record he rapped on
was “Buddy Remix” so those are just other blessings again. These people coming
into your life, God presenting these people in your life, and you develop
something with them. For me, definitely getting past the third album,
definitely tainted with the business. My innocence is gone. Not really all
that inspired. The true inspiration always came out of who was fresh and new
and never embarked upon the business, that one cat, two cats who just real hot
and got a dream. The one thing Paul said to me a long time ago, especially for
where I come from, I love what I do because I could’ve literally been a
stickup kid. I was pretty good at the streets. I was pretty good. I think I
knew whatever I put my mind to, I would be good at. That’s just truly it. New
York life presents such a hustle, especially when you come from a single-
parent home and your moms is on and off welfare, we dealing with the warranted
struggles. I’m the oldest child, and I’m trying to figure out how to help my
moms out. I could’ve been that cat. I could’ve been that cat on America’s
Most Gangsta, Best Gangsters. I could’ve been that for real deal. But God
pushed me a different place. First of all, I love my mother to death. I never
wanted to disappoint her. Although what I did in the streets, I tried to make
sure she never found out. When I was getting too heavy with it, I would tell
her. That would be my moment of repent. Really, to answer your question, Paul
put me on, man. Big up to Prince Paul all day. [applause] If it hadn’t been for my relationship with Paul, I could’ve been somewhere
else. I asked Paul, “What could I ever really do to repay you?” He said, “Two
things.” He said, “Yo, have some experiences that I never had with this hip
hop thing. And then two, turn around and do the same thing for somebody else
that I’m doing for you.” [applause] COGNITO Word up. Word up. Like Ali and Tribe, y’all also had experience with J Dilla. Maseo He’s a true king, for real. COGNITO Since this is Dilla month, and y’all are going to rock in his honor tonight at
Boombox, why don’t you speak on Dilla? What was that meeting like? How did
that come about? Maseo J Dilla, I think we all met him around the same time. If I can really recall,
I think Dave was the first to meet him but introduced him to Q-Tip. They met
in the malls in Detroit somewhere. I think Dilla had already been working with
Pharcyde at this point, though, and he was still an unknown, but he was
working with Pharcyde because he was putting his name down as Jay Dee, not
Dilla, so you could get it confused with Jermaine Dupree. COGNITO Not really, but yeah. [laughter] Maseo At that point in time, if you really didn’t know, because you would be like,
“Yo, same dude that produced Kriss Kross?” [laughter] COGNITO Pre-Wikipedia. Maseo [laughs]Yeah. Pre-Wikipedia, like Cliff Notes. [laughs] Really, meeting
him and connecting, my first time really chilling with Dilla, like having my
real moment when we smoked out and we kicked it, because when we’re around my
crew and we’re around Tribe, it’s like with the pastors of church sometimes.
[laughs] Sometimes. You know, we never really got loose. The studio
atmosphere has always been a real… That’s our playground. That’s where we
really take the work serious. Everybody’s truly into the art, but I got to go
to the crib a few times and hang out with him in his own world. After an
okayplayer show or any time I came to the
D[etroit], hung out with Fran-N-Dank, and we really kicked it, man. A lot of
times, man, when you get with people you really love and you care for,
everything ain’t always good, so you want to… There’s times you want to let it
out, man. He wanted to tell his Q-Tip story. I wanted to tell my De La story.
There’s times when we got with Ali, we done sat in the car many days and many
nights and shared our bad stories of our camps. That’s just your moment to
vent, and you know when you built family with somebody, you can share this
moment, and they know what you’re saying. You don’t mean no malice who you’re
talking about. You’re just venting, and you’re venting out of love because you
want to continue what you’re doing and who you’re doing it with, but there’s
that moment… Every family fights, man. It’s truly what it is. This is not no
fairy tale. We truly are family. You can see in the Tribe movie. You can
honestly see that. For some reason with the Tribe, I’ve been in the middle of
every fight. I don’t know why me. [laughs] Ali Shaheed [inauadible] Maseo Peace. Peace. [laughs] Want love. Peace, appreciate it. That’s family for
you, and my moment with Jay Dee, it was with Jay Dee and Frank-N-Dank, and
here it is Jay Dee, this was the one moment he really wanted to vent, like
bark a little bit. I’m like, “Yo, B, I’m going to help you find your tongue
because you think I ain’t going to really feel you on this.” I dropped
everything he was feeling, what was going on in the Tribe situation with
Q-Tip, and he kept looking back to Frank-N-Dank going, “Do you hear this
n---er? Do you hear him! Preach! Preach, Mase, please preach! You telling my
soul right now.” I was like, “Let’s smoke out, and let’s just let it out, B,
you know what I’m saying? Only way you going to be able to continue to be
inspired and do what you do and do it with who you love doing it, you got to
get that off your chest.” It’s a cliché, but you got to keep it real. It’s a
true cliché, but you got to keep it real, not only with your folks but with
yourself, because you not going to move forward. He still is great because
he’s been able to be real with himself and real with the situations around
him. I think in our final days of Dilla and hearing him talk, we all felt
that. We all felt that interview on that tape. We felt that, and it was true.
It was honest, man, and he’s the greatest, man. He brought something to hip
hop, and that’s the thing about this. I get upset when I see cats constantly
just taking from it. Taking, taking, taking, taking and give nothing back. Yo,
he gave something to hip hop in a major way, and he definitely helped carry De
La Soul past the tradition of “By the time you make your third album, your
career’s going to be over.” Well, he helped us beat the odds. [applause] COGNITO Word up. You’re good at this, man. It’s a good segue. (music: De La Soul – “Stakes Is High” / applause) COGNITO Y’all will get enough of that tonight at Boombox, you know what I’m saying?
You’ll get enough of that tonight at Boombox. Maseo I don’t know if Ali got that in his set, but it’s in mine. [laughs] COGNITO Word, word. Yeah, man, what’s driving you now creatively? Maseo Always the new talent. The new talent always drives me. I like the innocence.
This is something that just happened just yesterday. I met Mac Miller
yesterday for the first time, and I’ve been watching this kid. Actually, my
sons put me onto Mac Miller. My 19-year-old and my 14-year-old put me on to
Mac Miller. They was like, “Daddy, you going to like him.” They’re into the
Lil Wayne’s and all of that, and they definitely into modern-day hip hop, but
by being around me, their understanding is getting a lot more broader. My 19
-year-old has truly matured. He went from Lil Wayne being his favorite rapper
to now Lil Wayne and Big Daddy Kane is his favorite rapper. Busta [Rhymes] got
a spot with him too, like something about Busta, my 19-year-old really loves
him. He’s been loving Busta since he was like eight. Yeah, these new talent,
man. New talent has always been the drive for me from the days of Mos [Def],
from the days of Black Sheep, from everybody that was fresh that came through.
We always challenged the creative envelope. Check your ego at the door, and
let’s really do what we do. If I want to continue to be Maseo out here, how
everybody perceives me, well, Vincent Mason got to come up in here and really do
his job along with Kelvin Mercer and David Jolicoeur and Kamaal Fareed and
everybody else. We check our egos at the door, and we really get down to
challenging each other creatively and not canceling out no idea. Every idea is
a great idea. You have to try it. You don’t know until you’ve really tried it,
and do not cancel it out until you actually put it up there to go, “Okay, it
looks good or it sounds good, or it sounds bad.” You’ve got to put it up.
You’ve got to put it out there. It’s more than just verbally conveying,
because not everybody can see what you saying, so you have to show it, and we
all gave ourselves that respect. That’s what I always liked about our creative
space, but like I say again, the new talent. The new talent drives the hell
out of me. That innocence, man. COGNITO I also wanted to touch that the collaboration that you all did with the
Gorillaz. You didn’t really say much, but it carries that song. Maseo That’s God. Again. COGNITO We’ve heard that laugh. Maseo This laugh is my laugh, and I used to get teased for it. I got a lot fights
behind this laugh, seriously. It’s me, so I learned to embrace it. I can’t
change who I am, and I’m not trying to, but I think in them teenage years,
you’re self-conscious about a lot, so I pound a lot of people upside their
head for this laugh. I love the impression it has on people. I like making
people happy, man, so if my silliness brings joy, cool, because I like being
silly. I like being fun. I like telling jokes. Honestly, I really am a
jokester. My comedy comes free, because if you got to pay for it, it ain’t
funny. [laughs] That’s just my natural, just me being me, the class clown,
but I got my grades. That was my way of playing possum to everybody because I
believe we all can have a good time with what we love to do. 90% of the world
is doing something they hate doing for a living. They never even went to
school for what they’re doing for a living, and I’m part of the 10%. I’m going
to do my best to bring joy to the 90% that hate what they’re doing. [applause] COGNITO We come to that point where we’re going to open up the floor for questions.
Let’s see. Audience member Hey, Mase. Maseo Hey, Asia. Audience member How you doing? Maseo How you doing? Audience member I have a question I’ve always wanted to ask you. You mention that Dilla’s
music was stolen, and we all know that a lot of people will take and not
really give, and he only really became a legend after he passed. What can we
do to commemorate artists so that we don’t have to wait until they pass in
order to make them of legendary status? Maseo We have to support them while they’re here. We have to. There’s no other way
to put it. We have to give them the glory while they’re on this earth. Why do
we acknowledge them when they’re dead and gone? I can never understand that
myself. We definitely need to give them the glory when they’re here on this
earth, when they’re doing tremendous work. But for some reason, we take that
for granted. For some reason jealousy and envy prevails when a person is
alive, but when they finally die, then we have this sentiment, and then we
want to merit them. We live in a world that’s controlled by the devil. The
earth is controlled by the devil. He’s just as strong as the Creator. They’re
brothers, man. He’ll put these weary moments around you every now and again.
When Dilla was alive, I witnessed a lot of envious people, and I feel like
envy is worse than jealousy because you can never really detect it until the
very last moment, and it’s too late. There was a lot of people really envious
of him because he’s just that good and that great. If you know your Bible,
Jesus was great, but he had to go somewhere else to receive his greatness and
then come back for his people to acknowledge his greatness. Dilla had to go to
the spiritual realm for us to acknowledge his greatness. I’m glad I was able
to be a part of the disciples to acknowledge it while he was here on earth.
I’m down by law. [laughs] [applause] Audience member Salute. Maseo Salute. Saluterie. Salutations. Audience member So Maseo, I grew up listening to De La Soul, KDAY. I remember listening to you
guys on KDAY when I was in high school. Yeah, 1580 KDAY AM, so Craig Mack, the
Mixmasters, and all that stuff. Do you remember when you first heard that you
guys were playing over here in LA on the West Coast, and what is your first
show that you performed here in LA? Maseo My first show in LA was some skating rink. I can’t remember the name of it. Audience Member World on Wheels! Maseo World on Wheels! Word up. Word up. All I got to say is I was scared like a
mother because it was gangbanger city, B. Crips and Bloods all day. Yo, for
real. I mean, gang culture then really grew mainstream. It’s crazy. Gang
culture grew really mainstream. Here it is in New York, we didn’t have that at
the time. We have that now. It wasn’t called gangs. It was called your crew.
That word extended pretty dynamic. You could’ve been thugged out. You could’ve
been a rap group. You could’ve been a crew of dancers. But out here, it was
really gangs, for real. One thing I noticed with “gangs” on the East Coast,
especially New York primarily, crews would thug out for money, right? They
would rob you. It was about economics. If I’m going to hurt somebody, I got to
get something out of it. I’m really going to go in to cash this check on this
person. Out here? “No, I’m going to kill for my set. I’m going to blow your
head off because you don’t speak like me. What set you claim? Huh?” What? I
didn’t understand any of that really, and having on the wrong color. That
threw me off. I believe my ignorance is what saved me at the time, truly,
because it was hardcore gangbanging back then. Seriously, I was scared coming
out to LA. I’m glad I made friends with the Boo-Yaa
T.R.I.B.E. early. Word up. [laughter] Yo, for real, when I come out, they think I’m Samoan or something like that
anyway, so I made friends with the Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E early in the game. COGNITO Y’all used to wear a lot of crazy colors. Maseo Yeah, we wore the colors and the medallion, so I was right in. Boo-Yaa used to
hold me down every time, seriously. “Mase in town! Word!” [laughs] COGNITO Who’s got the mic? Audience member Yeah. Yeah, first I want to say, thanks for De La for being themselves,
creating their own language in the hip hop game, but I’ve got a question about
Long Island as far as groups, MCs that came out. Who originated the first, I
guess you could say “Long Island flow?” To my knowledge, it’s like JVC Force,
EPMD, so… Maseo There’s no real Long Island flow. There’s no real Long Island flow because,
come on, Chuck D from
Long Island. None of us sound like him? So I don’t know what that is. One
thing I can credit Long Island for is rappers using their real names. Erick
Sermon, Parrish Smith, Keith Murray, Craig Mack. You know what I’m saying?
Seriously, unless you was a 5%er like Rakim, you know what I mean? Everybody
did use their real names for the most part. Curt Cazal, Curtis, you know what
I mean, from JVC Force. I don’t know what the Long Island flow is, though, you
got me on that one. Audience member [inaudible] Maseo Okay. You from Long Island? Audience member [inaudible] Maseo Okay, I’m sorry. I don’t know what the Long Island Flow is. COGNITO Oh, there we go. Audience member Yo, I wanted to talk about the song “Buddy.” I know Puffy came along later
talking about how they invented the remix, but if I’m correct, I think “Buddy”
was one of the first remixes that was ever done. Maseo Actually, the first real remix in hip hop was “Me, Myself and I.” It was
completely different music all together from the original, not like a dub of
“The Bridge.” Marley did “The Bridge Is Over.” It wasn’t like a dub mix. It
was an actual remix where the music was completely different. I know Puffy
likes to take credit for that. That’s all for the cameras and for the press,
but people in hip hop know what it really is, and he’s in hip hop, and he
knows what it really is. Audience member Can you explain “Buddy,” because I know Prince Paul said something else in
that video, but it didn’t correlate to what “Buddy” sounded like in the song? Maseo It’s another way of saying “My friend, my dear friend, my close friend, my
friend to the end.” My loved one. Someone you spending special time with. COGNITO My boo. Maseo Yeah, my boo-boo. [laughs] Peace, thank you, man. Thanks. You know what?
Method Man likes the original. That really touched me, man, where he was like,
“I like the original ‘Buddy.’“ I was like, “I did that.” [laughs] Peace,
thank you, man. Audience member Speaking of Method Man, I just wanted to know how the Redman track “Ooh” came
along. How did that come about actually? Maseo Everybody that we worked with, especially after, I got to say, I give it to my
guys on a lyrical tip, and us collectively, when we think about people want to
work with, when the lyrics start to come together and add that extra added
instrument. The vocal has always been another instrument to us. The cadence,
the melody of the vocal, and then also who else you hear on the track, that’s
how we always built our collaborations. We didn’t say we going to really
consciously work with this person. Of course, you want to work with everybody,
but sometimes it just don’t come together like that. [points in the
audience] I’ve been wanting to work with Raphael [Saadiq] for years, but it’s
about the right song, right track, especially when you truly care about your
art. I want to make a record that’s going to compliment us both and create
something completely new for us and Redman or whoever that person may be. Our
styles coming together to create a whole new style. It’s not just about a
feature. It’s truly about doing a collaboration and bringing everybody in the
creative fold. When you call somebody like Redman, he’s thrown off because
he’s like, “De La, thinking of me?” Everybody looked to meet the challenge,
especially if you really… it’s an unspoken. If you’re into hip hop like you
say you’re into hip hop, you’re going to meet certain challenges. Redman met
the challenge. Busta met the challenge. It was definitely a natural think.
Slick Rick, that was the most incredible, I felt, record we made. I didn’t
know how we were going to do that. I always felt like Ricky was going to
outshine us out the door, but it came together. Even the turnaround to make a
record with B-Real. How we going to do that? It’s just going to be Mase and
B-Real, because they the only ones that smoke weed, but the concept came
together. The concept was so ill. Us - myself and B-Real - trying to get Pos
to smoke weed who never smoked weed, and calling the song “Peer
Pressure.” We’re as comedic at
one point; the dual message. The dual message, “You don’t have to smoke weed
to be cool,” and then, “Everybody who smoke weed ain’t bad people or stupid.”
By having Maseo and B-Real and Posdnuos brings a certain message to weed
smoking and the person who chooses not to smoke weed. It was very comedic and
hip hop at the same time, and a true, true, true collaboration, not a feature.
“De La featuring B-Real” and it’s just some bullshit he kicks a 16 and it’s
over. Audience member Hi Maseo. I’m hoping this is a yes, because I saw that you guys did a Nike
couple of tracks a couple of years ago, and it really got me pumped up for
another De La Soul album. I’m hoping that you say yes. Is there another De La
Soul album in the making? Maseo Absolutely, man. Absolutely. [applause] You going to see a lot of cool stuff going down. A lot of cool stuff going on.
Right now, the fellows is moving along with this project presented by these
French cats as a concept album called First
Serve. They play these two weird
characters. I forgot the name of Dave’s character, but Pos’s character is
called Deen Witter, and I like his character because he’s totally out of
character being this character. He’s playing somebody who’s supposed to be a
degenerate, pretty much a fuck-up, smoking weed, wearing a smoking jacket and
the do-rag. It looks bugged out. Dave look like a broke-ass Rick Ross. It’s
funny as hell. It’s funny. It’s funny. The project is called First Serve. It’s
funny, man. I don’t want anybody to assume that it’s a De La Soul record and
be disappointed. You really got to check out the concept of the whole project,
check out the visuals, the credits. It’s funny as hell, man. I’m working on a
project called DJ Conductor, where I’m producing new artists and my friends
that I’ve been wanting to work with for the longest. I got a song with KRS-1.
I’ve got to song with Freddie Foxxx. I’ve got a song with Mac Miller, a song
with Fashawn, a couple of cats that I’m inspired by, and finally doing
something that I’ve been needing to do for a long time. Then, you’re going to
see us, of course, make a De La album. We’re going to also make a De La album
with Prince Paul. [applause] A lot is going down. A lot of good stuff is brewing. I’m in a good place where
things are. I’m glad the Internet did what it did to the record business, so
the strong will survive. It’s going to show the true testament who’s down for
this music and who’s not down for it, because the checks aren’t there like
they used to be. We’ve got to work that much harder for the check. I love what
I do, so I’ve always worked hard. The error of the big checks, I wasn’t really
catching them anyway. [laughs] I didn’t miss anything. I’m still able to do
what I love to do and catch what I’m catching. I like my place in it. I love
where things are at with the Internet and things being independent again. It’s
going full circle. I was with Tommy Boy when they were independent, and then
they went major. Now they’re back to being independent again, and everybody’s
independent.

Santa Cecilia Orchestra
Since the Academy likes to spread the musical landscape as far and wide as we possibly can, it felt right to have one of the most fascinating outfits in Italian musical history sit down with us as part of the 2004 Red Bull Music Academy in Rome. Founded in 1908, the Santa Cecilia Orchestra (or The Orchestra dell’Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, to be precise) was the first orchestra in the whole of Italy to devote itself to symphonic repertoire; giving the first performances of some of the most important works of the 20th century, and conducted by legendary figures such as Mahler, Strauss, Sibelius, Stravinskij and Toscanini. In their lecture we learned about the continued life of these talented figures.
Hosted by Emma Warren We have the Orchestra de Santa Cecilia here. They are going to play some music and they are going to talk to us as well. So here we are, the Orchestra of Santa Cecilia. Francesco Storino Hello, everybody. We are the education staff of Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia is one of the most ancient music institutions all over the world. It has been founded in the 16th century, in Rome, and it’s five hundred years it brings music to people. Before we speak, I prefer we play. Let’s hear a little music, and let me introduce my friend and colleague, Gregorio, playing. [applause] Yes, please. Do you know what instrument is this? Audience member French horn. Francesco Storino Not at all. Audience member Tuba. Francesco Storino Tuba, yeah. It’s basso tuba, it’s a tuba. It’s a fascinating instrument. I don’t want to speak. Please, Gregorio, play for us. (music: Gregorio Mazzarese – live tuba performance) What Gregorio played for us is a great minuet by Johann Sebastian Bach. It’s Baroque music. It’s music that’s four hundred years ago. Now, let me introduce our beauty, Laura, pianist. For a pianist, what better to play than Chopin? (music: Laura De Mariassevich – live piano performance) Great. Now, let’s introduce myself. I am Francesco, I play the cello. And since I am very arrogant, I want to introduce myself playing a piece written by myself. Its name is “Intrada.” (music: Francesco Storino – live cello performance of “Intrada”) Oh, so, I... Ah, OK, here you are. I need somebody, help! [fiddling with mic] OK, thank you. So, now, we have introduced to you very different kinds of instruments. I guess for many of you, a classical concert may be quite a new experience. Is it? Audience member No. Francesco Storino Not at all? OK, I’m very happy with this. If it isn’t, we will speak in a more profound way. First of all, I would like Gregorio to explain to us how a brass instrument works, because it’s very interesting. Gregorio Mazzarese OK, this is a tuba. This is a brass instrument, probably you know other brass instrument, somebody had a mistake with this instrument, call him a French horn. OK, all brass instrument are French horn, trombone, trumpet. The trombone, you remember, is one that you can probably see playing this way [mimics trombone slide]. The similar characteristic of these instrument that they are all made by brass, by a metal, yellow metal called brass. The function of this instrument are very simple. This one is only a tube. This is not this instrument that make the sound. The only part in which we can make the sound is this one [holds up mouthpiece]. All the rest of the instrument is only tube that amplificate the sound that you form, you create in this mouthpiece. The similar characteristic of all brass instrument is that they are a tube, they have a mouthpiece, they have some finger mechanism to make the tube longer and shorter. You must see that this position, this finger, this mechanism, is not... Francesco Storino Don’t forget them. Gregorio Mazzarese OK. You see that we have also in the trumpet, you see three mechanisms. Why? Don’t ask me why. OK, the sound in the tuba and in all brass instrument is make in this one, just like this. [blows through mouthpiece] Yes, you must imagine that all my life, I make this one. All the brass instrument in this life make all the boos buzzing in the mouthpiece. The sound of the mouthpiece is amplificated by the tuba this way. I show you. Just similar to the electronic device. Sometimes you have the device that produce the sound, and another device that amplificate the sound, is all electronical. But you have the master that you make by the computer by other device, and then you have the amplification, that this is one. The difference from a brass instrument and electronic instrument, also between the other instrument that you see this afternoon with us, is they are only acoustic instrument. We have no electronic device that amplificate the sound. Why we have only four fingers? Because you know that the notes that we can produce are a lot. Because this is not ... We have not the report from one note, one fingers, but a lot of note with one position. I want to explain. If I don’t push anything, I can make not only one note, but a lot of note. If I push one finger, I have the same series of note, but just a half tone lower. You see, this is the first series. [plays tuba] One finger. The tube became longer and longer, and you can make the series of note, not only one note, lower, lower, lower. Mixing up one note from one series and mix another from that, you can have all the grade of the scale. This is the reason for, because all the brass instrument, trumpet, trombone, have only seven position, because mixing up one, but you can push two together, have all the note. Another characteristic of a tuba is the lower of the bass instrument. The instrument make a note more in the bass register of the scale. This is, the tuba is one of the younger of the brass section, because it was created only in the last centuries. Why? Because trumpet, you can find a trumpet also in the medieval period. But this instrument was the younger because it was technically difficult to make up a tuba, and then because the ancient instrument, they have not a very big sound. So they don’t need, in the lower register, a very big sound from a brass instrument. But from the last century, the sound in a live electronic device, the sound of the orchestra, the sound of the music, became bigger and bigger and bigger, until we found the electronical device that permit to have a big sound. It’s not breaking, but from eighteenth century, music needed more power. More power. It begin for this reason, born, tuba. Also the contrabass. You see the contrabass that my friend Storino explained, Francesco explained about the string. Most of the contrabasses became bigger, because they needed more sound, the orchestra became larger. In the eighteenth century orchestra we have twenty string, then became thirty, forty, fifty. At the beginning of the twentieth century, we have one hundred, and more and more and more. Mahler writes a symphony for one thousand instrument. Audeince member Is it usual that in an orchestra, there are two or three tubas playing? Gregorio Mazzarese OK, always, the most, ninety percent of the piece of the orchestra in which you found a tuba, there is only one tuba. There is some piece, especially for Berlioz, especially for Strauss. Francesco Storino Mahler, too. Gregorio Mazzarese Mahler, not. I don’t remember Mahler with two tuba. Strauss and Berlioz, we need two tuba. Audience member Stravinsky. Gregorio Mazzarese Stravinsky. Stravinsky, no, two tuba. Francesco Storino Maybe Wagner. Gregorio Mazzarese Ah, so, Rite of Spring, yes, Rite of Spring have two tuba, yes. The reason, when we need to create attention, then we speak about attention. Audience member Some 19th-century composers actually added a lot of low instruments in their works, and they needed a lot of instruments like double basses and tubas, maybe. Wagner. Schoenberg also. Gregorio Mazzarese Two reasons in which they employ bass instruments. Not only bass brass, but also bass strings, because they needed two situations. The first was what I say before, that they need more sound. When you need more sound, you need to improve mostly the bass, and then also the high, because the ear of the men, of the human people, you know that it’s easier to heard the central range. You have difficult to heard the lower, also the very high range. Our ear is able to distinguish very good in the middle of the range. When you go up and down, so when you want to employ the sound, you need to employ more the lower. Probably, I don’t know, all the device, we find that pushing this way, you send immediately the sound that may be called wider. There is only a little trick employing the bass and the high there. The second reason, to make the people afraid. It’s another trick. For example, Shoenberg or Zemlinsky use two tuba, it’s a lot of contrabass, to make a situation of afraid, of tension. If you improve just like this. Audience member Can’t the tuba produce harmonics? Gregorio Mazzarese [plays tuba] The same bass. Audience member Can’t the tuba produce harmonics? Gregorio Mazzarese Wait, the same bass, the player here, will make you afraid. [Laura plays piano] While the lower register, it’s poor. So they need one tuba, two tuba, two double bass. Audience member Can the tuba produce harmonics, those high tones inside the note? Gregorio Mazzarese Yes, theoretically you can play as high as you want. Practically it was I believe the other player. We work only with harmonics. When a player [plays three ascending notes on tuba] These are the second, the third and the fourth harmonic. The first harmonic on this tuba is this one. You can choose the second harmonic. You can elide it higher. Francesco Storino I will answer your question with the cello. I can go much higher and I will show you. Gregorio Mazzarese OK. The last thing which I remember, one piece in particular in which brass instruments are used to make a strange situation. It’s a piece of Schoenberg. It’s not very... it’s called Gurre-Lieder. Gurre-Lieder is a piece of Schoenberg in which he wants to represent a lot of scenes of this country, Gurre. In this piece, in one point he wants to represent the skeleton that at the end of the night, when they go down in the hearth. They use three tubas and two contrabass posaune just like a [inaudible] go down, down, down to represent this situation. Remember, it’s a passage just like this one. (music: Gregorio Mazzarese plays brief tuba passage from Gurre-Lieder) These are the skeleton that go down now. The other question? [laughter] Later. Audience member The tuba was also used in a lot of popular music like marching bands and jazz bands in the beginning, right? Gregorio Mazzarese One of the most famous composer for marching band is John Philip Sousa. Audience member American. Gregorio Mazzarese Yes. Not only composed for tuba but he built a tuba. Probably you see a tuba that is going just around the body of the player and going this way, similar to this one. It’s only the shape that is changed because this is only a tube in which, instead of this shape, is a shape just around the body of the bringer and the player. He studied this kind of tuba to make easier to transport while he was playing. Also for an aesthetic reason, because the bell was not going up, but going in front. He had these two advantage. The first advantage is that the sound, when you play in the open air, don’t go out but go in the people, in the orchestra. The second reason is that with the big bell you can write the name of the band, of the composer, you can enjoy this one. Audience member How long is the tube? Gregorio Mazzarese In this tuba it’s 4 meters, without pushing the tube. But the most popular tuba, the B flat tuba, is six meters longer. Pushing all the valves, you can go to eight meters longer, just about. Audience member Thank you. Gregorio Mazzarese Ciao! [applause] Francesco Storino Now I can show you some secret about string instruments. Of course I have a cello, and I speak about the cello but what I will say, it’s for all string instruments. First of all, may be interesting that in Italian – Italy is where string instruments have been invented – the name is not string instrument but bow instrument: Strumenti ad arco, “bow instrument.” First of all I will explain that the name of the bow can sound strange, because the shape is not the shape of a bow. But this is now. When the string instruments were founded in the 14th century, the original shape of the bow was exactly a bow, like this, convex. Then with passing the time and needing more effects, first for some of the springing bow effects, like this [plays cello] can you see? the bow springs on the string – they found that this kind of shape was much better to do this. With the centuries, the shape changed in this way. Speaking of the bow, may be quite interesting to see, do you know what material is this one? Horse hair, OK, everybody knows. But the secret I want to explain to you: Do you think it’s male or female, or both? Audience member Female. Audience member Male. Audience member It doesn’t matter. Francesco Storino It does. It’s male, only male. Why? Audience member Stronger. Francesco Storino Not at all. Audience member Thicker. Francesco Storino No, very characteristic matter. Think about physiology. There’s a problem: This is a horse tail, of course. Think about a horse... Audience member [inaudible]. Francesco Storino Yeah, think about... Audience member Substances that end up in the horse’s tail, not with the male horse but with the female horse? Francesco Storino Yeah, for example. I speak without any problem. Think of a horse when it pisses. Audience member Exactly. Francesco Storino A male will piss this way. [points forward] A female will piss this way, on its tail. [points down] The problem is that the female horse hair stinks. This is the only matter why we use male horse. That’s just funny, but nobody knows. Audience member Yeah it is funny. [laughter] Francesco Storino That’s the only matter. Otherwise we can use all kind of horse, of white horse. White horse instead of black horse: This is a real physiological difference. Black horse gives hair for double bass bow, because it’s thicker. We need thinner hair so we use white horse hair. When you look to a string instrument, you can see a body, that’s the main part of the instrument. What you can’t see is what’s inside the body of the instrument, because it’s not only empty. Inside there are two main parts. A little cylinder of wood that connects the upper to the bottom. Its name in Italian is anima, that means soul, because its position is really the soul of the sound. It depends on the correct position of this little wooden part how the sound will be good or not so good. In English it’s “sound post,” in Italian it’s soul. OK, we are more poetic, I don’t know. The other one is the chain. Name is chain because it’s a wooden piece running on the upper part of the body in this way. Both these pieces of wood for all string instruments have the responsibility to amplify the sound, to make the sound possible, to transmit to all the body of the instrument, and then to be released from these holes – named Fs, it’s evident why. The shape is only for aesthetical matters. It push out the vibration of the string. The cello in the range of the string instruments is like a tenor in human voice. It has as characteristic, it reaches all the range of the human voice, from the bass to the female voice, and then more, going up to many notes usually played by the violin for their height. [plays cello] It’s a very large range of notes. For example, I can show you the harmonics you were asking. Audience member The armonici. Francesco Storino The armonici, yeah, the harmonics you were asking. What do we mean when we speak about an harmonic? If we have a principal note, maybe this one [plays cello] – this is a theory coming from Pythagoras, okay, so it’s very important – if you cut the string in two equal parts, this sound will be an octave upper. I show you immediately: If I put my finger at the exact half of the string, if the sound of the open string is this [plays cello], with my finger in the middle will be an octave upper. If you divide it into three parts, will be an octave and a fifth upper. So this is a third of the string. Then two octaves. The more you divide the string, the upper goes the sound. These are harmonics. Gregorio Mazzarese You see that when he make higher notes he push here, OK. Now, for the purpose of the demo, he can push also very soft here. [talks to Francesco in Italian] Francesco Storino Mhmmm Gregorio Mazzarese You see that he is pushing here, at this point. It’s just like he make it here, here, here, here, here, here, here, at the division, pushing this point, it’s a... Francesco Storino If I play, if I just push very lightly here, I divide the string in four parts. It’s the same, three and one, so it’s like I’ve divided the whole string in four parts. Gregorio Mazzarese You see, people see, if you push here, the sound becomes also high because it’s just like if he divided it in eight parts. It’s interesting. Francesco Storino It’s four. Gregorio Mazzarese It’s push here, just like he push here, here, here, here, here. There’s a point, there’s an eight part of the chord. Francesco Storino I can use these to make the higher sound as possible. Harmonics. Francesco Storino He meant, with harmonics. Gregorio Mazzarese [inaudible] but had only with the tension to this note. If you listened very carefully, you heard after ten seconds, this note. You’re able to hear that higher note. Francesco Storino Can somebody hear? Yes? Gregorio Mazzarese It’s very soft because inside the first note, there are a lot of harmonics. The fifth is the harmonic that we heard better. There are other harmonics in the chord. OK. Francesco Storino Yeah. Now I just want to play something because I want to show what the cello is in, for example, romantic music. The cello in romantic music is a singer. A singer without words, and in fact, I want to play a piece by Felix Mendelssohn, named Lieder ohne Worte. Lied ohne Worte. That’s “Song Without Words.” OK. Thank you. (music: Francesco, Laura and Gregorio live performance of Lieder ohne Worte) Audience member In the Baroque period... Francesco Storino In the? Audience member Baroque. Barocco. Francesco Storino Yes, yes. Audience member The Baroque period. Francesco Storino La Baroque, yes? Is it? Participant Yes. I heard a lot of Barocco through my life. Anyway. In the Baroque period, I remembered that in the orchestras there were no double basses yet. Was the cello a big solo instrument for those pieces? Francesco Storino Maybe I have to explain you better what no double basses meant, because it’s not exact. There were no double basses simply because their name was not double bass. You have to know that double bass – that I find is one of the most fascinating instruments existing – is quite a new instrument. But its shape and its kind of technique depends very strictly on his grandfather, the violone of the Baroque music. For example, string instruments, modern string instruments, are the evolution of the viola family of the Renaissance period. Audience member Viola da gamba. Francesco Storino Please let me. Viola da gamba, for example, yeah, but double bass is quite the same as the viola di piede, that’s foot viola, viola di piede. That was the old name of double bass in Baroque and the Renaissance period. It’s not true there were not bass instruments in Baroque music. There was simply violone instead of double bass, so it existed, a bass instrument, for Baroque music. Cello is not a great solo instrument in Baroque period, because cello was in a strange situation. I can’t explain in a very short time, but viola da gamba, the old parent of the cello, was a noble instrument. Noble not for a particular characteristic or something like this, but because it was played in the courts. It was noble because it was played by kings, for example. It was considered noble. When they found an instrument like the cello, whose sound is much powerful and rich than the one of the gamba, of course there was a great reaction to this, and cello was considered en français “le pauvre diable,” a poor... Audience member Poor devil. Francesco Storino Yes, yes, yes. Poor devil. Only with Johann Sebastian Bach, this idea started to change. This is why in Baroque music only Vivaldi wrote some concerts for cello. Vivaldi and the cellists. But not famous composers like Tartini, maybe, like Corelli, the great Baroque composer, Handel, Telemann. None of them wrote a cello concerto. None of them, because of this. Let me say that I consider viola di gamba a fantastic instrument. Very fascinating instrument. It’s a pity I haven’t one now, but it sounds very soft. It’s so beautiful. The importance of the cello starts with Bach and with the Classical period, Beethoven, for example. They are the first important composers for cello. OK? I want to change now. Gregorio Mazzarese Want to speak about tension? Francesco Storino What’s that? Gregorio Mazzarese Want to speak about tension? Francesco Storino Yeah. Gregorio Mazzarese OK. Francesco Storino Before, as I heard the lecture that was before our one, it was very interesting because I heard about tensions, what was the idea of... Gregorio Mazzarese Because acoustics. We play acoustic instruments. Usually you use electronic device. What is the matter that we needed to make the same, we and you? We needed to make up the tension of the person who helped us with our instrument, and you with your instrument. Sometimes we also use electronic device. And what is the [inaudible] things that make up the attention to person. The attention is made up by the tension. Attention/tension. How we can create the tension with music, with our instrument? We want to explain something about this. OK? Francesco Storino OK. Yes, but before speaking we have to play. Gregorio Mazzarese Yes, we have a piece written by Francesco. The name of the piece is Orange, “Arancione,” just like the color, and the heart of this piece is not only – just like my shirt, yes – the title of this piece not only thinks of the music, I think it’s beautiful music. But which are the points that the attention go up and which is the point in which the attention and the tension go down? Francesco Storino Many of you have already heard this because we started with this piece, but now we’ll play again, just to speak about this piece. This will be another thing we will speak about, the fine tuning of the instruments. We will speak about afterward. Gregorio Mazzarese You can change the tuning by, for example, he using the mechanism at the top. In the tuba and on the basses, you probably you see trumpet player that move this pump, is the principle pump. Usually you can put the pitch lower and higher of the total instrument. OK. [speaks Italian] (music: Francesco, Laura and Gregorio – live performance of “Arancione”) Francesco Storino Have you heard how we started in a mood and ended in a [inaudible]. This is made just to create, in various ways, attention. For example, what did we do? First of all, we made clear the difference of the increasing number of players, of course. First I play alone, then with the tuba, and then we were three. But this is obvious. Less obvious is the use of the dynamics. How did we use dynamics in this piece? For example, when I started alone, I played quite soft, but not so soft. For example, the start was this. [plays cello] Don’t worry, this is usual. It’s normal that this happens, but it’s not so normal. It happens to the players, and it happens even in the concerts so there’s some player that during a concert will be looking over his person to switch off during the concert. It’s very funny. Returning to our tension, dynamic tension. I wrote in this piece the starting of the piece is piano, soft. But when the tuba starts to play, I wrote mezzo-forte, not so soft. But if I play, I play it not so soft to start, and softer when the tuba gets in. Please. Directly from your start. [play together] Gregorio Mazzarese OK. Francesco Storino OK. Yes. OK. This is your start, but I was wrong. Gregorio Mazzarese The entire bar. Francesco Storino Number, number? Gregorio Mazzarese Is 21. Francesco Storino 21. Gregorio Mazzarese Second bar. Second. Francesco Storino Number. Gregorio Mazzarese The ten movement. Francesco Storino All the bad place. Gregorio Mazzarese OK. Francesco Storino It looks. It’s a stronger sound, but it isn’t. Simply, two instruments, instead of one, are playing first. Second, the harmony is richer than the beginning, and this gives an idea of increasing something. But I didn’t do it playing stronger. Even because this piece is three minutes of music, if I play too loud now, how can I play at the end when... [plays loud on cello] I have to break my instrument to play so loud? I can’t. This gives tension, when dynamic is used in a way you can’t expect. Another example of this may be Laura, with you. Maybe let’s play place 41. Your beginning. Laura De Mariassevich With piano? Francesco Storino Si. [speaking Italian] (music: Francesco, Laura – live demonstration of “Arancione”) Francesco Storino OK, thank you. Did you hear what happened? Suddenly, the dynamic was down. Audience member A real contrast. Francesco Storino Real contrast, yeah. But in the whole you can’t feel it as a piano moment. Piano, soft moment of the music, but like something has happened. Like a broken breath. What happened? This gives more attention. Even if we play it in a way that seems to be dis-tension way. OK? Is it clear? Did I explain myself? Audience member Yeah. Francesco Storino This is one way. Another example is the rhythmical example. The beginning of the piece is this. [plays] Going on is this. [plays] Then. [plays] And more. [plays] More again. [plays] And finally. [plays] These are examples of diminution of the rhythm. Every time faster, faster, faster and faster, but not faster in the movement. Not faster in the beat, but faster in the writing. [counting rhythm] like this. This is not a way to give a rhythmical tension. This is very important, because the faster you write, the bigger will be the impression of the music. It’s quite strange, because usually we think that faster music sounds like more tense music. This isn’t true. For example, if I play the same pace at two speeds. Here. [plays] This is like this. [plays] But if I play it faster. [plays] Maybe you can see I have some difficulty playing, but the first idea was this. [claps beat] The second idea was this. [claps beat] The feeling is slower. Yeah. The feeling is slower. The music is faster, but the feeling is slower. This is a way to make a dis-tension, not a tension. The tension is given playing at exactly the same tempo. For example, for you this is very good, because you have familiarity with electronic devices. Electronic devices have great advantage in keeping the tempo. When you use a loop, you are sure that you will have the same beat, and you decide if you want to change. It’s not given by personality. It’s not the same when you play with acoustic instruments. You risk, when you play an instrument like this, to rush, or to slow down the music. This is why using acoustic instruments, using increasing reboots gives tension, because you have to keep the control of the rhythm. You have absolutely to make up your mind to control what’s happening on the rhythm. I feel a little envy for electronic device because of this. Because they give you something sure. For example, with the rhythm. But, my envy stops when I think that I can take the control of myself to have the same rhythm, and, if I want, I don’t do this. I give a little more. For example, I change a little the tempo. I did this. Maybe you didn’t feel, but if you have electronic device keeping the tempo, you have felt that I was a little pushing the tempo. Was a little faster than the start. I can do this. This is my advantage, our advantage, with acoustical instruments on the electronic devices. Gregorio Mazzarese OK. Resuming what he was going to explain. What is that make you be in a tension about music? Not on the music, also in your life. Also in literature. Also in life. If you want to make tension, what is it that make you afraid? Is what is unexpected. You are in tension. You are in afraid. When you have something that you don’t know. When you don’t know what is going to happen. When you going to do something that you don’t know. What is the opposite of tension? Is boring. What is boring? Is what you know. Something repeat. How you can play to the bore music? Bore literature? Bore book? Bore life? Bore evening? When you repeat the same thing all the time. When the people expect what you are going to perform. What we are going to present. What you are going to speak. The people is intention is give you his attention when he don’t expect. You can have the tension of people, and probably is useful for your work. Also in any electronic music. Also when you are in a disco, or music happening. How? You have two way. One is the progression. In the piece of a Francesco that all two situation. The first way you can create tension is by progression. What means? To go in one direction is can be in the sound. [Laura plays piano] Laura De Mariassevich OK, so I think you use this rhythm very usual in your composition, because it is a modern rhythm. The last one is the more complicated. It could introduce another argument that is the harmony. In this variation, Mozart changed the mode from major to minor. I think you know major minor, or you know chord. Gregorio Mazzarese We explain later. Laura De Mariassevich Yes. We explain later. Gregorio Mazzarese With the help of Francesco. Laura De Mariassevich This melody is in, this variation is in minor mode, and you can listen that the character is more intimate. Is different from other variation, because minor mode has the expansion. This affect to create an intimate sad character. If you want to create a sad and intimate melody you can use minor mode. That is more efficient by the major. This is the variation. [plays] OK? I think it’s different. OK, and finish, you can tell about harmony. Gregorio Mazzarese Matter. Laura introduces another matter. Brava. [applause] You see, and you heard how Mozart change the melody and the rhythm, especially in the last when is just like jazz rhythm. Is Mozart and jazz. Is Mozart. Original Mozart, but the most important is the last one. You must know that the music of two century. Other music of two century from perhaps three century, from 17th century to the last century, the 20th century, is based on two rules. Major and minor. You know that one. You know about this. All the music. Also, the music you use in electronic device is based on these tunes. This is one of the mystery of the music. The difference from major and minor. You must know that this is the music played in major moods. [Francesco plays cello] The same notes we change only one notes of a half tune. It means that from [plays] Only change these notes, hear the music. [plays] You feel the moods, from happy to sadness. [plays] Major. Minor. He change only one note of half tone. Nobody knows why changing this notes, we feel sad moods, instead of happy moods. This is not only in our civilities. Also if we make heard this music in a tribal people, or in other country. In Japan. In Brazil. In Cape Town. People [inaudible] that is happy moods, and sad moods. Nobody knows why, and on this two moods, is best the music from the 17th century... Francesco Storino No, 16th. 16th century. Gregorio Mazzarese 16th century to the last century. After the beginning of the 20th century something changed. They discovered either way the mystery moods remain still today in all the life music. The pitch will move, which is composed of notes. And nobody why. This and other things that is complicated to the tension. If you want people to make tension, you must don’t play these notes, this note. What it means. The note that will change from the alto tone is the note that you make happy or sad. [plays] Happy and sad. If you put a way, this note, if I saw this. [plays] We don’t know how you, notes is. This is a trick, another trick to make tension. It’s used, for example, from Harry Mancini. You know who is Harry Mancini? He’s a composer, who composed the soundtrack of ... Audience member Yes, Charades, Pink Panther. Gregorio Mazzarese Of Pink Panther, yes. You remember the beginning of Pink Panther? Audience member Breakfast at Tiffany’s, too. Gregorio Mazzarese Especially in the Pink Panther, you remember how the Pink Panther begin? Audience member [inaudible]. Gregorio Mazzarese Yes, but before this. [plays] I see. What make Harry Mancini these three notes? He needs to make you in tension. He needs, Harry Mancini knows that this is a film, you know the film is a story of diamonds and keeping. Music make tension. The first things Harry Mancini does, did is put away the modal note, the note that make you happy or sad. So when you heard, okay follow. [plays] Now you don’t know if it is happy or sad. Have the same music with the modal node. For example, happy. [plays] This is sad. It’s is not, you are not afraid, you know that is happy or sad. Putting away this note, you know the music, you don’t know what happy. This is a way to make tension. You must know that to make the music, happy or sad is very important also for these reason. Francesco Storino In the Pink Panther theme, we know it’s minor only when the theme is already started. This is cute, because we have to wait for one minute music to know this. This is the tension. In one minute, we don’t know it would be major, minor, modal. We don’t know. Gregorio Mazzarese A lot of composers in classical music, and also in the soundtrack music, use this way to make you without.... Francesco Storino The first to do this was Ludwig van Beethoven in the 9th symphony. The 9th symphony of Beethoven starts like this. [plays] For one minute we have two notes, B and A, and those notes don’t tell to us what’s happening. We only know there’s this. [plays] It goes on, goes. And finally the whole orchestra played. (music: Francesco Storino performs section from Beethoven's Symphony No. 9) Here is it. Now we know this is minor! It took two minutes know it. When there are three of them, like this, what’s happening? I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. Gregorio Mazzarese This situation make it that we have, in this scale. In the scale. A [inaudible] position of the note. When we decide in the most of the music that we use today, that you use. We have a [inaudible] position of a note. There is a bass note, from the middle, for example. [plays] There is a dominant, the second for important for something. [plays] Then there are other, for example, there is the sensible. There is the note that you never stop this note. For example, see. [plays] You can stop there. [plays] Audience member It’s the leading note, there’s a subtonic. Gregorio Mazzarese Yes, it’s the leading note, subtonic. This is the modal theory. You must understand, in the last century, they put all the, [inaudible] and they start another way to music. We time, I can explain what’s [inaudible]. Audience member I was really about to ask about the mic... Francesco Storino The microphone, the microphone. Gregorio Mazzarese What’s your name? Audience member Alex. We were talking about tonality, tone of music, a concept that was mainly explored after the Baroque period, but had a great work with the well tampered clamp here. That established, it was in my opinion it was a scientific essay about tonality. Which is actually in, once again, my opinion, a gravitational force in between notes. But what about modal music? Gregorio Mazzarese Yes. Francesco Storino That’s very interesting. First of all, I absolutely agree with your opinion. Tonality is gravitational system. But it works even with modality. The tension in this sense, in modality, lays on the mode itself. But the mode may be considered as a son of the tonality. Audience member Or the father, who knows? Gregorio Mazzarese Sorry? Audience member Father, because the concept of mode is earlier. Gregorio Mazzarese Yes. Audience member Scientifically. Gregorio Mazzarese Yes, sure, but you have to think about that with the 16th century, with [inaudible], for example, was of common opinion that the winning theory was the tunnel theory. For four centuries, this was absolutely this. Only after Mahler, it changed. Gregorio Mazzarese Imagine our modal music... Audience member Had a great deal about establishing the modes that people could play. In the middle age. Francesco Storino That’s a very long discussion, maybe interesting, but may even be that... Audience member It’s a little deep. Francesco Storino Yes, but maybe now it’s a little late. What time is it? Audience member 6 o’clock. Francesco Storino 6 o’clock. Gregorio Mazzarese You speak about modal music, but what happen in the last century? After three century of modal music, and major and minor, just like in the [inaudible], they want to find the other way to present the reality. That civilization is going broke. Also the music find a new way to represent what they do. This is a scientific way to make music. They decide that all the mode of the scale are the same situation. There is not the dominant, there is not the modal, there is not an attraction for note, but all the note, you understand me, are the same import. This is a scientific, academic, it was a decision. They must found a different way to way to build the music, because without rules, regularly, we can do nothing. They decided on a table, the new rules. One of the new rules that they decided was the serial music. You never heard about serial music? Audience member I’ve heard of it. Gregorio Mazzarese [chuckles] Alex, OK. The serial music is a music in which you must make a serial. What is a serial, is all the 12 tone on the scale, and you must play all the 12 tones on the scale before to play another time one of the 12 note. You understand what that means? You must play, you have 12 tone in a scale. You have [Laura plays piano] You have the serial, you have these 12 note, you can choose the set. You can first one, then another, then another. Then you have 12 notes, but you can’t play the same notes two times. When you have the complete set, you can make another one. You can make, and this is the academic way to make it, you can make the same set in the inverse. Francesco Storino Really? Gregorio Mazzarese You can play in the opposite direction. You understand me? You have the serial, then you play one of these, then you can play the same in the opposite direction. Then you can change the interval, you can make... Francesco Storino Mirror. Gregorio Mazzarese Just like in a mirror. This is an academic way, that it take about ... Francesco Storino A mirror reverse. Gregorio Mazzarese You can take, about 50 years in the last century, it became... I tell, for example, of serial music written for tuba in 1990. It’s for tuba, you understand, I play. The first 12 note are all different. Then I play the same note in upwards direction, my change in the tone. This is what happen. (music: Gregorio Mazzarese – live tuba demonstration) Now, is the opposite. (music: Gregorio Mazzarese – live tuba demonstration) OK, that’s correct. If you see the music in, you see that the, this is the first section. The second staff is actually identical of the first, just read in. Then the piece go on, go on. What it means, this? That they want to find a new way. When you heard this music, you probably don’t, hmm, sounds strange in your ear. You must understand that the beginning, about 1920, it sound very strange. It was just like a scandal. A scandal when you make this music. But they go on. The other situation that we can find to, different way to make music, is using the sound of nature. Probably you, this is the way that you can go, do with a electronic device, and you improve over the electronic device. Using for example, cascade sounds, river sounds, Martello, hammer sounds. Music using the sounds of nature. You can make music just using this way, use the train sound and so on. Sometime they have a mix using a tape, using an instrument that represent sounds of the nature, sounds of civilization. Francesco Storino Maybe we have told so much. It’s enough. I love to end with music. Audience member Yeah! Francesco Storino We are thinking about to play something by Chick Corea, because we do believe, and this is the matter for which we are here. The differences between classical music, rather than jazz, rather than all kind of music, is not the difference that makes a contrast. Is only a different to inform us that the music is different by another, but the great music is only great music. Leonard Bernstein said, “There are only two kinds of music, good music and bad music.” I agree in total. When I am here, I learn so much from what you are doing, because it’s very interesting and very important. The history of music is going on, and you are not only the present but also the future of music. We are too. We love to have this kind of experience, common experience, in music. So now we can do this with Chick Corea. And why not? I hope we can do something together sometimes. I really hope. OK, please. Would you like to improvise something with us? Something once? Audience member Yes. Francesco Storino Who wants? Come here. (music: Francesco, Laura and Gregorio – live performance of Chick Corea song) Thank you to everybody. Gregorio Mazzarese If you ask some more questions, we are here to answer. Not only for Alex. No? OK Audience member What do you think is the most important thing about when you are ready to handle a new composition? Francesco Storino When we arrange. Go ahead. Gregorio Mazzarese You have the multiple expert ... Audience member Attention, you talked a little bit about a little difficult elements within the composition, in the composition itself, the flow and stuff like that. Do you feel that there is a certain structure, or formula that is particularly helpful? Francesco Storino There are many, many things that on which will depend this answer. It depends, for example, on a... First of all, on the personal feeling. What’s important to me for I want to put... Audience member Self. Francesco Storino Yes, of the music, and first of all, myself. Okay, myself. Myself, not an ego way, but in a feeling. What’s my feeling about this music? What I want, for example, what happen now, if I had arranged this piece, my feeling is very rhythmical. Even as a children’s song, so very nice theme, a very simple harmony – I feel a great pulse, rhythmic pulse inside. If I made an arrangement for example, for this group, I would have written a very important rhythmical part. [drums on body of his cello] Something like a bodhran, in Irish music, for example. Another very important thing is to know, absolutely, perfectly the instruments you are going to use. Audience member For the sounds. Francesco Storino The sounds, the sounds, and not only the sounds. In our, especially in our field, the technique of those instruments is fundamental. If you want a sound, if I want a tuba sound, for example, I have, not only I must know that this instrument can do this. I think it’s the same in your field. You have to know perfectly this, because otherwise you will bring only an idea, your idea. But it will not pass because the people who’s playing this or the instrument who is playing this will not give this idea. I have a big deal with myself now, because I have just written a piece that I am afraid will be not possible to play, exactly for ideas. I wanted to push the technique of an instrument – actually the cello – in such a way that I am afraid it will be not possible to play. But it’s a deal with myself. Audience member Why is that, because of the... Francesco Storino Technical matters, because... [motions to sit down but realizes his chair is not there anymore] It’s not my chair. That’s very dangerous, and it was sitting up onto nothing. I’m afraid I’ve written something I was not able to play. Audience member Why don’t you use 2 people? Francesco Storino When I use two people... Audience member If you can’t play it, then why don’t you use two people to play it? Francesco Storino I have only one. I haven’t another one. Audience member If you get twp people to put the hands on it, no? Francesco Storino No, this is not possible. No, because it’s quite complicated to explain. It’s obviously not two people on one instrument, okay, but two people playing the same part, if there’s a problem, bend to the meaning, to the technical meaning of this part. Both of them will not play this. The deal with myself is, I want to do this, because I like very much what I’ve written, but I actually don’t know if will be able to do it. That’s a risk I can take on myself, not on another person. Audience member What is the risk you are making? Francesco Storino The risk? The great risk is that the music will be not my music. Audience member No, no, but you cannot get the scale? Francesco Storino No, I haven’t fear enough to play, because maybe [plays] It’s so difficult, music. [plays] An example, I have [plays] An octet, here. If I have to go more than an octet, it’s very large. [plays] It arrives a moment where my hands is too small to do all of what I want to do. If I write this, I will not play, because my hand could not play there. Audience member That’s why I asked you, why doesn’t two people play the same instrument? Francesco Storino Because the coordination is absolutely impossible between hands. You know, there’s a very interesting thing, technically speaking... RBMA Sorry to cut you in there. Francesco Storino Is it too late? RBMA No, no, you can continue it after we finish, but we need to wrap it up, because we’ve got quite a tight schedule this evening. Once again, thank you very much indeed. Francesco Storino OK, thanks to you.

Luther Campbell
Luther Campbell, you might say, is both the Kool Herc and Russell Simmons of Southern hip hop. As a promoter, club owner, label head, pirate radio station proprietor, clothing manufacturer and the foul-mouthed hypeman for rap’s most X-rated group, 2 Live Crew, Campbell pretty much did it all, single-handedly building hip hop’s first artist-owned music empire. But, Campbell says, “everything I know about the music business started from me being a DJ.”
In this talk with Vivian Host held in Miami as part of Red Bull Music Academy’s United States of Bass event series, the man known as Uncle Luke chats about all of the above and more.
Hosted by Vivian Host This man probably needs no introduction to all of you but this is Luther Campbell, AKA Uncle Luke, AKA Coach Luke: the ringleader of 2 Live Crew, the man behind Luke Records, the owner of Pac Jam, entrepreneur, football coach and enthusiast, Miami-based rap pioneer and one of the biggest champions that the city of Miami has. Welcome. Uncle Luke Thank you, thank you. Sorry I’m a little late. My schedule has been hectic this week. I just lost my father a couple of days ago so I’m not even looking at calendars, people are just telling me where to go. I’m sorry. Vivian Host I’m so sorry to hear that. Thank you for joining us anyway. Uncle Luke You’re welcome. Vivian Host I think that definitely speaks to one thing that we’re going to be talking about today, which is your impressive work ethic and how you keep going no matter what’s going on in your personal life. But I want to start at the beginning. I just finished your book last night – this is your new book, Luther Campbell: The Book of Luke, which will be available after the show if any of you are interested. It’s terrific and in it you talk so much about Liberty City, which is a neighborhood of Miami where you’re from. Can you tell me and the rest of the world what it was like to grow up in Liberty City? Uncle Luke Liberty City was a great place to grow up but it became tough times, we saw things change. At one point it was just straight black and white and then there became more Latinos in Liberty City, as well as Miami. So we were just seeing the city just evolve from one thing to the next thing to people moving… Whether they were moving from Miami to Carol City, from Carol City to Davie to Broward, and this whole area right here developing into something this great when it used to be all warehouses and things. Growing up, it was a beautiful thing. I was talking to a friend of mine the other day, talking about how as kids we would be in the parks. We would be DJing at Manor Park – which is called Charles Hadley right now – and going from there to Allapattah Junior High, just DJing and playing the Egyptian Lovers of the world, Herbie Hancock and different tunes like that and then going to the park playing on a Sunday and going to the skating ring on a Saturday and playing and a lot of those different things we were able to do, as well as break artists. Once I started making some money I said I need to put a teen disco here and we eventually put up the Pac Jam. A lot of people they call it the “Hey, hey.” You know, the Pac Jam junkies. Vivian Host We’re going to get to that in a minute in a big, big way. But first… Your parents are from Jamaica and the Bahamas, respectively. I remember you said that your mom would kick you out of the house at 9:30 in the morning and insist that you couldn’t come home until 4:30. Uncle Luke Oh yeah. If you know anything about island parents, you know they’re all about working. Like you said, my mom was Bahamian, dad was Jamaican. Our household was what you call a cross household – that means everybody is talking about politics and at the same time you had to work, work, work. The work ethic was serious. I was the baby of four brothers. All of my other brothers… We got Navy pilots to guys who are like the who’s who... I call them all astronaut brothers. Everybody went to college but me. I used to sit there and listen to all the horror stories about college so I was like, “I don’t want to go there. I’m going to go get me a job.” Vivian Host I was wondering if when you couldn’t come home until 4:30 if you were actually working or if you were doing other things. Uncle Luke That was after I finished high school. Because I decided I didn’t want to go to college, it was like, “If you’re going to be here then you’re going to have to leave at 8 o’clock in the morning and then you can come back here at 4:30. But you’re going to leave. You ain’t going to be sitting up in this house!” Vivian Host I feel like if that happened to me I would just be messing around and playing videogames and hanging out at Taco Bell or something. Uncle Luke No, you had to go get the paper and actually go look for a job and then after a couple of weeks you had to bring some money home to pay some bills. Other than that, you got kicked out. Vivian Host What was the worst job you ever had? Uncle Luke When I was a kid, in the summer, we used to go to Miami Beach because I played football and they would give us jobs. I actually used to ride the back of a dump truck and go pick up trash on the side of the road in Miami Beach as a kid. That was probably the worst job being on the back of that dump truck. I’m at this young age – not 18, not a grown man – getting the trash off the side of the road. But now I can go through different alleys that people don’t know about to avoid the traffic when I’m over there. Vivian Host Way to look on the bright side. But originally you wanted to be a football player, right? Uncle Luke Yes, yes, yes. My whole thing in ending up going to high school on the beach was… I was going to Orchard Villa Elementary in Liberty City. They used to have this test they called the presidential test for scholastics and all that. We used to take the test and the guys from Miami Beach would come and look at who could run fastest, who could jump the highest and then they would recruit us to go play football over at Flamingo Park. That’s how I ended up over there. They wanted me so bad that they would pull a bus in my backyard to make sure I got on that bus to end up going over there and playing football. I ended up playing football until I got to the 11th grade. A coach, a guy who had played in the NFL and blew his knee out, came back to say, “None of you guys are going to make it to the NFL,” and then he said, “There’s only 1,100 people that’s in the NFL and 10,000 people coming out every year so the chances of you making it is slim to none,” and the light went on and I stopped playing football right then and started focusing on my education. Vivian Host Do you ever regret that? Uncle Luke No, I’m happy he did say that but the part that he left off – and the reason why I’m so involved with youth sports right now – was because he didn’t say that I could get an education by it; like I can still play football and this football will pay for me in college and I won’t have to be like my brothers that are calling every day for money. “Mom, send money.” If he’d have told me that, then I would have stayed playing football and I’d have ended up hopefully getting a college degree and be able to do probably more bigger and better things. That’s why I’m so involved in youth sports right now today. I tell these kids that are in the city that come from disadvantaged households…. They have a 2.0 and I encourage them to get 2.5 and study for the ACT and SAT test. That’s why I’m so involved in the school system and getting rid of FCATs and things like that because it don’t prepare them to take that test to qualify to get into school. Vivian Host But I’m sure you’re not telling them, “You’re never going to make it in the NFL.” Uncle Luke No. I’m telling them to take this opportunity because Miami is a hotbed for football. They’ll take the third string guy. At a D3 school you’ll be able to get an education and come back and be a productive citizen. Vivian Host So you’re off like, ‘OK. I’m going to get an education. Nevermind football.’ Then you get really into DJing. How did the DJ bug grab you? Uncle Luke The DJ bug grabbed me because – Vivian Host And when did it? Were you already out of high school? Uncle Luke Yeah. I was still in high school. I used to sit and listen to the radio a lot just like every other kid. But I had some Jamaican friends that lived across the street, some straight Rastas. They were real gangsters. I didn’t know they were gangsters until they were on TV and everybody was looking for them. [laughter] The Shower Possee and all of this. I was like, “Those are my friends over there.” They would give me an ounce of marijuana to make tapes for them. Back then it was 8-track tapes, so I became the guy to convert the records to 8-track tapes for them, and then I would get the weed and roll up dollar joints and sellt them in school. That’s when I knew I was an entrepreneur. [laughter] I was like, ‘OK. I’m all about making money.’ So I eventually fell into that. I loved spinning the music and then I started mixing the music. Then I started having dances in the front yard by playing these different reggae tunes. Vivian Host So you were making mixtapes for the Rastas. What kind of things were on these mixtapes? Uncle Luke You name it. From Bob Marley to [Lovindeer’s] “Don’t Bend Down.” You name it. It was all kind of reggae. Vivian Host Was this also around the time that you had a Pac-Man machine that you were charging kids to use? Uncle Luke You did read the book. [laughs] Vivan Host I read it. Uncle Luke I started off doing the DJing thing, making money with mixtapes and things like that. Once I started making that money, I eventually bought me a Pac-Man machine. I said, “Well, there’s no game rooms around here. I’m going to put the Pac-Man machine in the wash house.” The kids would come and listen to me DJ. I’d turn the speakers into the front yard. After the music started playing, I’d encourage them to go in the back and play the Pac-Man machine. [laughter] Vivian Host Were you MCing at this point anywhere? I guess you were gaining the skills to sell things to people because you were like, “Hey, go play the Pac Man and, by the way, there’s a mixtape,” and, “Okay, have a dollar joint.” Uncle Luke Well, the joint business stopped then because I got caught. Dad, he’s a Rasta so he’d be like “Hold on, you can’t have this in here!” But eventually everything all led up to knowing that, okay, I wanted to be in some kind of business, I wanted to be some kind of entrepreneur and then I had this love of music. And then, because of my household, like I talk about in the book, my dad was playing Burt Bacharach and all kind of different music throughout the house. And on Friday nights around this time, my mom and her girlfriends would get together and play all the cuss versions of Millie Jackson and the night ended off with Redd Foxx and Leroy & Skillet. That’s where I pretty much got a lot of my influence, from all these different types of music. (music: Skillet and Leroy – “Working Girl”) Vivian Host I read somewhere that your mom thought you might be a minister when you grew up. Uncle Luke Yeah, right. Vivian Host You said that in your first book. What’s that about? Uncle Luke Yeah, I was like, “Why did you name me Luther. Did you name me after Martin Luther King?” It was like, “No, your dad’s brother’s name is Luther. But you could always still be a minster,” I’m like, “Well, I don’t know about that one.” Vivian Host How good did you get at getting yourself out of trouble once you got in it? Were you good at talking yourself out of getting in trouble? Uncle Luke Yeah! I learned along the way. I would go to class and tell the teacher, “Oh, your hair looks nice today,” and I would bring goodies and stuff. “Would you care for any doughnuts? Hiiii!” Because I know you just go to class and you automatically get a C by being nice. I would go in and I would tell nice things to the teacher and sit in the front then all the tough guys in the back would be like “Hey, shut up.” And [the teacher would be like] “Oh, I like you.” So I kind of learned how to do reverse psychology. Vivian Host So you got out of trouble and you learned your way with women around the same time? Uncle Luke Yeah, when I was a kid I had long hair. When I kind of got introduced to women it was because I had this long hair, all the girls wanted to braid my hair. I ended up between their legs some kind of way... Back in the days you’d get your hair braided and you would sit like this in between the girls legs while they braided your hair. So I found that to be a very comfortable place that I liked to be. But one thing I did learn was... I learned that girls are either gonna like you or they’re not going to like you. So there’s no reason to lie to girls. I pride myself on never, never telling a girl a lie, even my wife. You don’t have to lie – if they like you, they like you. My friends would be sitting there lying, “Oh, I love you. This is my girlfriend, you’re the only one,” I’ll be like, “No, we’re friends and I like a lot of girls.” It was all about being honest. Vivian Host We’re like ten minutes in and you’re already dropping so many knowledge darts. Uncle Luke It’s better to be honest. Just say you’re friends and get your hair braided. Vivian Host You talk in your book about going to high school on Miami Beach. I was wondering if being a teenager in Miami was already pretty wild? Uncle Luke Yeah, it was kind of wild. Like I said, you had a lot of things going on. When I was 18, everybody sold weed, everybody sold cocaine on every corner. Money was flying everywhere; everybody had money. Guys in the hood had Ferraris and Testarossas in the projects. It was crazy. During those times, you could either get into something bad or you could be a seller, a drug dealer, or you could be dead. You had to make up your mind as to what you wanted to do in life during those times because it was easy to get in trouble. My mom would just always tell us, “It’s easy to get in trouble and hard to get out.” Here are these five boys in a two-bedroom home; she would preach that on a consistent basis. And then I used to look at some of my friends that was on drugs and things like that and I’d be like, “Look, you all lookin’ like zombies.” I pride myself on never, never taking drugs. I smoked one joint in my life. I tried it and when I did smoke it, that was the day that some guys were coming to beat up me and my friends and they were moving in slow motion. I was like, “Never no more. Let me get out of this one right here.” And that was it. It was wild back then. Vivian Host What about the sex aspect of the high school parties? Were people more prudish back then or was that crazy too? Uncle Luke That was crazy. Vivian Host I think people think that you invented people acting freaky at a party but I was wondering if maybe you were just “reporting the news,” in a way. Uncle Luke I did get into a lot of different things. But my high school days... Really, to be honest with you, it’s sad to say: in my high school days, the prettiest girls did the teachers back then. That was sad. They would sit in the front and get all As and they would date the teachers. They didn’t want nothing to do with no high school guy. Back then, unlike right now, the guys used to pull up in cars, the dope guys, and they would come get the girls from high school and take them to lunch. Now they don’t let kids out to go to lunch. You know, there would be lines of cars picking up the nice, pretty girls. We didn’t really have the opportunity to get the pretty girls because the girls who would finish school didn’t want nothing to do with a high school guy. They wanted a guy older than them. Vivian Host But then you became a DJ. Uncle Luke Yes, I became a DJ and then I used to play on African Square Park and I used to play at the dances and the parties. And then after the dances and the parties we found our way to this raggedy hotel on 79th street with the girls. You know, the groupie girls; afterwards they wanted to be with the DJs and that’s when the party started. Vivian Host So the groupies were happening even in the park jam days. Uncle Luke Yes, you’re a top-of-the-line DJ when you’re in Ghetto Style DJs. You’re in one of the top DJ groups and you had girls that would follow you, and the roadies. We had roadies but we didn’t know they were roadies until now! They were the guys who would pick up the speakers and they had girls. Everybody had girls! I got introduced to girls at a very early age. So when I got deep into the music business it didn’t faze me at all. Vivian Host You had already been doing that for a couple of years. Uncle Luke Yes, been there, did that. Vivian Host So when you were playing in Ghetto Style DJs what were the records that you had to play as Luke Skywalker? Uncle Luke Man, I kind of introduced people… If you could imagine 24 speakers, all bass bins. If you can imagine 2,000 or 3,000 people in the park and then another set of guys with 36 speakers set up across from you and everybody playing music at the same time and you then organize it and say, “Hey look, we’ll play and then you’ll play.” We basically battled based on what we said out of our mouth, the slick comments that we would make on top – that was one part of it and then the other part of it was how deep your bass was. People would sit in the speakers and the fans would be the judges. (music: Herman Kelly – “Dance to the Drummer’s Beat”) I would play Herbie Hancock. I would play [Herman Kelly] “Dance to the Drummer’s Beat,” which was a song that you had to play and then you were playing that instrumental and you would have to have something to say on top of the beat. I would play Run-DMC. I would play T La Rock “It’s Yours,” Original Concept, Mantronix; songs like that before Miami bass would come around. And then we’d be on this mad search for any song that had more bass in it and that’s how I introduced reggae to the people because I was looking for more bass. The first reggae song I played at a party was [Lovindeer] “Don’t Bend Down” and then I slowed the pitch up to make it go slower to get more bass out of it and we won a whole bunch of jams off that, battles, and everybody then started playing reggae music at the time. Vivian Host Back at this time a lot of hip hop was pretty positive – there was a lot of storytelling, talking about what was going on in the ghetto or partying but it wasn’t that dirty quite yet, or not that many sexual lyrics at least. But were you saying like, “Get it, get it, drop it, drop it,” and dropping dirty lyrics even back in these times? (music: Krush 2 – “Ghetto Jump”) Uncle Luke Oh yeah. My first song that I created was a song called “Everybody Ghetto Jump.” That kind of got us into the music business because in the dances I used to create all these different dances. One dance [was when] we played the “Wild Wild West” [theme] and we would say, “Everybody ghetto jump,” and the whole crowd jump, jump, jump, jump. We would have the whole crowd just jumping up and down. These guys right here came to me and they said, “Hey look, can we do a song to that?” I was like, “Yeah, you can do a song to it, no problem. You just got to come do a free show.” Vivian Host Who were the guys? Uncle Luke That was Krush 2. Technically, that was the first rap song in Miami from those guys there and if you look at the label it says “Created by Luke.” At the end of the day I was like, “Okay, now you guys got to do a free show for me.” Back then I was on this [thing like] “I’ll break your song,” because I’m playing at a skating ring with 2,000 people on Sunday, I’m playing at the park Sunday at the daytime with 3,000 people and on Friday night I’m playing at the local high school with another 1,500 people. Your music was getting played to all these different people and I’ll break your song because I stand behind it. Vivian Host Were these same guys saying “ghetto jump” in the club or you were saying “ghetto jump” and you gave them the blessing to put this on a record? Uncle Luke I was saying it and they just took the same rhythm and everything and made the song. And then once they did that and they didn’t do the free show I was like, “Okay, well let me show you how bad I am. I’m going to make another song.” At that time, that’s when I brought the 2 Live Crew down to do a show for me at the teen disco and then I said, “Look, I got this other song called ‘Throw the D’ and ‘Throw the P’ – the girls throw the P and the guys throw the D.” These dudes just screwed me right here; they didn’t do a show for me. I said, “I’ll show you all, I’m going to do another song. I’m going to create another song.” And eventually that’s how I linked up with the 2 Live Crew. Vivian Host What was your relationship like around this time – around 1985, ’86 – to other people in this Miami bass scene that was forming, people like Pretty Tony or Amos Larkins? Were you battling them or were you guys cool? Were they coming to Pac Jam or was it an adversarial relationship? Uncle Luke It really wasn’t too much of a relationship but I originally took 2 Live Crew to Pretty Tony and said, “Hey look, I’m not in the music business I’m into doing concerts.” I wanted my own thing. I wanted to be either a DJ on the radio or I wanted to be like Al Hayman and do concerts. That was my whole thing. I was making money doing concerts. I didn’t want to be in no music business but then all those guys told me no. I took [2 Live Crew] to Pretty Tony, who I thought was a good friend of mine – which, he is a good friend. He had a record company; he was doing all this Trinere stuff, Freestyle, and all those different things. I said, “Hey man, I got a song.” He came from the same background and used to have a DJ group called Party Down DJs and I’m just thinking it was a no-brainer. He was like, “Nah, we ain’t doin’ no rap,” I’m like, “Huh? I thought you was my friend.” Eventually I was like, “Okay, enough of that. I’ll just put the song out myself. I’ll figure out a way to do it,” and that’s how I ended up getting in the music business. Vivian Host Was that an attitude popular in Miami at that time? That people didn’t want to put out rap records? Uncle Luke Yes, it was pretty much the attitude. Everybody was doing dance. This was a dance town. Those guys did that song and that was pretty much probably one of the only rap songs that I know of, and Amos was doing a lot of dance as well. It wasn’t nobody that you could go and take the record to; I mean, even with me being a popular DJ that would automatically break a song which would be a no-brainer for people. Vivian Host When you were promoting concerts you were bringing people like Run-DMC and MC Hammer and a lot of rappers from New York, early rap groups, to town. Do you have any funny stories about bringing artists to Miami? Uncle Luke Oh yeah, it was funny. Back then it was crazy because a lot of guys from New York at the time, they wasn’t travelling nowhere. Miami was something that they only saw on a postcard. I didn’t know it at the time. I’m just bringing these guys down because I’m breaking their records. I remember one time I brought down Divine Sound… Back then they used to have this airline called People’s Express. Anybody know about People’s Express? See, now you gonna tell your age. A lot of young people don’t remember People’s Express. It was this airline that you didn’t buy a ticket, you paid when you got on the plane. You are 30,000 feet in the air and then you whip out your money and the stewardess comes around: “Okay, give me the money.” There was People’s Express; on Eastern, you had to have a ticket. I was like, “I don’t trust whether these guys are going to come here or not. I’m going to book these guys on People’s Express.” Every time they would get on there and they would tell the stewardess, “We don’t have any money.” They were like, “The guy is going to pay for it when we get to Miami.” Every trip, I would walk up – me and the police! – because the police was like, “Yo. You’re all going to jail,” and I would be there to pay the stewardess the money every time, from T La Rock to Jazzy Jay. Another story! I had this little Honda. I would pick the guys up from the airport and my car broke down and we needed to jump the car. I had all these speakers in the back so the battery died and I was like, “Hey, Jazzy Jay, connect the jumper cables over here.” He said “Jumper cable? Motor? Battery?” The guy did not know what a battery was. I was like, “Y’all people in New York are weird.” That was funny. He never knew a battery was in a car. Vivian Host Did you go to New York at that time or were you just staying in Miami? Uncle Luke When I was DJing, I never went to New York. The farthest I got was when I was really, really getting out of hand as a kid, my mom sent me to stay with my Navy pilot brother in Washington DC. I ended up staying there for a year and that just totally changed my life. I saw people doing things. I saw African-Americans doing things; with briefcases, going to work. Because I wasn’t seeing that down in Miami, that set off an alarm in my head that you can do some positive things other than being a DJ or a straight garbage man, a janitor. You could be something. After staying there for a year, winter came, some blizzard, and I was like, “No mom, you don’t have to worry about me getting in trouble. I’ll be back and I’m going to be on the right track.” Vivian Host You became such a Miami champion and you were able to make so much money just in Miami alone, but I was wondering if in the early days the dream was ever to make it big in New York. Uncle Luke No, the dream was making it big in Miami for the South and everything. That’s why I did this book because it’s so important and I just want people to know the story and the history of it. Once I started doing things, I looked at… Most people in my community, in the African-American community, they get educated and then they leave. They go to Atlanta; they go work in Atlanta, Detroit, or somewhere else, New York. I always said if I ever get to send all my lunch money somewhere, if I ever become successful, I’m going to stay here and hopefully inspire other people because it was so easy. I was offered jobs to run major record labels in New York. I started getting into the movies and they wanted me to move to California. They said, “Okay, you need to be serious about the movie business. You can keep your record company here, but then there’s going to be times where you’re going to be on the set for four months.” I had to make that sacrifice. I had to make that decision. I’ll just do some movies and I’m going home. I wanted to be here to hopefully inspire other kids to be involved in music industry in the same way I was. Vivian Host On the note of anticipating people’s needs, let’s talk about the Pac Jam Teen Disco that you started. Uncle Luke Pac Jam grew. It grew with me. Pac Jam started out in a skating ring. We were going to a skating ring that was doing badly on a Sunday night and we’d [rent it out] and call it the Pac Jam. We started making more money and then the whole goal was to get our own teen disco and not go rent other people’s buildings. So we purchased the Pac Jam on 54th Street and 12th Avenue. Vivian Host How much did it cost you? Uncle Luke We were actually paying rent, not purchased. I’m sorry. We were leasing the building. The rent probably was about $500 a month. This was 1986. When you look at the first album cover you see us in the back with my University of Miami underwear on my hand and my UM drawers on and my Hurricanes jacket – that was actually in the back of the original Pac Jam teen disco. It was a teen disco on the weekend and it was the warehouse throughout the week that we would store the records in. Vivian Host So you guys had to take all the records that were stored there during the week and move them into the back to make the club? How long did that take? Uncle Luke It would take quite a bit of time. We would stack them on and off and then when the teen disco was over on the weekend … Again, that’s where we had one of the first underground radio stations because now I’m in the music business; I’m selling records. I ended up going to England and I learned about all these pirate radio stations that was all shows and between pirate radio stations and acid parties I was like, “That’s a great idea.” Vivian Host What was it like the first time you played in England? Uncle Luke That was crazy. That was the craziest gig ever. You’re sitting up there and… I don’t know how many of you have been to an acid party or even know how it works. It’s like, “We’re all going to wait right here at the phone booth and the guy is going to call and say this is where the party is.” We would all have to sit there and wait at the hotel and it’s like, “Ready, set, go.” Everybody that was involved in the party was all lined up in cars at different phone booths and they’ll get a phone call: “Party is over here on Second Avenue at this place right here.” Then everybody would rush to that place and you only had a certain amount of time to actually do the concert before the cops could come because it was illegal. Vivian Host So you didn’t play at a hip hop show in the UK, you played at a rave. Uncle Luke That’s what you all call it now? Just like you all changed twerking on drop it like it’s hot. Vivian Host What was the reaction of that crowd to your music? Uncle Luke They loved it. Performing in England was almost like performing at the Pac Jam – it’s the hardest place in the world. It’s like the Apollo. Those people are really serious about their music over there and if you don’t perform for real you would get ran out of town. That was crazy. I was like, “No more acid parties for me. I don’t want to end up going to jail over there. I don’t know what the prisons look like.” Vivian Host Back to the pirate radio guy that you found… Uncle Luke Steven J. Grey. He is the guy on Channel 7 right now who does the traffic report in the morning. He was the guy that actually built my pirate radio station. You all hear him in the morning, “Hey, this is Steven J. Grey reporting live.” That guy, he knows! (music: Anquette – “Miami”) Vivian Host If you look on the B-side of Anquette’s “Miami” you can see J. Grey’s got a song called “Miami.” I thought it was nice you gave this man a shout-out. Uncle Luke Yes, that was the point. It’s all about giving people credit where credit is due. Vivian Host So, Steven Grey made a pirate radio station on the roof of Pac Jam? Uncle Luke Yes. It was inside during the week. We had to use this building to get our $500 out of it a month. During the week you would have, just like I said, the records on the dancefloor and then you had the booth that was used for the DJ booth on the weekends and throughout the week we would have the pirate radio station in [there] and we would have the transmitter on top of the building. We maximized out of that. We knew having the transmitter there that the FCC ain’t coming in the hood. It was like, “We ain’t going in the hood to go track down some people,” because they knew they weren’t going to be able to come out of there alive. We lasted quite a long time doing that. Vivian Host It strikes me that some of the things that you were able to do in terms of pressing records and distribution and having a pirate radio and having this crazy teen disco were simply because either the law enforcement didn’t want to deal with it or there were budget cuts or the records were cheaper to press in Miami, it’s very do it yourself because nobody was really regulating it. You might not have been able to do all of those things if you were living in New York or somewhere else where it was more systematic. Uncle Luke Like I said growing up as a kid I had no knowledge of the music business itself but there were record companies here. There was TK Productions, there was Bo Crane’s company Pandisc; you had a lot of different companies but you would be able to go to the pressing plants and they understood about distribution. I didn’t know anything about it. I went to this guy to get all my information then Fred Hill, God rest his soul. Fred was the first record guy I ever met in my life and the first gay guy I ever met in my life. Fred would tell you he’s gay. Back then being gay was something different. Everybody loved Fred and Fred was a knowledgeable guy. He would sit there and break it down, him and his partner Jerry, and then you would get more education. When you go to Jerry Parson that’s like going into the Godfather movie. I learnt the business through all these guys about distribution and then being an intern at [the radio station] 99 Jamz I learned how records got played. I would talk to all these record promoters that would come in; they would tell me how these records are getting played around the country. Jerry’s job was his record pool. He told me that, “There are other record pools around the country similar to what I do right here. You just got to tap into the same people.” Vivian Host It seems like Jerry Rushin, who was the program director at 99 Jamz, was an important person in breaking the Miami bass sound. Was that somebody that you were friendly with? Uncle Luke Yes, I was really friendly with him. I would be hanging around the radio station because I was just like a little intern. That’s why I always encourage all my artists – whether it is Pitbull to Trick Daddy or whoever – to be nice to the intern because the intern eventually is going to end up being the program director. It always happens! Call the music director and he will remember you three or four years down the line. Jerry was a good friend of mine. He taught me a lot. He would make phone calls around the country to other radio stations and say, “Look, support this.” But early on they couldn’t play my records until I started making R&B music with groups like H-Town and stuff. Vivian Host Going back to something you said earlier about how Pac Jam was a tough crowd, can you talk a little bit about the acts on stage and how the audience would haze them? Uncle Luke It was brutal. If you didn’t get booed, you did great. If you didn’t like you, they would stand there and look at you like, “Okay.” Ain’t no “Throw your hands in the air, Wave them like you just don’t care.” None of that. [It would be like] “Can you get to the hit song? We want to hear the other stuff. Get to the song that we like because we got other music that we want to listen to.” That crowd was a tough crowd. Biggie Smalls, I remember booking him in there, and he was like, “Yo. I’m not going in there without you. They just did in Lil Cease and them about two weeks ago you had them in there. They abused the Geto Boys; they were like, “Boo, get out of here.” Jesus Christ. That was the place where I would go – we had the studio right next to Pac Jam – and take a record, put it in there, and see if it worked. And then it’s the same place I discovered Trick Daddy. I had this rapping battle in the Pac Jam and I was like, “Whoever is the best rapper I’m going to sign him up to a record deal.” We had a three-week battle. [Trick Daddy] eventually beat the guy out and they loved him and I was like, “Shit, they love you. You’re going to be good,” and I eventually put him in one of my songs. I put him on a song I was doing at the time, but I was filing for Chapter 11 [bankruptcy] so I couldn’t really sign him up. But it became a hit song and he became a great artist. Vivian Host We should explain that the club Pac Jam was running for ten years. There was a teen disco that started in ’86 and then eventually I guess in 1990 it moved to a different place and became more of an adult club and people like Trina and JT Money and Trick Daddy and all of them would go. Uncle Luke We moved it to a bigger building on 84 Northeast 2nd Avenue. As the business grew, the Pac Jam grew with us. It was all about having the offices in the same thing. We started a little place and then we grew into a bigger place and we would have bigger parties. Until right now today all those people who grew up in the Pac Jam have these big Pac Jam reunion parties once a month. One of the DJs, Chico, he was a part of the group and he would do these parties once a month and they would do them at the Doubletree Hotel and thousands and thousands of people would show up. He would do anywhere from around 3,000 people on a given month, just all those people who grew up in that era. It would be there and it would be just like it was in Pac Jam. Vivian Host In the early days of Luke Records and 2 Live Crew, it seems like the club was a place to test records for you in a way. Uncle Luke No doubt about it, we would test music there. I would test artists if you can perform. I’m big on hazing my artists. Ask Pitbull, he’ll give you some stories about me, some wild ones. Vivian Host You can give me some stories! Uncle Luke Growing up in that element we would test the songs, we would actually go make them and put them in there. If people didn’t dance to them after you get to the second verse, [then they go] in the garbage. For instance, before I put the lyrics on the song, the song was [tested] in the teen disco for at least six to eight months, maybe longer, before I actually put my vocals on top of the song. It was just the straight beat because, just like “Dance to the Drummer’s Beat,” people wanted the beat. They were more interested in the beat and that taught me the music business it was about the beat first and then it’s the hook and then it’s the lyrics. If you got a good beat then people will like it. If you got a good hook then people will dance and sing the hook and then the lyrics will make it a long-standing hit record. That was my whole philosophy in doing music. If the beat wasn’t right, if Mr. Mixx didn’t make a hot track, I would be like, “I’m not going to sit up and fight this track. I’m going to test the beat first and then I put the lyrics on there. If people dance to the beat then we’re good. Vivian Host I have to ask, when was the first time that “Doo doo brown” was said? Where did you get that lyric from? (music: Freedom – “Get Up and Dance”) Uncle Luke Probably when I was DJing the Freedom song “Get Up and Dance.” That was one of the big songs in the parties. Like I said we played the instrumentals and I would just go off or whatever. I would lock onto one girl dancing and things would come out of my mouth and I ended up doing my music the same way when we were creating this whole party. I never wrote no records down. I was like, “Bring the girls in, bring the party, bring the Bacardi.” To this day, I still drink Bacardi. Bring the Bacardi and nice girls to the party and before you know it turn the track on and give me the microphone and the girls start dancing. They would actually write the songs for me. I didn’t give them credit. I don’t know why. I should have just gave all the girls credit. Vivian Host 2 Live Crew songs are like The Simpsons I think, where they operate on different levels. If you’re an adult you understand some of the jokes on an adult level, but if you’re a kid you still think it’s funny. Uncle Luke It’s like when I say, “Free willy, free willy.” Free willy means two different things. Vivian Host That was a fabulous movie! What are you talking about? Uncle Luke I know, right? You got to get creative when you get in trouble for everything you say. Vivian Host Let’s go back a second to you linking up with the 2 Live Crew. They are originally from Riverside, California, which is a somewhat boring place. Uncle Luke Yes, it is. Vivian Host You found them and brought them out to Miami and showed them something different than Riverside, I’m sure. Right before they were with you they were making songs like “Revelation,” which was a serious song about the state of the world. Uncle Luke And then I corrupted them. Vivian Host I was wondering what was the conversation went like with the 2 Live Crew guys. Like, “Hey guys, this ‘Revelation’ song is cool but I have this other song idea called ‘We Want Some Pussy.’” Uncle Luke No, actually the first song was “Throw the Dick.” I was mad because, like I said, it was when the guys did the “Ghetto Jump” that was the conversation because in the group it was this guy Yuri Vielot and then it was Fresh Kid Ice and then it was Mr. Mixx. Mr. Mixx was the producer, always producing. They had two different things they were already doing. You had Yuri, who was like the first Common. 2 Live Crew was more conscious than anybody would ever think with that song they had on there, “Revelation.” On the other side, Chris [Fresh Kid Ice] had the little “Beat Box” going and that was more of a dance song and that was the one that we really played at the Pac Jam because that fit what we were doing at that particular time. Just like I said when I brought them down it came at the right time and I said, “Hey look, do this song here: ‘Throw the Dick,” and Yuri was like, “No, I’m not into that. I’m into astrology and the world and it’s all peaceful. I’m not doing that.” Chris was like, “Okay, well, I’ll do it.” And then eventually I gave him the idea, the concept, said “Here’s the dance, look at it,” and then that’s how he came up with the lyrics for the actual song and Mixx came up with the music. We was like, “Hey man, we got some famous comedians around here.” He was into comedy like I was – Dolomite, Leroy & Skillet, all that stuff Bo Crane was putting out. He’s was the one who corrupted me; that guy over there, the white guy. He was the one putting out Blowfly and all that. Mixx was deep into that. I was like, “Yo, we got to make it different. We don’t want to make it the same way like every other hip hop. We got to be different. We got be Miami.” He would add uptempo to it and at the same time he put the comedy in there. Vivian Host So you would sample those records. Uncle Luke Yes, he sampled those records. Mixx was really, really creative. All I would do is give him an idea. I was like, “We’re going to make the song ‘Throw the D’ Okay, cool, let’s go,” and then they would tell me the lyrics and I would be like, “Okay, that’s the dance,” describing the dance, and he would have the beat and when I heard that Aunt Esther [from Sanford & Son] screaming in there. I was like, “Boy, we gonna get in trouble?” And he said, “No, don’t worry about it.” That’s Aunt Esther. It became a hit song. Mixx told me no, we were not going to get into trouble for sampling. I didn’t know anything about sampling. (music: 2 Live Crew – “We Want Some Pussy”) Vivian Host Let’s hear a little bit of “We Want Some Pussy.” I can remember that in grade school the two tapes that you had to hide from your parents were Guns N Roses and 2 Live Crew. Guns N Roses you couldn’t let your parents see the lyric sheet because that was very vulgar and crazy but with 2 Live Crew and the naked girls on the cover you couldn’t even let them see the front of the tape. Uncle Luke That was a marketing idea that I came up with. I used to actually release my songs, the albums, at the same time there would be a big release. If Michael Jackson was getting ready to release an album, everybody would be lined up in the store; so the week before that I would release an album and I would have a girl in a thong, or a bunch of girls in thongs. While you go in and look for this Michael Jackson song and you browsing and you’re like, “Oh shit, this girl is wearing a thong,” and then get the record and turn it over to the back and [the track titles are] “Throw the Dick?” “S&M”? “We Want Some Pussy?” What the hell?! It was a little marketing thing but it was where we were from. I felt like it would have been real corny if I’d have been acting like… I looked at Ice-T, I love him to death, but Ice-T is from California and he always acted like he was from New York, talkin’, hanging out with Bambaataa and all these guys. I was like, “I don’t ever want to be like Ice T.” We’re from Miami, everybody in Miami goes to the beach, the women wear thongs and the women wear bikinis and we party with jet skis and all these different things. We don’t have no stickers on the wall, we don’t do no breakdancing. We booty shake. This is Little Havana, we got uptempo music. Everything about what I wanted to do was about being true to Miami and not trying to be like somebody else. Vivian Host Did you ever go on tour with any heavy metal guys or rock guys? Their tour bus probably looked a lot like your tour bus. Uncle Luke Yeah, Motley Crüe, those guys were good friends of mine. Weird as it may be, Sinead O’Connor was one of my good friends. Yeah, the little baldhead lady. She’s a real rebel; boy, I’m telling you. Me and her would have some real deep conversations. Vivian Host How did you guys get to be friends? Uncle Luke At the MTV Music Awards, I met her and she knew everything that I was doing, what I was doing, how I was doing it, why I was doing it. We’d have these deep conversations about politics – she was deep into politics and me and her became cool. From that point on, we was like real good buddies; we would talk all the time. Vivian Host Was this after Banned in the USA and all the lawsuits? Uncle Luke Yes. Vivian Host You put out this first album and then subsequent albums things start to get crazier and crazier. Just like how you started off with regular dancers that you would audition and then eventually the dancers just became crazy girls from strip clubs. Uncle Luke Yes, it started off with boy dancers, girl dancers, regular Miami Heat-type dancers and then as people kept saying that we were this and we were that, I just realized that I can’t beat the big machine if the big machine is against us. If we’re going to be the guys who wear the black hat, then we’ll wear the black hat and then we’ll wear it good. If we’re going to be the bad guy, we’ll be the bad guy. We just started really pushing the envelope a little harder then. We got rid of the kiddie-type dancers in the end and eventually started using full-figured women and those being dancers. Back then there wasn’t no strip clubs. When I would do the videos I would actually shoot the videos a certain kind of way. We started using these really, really attractive women, full-figured women and that’s where the big butts came from and the dropping it like it’s hot and all that. Then they start opening up clubs like the Rolex and those girls who did my videos ended up in the clubs and now those same girls we would use on tour. Vivian Host What do you mean there were no strip clubs? Uncle Luke There wasn’t no black strip clubs. The first time I got introduced [to strip clubs] was when I was DJing at the Pac Jam, the guys who were my security – these guys named Rocco and Damian – their mother owned a strip club on Biscayne Boulevard right across from Houston’s Restaurant. There was little one and their mother owned it. You know, these big, big white guys would do the security for the club at night. Tootsie’s was right on the corner of 199th and 441 – the original Tootsie’s, not the one that you see now – and they were like, “Yo. We’re going to take you to the strip club,” and so now, as I’m getting into the music thing, I was like, “No, black people don’t go to strip clubs. Those are for guys with motorcycles and helmets like you see in the movies. They’ll beat you up.” They eventually took me there and that just totally blew my mind and it just all came together at the same time. Then this guy Carl changed the club Climax into club Rolex and before you know it strip clubs in the black community became big off the music. Vivian Host What year was this that you went to your first strip club? Uncle Luke My first strip club? It had to be around ’82 or something like that, maybe ’79. It was amazing. It was a real eye-opener. Vivian Host I bet it was. Uncle Luke Yes. They said, “You’ll go in. You’ll come out a gynecologist.” I had to go look up what a gynecologist was. Vivian Host Then you realized not only were you a magician and a musician, you were also a gynecologist. You were somewhere between 19 and 22. Uncle Luke Yes, a young guy getting his eyes opened up wide to this thing called Miami scene. Vivian Host By 1990, things were so crazy for you. People were starting to attack you for obscenity. I looked at how much you did between 1989 and 1990 and I was wondering, how did you not lose your mind? You were fighting legal battles, you were running a club, you were running a record label, you had other businesses as well. Uncle Luke It was a crazy time but, like I talk about it in my book, the influential people who prepared me to deal with all these different issues that I was going to have to deal with from the political standpoint were my dad and my uncle Ricky. They talked to me. My uncle Ricky wouldn’t allow me to look at cartoons when I went to his house on the weekend. He would teach me about politics, to read the newspaper, look at the news, how to understand the news. He turned me on to H. Rap Brown and Malcolm X and Martin Luther King; he told me the difference between different people and the struggle that he had to go through as a Bahamian man and coming up in Miami and being a painter, one of the first African-American contractors here in Miami, and the things that he had to go through to be successful in his business. I learned all those things along the way so when I got attacked it was like a full circle. I had already been told about some of these things that had happened to other people before me so I was basically really, really prepared. It was stressful. I wouldn’t say it wasn’t stressful because there were play times that I would be by myself and say, “Why am I going through this? Why am I fighting for hip hop? Hip hop don’t care nothing about me.” It wasn’t a case of going to jail. When we lost the original obscenity trial – when a federal judge said this song is deemed to be obscene – I wasn’t going to jail. I put myself in a predicament where I ended up going to jail by going to sing a song that the federal judge had just said was obscene because I believed in free speech and then I believed that it would be other guys before me. If Ali is on the record, it would be case law and most people understand case law; if it’s still on the books, then they could take off a Lil Wayne record, a Drake record, NWA record – they could take any record off the shelf because the precedent would have already been set. I could see lawyers and state attorneys and people using this to take whatever hip hop song they wanted to take off the shelf. I went back and got that overturned in appeal and I thought that was very, very important, more important than the case that we won in the Supreme Court. Vivian Host Probably everybody in this room knows, but if somebody outside is not familiar, you were in a legal battle with the Mayor of Miami and the Sherriff of Broward County who were calling your music obscene and pulling it from stores. Your music was ruled obscene. Another person might have just stayed home and fought that legal battle and instead you went on the road playing your shows and saying, “Fuck the police” and “I’m going to do this really dirty show” all around the country in various cities. Was there a moment while this was going on before you went on the road where you were like, “Maybe I should just chill”? Uncle Luke No, not during that time. I went from businessman and then I ended up becoming this rebel. I just was like, “Okay, you can take me to jail.” I remember going to Cincinnati and the police chief came to the airport… No, he came the store where we were doing an in-store and said, “If you sing these songs in Cincinnati, I’ll take you to jail.” I was like “You need to get your jailhouse ready because I’m going.” I would go to different cities and the same thing. I would not have a problem with going to jail again and again. We would go back to the studio and we would make a song harder than the song before that and it just became us against the government. Vivian Host We should talk about the Campbell vs. Acuff-Rose case. Probably, people confuse the two things together, but that was actually a separate legal case where you were sued by the music publishers of Roy Orbison because you did a parody version of “Pretty Woman.” (music: 2 Live Crew – “Pretty Woman”) Uncle Luke It was “Pretty Woman.” We did that song and again just poking fun. How we ended up getting sued... Because again, I had already gotten sued by George Lucas, who originally gave me a license to use the name Luke Skyywalker. There were all these different... Tipper Gore and her group – they looked at everything that we did, anything that we did, anything that we sampled, anything that was affiliated with me that they could go and put pressure on somebody to come after us. Roy Orbison and that whole group and family, they just went and said, “Look, you got to sue them. How could you allow them to use this song?” Blah, blah, blah, and all that and they would put pressure on them; they would force them to sue us. The same thing with George Lucas, put pressure, they’ll sue, they’ll call different municipalities, governors. Dan Quayle and everybody had something to say about 2 Live Crew and eventually we went, they sued us and they said it wasn’t a parody and I’m like, “Why are we getting sued? This is a parody.” My lawyer Bruce Rogow at the time explained it. At that period of time you had everybody doing parodies. You had Weird Al Yankovic doing Michael Jackson, you had this guy doing Bobby Jimmy doing different parodies, you had everybody doing parodies, Saturday Night Live, every Saturday Night Live to this day they did parodies. We didn’t understand that. It goes back to what my old man always said: you either fight for something or fall for anything. It was about fighting, I didn’t care how much money I had to spend in fighting the fight. Again, that was another situation that I didn’t have to fight that. That wasn’t a case that I was going to jail. All I had to do was say, “Okay, you’re right, Roy Orbison. I’m going to pay you $10,000 and walk away from it.” I’ll pay you a license fee, I’ll just discontinue the record and I won’t deal with this and I’ll save millions and millions of dollars. But then it wasn’t about that for me. It was about fighting for free speech. Vivian Host You must have been tired. Were you tired or were you energized by all of these? Uncle Luke I was enjoying myself. I was really, really enjoying myself. I was enjoying every day getting up, strategizing, seeing how I could beat them who were trying to beat me. I just knew that they were up to no good and I was doing right. It wasn’t a problem fighting for that cause. Vivian Host Amen. And now Chris Rock won the right to parody you. Uncle Luke Exactly, every time I see him I say, “Yeah, you did me and I gave you a career.” Vivian Host We don’t have that much time left but I did want to ask you while this was going on you decided to strike out on your own without the rest of 2 Live Crew and become Uncle Luke, your next incarnation. Uncle Luke Yeah, that’s when I did the album Banned in the USA. That was my first solo album. The guys still performed on the album. It wasn’t like your traditional breakup, I was still a part of the group. I just wanted to do my own album with my own lyrics, my own party music, because it was so many years of defending what they were saying and defending free speech. What people don’t realize is those guys wrote their own lyrics. I came up with concepts but they were responsible for their own lyrics. I had to defend their lyrics and I was always out front defending their lyrics. I wanted to do my own thing and my stuff, if you listen to it, is more party-oriented. It’s not as wild, it’s just to get party going, and that’s what I wanted to do. “Banned in the USA” was the first song that I did and I talk about it in my book when I had the conversation with quite a few people and getting the song to be able to get done. I did the MTV Music Awards. That was a very, very emotional show because at that time we had won all the cases and beat everybody in all the trials. When I did the show I had glasses on, but I was crying the whole entire show and people were feeling it and guys were coming on stage – MC Hammer and guys who I helped – and they all felt the moment. At that period of time, that’s when really, really traditional hip hop artists embraced us. We fought this long fight, we got to sing this song to a national audience and now these hip hop artists from Chuck D and Flavor Flav to Hammer and all these guys, Run-DMC, they’re all coming on stage and giving us hugs as the performance went on. That was an emotional album and emotional time. Vivian Host I think it’s interesting that you still take on the hip hop artists of today in our Miami New Times column and on your Twitter. You’re still fighting. You do all these amazing things for the community, you coach football, you started a football league in Liberty City for the youths and stuff like that and you could be a sports commentator. Have you ever thought about that? Uncle Luke Yes, I do sports every Tuesday on 940 Radio because I’m so heavily involved in sports. We started our [youth football] program, Liberty City Optimists, 25 years ago – we’re celebrating our 25th year anniversary right now and we have over a hundred volunteers and nobody gets paid for anything. We have over 400 kids throughout the year on a year-round basis. We got great kids that came through the program that are doing productive things like the commissioner for this area, Keon Hardemon; he was a kid that played in program, baseball and football. Then we got kids like Duke Johnson, Devonte Freeman, the kid that leads NFL right now in rushing and touchdowns. Chad Johnson played in the program, Devonte Davis. We got about ten kids in the NFL right now but the ones we’re really proud of are the ones who are productive citizens, the ones who come back to the program and volunteer their time to help out the kids and that’s what my passion is. I love working with kids and I love working in a high school with sports because I could then help those kids understand that through sports you can go and get a good education. Every year on the football teams that I coach with Miami Northern and Miami Northwestern, 95% of our kids end up going to a university, whether it’s Stillman, Spellman. It ain’t got to be University of Miami or Florida State; they’re going to go and leave and go to some college. Those are some of the kids that come out of our program that we inspire to do that. That’s what I’m most proud of. Vivian Host Last question, when you look at your whole career in music and everything else, what do you think was the great motivator for you? Uncle Luke Miami. Just the love for Miami. When you ride around the country and you’re sitting up at this New Music Seminar where people come from all over the world and you’re sitting there and people say, “That Miami music. That’s just straight booty music. It’s a fad. It’s never going to last.” This guy Hank Shocklee, I’ll never forget it to this day, said, “This music is a fad.” He’s sitting on this panel, 800 people in the room and then I stand up in the middle of the crowd and I say, “That’s BS. The south is going to rule hip hop at one point. You just keep living and you’ll live to see it.” To me, Miami was being the forefront of creating hip hop, whether it was Krush Two or whether it was what was Bo Crane was doing, whether it was what Henry Stone was doing or what we were doing – we created hip hop in the South. It just wasn’t a Miami thing. It wasn’t doing it nowhere else. I’m very proud of that. We don’t get the credit for it – you ask did the book, it’s because we don’t get credit for nothing. We don’t get credit for the parental advice sticker. We don’t get credit for doing two different versions of a record. We don’t get credit for the wrapped vans that you see – we were painting the vans back then. We don’t get credit for the Disco Dave and the soundsystems inside the cars. We don’t get credit for nothing in hip hop. So I mean, that’s what the struggle and the fight is about. Vivian Host Well, you’ve always been pulling out the crystal balls from your videos and looking into the future. There are many more great stories about things that Luke pioneered and I guess we’re out of time, but maybe personally he’ll take some of your questions. Thanks so much for joining us. Uncle Luke Thank you. Thanks very much.

Mike Grinser
Mike Grinser has made a name for himself in Berlin’s electronic world and beyond as one of half of mastering studio Manmade Mastering, alongside his partner Tim Xavier. In addition, Grinser also works at another renowned Berlin studio, Dubplates & Mastering. Born and raised in Bavaria, Grinser was a rock fan at first before being turned onto electronic music in clubs via early Chicago records from the likes of Phuture. Intrigued, he sought to understand how this new music was created eventually learning to DJ before moving to production. Sitting in mastering sessions for his own records he acquired a deep interest in the technical side of electronic music, launching him on a new path. Since then his ears have helped put the finishing touch to music on labels like Ostgut Ton, Plus 8, Bpitch Control and many more.
In this conversation as part of the Lisboa Electronica festival, Grinser retraced his steps to the mastering studio and shared details on what exactly goes on behind the doors to get the best sound out.
Hosted by Aaron Gonsher If you’ve listened to electronic music at all over the last decade or so, you’ve probably heard the work of the person who’s sitting next to me on this couch, even if you might never have heard his name before. He is a mastering engineer who works at two renowned mastering studios in Berlin, Dubplates & Mastering and Manmade Mastering with his partner Tim Xavier. Please join me in welcoming Mike Grinser. [applause] Mike Grinser Welcome. Thank you for coming out. Aaron Gonsher We’re going to get into mastering a lot today and for a lot of the people in the audience or for people who are just interested in audio in general it’s sort of a black box. We have a lot of visual aids that we’re going to project up here in a bit and go through the process as granulary as possible. Before we do that, I think it’s important to know how you first got into music in general before you decided to become a mastering engineer, especially. What was your introduction to electronic music? Mike Grinser My introduction to electronic music was about the end of the ’80s. I was pretty much a rock guy before, was into grunge music, Nirvana and bands the like. At some point I first heard electronic music from Chicago, I guess, from bands like Phuture, for example. And I was quite impressed by the sounds and the music and I wanted to know how this very new sounding music to me was done and that was like my starting point in electronic music at the end of the ’80s beginning to the ’90s. Aaron Gonsher And where had you been during that time that you were exposed to Phuture in the first place? Mike Grinser I was still living on the countryside. I grew up in a very small village in the very south of Germany in Bavaria and I was still living on the countryside and yeah, I was going clubbing. And a friend of mine was running a club and I was hanging out there and DJing there and it happened all there, basically. Aaron Gonsher How quickly did you go from hearing Phuture to DJing? Mike Grinser I was Djing before. It was like... Yeah, towards the end of the ’80s. It was more like a... Kind of a crossover sound where you would go from some hip-hop stuff to rock stuff to electronic stuff. It was quite a huge variety, a mixture of different styles of music. Aaron Gonsher Was there a certain point at which you started to get into music on much more of a technical level as opposed to a purely musical one? Mike Grinser Yeah. I was always quite technically interested but when I started to produce music or get interested in how to produce electronic music and when I was releasing my first records or did tests cut on a dubplate to play it out as a DJ I always tried to go to the studios, to go to the mastering studios and sit in for the session and that’s the point where I got interested mainly how music came to wax. Aaron Gonsher At the time that you were producing this music, were you still living in your hometown or had you… Mike Grinser I was still living in my hometown but then left quite shortly after, so like at the beginning of the ’90s I landed in Munich and did some studies there at the university and got access to a quite famous club in the ’90s, which was called Ultraschall. And one of the owners of the club was also doing a record label and more by accident we got to know each other and I had the idea to produce and release music and then we found a home on that record label, which was called Disko B. Aaron Gonsher And for people who might not be familiar, can you talk a little bit about what the sound of Ultraschall was associated with at the time? Mike Grinser The sound of Ultraschall was associated mainly to techno. There were a lot of international DJs booked to the club like DJs from Detroit. A lot of American guys and also people from Austria, so the club had a relationship to the US, to like Underground Resistance and the Detroit people to the Chicago people and also in continental Europe to Vienna, for example. To Patrick Pulsinger and those guys. Aaron Gonsher And you mentioned a lot of names just now and labels. How did you feel about the sound of the records that were coming out at that time? Again, not just from a musical level but from a technical level. Were you already thinking about what are ways that this can be improved? Mike Grinser I guess, yeah. I guess the sound, especially in electronic dance music over time or with the decades from the ’90s to the ’00s and to nowadays, pretty much changed. In the ’90s it was like pretty rough. The studios didn’t have that much processing gear. Maybe also that much of a know how when it comes to vinyl and cutting. Aaron Gonsher Why do you think that was? Was it simply because the knowledge wasn’t available or accessible in the same way? Or were people not interested in the way they are now? Mike Grinser It was accessible but a lot of people working in the mastering industry now... A lot of the knowledge is self-taught and it’s not so easy, especially when it comes to vinyl, to have access to knowledge because you can’t go study these things so you need to find people or mentors to show you things. I think back in the ’90s a lot of people transferring music to discs... A lot of the knowledge they had was self-taught or adapted from some mentors they had. Aaron Gonsher Who were those mentors for you? Mike Grinser For me, those mentors were in the ’90s when I was producing music. The first one was also by accident, Tobias Neumann. It happened that we had a studio with him or he had a studio and gave us his vocal booth as a small production studio. When I got doing my first mixdowns he showed me a couple of tricks and skills and then later on when I started my mastering career, my nowadays partner Tim Xavier showed me how a cutting system works, showed me how to transfer music. And at that time he brought over... Tim is an American guy and at some point he moved his studio from Brooklyn to Berlin and he owned an American cutting system, a Scully Westrex cutting system and I first learned on that system and then later on I met Christoph Grote-Beverborg from Dubplates & Mastering, the owner of Dubplates & Mastering, and he later showed me how to cut on a Neumann VMS-70 system. Aaron Gonsher And I know that looking at those photos that you brought, we’re going to get in a bit later into some of the differences between the Neumann and the Scully that you’re describing. But I think as we’ve been talking about mastering so far, we haven’t answered the very basic question of what is mastering and why should I, or why should someone who is just a regular consumer of music, care about mastering? Mike Grinser Very basic speaking, mastering is the bridge between production and duplication and the bridge between a production, recording, mixing studio and the world out there. Before music gets released it gets mastered. It may get transferred from one medium to another medium and the master media we do at the mastering studio, speed, electro disc for vinyl manufacturing or a data set for, let’s say, CD production gets sent to a pressing plant and the pressing plant replicates the master and duplicates it. The second part of your question, why should someone worry about mastering? Mastering is also the last technical and also the last creative step in music production. In mastering, we make sure that music translates well to different listening environments and different playback media. The better a master will translate or that will also help sales, I guess, if you have a good sounding product in the end. Aaron Gonsher I’m curious, would that answer that you just gave me have been the same as when you’d first started out as a mastering engineer? Or were you approaching it very differently during the years when you first started working with Tim Xavier or when you were first sort of getting your feet wet and sort of acquiring that knowledge? Mike Grinser Yeah. In the beginning when I got into this I just basically started with digital mastering and everything else came later. I think you first have to gain some knowledge. You have to get a feel... what’s possible, what’s not possible? In, like, 70 to 80% in mastering you work with left right stereo sounds, so you don’t have access to individual instruments of recording but you work with stereo sound and when you apply processing to a full mixdown then little things can go a long away. So, if you adjust something in the frequency domain at one part it has an influence to a totally different part. Every engineer has to find its own paths, its own ways and gain its own knowledge on how to approach music and how to apply processing. Aaron Gonsher Can you talk about what some of those lessons were for you, though, when you were first starting out? Because I think mastering, as you’re describing it, is the sort of thing where there’s this balance of the formal education of maybe learning from someone directly and informal of actually sitting behind this lathe or the processing chain for when you’re mastering something and learning on the job. Mike Grinser Yeah. I think, well... I think it’s very important to educate your ear in a technical manner but also in an artistic way. You need to learn a few lessons, I think, to gain some intuition on how you start working on projects because if you get a collection of recordings sometimes it can be that recordings were all made in one studio by one band or one producer and then it lands with you at the mastering studio but it can also be a collection of very different things like a compilation, for example. And you need to get a feel where to start and where to land, in the end. Aaron Gonsher Just now you mentioned this balance between the technical and the artistic. What is artistic about mastering for you? Mike Grinser I think it’s very important if you work on music, you treat music of other people to do it in respect of the musicality of the music and also of the emotion of the music. And you have to get a feel for it. What would the band or the producer mean with the recording? Where does he want to go with it? Is the recording, the mixdown, is it done well or does it lack different aspects? Was the producer able to fulfill his idea with his production, with his arrangement, and with his mixdown? Or does it need some help from an objective ear as a mastering engineer? Because as a mastering engineer, you get the music and you hear it the very first time and this allows you to lend the producer and the musician an objective ear and apply processing accordingly. You have to find a balance between benefit and sacrifice, I would say, because every processing step is not necessarily a benefit. It’s, first of all, a sacrifice because you add processing, you add a little bit of noise. Every processing step has to be done right in order to achieve a good result. Aaron Gonsher How much have what the people who are sending you these records to be mastered... how much of what they want out of the mastering process has changed in the last decade since you first started out? And what are some of the factors contributing to someone asking for something completely different out of a record in 2008 for what’s possibly the exact same genre of music versus the same record in 2018 or something very similar. Mike Grinser Yes. So, I think nowadays when it comes to records, for example, a lot of people expect their record to sound like a CD. Aaron Gonsher What do you mean by that? Record sounding like a CD? Mike Grinser Yeah. With as less artifacts as possible. When it comes to vinyl, the thing is that the quality of the playback from outside to inside changes pretty much because the distance shrinks towards the inside, which makes it more and more difficult for playback system and the cartridge to read the information. Regarding electronic music, for example, how the energy is distributed throughout the frequency range and the range of hearing from like 20 Hertz to 20 KiloHertz change pretty much so records from the ’90s didn’t have much information below like 70, 80, 90 Hz. Nowadays, bass drums are rather around 50 Hz. Aaron Gonsher Is there a reason for that? Like a shift like that, specifically? Mike Grinser I think it has a lot do... Because back in the days when you wanted to record a record, you needed to book a studio probably on a daily basis, which could get easily quite expensive. With all the new technical possibilities, recording with computers, different DAWs, it had a pretty much democratic influence on how music is produced and how music is mixed because nowadays it’s easily accessible for everyone to get a computer, to get a DAW, to get a couple of plug-ins and produce music. And back in the days that was much more difficult and you... A lot of the bands and musicians needed bigger record labels who could afford to book those studios. Aaron Gonsher How has consumer expectation also impacted your work, then? Because I just asked about… Mike Grinser Yeah. Aaron Gonsher … what the producer wanted, but what about… Mike Grinser Yeah, it’s… Aaron Gonsher … someone who’s just listening? Mike Grinser It’s hard to say because some musicians and some producers expect you to just apply a little bit, to enhance the music with transfer and processing, while others expect you to change their sound, to transform the sound with deep processing. And as a mastering engineer, you have to get a feel what is necessary with a project or a recording you have at hand. Aaron Gonsher But for the actual consumer... Say if someone in the last 10 years, their listening has changed from CD to streaming and then to vinyl and then back to streaming, how does the different avenues, particularly when it comes to something that’s relatively new for a lot of people like streaming, affect what artists want of your mastering, to compete in that sort of field? Mike Grinser I don’t know whether artists think that much about it. I think it’s our profession also to train people and what I do nowadays is very often delivering different sets of masters for different platforms. When music gets released nowadays, it’s very often released on different media, let’s say vinyl, CD and digital media. Also, in digital media there is a quite big difference between online distributing music, so files... be it, mp3 or wave, AIFF for people to download, or streaming services. Nowadays it’s quite difficult to spread the information because when people release music they have distributors and distributors have different aggregates to place the music at different stream platforms or download shops. And spreading the information, what master is for what platform can get lost and can get quite difficult. I think it’s up to us engineers to train people and to spread the knowledge about what is best for what medium. Aaron Gonsher In terms of what’s best, are there particular things that you see people constantly misinterpreting? I’m thinking in this case of something like loudness? Mike Grinser Yes. Yes, the problem is that still a lot of people ask for very loud files because they think if someone searches for music online or at the record shop that it’s an argument to buy a file or to buy a record if it sounds louder than other stuff. To a certain degree, that is true and that was always existing. It already existed back in the ’50s when music was played on the radio and suddenly there was a song played on the radio which sounded louder than the other songs. And that’s always an argument for listeners and consumers to buy this. But a few years ago, it reached a quite crazy amount of loudness and people still ask for quite high loudness. But then it’s also up to us to train people and tell them that it’s not always a good idea because excessive loudness implies problems on playback. Club sound systems, for example, amplifiers, speaker cabinets start to distort, start to overdrive. Also, when music is played on the radio. And when music is streamed online, almost all streaming platforms have loudness correction algorithms built in. And… Aaron Gonsher What do you mean by that, exactly? Mike Grinser It’s an algorithm which measures the loudness of all the songs which are accessible and matches it to a certain loudness, which can have an influence to the sound and also the frequency patterns of a recording. If you master very loud, then if the music is streamed then the algorithm will measure that, change the loudness and also the frequency content. Aaron Gonsher So, you’d be sacrificing dynamic range in the mastering step to reach a point that is going to be enforced against you by a streaming service anyway. Mike Grinser Yes. Yes. And the thing is that for streaming platforms, the loudness is minus 14 loudness units. It’s a different measurement compared to peak or RMS. Music distributed online for people to buy files, the loudness is much, much higher. I find it a good idea to either see whether your client is willing to step back on loudness and if not, you may consider to do two different sets of masters. Aaron Gonsher How frequently do you find that clients are actually amenable to these objective recommendations that you’re making? Mike Grinser I would say most of my clients have an open ear for that and… Aaron Gonsher I’m not asking you to name names. Mike Grinser Good. And I think most mastering engineers also have their style, kind of, yeah. It doesn’t mean that I always have to print my Mike Grinser print on masters. I do. But some just like it a little bit louder. Others like it a little bit lower. Some want it a little bit more low end or more high end. Masters can be different and if you do this for some time, producers and artists, musicians pick their mastering studio and their mastering engineer and just by, for example, going online on Discogs you can have a look what engineer mastered and cut what record, what release. This is a quite good resource for people to find out about preferences of the engineers they work with. Or you could also come for an attended session, which I would always recommend because you get an inside what happens in the studio, what happens in mastering. You can also get a feel for who you work with and, like, personal connection is always a good idea when it comes to releasing music and mastering music. Aaron Gonsher Just to go back a little bit, talking about individual mastering engineers having this sort of signature, were there people who when you first started mastering or when you first started getting interested in it that you studied through their records without actually having access to them? Mike Grinser Back in the ’90s when I was releasing my music, I pretty much knew where I wanted to go because I was always a music collector and listening to a lot of different kinds, different styles of music. And I had an idea of where I wanted to go and who I wanted to work with. And maybe you also have to try different things and at one place or with one release you’ll find the perfect match. Aaron Gonsher Although mastering can also be quite expensive, depending on what studio you have. And it’s more difficult for people to actually reach that level of... First of all, getting someone to sign your release, to believe that it’s something that they want to sign and put money into mastering, and then get multiple more that people are willing to give you a shot at different studios, right? Mike Grinser Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, mastering takes up some time and takes up some studio time and if... our studio is built off... the philosophy of our studio is we work on other people’s music and we want to do the best or to want to have the end result to sound as good as possible. This means you need to build up a processing chain. You need to think about acoustics monitoring and just running such a studio costs some money and so we ask our artists and clients to pay for the mastering. Sure, we’re going to get paid. And yeah, but on the other hand we also take parts of that money and just reinvest it in the studio to make things better and improve things. Aaron Gonsher What are some of the biggest mistakes that you see in people who are sending you files for mastering? Mike Grinser You know... Aaron Gonsher What would I send you that would really frustrate you? Mike Grinser It can be different things. First of all, I find it important that you leave a little bit of head room when you record music so, for us as mastering engineers, when we work we can tell you with a DAW, we measure in DBFS, meaning DB Full Scale, digital full scale. I would recommend to leave a little bit of head room which would be around three to like 60 dBFS [decibels relative to full scale], peak head room. You should also work on a sample rate which is at least the sample rate of the final medium. So, in case of a CD that would be 44.1 kHz. You could also work higher. And it’s a good idea if you, for example, use double the sampling rate of the final product. So, in case of a CD, 44.1, you could use 88.2 for example. Or for film, music, music videos it’s 48 k[Hz]. You could use 96. This way you don’t have rounding issues so if you want to go from a sample rate from like 96 K down to 44 K you would have a lot of uneven numbers in the conversion. There is good converters but rounding or rounded numbers will always... Or can have rounding artifacts as a problem. Then if your music is centered to a rhythm, it’s important that that the rhythm instruments are not phase reversed, so all the rhythmical instruments, be it percussion, bass drums, snare drums, are correct regarding their polarity. Aaron Gonsher Why does that become an issue for you? Mike Grinser A signal with right polarity, you will have a positive waveform followed by a negative waveform. A positive waveform, if things are connected in the right way and in the proper way, a positive waveform would cause a speaker cone to move to the outside, and the negative part of the waveform will let the cone move to the inside. And that can have an influence on punch and impact, for example. Then, regarding the frequency range, it’s also a good idea if the individual instruments in a recording are dynamically controlled in a good way, because when several instruments play at the same time, they have an influence to each other, so one instrument can modulate or mask the other instrument. When you control different parts in the frequency domain in the right way dynamically, you will have less masking and modulation artifacts. Sometimes, especially when it comes to vinyl, it’s a good idea if you have your high end as controlled as possible, because in cutting, most problems come from excessive high end or from sibilance, be it high hits, crashes, s phonemes in vocals. The thing is that if you have sibilance or s phonemes in vocals which are too strong, it’s a sawtooth waveform, and sawtooth waveforms are very complex or can get very complex, and it can be a problem on playback, so a cutting system is always superior compared to a playback system. What we call vinyl distortion is not distortion coming from the cutting process but from the playback. Then, another thing to watch out for is controlled low end, so it doesn’t get muddy and the instruments in the low end, like bassline, bass drum, low toms, congas, stuff like that are separated well and the low end is not getting muddy. Yeah. I think that’s... Aaron Gonsher That’s a lot to keep track of. Mike Grinser Yes. Aaron Gonsher Well, let’s say that you do get something that hits all of the right points, that doesn’t have any of the problems that you just described. I think this would be a good opportunity to segue into what you’re actually doing in the processing chain once you’re starting to master this particular track. I know that you brought some examples, so maybe we could bring those up now and talk about the processing chain in your Manmade Mastering studio. So again, let’s assume that nothing has a problem with whatever track is coming in. Mike Grinser It’s not showing up on the screen. All right. And it shows up. [Grinser brings up photographs on overhead screen] Aaron Gonsher There we go. So maybe talk a bit about what people are seeing here. Mike Grinser So what you see here is a part of our processing chain at Manmade Mastering. When we designed the processing chain, we tried to keep it versatile and have a collection of instruments, or of processors, which allow me to have access to different parts in the frequency domain. Basically, it’s a mixture, or it’s a hybrid mixture, of digital pieces of gear, can be plugins, or those white pieces here on the bottom is two digital processors. One is a seven-band digital minimum phase EQ, and the other one is a compressor/limiter de-esser digitally. Aaron Gonsher For that first piece, can you expand on that seven band? You’ll have to repeat so I… Mike Grinser Yeah. Seven-band minimum phase equalizer, which I’m mainly using to clean the spectrum. So as I tried to describe before, when instruments modulate each other or mask each other, or signals get recorded in recording rooms and room resonances, for example, get recorded, then I can use EQ bands to find those modulation artifacts and resonances and dip them with a narrow-band parametric filter. The processing chain, as I said, has a digital part and an analog part, and with a digital router and an analog router the things are connected together and I can quite freely decide about the processing chain. So what piece of gear do I use? Which piece of gear do I leave out of the processing chain? Aaron Gonsher How important is the listening environment in all of this? Mike Grinser The listening environment when it comes to mastering, I find it very important, because as I said before, it’s the first time you listen to a recording, so you didn’t spend time before. It’s very new to you, and mastering doesn’t take so much time compared to recording or mixdown, for example. So we at Manmade, or most studios I know of, plan about half an hour for working on one track. Sometimes, can be only 15 minutes, 20 minutes sometimes. It can also be 45 minutes, but it’s around about half an hour. And to give you the opportunity to take the right decisions, a good listening environment with good acoustics and a good monitoring system will help you to take the right decisions. And when it comes to a tonal balance, it’s very important that the master is balanced. So let’s say you have a listening environment where you lack low end, so some frequencies in the low end may cancel out. Others add up due to room resonances, and it makes it hard for you to take a decision. “Do I need more low end? Do I need less low end?” And if you have too much low end, then your master will always sound quieter compared to a better balanced master. So this would imply problems, and therefore a good listening environment, a well-treated room, and a well-set up speaker system would help you. The master would benefit from it. Aaron Gonsher Can you take us through some more elements of this processing chain? Mike Grinser Yeah. Here in the middle, you see the screen. Here on the right, you see one monitor. Here, this thing is a metering system where I have the opportunity to meter the frequency spectrum and also the left-right relationship with a correlation meter or coulometer. Yeah. So I can monitor the frequency balance and also the stereo image. On the bottom of the picture here on the right, you see a monitor controller. A monitor controller is... I find it important at a mastering studio, because basically what it is, it’s the monitoring part of a mixing desk, so all sources, be it a turntable, be it the feedback information of the cutting system, outputs from the DAW, analog outputs, digital outputs are connected there, and just by switching those knobs, I can compare things. I can A/B compare a record against my digital master, for example. Each source of the monitor controller, I can choose a level offset, because doing proper A/B comparisons is kind of its own art form, and if you compare a master against the pre-master, for example, it’s very important that the loudness is matched exactly. So our ear is pretty sensitive regarding a level, and even for untrained ears, if you have a half a dB of a level difference, you would think the louder one is the better. Even if I would play you two times the same mixdown and one is half a dB louder, you would clearly point to the one which is half a dB louder and say, “This is better,” although there’s no difference at all, only the level difference. Yeah, and monitor controllers, mix and combined with a DAW make it easy for me to do A/B comparison wherever in the processing chain, or I can compare different media. Aaron Gonsher And what else happens here before you actually start to cut this record? Mike Grinser So most of the times nowadays, as we have pretty good bandwidth of the Internet, for example, we call it mastering for approval. So if someone comes in for a session or sends in a project through the Internet, we master the project and would have master files at the end. And if the artist attends the session, I would prefer to send him home with the masters, because when you’re not familiar with a listening environment and it’s the first time maybe you spent at the studio, then you will probably be impressed by the studio, the listening environment, the monitoring system, all the gear which you find there. And I find it a good idea if the artist has the possibility to take the masters home, check them out in his listening environment, on a car stereo, at his own studio. DJs can play it out, and then give me a notice whether it’s all good with the master and the artist enjoys the master. And then in a second step, I would prepare a transfer session where I transfer the master from one medium, which is mostly DAW nowadays, to a lacquer disc, for example, to acetate for vinyl manufacturing. Aaron Gonsher Can you bring up the image of the lathe that you’re using to cut that? You mentioned a little bit earlier that you learned on a Scully lathe. Mike Grinser Yes. Aaron Gonsher But I guess now you have a Neumann? Mike Grinser Yes. Aaron Gonsher It might be good if you can talk about some of the differences between them, or what that learning curve might have been for these different ones, and maybe you can even make this full-screen so that people can... if you’re going to be flipping through. So this is still in Manmade Mastering, and this is what’s actually going to be cutting the digital file to… Mike Grinser Yeah. This is a so-called cutting system, or a cutting lathe, or that’s the cutting desk. Cutting systems have a lot of electronic components, and fine mechanic components. What you see here is the platter. Here, this small thing is the actual heart of the machine, it’s the cutter. I can flip to a different picture where you can see it better. So here you see the platter with a 14-inch master, which is being cut. Here on the left, that black thing, is a microscope, in order for the operator or the engineer to be able to check the grooves under the microscope for different things. For example, I can decide about the cutting depth, so the depth of the grooves. I can check whether the cutting stylus is still of good quality. Aaron Gonsher How long does the stylus last? Mike Grinser The stylus, it depends. So nowadays, very often the problem is that supplies for vinyl, so acetates, lacquers and styluses, the quality varies. But Neumann specs is 20 cutting hours, which is not much. The cutting stylus is either a ruby or a sapphire and the shape can be rounded over time and the stylus can also break. It’s, let’s say, roughly around 30, 40 cutting hours. We also decide about the quality of the stylus, not only visually by looking through the microscope, but also by listening to blank grooves. So we cut blank grooves, grooves without modulation, grooves without music, and listen to them and decide about the noise floor. Lacquers we cut don’t have the artifacts from vinyl, cracking artifacts, pops and ticks, if the stylus is good. The only thing you hear is a little bit of white noise, which is due to a playback stylus traveling inside a groove. That causes white noise. All the other artifacts from vinyl are added with different processing at the pressing plant. Here on the right, you see an instrument to measure pressure. The most delicate part of the cutting system is the cutter head. That’s the piece over here. A cutter head translates an incoming electrical signal to modulational vibration. So let’s say you send a pure sine tone to the cutting system with a thousand cycles, which means a thousand Hz, one kHz. Then the cutting stylus would vibrate a thousand times from left to right for a mono signal. So what a cutter head is, it’s a quite strong electromagnet with coil forms. The coil forms start vibrating according to the electrical incoming signal in a magnetic field. The coil forms are connected to the cutting stylus. The cutting stylus, you see it here. That’s the cutter from the bottom, just flipped over, and here you see the cutting stylus mounted. You also see two wires here. In order for the least amount of noise introduced to record grooves, a cutting stylus is heated and it’s similar as if you would cut with a knife through butter if you use a hot knife, a warm knife, then the flanks of the cut are much more precise compared to a cold knife. Here it’s similar. The pressure meter I showed you before is to... because the cutter head is a closed system and depending on the amount of high frequency of a signal, it can get quite warm and hot inside the cutter, the heat... the system is closed, the heat cannot go somewhere so we use helium to cool down the coil forms and just give them a longer life. Here you see a close-up of the cutter with the cutting stylus down here. When the stylus cuts a groove into the surface, a lacquer is an aluminum plate and the aluminum plate is coated with nitrate cellulose lacquer. The grooves are cut into the lacquer surface. When the cutting stylus cuts the grooves, some material is cut out and in order for the modulation not to be sacrificed with the cutout material, the cutting systems have a vacuum system sucking up the chip. It’s called the chip. It’s basically just a string of lacquer, and the low pressure sucks up the chip and it travels through this small pipe down here. Aaron Gonsher What can go wrong at this stage? When this thing is actually cutting the grooves into the lacquer and the lacquer is going to be sent to the pressing plant, what are the sorts of... what do you want to see in these grooves? You mentioned that there is a microscope, that you’re actually looking down on the cut. What do you want to see in these grooves, and what are signs that they might be irregular or actually cause a problem at the pressing plant? Mike Grinser Yeah. I want to see clean grooves. I have a couple of pictures of grooves... That’s grooves you see here, I just took a picture with my mobile phone through the ocular of the microscope. What you see here is a couple of grooves, modulated grooves. One groove is three here, maybe four white lines, so two white lines on the outside, which is the groove flank, and the blurry line in the middle, which is the bottom of the groove. And the parts between the bottom of the groove and the groove flank needs to be... under the microscope... the microscope has a light, so the grooves are highlighted and you can see through the ocular. I want to see it clean with no white or blurry lines. What we also check through the microscope is... we make sure that no over-cut happens. If the grooves modulate, the cutting system will cut a spiral towards the inside. When grooves modulate, you need to have a part in the cutting system which drives the cutter head so it cuts the spiral without grooves ever touching or colliding, because if grooves touch or collide... if they collide, you can have skipping on playback. If they touch, this can cause problems in processing at the pressing plant and have high a amount of noise. Here you see four grooves. Here, those bigger excursions is low end information and these tiny detailed things inside this groove is mid-high frequency stereo information. If you cut stereo signals into one groove, how does this work, one groove for two signals? A groove has two groove flanks and each groove flank carries one signal. One flank, the left signal and the other flank, the right signal. For stereo information you will have timing differences between left and right, so phase differences between left and right. How the system is built, it’s called the so-called “45-45 system.” This means that the coil form is at an angle of 45 degrees to the surface of the record. When you have timing differences and phase offsets between left and right, you not only have horizontal, or lateral information how we call it, but also vertical information. When we... I show you grooves with a high... very... it’s under the electron microscope. You can see the details of the groove and you see that grooves can get quite complex depending on the frequency and phase content. What the cutting stylus does is some kind of a 3-D movement between left, right and up and down. Aaron Gonsher When I’m listening to a record, when you get this final version of something that’s... when you’re mastering a record, what do you get the most pleasure from out of this process, given that it’s so highly technical? What keeps you interested in mastering something that might seem very esoteric, talking about 3-D groove depth or these variations in grooves that we’re describing or even just the maintenance of the cutter head and things like that? What keeps you excited about it as something that you spend a really significant amount of your time on? Mike Grinser Personally, from the beginning on, when I saw it the first time in the ’90s, I always find it like a piece of art and a miracle that you can cut music to take the plate, put it on a turntable and listen to it without buying a record or something. To me it’s like a piece of art and always, again, like wow, crazy. Aaron Gonsher Did you bring something with you, too, that you actually cut, separate from something that you pressed? Like, you cut a dubplate you wanted to use as an example for listening… Mike Grinser Yeah. I brought a couple of records, pressed records, and I also cut a couple of snippets to a dubplate. A dubplate is a lacquer disc, there’s no difference, just the diameter size is different because for 12" cuts you use 14-inch lacquers. Now I brought 12" dubplates. Aaron Gonsher So what we’re going to demonstrate on this dubplate is what, exactly? Mike Grinser I’d like to demonstrate you playback issues from outside to inside. As I said before, the distance of one groove in one rotation from outside to inside changes. So what changes is... so, one rotation on 33 RPM is always 1.8 seconds, no matter whether my finger is on the outside or here on the inside. But the distance shrinks towards the inside, which makes it much harder for a playback cartridge to track the information, especially high-frequency information, which is the most detailed part of a groove. And I can show it to you. Aaron Gonsher And so this also means that there is really a maximum of what you can cut onto a record and still have the highest fidelity possible. Mike Grinser It depends pretty much because if you have records at home, you might have noticed that records have a different loudness. You may find a record which is quieter than another record, or a record which is much louder compared to the LP record, for example. I can play you those snippets. [plays example on vinyl] Now, I have the same snippet at the inside, which sounds like that. [plays example on vinyl] A different part of the song has a second snippet with more information in the high frequencies. [plays example on vinyl] That is outside, again. And now we can listen to it on the inside. [plays example on vinyl] And I think, even in this listening environment, which is not perfect for A/B listening tests, you can hear quite clear difference of high frequency content from outside to inside. When one wants to release music on records, there is a couple of things you should keep in mind. This is like if you have several tracks on one side of a record, it’s a good idea if you place the tracks with the higher amount of high frequency content towards the outside and the more dull tracks towards the inside. For example, in the high times of vinyl LPs in the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s, it was like that, that the tracks placed so it makes sense regarding the medium, which means that the ballads, the songs with less high-frequency content with more sparse arrangements, were placed on the inside, and the more energetic tracks and the tracks with high amount of high-frequencies were placed to the outside. When it comes to records, it’s also a good idea to keep playing times in mind. As I said before, the loudness of a record is mainly, not only, but mainly related to time per side, so this means the shorter the playing time for one side, the louder a record can be cut. And if we take electronic music, we know we have two different rotation speeds, 45 RPM, 33 RPM. For 45 RPM, the playing time without losing level is like nine minutes, and on 33 RPM it’s a bit longer, because the record spins slower. It’s around 12 minutes, and everything exceeding these playing times needs to be reduced in level. So let’s say you want to make a record played by DJs. It doesn’t make much sense if you put 20 minutes on a side of your record, because the level, the loudness, would be quite low, which makes it hard for a DJ to mix it in his sets, because the other records the DJ would play would most definitely be much louder, and if you have a quiet record, it makes it hard for the DJs to play. If you release an LP album, which is more for like hi-fi listening, home listening, I find it practical if you have a playing time up to 20 minutes, 22 minutes maximum, and more than 25 minutes in my opinion doesn’t really make sense. Aaron Gonsher I know that you brought a couple of other records with you of things that you worked on, maybe we can just listen to one or two of them. I think it’d be interesting to talk about, like I don’t know what records they are that you brought, but if they were particular challenges that are going to be relative to people when they’re thinking about either mastering as something in general, or as it relates to individual elements. Mike Grinser It’s hard for me to speak and change records at the same time. Aaron Gonsher I can hold it. Mike Grinser And what I have here is quite an interesting project I did some time ago. And nowadays and the last few years, there is quite some re-release projects. There are labels and people who do beautiful re-issues. Not all of them for sure, but quite a lot of them, and sometimes there is no master media available of the record, and this is a record from the Love of Life Orchestra from Peter Gordon. Peter Gordon was part of the Arthur Russell band in the ’80s, and he didn’t have masters, master tapes, master files, of that record. So what we did is we found a good, new, old stock copy on the Discogs, a record, then I recorded the tracks to digital, then the label sent the recordings to another studio, which has very good processing gear to work on the spectrum of the recording, and to reduce vinyl artifacts, reduce crackling, reduce pops and ticks. And then the file got sent back to me, and then I mastered the music and cut it to play. Aaron Gonsher Let’s hear how is sounds. Mike Grinser So what I have here is I have record here, and I also have the digital master. Aaron Gonsher So this is the Love of Life Orchestra? Mike Grinser This is the Love of Life Orchestra. The song is called “Condo”, and that’s the record. (music: The Love of Life Orchestra – “Condo”) Aaron Gonsher And now this is the digital master in comparison. Mike Grinser Yeah, that’s the digital source. And that’s the vinyl again. It pretty much depends on the music, so vinyl is a nice medium. Vinyl is, because of physical limitations of cutting and vinyl playback, the sound of vinyl is very close to the way we hear. But for certain music, for example experimental music, music with square wave forms, aggressive music, vinyl might not be the best medium, because it’s physically quite limited, yeah, regarding frequency content, regarding phase relationships of left and right channel, yeah. Aaron Gonsher So it’s good to keep in mind that, even if you don’t have a vinyl release to your name, it doesn’t necessarily mean that that’s the best possible format for your music to come out on. Mike Grinser Yes, yes. Aaron Gonsher Well I think we’re probably still just barely scratching the surface, but... Mike Grinser Still, yeah. Aaron Gonsher I wanna thank you for coming out today, and sharing all of your knowledge about mastering, and I think it was probably very illuminating to the people in the audience as much as it was to me, so thank you Mike. [applause] Mike Grinser Thank you, thank you. I hope I had the chance to show you different task in mastering and a little bit of insight, what happens in this kind of black box of a mastering studio. [applause]. And thank you for coming out. Aaron Gonsher Are there any questions in the audience? I see a few hands already. There should be some microphones coming by if you just keep them up and we’ll hit them one by one, and I’m gonna hit stop on that. Audience Member Hi, I would like to ask you two questions. Do you think that realistically is there a difference between analog and digital mastering nowadays? And also, for people who cannot buy hardware, is there any digital mastering software or plug-ins that you would 100% recommend to achieve a more professional sound? Mike Grinser So to me the difference, or let’s say parts in mastering nowadays are done purely digital. For example, limiting is nowadays a purely digital task. To me the difference is nowadays algorithms and computer processing power is so good, that you can achieve good results with only digital processing. The difference to me is the workflow. If I have analog output piece, or also digital output piece, it helps me more to concentrate on the music I’m working on, and less to the screen, to parameters, numbers, and stuff like that, yeah. And the second part of your question is there is good, very good, software for mastering. There’s limiters, also EQs. Just recently in one picture I showed you there was white digital pieces of gear, which is from a Swiss company called Weiss, and there is the compressor, it’s called Weiss DS1, and there was just recently a plug-in released, and it’s not an emulation. The code got ported to that plug-in, and sonically very transparent and very interesting. Audience Member Cool, thank you so much. Audience Member I wanted to ask, first of all, there’s like every month, every week, there’s new Isotope plug-ins, VSTs, whatever, coming out, trying to take over your job, so to say, and how do you embrace that both as an opportunity for bedroom producers who don’t have the budget for huge mastering, and as a challenge as well? And second part of the question, do you think artificial intelligence might get its way into mastering these next years? Mike Grinser So I think if you’re new to producing, or if you’re producing and you want to play the music out as a DJ, for example, you could use automated processing. There’s different options you could use, so you have an idea what happens. I think music is a quite personal... Yeah, it’s art, it’s very personal, and with emotions, and I think artificial intelligence wouldn’t really help the basic concept of music. Audience Member Thank you. Audience Member Hi, and thank you for the information that you gave us. It was really insightful. I just had a question regarding, it’s not so technical, but because you say you have to train your ear into the technical, then also your own preferences and your own tastes, is there a line where you draw according to your own tastes if, for instance, you receive some productions and you have to master it, and you just don’t feel it, you just don’t like the sound by itself and you don’t get inspired by it, where do you draw the line between your own taste and basically what you have to do technically? Is there a line between those two? Mike Grinser So basically when I go to the studio, I leave my taste at the door, and just work on the project, on the sound of it. Sometimes there might be issues where I would go back to the producer and ask him to improve things, and most of the times, I can’t really tell whether it’s my taste or not. Sometimes it happens that I work on something and I take it home, and I think, “Wow, I somehow like this,” and I listen to it at home and it sounds completely different, because it’s a different way of hearing and it’s a different approach, all the things you do in mastering. And you need a technically trained ear I think, which you can do with some listening training, golden ears, for example. And the other thing is to gain some intuition on how to work with recordings, and I think if you once do the job on the regular basis, it’s not so much about taste. Sure, if I work on a project and I know the person, that’s for me quite important. So if you do the job everyday, it can happen pretty fast that you come up with automatic things instead of listening to the music, and you have to find your own path, how to deal with things you don’t like. But I think over time you progress, and most of the times I don’t have taste when I do mastering. I just try to help, or I try to take what people give me and make things a little better, be it my taste or not. Audience Member Thank you. Just second part of the question then, in electronic music mostly, I mean any kind of music, there is certain trends sometimes that have been evolving through the years, and maybe is still going on now. Do you feel that sometimes it is going to impact your work, which kinds of trends are popular, like minimal techno in Berlin for this kind of stuff, or micro house in France. Does it impact your work when you’re behind your desk? Mike Grinser When I’m mastering, I try not to think in genres. Sure, sometimes the genre of a project you’re working on has an influence to the way you work with it, because the genre implies where the music is played at. Is it played at a club? Is it played more on a home stereo? Is it more intimate, or is it more aggressive? Yeah. Audience Member Thank you. Mike Grinser I hope this answered your question. Aaron Gonsher Were there any other questions? Couple more over here. Audience Member Hello. Do you usually follow a specific process when working? So, for example, start with equalization, then multi-band compression, then limiting, or you do it depending on what the track needs? Mike Grinser Yeah, it pretty much depends on the project, what the track needs. Some recordings need more processing, others need less processing. But I can’t say I first do this, and second this, and last this. The last step is pretty clear, because the last step will somehow be a limiter, or a brickwall limiter, but everything, what happens before depends on the recording, and there’s no rules how mastering works. It depends what recordings need. If the only concept is that technical things will be before the artistic part, so we have the technical aspect of correcting things, narrow-band filtering, for example, de-noising is also a part in mastering, which comes before everything else. Or if a recording has DC offset, then I would correct this first before I continue with the artistic part of it. You can call it audio sweetening and other corrections will be before. Audience Member OK, and what kind of audio sweeteners do you use, or do you like to use? Mike Grinser Mastering, the processing you use, is mainly two things, equalization and compression. That’s the two basic things, and it can be a combination of limiting or expansion, depending then on the project. Audience Member OK, and when an artist sends tracks to you, do you usually give feedback to them before starting the master? So you tell them, “This, this, and this need to be fixed on the mix now.” Is that usual? Mike Grinser Not by concept, usually only if I encounter problems, like more serious problems, which I find important to correct. So let’s say, as an example, there’s an instrument, an important instrument, let’s say a snare drum, for example. And the snare drum is completely out of phase, which would mean that when it’s played back in mono, the snare drum would miss. And as, for example, when you ask about electronic music, a lot of club soundsystems are in mono. Even like Berghain soundsystem, for example, on the weekend as far as I know, is in mono because it has more impact, and then it would be sad for the artist if he misses his snare drum, and then I would go back and tell him, “Hey, that’s out of phase. You may wanna correct this.” Aaron Gonsher It’s not gonna be, “This is 120 BPM. I really like it better at 128.” Mike Grinser No, not like that. Aaron Gonsher I think there was one more over there. Audience Member I would like to know on the weight of vinyl. There’s sometimes 180- gram vinyl, and does this have an effect on the music, that it’s pressed on vinyl, or does it make no difference how thick the vinyl is? Mike Grinser You mean on the sound quality? Audience Member Yeah. Mike Grinser No it doesn’t. It doesn’t. That’s a myth, so 180 gram or 140 gram doesn’t make a difference to the sound. It’s just difference in handling and how a record feels. Audience Member So it’s just marketing? Mike Grinser Yeah. Audience Member Yeah, OK. Mike Grinser What makes a difference is at some pressing plants you can ask for 100% virgin vinyl. So very often pressing plants, the vinyl is a mixture of recycled and virgin vinyl that makes a difference regarding noise, for example. Aaron Gonsher If there’s not anyone else, then... OK, one more. Audience Member Hello, hi. It’s very insightful. I just have a question, because when mastering, usually people they concentrate on the low end and the high end, and usually the mid-range gets a bit forgotten. How do you work on the mid-range? Do you usually go for the low end, high end, mid-range, or do you work mid-range and then apart? Mike Grinser It depends, yeah. In club music nowadays, if you look the frequency content on an analyzer, it looks a little bit like a bathtub, so you have a huge low end and not very much in the mids, and then some high end again. But there are sounds where the information in the mid-frequencies is important, so our ear by evolution is much more sensitive, so we don’t hear linear. Our ear is pretty sensitive to the frequency domain, and the ear is much less sensitive in low and high frequencies. So if you have track with a huge low end and a little bit of high end, and no information in the mids, it will always sound lower compared to tracks which have information in the mids. And if the frequency content or the frequency balance of a track is off by quite far, then I would either talk to the artist, or I would try to apply processing, which is not that obvious as EQing, for example. What you could do, sometimes I mix in a parallel path frequency, selective parallel path. So let’s say the information in the mids is not strong enough, and I want to have it stronger without obvious EQ steps with a quite high amount of gain. Then I prefer, for example, to mix in a parallel path where I try to raise the level in the mids. Audience Member Just one more question. There’s a type of EQ that’s been approached recently, dynamic EQ, and it’s being used a lot right now. Do you think it adds more to the dynamics than the usual processes that you work? Mike Grinser So dynamic EQ is basically very similar to multi-band compression, and if you want to use it, be prepared that these processors are quite complicated. So they have different bands, each band has a gain or second knob for the quality, or for the Q factor, and then dynamic functions for threshold, attack, release, so it can get quite complicated. And when you apply processing then, at least for me, I always try to keep things under control, and not out of control. And when you sit there and you do a master, and you don’t like something about the master, some detail in sound, then it makes it easier or better for the outcome if you know where to go and what to change in order to get rid of the artifact you don’t like. And complicated processing, like multi-band compression or dynamic EQing have a quite steep learning curve, and yeah. Audience Member Thank you. Aaron Gonsher If that’s all, then let’s give Mike another round of applause. Thank you for coming out. [applause]

Manuel Göttsching
Manuel Göttsching is a German music icon, arguably one of the country’s most dynamic and influential talents. In the early ’70s, he co-founded and played lead guitar for pioneering krautrock group Ash Ra Tempel, which in addition to releasing several heralded albums, inspired space rock and psychedelic bands like Philadelphia’s Hash Jar Tempo. During the mid-’70s, Göttsching released several works of minimalist guitar music. Then, in 1984, he made a surprising left turn with the release E2-E4. Recognized as one of the “Best Albums of the ’80s” by Pitchfork, E2-E4 seamlessly wed Göttsching’s work on the guitar with minimal electronic music. Today, it is often credited as an essential forebear for house and techno. In 1989, part of E2-E4 was remixed by Sueño Latino for their eponymous smash single, which was later remixed by in 1992 by Detroit’s Derrick May. Then, in 1994, Carl Craig sampled E2-E4 for “Remake (Uno).” Since then, Göttsching has resurrected Ash Ra Tempel under the name Ashra and continued to compose a variety of new music.
In his 2018 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, Göttsching discussed his feelings about the term “krautrock,” Ash Ra Tempel’s work with Timothy Leary, the making of E2-E4 and much more.
Hosted by Jeff Mao Today, we welcome a German music icon. He is a musician, bandleader, producer, and his work
spans some of the most important and influential areas of modern music making. So won’t you
please welcome Mr. Manuel Göttsching. [applause] Thanks so much for being here today. Manuel Göttsching Thank you. Jeff Mao Thank you. We heard a little bit of music in the background as you guys were entering the room. This was a recording from 1976 by Manuel, entitled “Shuttlecock.” It is an 18-minute version of this composition. This is by no means the longest piece of music that he’s worked on or recorded. You have music that is 18 minutes, 30 minutes, very famous piece which we’ll get to later, which is a little bit longer. I just wanted to ask you firstly, what is it about very expansive pieces that is so appealing for you as an artist and musician? Manuel Göttsching The length of the pieces, you mean? Jeff Mao Yes. Manuel Göttsching That’s very simple because my biggest aim in music is to improvise, so I just start playing and there’s no end. I start as long as I want to and as long as I think it has an expression or feeling or a red line or something. Then some moment, I think, ‘Well, it’s okay or it’s over,’ then I stop it. Yes, I had a lot of pieces recorded or played. The first, Ash Ra Tempel concert here in Berlin, we played sometimes one hour, two hours. There’s a funny picture in this book; maybe some of you know it from Julian Cope’s Krautrocksampler. There’s a picture where you see us, my partner Hartmut Enke on bass, me on guitar with long hairs like this — you don’t see anything. Maybe my nose is out. And Klaus Schulze on drums. There’s the line written under the photo is, “Ash Ra Tempel could play for hours without looking at each other.” We played sometimes, yes, three hours, four hours without talking or without stopping. We had problems then to record, of course, because the length of a vinyl was 20 minutes per side or maybe 30 sometimes. If it’s not too much dynamics, you can do it. I did it with E2-E4. I had to do it. I started also to compose and to construct shorter pieces. I think the shortest one is less than three minutes that I did, and the longest one is one hour. Jeff Mao There’s a point at some point where you realize, the expression, ‘It’s complete.’ How does it start, then? Manuel Göttsching It depends what you do with it. Sometimes I compose pieces, then I know exactly what it is. Then I see... I decided after the possibilities of the composition of the tonality, of the chords, the harmonies — and sometimes I don’t do it. Sometimes I just start playing on and I don’t think much about composition. Improvisation is standard basic thing, and then of course there’s no time limit. Many pieces I did are a mixture of both; There’s a structure for composition, but as a possibility to improvise over this structure, over this some harmony or some cords or some rhythms and then sometimes it’s longer, sometimes not. Jeff Mao I wonder if you could just take us back a little bit to your beginnings. Where did you grow up, and what were your early musical memories? Manuel Göttsching Well, I grew up in former West Berlin, in the western part of the city of Berlin. My first of very early influences were of course, through the radio. In the 1950s, there were the radio station by American Allied forces, Brit Allied Forces, BFBS, AFN, also the French ones. When I was a child, of course I listened to that. I got somehow the radio. My mother was interested in music; she loved operas, so I listened to Italian operas: Verdi, Puccini. I love those Bel Canto style. Of course, I was a bit too young in the ’50s, so I didn’t get so much of rock & roll. Of course, I remember a little bit, the first Elvis and so, but the more influences came in the 1960s. When I also started to be active in music, I started studying classical guitar, so I became interested in classical guitar pieces. Of course there was the pop music; started with American music, like Motown sounds. I listened in the radio, but this was also the Rolling Stones and the British blues bands and British guitar players, so I switched from classic guitar to electric guitar. In the beginning, I didn’t know anything about electric guitar. I really had to learn it as a new playing, because it has not very much to do with classic guitar playing. Yeah, that were the early... Jeff Mao When you started your first band, what was the main influence? Was it blues or was it American rhythm and blues, or what? Manuel Göttsching The first band was at school; this was just for fun. We started to cover some songs that we liked. We were 13, 14 years old, but this was already with my later partner, with my partner over the years with whom I finally founded Ash Ra Tempel, Hartmut Enke. We played some Rolling Stones, we played some Beatles, we played some Who, some what was the popular music and that was just for fun. We played at some school parties. The funny thing is, I was the singer in the band I didn’t play guitar. I convinced my mother to give me a guitar for Christmas, an electric guitar, to buy one. I really couldn’t play anything with it. I wanted to become the drummer because I liked to play drums. My partner Hartmut said, “No, you have to play guitar. You have to.” I said, “No!” The compromise was, I’m the singer. The problem was, I didn’t know any very much English at the time, so I tried to make sounds that sounded a little bit English, like that what I heard on the radio. [laughs] Well, it was fine and nobody cared. Later, sometimes I was really shocked when I read the original lyrics, and what I understood at the time was completely different. [laughs] Jeff Mao When did it transition away from doing something that was so heavily influenced by the UK bands that were blues-inspired, toward something more of an original creation, the things that were coming out of this country, in particular? Manuel Göttsching That was very, very soon after one year. We just were tired of playing cover songs. It was just a little boring. We had a choice, either to make it more professional... we really didn’t want it, and so we really thought about how to play our own music or our own style or just how to create music. One important thing was the 16th birthday of Hartmut. He got a vinyl from Blue Cheer playing the “Summertime Blues,” which was more hard rock than blues in a way, and we were fascinated by this. We thought, ‘Oh, we try this type of style.’ At the same time, another influence, which was an influence in Germany and in German music, it was free jazz. Although we didn’t like jazz, the impact was free, to make free music. This could be free rock, free folk, free whatever. Free classic, maybe. We were fascinated to create sounds and to make free music, freestyle without any structures of music rules, just starting and playing. That was in 1968. We found a third member for it. We made one concert. I remember we had to leave the stage after 10 minutes because the young kids, they wanted to hear some cover bands who play The Beatles and The Rolling Stones and not this. We were a bit too early at 14, 15. We switched a little bit to playing blues themes, but trying to improvise at the same time, trying to combine composition and improvisation a little bit in the style as group Cream were doing it on some legendary albums where they play short blues themes and they start improvising for a half an hour, and then finally back to the theme. Yeah, we liked that. Later, the time was right to switch again to completely free improvisation, and we founded Ash Ra Tempel. We played exactly like the thing before, we called ourselves before, Steeple Chase Bluesband, [but] we didn’t play blues. We used some elements of it but tried to keep the freestyle of improvisation and using some blues themes. For starting to compose or to build up your own ideas with music, blues is a fantastic start because it’s very simple and you can... For a start, it’s a good thing. Then you can develop something else out of it. Jeff Mao Just out of curiosity, what free jazz artists or compositions were you listening to at that time as an influence? Or was it just the idea of free jazz as a concept? Manuel Göttsching It was more the idea because we didn’t like jazz. Jazz was for me, it was old skiffle bands, or people playing some swing at brunches on Sunday morning. [laughs] We didn’t like that, we thought it’s completely outdated. But there was a nice place in Berlin called Jazz Gallery, a small club. We quite often went there and saw people. There were also blues musicians coming there and playing, so we got a little bit influence, but not really from the free music, free jazz scene. I think, I don’t hear records or I don’t remember that, but the idea was fascinating. Jeff Mao It’s more of a conceptual thing. That’s interesting, though, because African American identity is associated with free jazz; this is very revolutionary music. But what you’re creating with Ash Ra Tempel and all the other bands that are emerging at this time was also something that had very specific roots in that era in coming out of what you’ve described as a vacuum. I wonder if you could just elaborate on that a little bit. What were you guys facing culturally? This cultural vacuum that you’ve referred to in the past? Can you describe what that is for everybody here? Manuel Göttsching You have to go back to Berlin maybe in the 1920s. 100 years ago, Berlin was a quite lively city with very interesting cultural scene with music and theater, cabarets and literature, and very experimental. There were some people from the Dada movement, there was Walter Mehring and George Grosz for example, they composed a piece for a knitting machine, and a typewriter that performed it. There was another composer, [Stefan] Wolpe. I found out he worked with 10 gramophone players with different speeds. He played Beethoven symphonies. So, nothing new in the ’90s! [laughs] It’s been there. It was really interesting and very lively thing. All this was cut down, all this was killed and gassed and some people who were lucky could flee or emigrate. After 1945, there was nothing left; there was this what you call vacuum. Berlin was not only... the houses were ruins, but the culture was ruined. It had to be built again. People were very careful because people felt guilt and, ‘I don’t want to be too loud ... ‘ they started with German schlager again. This was, of course, German schlager, maybe German songs, very simple text lyrics about love and about somebody that is in Italy. Jeff Mao It was the popular music of that day. Manuel Göttsching That was the popular music. But there still was jazz, so the jazz scene was very lively in Berlin before the war, and jazz was of course forbidden during the Nazi time. Or they tried to Germanize jazz in a way, which was ridiculous. Of course, people wanted to listen to the real jazz or swing or what was popular. After the war there were also some new younger musicians who tried to keep up with the jazz scene and try. But there was a gap; they couldn’t listen, they couldn’t follow the jazz development for five years or even more. It was a bit outdated. Then there were orchestras, big bands, the radios. Every radio station had his own or several big bands and dance orchestras. This was the music scene, and not very progressive or creative or inventive. Then came the ’50s. The rock & roll, there were three, four singers in Germany, like Peter Kraus, Ted Herold, who played a very shy version of rock & roll, which was also not so attractive. It was German Schlager, and it was only in the ‘60s, it started, beginning of the ’60s, of course with influences from America, from Britain. It started with protests and folk music with Bob Dylan, and then protest and folk music in Germany grew in the first half of the ’60s. And pop music. There came the Rolling Stones. This was also new, this was protest, this was not nice lyrics, this was, “Satisfaction, I can’t get no... ” This was new. Probably inspired the new generation, the young generation in Germany to create something new. There was German protest, folk music... There was a complete new scene developing, and very experimental; there was an audience, people wanted to hear that. So it was concerts and welcome and it was a very creative lively years, I think. Jeff Mao Well, let’s hear a little something from the first Ash Ra Tempel album. This is a track entitled “Amboss.” We’re not gonna play the whole thing, but we’ll play a little piece of it. This is from 1971, Ash Ra Tempel. (music: Ash Ra Tempel – “Amboss” / applause) Jeff Mao That was “Amboss,” from Ash Ra Tempel’s first LP, 1971. Manuel Göttsching That’s a perfect example for what I tried to explain with freestyle, free music. That’s how we improvised for hours. My biggest fear was to record or to make too much record production, so I wanted to keep it as much as possible I would like, this is exactly like we played live our concerts. We only had to reduce it for 20 minutes. We just played and we took some parts. But it’s quite close to that how the live concerts had been at the time. We had problems, technical problems. Not with the music but to record it, because we couldn’t find a proper studio for that. We tried. The company we started with. It was a small label, Ohr music production, we can maybe talk later about this. The owner of the labor was working together with a very popular guy in the schlager [scene] and they had a small office within a big building of the schlager company, Meisel. They had a small studio there, demo studio for schlager singer. We went there and put all our big huge amplifiers and cabinets there and we played 10 minutes and then we had to stop because the whole building was shaking. The secretary said, “Oops, with can’t work anymore.” [laughs] We went to another studio, to a quite professional studio at the time in West Berlin called the Audio Studio. There was an engineer who didn’t understand anything. He just put the faders in some position and then he left the control room and usually we started quite low. Then it became louder and louder and louder, and of course, after 10 minutes it was so loud that everything, the company tapes were only distorted, and the producer said, “I don’t pay that.” Finally, we had to go to Hamburg. We were lucky to meet the legendary engineer, Conny Plank. At the time he was quite young, and he later became a legend in music producing and engineering in Germany. He was the right man, he loved it and he said, “Wow! Yes! We need some fades in here and we need here and yes ...” he added this. He was really playing as a fourth member with us when we recorded it. That was really a fantastic production. Jeff Mao This is music that was created to expand one’s consciousness, or that’s how it’s been described. Was that the intention? Manuel Göttsching Yes, that’s... well, no. I wouldn’t say so. This was the common promotion in that time because music had to have some meaning and you had to explain, why do you make music and what’s the reason and what do you want to express with your music, so you had to find something. It as my partner Hartmut. He was great in that and he explained to everybody that we find new consciousness and whatever. [laughs] I didn’t care, I just wanted to play music! Jeff Mao But I mean, this leads to an interesting point as far as just how people, like you say, are marketing or labeling music. Even in a place like Berlin at the time, it was a fledgling industry? It was an industry that was building back up? You had said that there’s no music industry really when you started here. And yet, there’s still this compulsion, this need to have to be able to market something or make it tangible in a way for people because this is so experimental. Manuel Göttsching Yes. Yes. You’re right. That was ... the industry was schlager music. That was a big industry, but for that type it was nothing compared to Britain or England or America where there was a complete industry for the beat music, for the rap music. There was an agent. There was a manager. There was a label. There was a publisher. And in Germany these bands or groups and musicians at the time, they were completely doing all by themselves. Officially, the management was forbidden in Germany. You had to ask to go to the state department to ask for a job as a musician. It was crazy. Jeff Mao So, you couldn’t actually have a music manager? Manuel Göttsching No. Nope. We had to do it ourselves. So, it was a road manager, manager or graphic design or the photographer was at the same time the manager. You did it all yourself. So, this was very unprofessional, but on the other hand a very creative atmosphere was happening. Because people were so ... There was a lot of crazy things happening. A lot of things were completely stupid, but some really nice things emerged because of this nonprofessional behavior. There were a lot of reviews. Especially, about this first album that people said this is music. Like for example, Iggy Pop would have loved to do at the time, but he couldn’t because the industry would not make it possible to record something like this. That’s probably true. That’s why some strange things happened in Germany. [laughs] But, because of the social and political situation at the end of the ’60s, of course, everybody was highly politically, how to say it, I don’t know the word now. Jeff Mao Motivated or? Manuel Göttsching Motivated, yes. You had to have your opinion. You had to have a statement. That’s also in music. It had to have a meaning and it had to have a social meaning and a social, political meaning. This was very important. There were many political groups like Ton Steine Scherben or Floh de Cologne. There were protest songs. On the other hand, there was the hippie movement and which also came to Germany. The Kommune, Amon Düül for example, emerged at the time. Jeff Mao Were you a part of this commune scene at all? Manuel Göttsching No. I wasn’t. [laughs] Jeff Mao Not trying to live that way? No. Manuel Göttsching No. I was a bit to young. I mean I was 16. I was 17. I was 17 when we found the band Ash Ra Tempel. I was 18 when we recorded the album. The first album. I still went to school. I lived with my parents. Hartmut was the same. So, we still made it, yeah, for fun. We didn’t really think of making a musical career. We loved the music. We had success. Of course, we liked it. So, we continued. But, we didn’t think very much of the next 10 years or so. Jeff Mao OK. So, speaking of like labels and genres and what not, so there’s a term you mentioned before. It begins with a K. Ends with autrock When did you first hear this term that was this genre name that was assigned to bands like yourself, Ash Ra Tempel, Can, Kraftwerk. Did you reject this name, this grouping or did you just think... Manuel Göttsching Which name? [laughter] Jeff Mao I’m not going to say it. Because I know that it’s contentious for some people. So... Manuel Göttsching No. No. No. It’s funny. So, of course. Do you mean krautrock? No it’s a funny name. I think it’s quite appropriate a name. Because, yeah, it has something German and kraut is also something mixed up. So, it’s not really organized. So, it has something and it’s not really rock. So, of course, in the beginning many musicians, especially musicians in Germany who took it very serious, to play serious rock music, they were of course, offended. But, I think if you look at this. Who is now or when you remember the time. When you remember the bigger names, this is not really... this is so diverse this music. There’s Amon Düül, this electronic scene. There’s a jazz scene. The free jazz scene, for example. There’s some like Embryo. They played some early world music. There are folks songs like Witthüser & Westrupp and Hölderlin. All these bands that were... Can was a kind of jazz rock band. So, it’s... Jeff Mao Quite diverse. Manuel Göttsching Quite diverse and so it’s not ... Yeah, I think it’s quite appropriate today to call it like that. And so, I don’t have any problems with it. Jeff Mao You recorded an album with Timothy Leary. How did that come to happen and can we show image number five, please? So, this is you guys in studio. Manuel Göttsching This is not me, no. [laughs] That’s Tim Leary. That’s Sergey Golovin, that’s Walter Wegmüller and that’s Brian Barritt. Jeff Mao OK. So, there is Timothy Leary. How did this project come in to being? Manuel Göttsching We we recorded our second album, Schwingungen and we wanted to include some lyrics for the next album, as well. We had a crazy singer for the second album, Schwingungen, which was nice experiment. It was a bit, yeah, very adventurous. [laughs] So, we used a text we had on the cover of our first album. We had a text from Ginsberg from “Howl,” an excerpt- Jeff Mao Allen Ginsberg? OK. Manuel Göttsching Allen Ginsberg. Yeah. So, we thought maybe we could... It was difficult with text. We had to make something in English because we thought of being an international music or musicians. And so, we didn’t want to make something in German. So, we thought maybe we can win Allen Ginsberg to work with him or something. But, Allen Ginsberg was no where to find. Nobody knew where he was. And our producer, the label, owner, Rolf-Ulrich Kaiser, he came one day and said, “Well, Timothy Leary is in Switzerland. We can make a contact.” I didn’t know at all who was Timothy Leary. I had never heard of him before. [laughs] But, my partner, Hartmut, was really enthusiastic, “Wow, Timothy Leary. That’s great.” Jeff Mao He’s a fugitive at this time, right? He’s a fugitive at this time. He’s escaped the United States and escaped from prison. Manuel Göttsching He escaped from prison. Yeah. He was ... Tim was working as a experimental... He did experiments with LSD as a neurologist and a psychotherapist at Harvard University. This was the time when LSD became very popular. Not only as a party drug in the United States. And so, he was thought of being a very dangerous for the youth and I think it was Nixon who called him one of the state enemies number one and they tried to get him out of business. And so, he was caught because the rules of the laws of the drugs are different in each state in the United States. Differ very much. I don’t know if... maybe it’s still today. But, it was at the time. But, there’s no really border between, I don’t know, Ohio and Nebraska. You don’t know when you leave one and so. They just found a simple trick. He went somewhere across the country and he was caught with 10 grams of marijuana or so. But he was sentenced to 10 years. To get him out, yeah, to get him away. He escaped from the prison. That’s a funny story. The prison because when they had to choose he was going to, they had to make a test with him. How dangerous he is? How big is he? Danger of escaping or whatever. So, Tim Leary was very amused when he went to the test to find the paper. He read the questions. Then he found out that he developed this test as a neurologist, as a psychotherapist. [laughs] So, he knew exactly what to answer. And he came to a relatively open prison. Then his former wife managed somehow to get in contact with the Black Panthers to free him and to help him to escape. And they helped him to leave the country. He went to Algeria, where the leader of the Black Panthers was resident. Jeff Mao Eldridge Cleaver. Manuel Göttsching Eldridge Cleaver. But, they didn’t get along together because Tim Leary was a very easy guy. He was not interested very much in politics. And Eldridge Cleaver was a very hard liner and military. They were not really good together. And Tim Leary felt a little bit like another prison there. And then somehow he moved. I think he found this guy. The English guy, Brian Barritt, and they moved somehow to Switzerland. Because in Switzerland he had some friends. Political friends who cared that he was not delivered, how to say it, to the United States. So, he lived there for about one year. And in that time, we met. Hartmut went there with a producer and they made a concept. And funny thing, by the way, Switzerland was, of course, in Switzerland LSD was invented... Jeff Mao So, he went to the motherland basically. Manuel Göttsching Yeah. But the record is not about LSD. Tim Leary was writing a book about seven levels of consciousness. That is something that ... a theory. I don’t even know if it’s his theory. Maybe it’s an older one. But, he wrote about it. And theory of different stage of levels each human being is passing through. More or less. So, we took this idea of the seven levels, as a basic structure, as a basic concept for the album. And, then we went back to Berlin and we had some more guest musicians for the album. And then, we recorded. And somehow we went to Switzerland and recorded for some days. Jeff Mao And you still perform some of this material today with other musicians? Manuel Göttsching Yes. That’s another story. That’s a funny story. Jeff Mao Well, let’s hear a little bit of Ash Ra Tempel with Timothy Leary. This track... Well, it’s a space side and a time side. So, it’s a piece of space side from 1973, I think it is? Manuel Göttsching Yeah. The recording was in summer of ’72 and released in ’73. Jeff Mao OK. So, you still performing this material today with different musicians? And that’s Timothy Leary on vocals though, right? Manuel Göttsching Yes. Initially, he was supposed only to write the lyrics and to speak some words. Then he was so enthralled by this happening that he just started to sing. He could sing. It worked. And we left it like this. It was a quite chaotic production in Switzerland. We went to the studio. The most modern, advanced studio in Bern, in the small city of Bern. At the time, we brought the engineer from Cologne, from our other studio. He started to rebuild the studio completely and to install the monitor was different and to make this. We were only hanging around. We lived all together for some days in a nice house up the hills. Yeah. It was nice thing. So, we recorded some material. But we went later in the studio to mix it again and in Cologne. So, Tim, he was not allowed. He couldn’t come to Cologne. So, he sent his assistant, Brian Barritt, to Cologne. And Brian was always playing it over the phone to Tim in Switzerland. “Yeah. Great. We need more synthesizers. We need more sound. We need to hear more space. More cosmic.” So, it became, well, in the end, very chaotic. But, it was a nice experience and after all I think musically, it’s well maybe not so inventive. But I liked it very much that it finally happened. And that’s a good thing. And the funny thing now is, is that some years ... three years ago, 2015, I was invited to Melbourne, Australia for a festival to for a solo performance. And the woman who created the festival proposed that I would probably play with some other musicians to perform some session or some workshops or so. I don’t like those kind of sessions. So, my wife proposed, “Why don’t you play some old Ash Ra Tempel?” I just said, “Great idea.” And they looked for some, they proposed some musicians, this was Ariel Pink from Los Angeles, Shags Chamberlain who played with Ariel Pink, and Oren Ambarchi, who is Australian. He’s well-known for his solo work, solo experimental guitar. And he also played with Keiji Haino. And he’s doing a lot of things. I didn’t know any of the three. And so, I thought, “OK. Let’s try.” I got in contact with them by emails. And I wrote, “Well, do you know some? Do you need some material? Do you know some scores? Maybe some lyrics?” They said, “Hahaha we know it. We know everything. We are so familiar with this album.” I proposed maybe Timothy Leary for singing with Elliot. And some of the second album, Schwingungen. So, we made a mixture of a one hour program of these two albums. And, yeah, we met only one day before in Australia. We had one day rehearsal and it was perfect. It was like if we had played it the day before. And later, we brought it out as a record last year. When I heard the recordings, I thought it sounded perfectly like the original. It could be some lost demo tape or something like that. [laughs] Jeff Mao Well, I mean this is a recurring theme for you in a way because you are constantly revisiting, even though of some of this material is older, you are reinventing and re-performing and re-presenting this material quite a bit in recent years. I actually want to skip ahead a little bit because I want to get to some of your solo recordings. And yesterday, this idea of reduction came up in terms of just stepping back and maybe having less being available. Having things less available to you in simplifying and how that can be an effective tool as a creative person. When you did the first solo record, Inventions for Electric Guitar, Ash Ra Tempel had dissolved. Did you feel that that was a necessary thing to do something entirely on your own? Manuel Göttsching Yes. It was not immediately, but it developed within one year or so. Ash Ra Tempel was basically a project from my partner, Hartmut, with me for many years from the very first school cover band until, yeah, Timothy Leary and then we made a nice fourth album called, Join In, which is also a improvised album from the beginning to the end. But, very soft and a bit relaxed and it’s not aggressive at all. It’s very different from the first one. And then he quit. He didn’t want to play anymore. He didn’t want being professionally a musician. He wanted to keep his mind free and he wanted to play when he wants to play and not because it’s a record production and not to make concerts. It just didn’t work anymore. And so, I thought of continuing... I like the idea of a band or group. I tried with various musicians. But it didn’t work that much in this way. And I was not so happy with it. And somehow one year later, I came up with the idea of a solo album. And a little bit I was influenced by the... I found out about minimalism, minimal music, which became popular the beginning of the 1970s in Germany. And I heard some Terry Riley and Steve Reich at festivals in Berlin. And it was, especially Terry Riley, influenced me as a musician. Not so much maybe as a composer, but I saw him playing and I was really attracted how he performed and how he played. He was very fluent. Very great keyboard player. And just with a simple tape delay, he made incredible sounds and all this minimal structures, he played and played. He could do it very simple, technical equipment. And so, I thought why not. I think I can play a little guitar. So, why not? I should try it with a guitar. [laughs] I took that what I had, which was just one guitar. And I used a tape recorder for a delay. And I used the minimalism. I used the structure of the delay as to keep with this rhythm, to keep the structure of the repetitive patterns. Another idea was to use the only guitar as a sound source. But this is also a minimalistic approach in a way because you’re just reduce. You take one, two, three, elements and concentrate on this and don’t do anything else. And don’t have to overdubs and more drums and more whatever. I tried to make the best out of these elements. Jeff Mao Well, let’s listen to a little bit of a track called, “Echo Waves,“ from Inventions for Electric Guitar. (music: Manuel Göttsching – “Echo Waves” / applause) Jeff Mao So, that’s just the electric guitar, multi-tracked with delay and that’s it? Manuel Göttsching Yes. [laughter] Jeff Mao You mentioned to me in an email recently that you’re re-presenting this with an orchestra or you have presented this with an orchestra, as well. So, it’s scored. How much of this was scored going into this? How much of this was just, you know, improvisation? Manuel Göttsching No. The original is for four guitars. So, I’d have four voices. And I performed it once in Japan with four guitar players with Elliott Sharp from New York, with Steve Hillage from England and a good old friend of mine from the Virgin days. And a young Chinese player, [unintelligible] who is very popular in Beijing with several groups. And just now, I’ve found, for some years, I’ve found a great band in Denmark. Six young musicians. Guitar players, experimental players called Circlen. They play experimental guitar music. They used to play in a circle and the audience is in the middle. So, they have a kind of surround effect. Very interesting idea. And they were fascinating. Of course, they knew the piece and they liked it and I invited them for a concert at the Szczecin Philharmonic, there’s a great new philharmonic. We performed it there. So, it’s not an orchestra. It’s just a group of guitar players because it’s a guitar piece. Of course, I can not play it alone to have the four voices, so we can play it with maybe six voices. Yes, I wrote down the scores. I have here the actual album, the new album, the vinyl album. We have made some two years ago. I put on the backside the original score that I had written for it. I had to try. I tried to find a solution to write down the delays. The initial note, the first, the second, the third delay in a kind of three dimensional way. So, yeah, that was a funny idea. So, of course, I had written it down. But, I wrote it down later. So, at first I played it and then I wrote it. Jeff Mao Is there something that you want to show us with... Manuel Göttsching Yeah. I can demonstrate it probably a little better on the guitar. For the delay I used at the time, I used a tape recorder: Reworks A77, which was a state of the art tape recorder. And the length of the delay was produced by the speed of the tape and by the distance between the recording and the playback hat. So, it was a fixed delay. Later, I got a modified model of this tape machine where I could change the speed and then I could change the delay time. But for this at this point, I had just a delay of 370, around 370 milliseconds. I make just a little demonstration for it so that you hear how it has been done. This is just, that was delay and then I used two different tempi for two different pieces. The first, “Echo Waves” is in a triolic tempo and the second piece Pluralis is in a straight four-four tempo. This is like the first one. That’s the initial part. The first guitar starts with that. Then, there’s a second guitar, which plays a bit more and on the higher level. Then, I add a third, which was more bassline and then one voice is more, how do you say it, it’s more sound. I used a volume pedal, nothing more. That was it. I created this first piece, the second piece, all the other piece and the other tempo. This is slow. This is like this. This played for, this is the basic theme, this was played for, I had to play it for 20 minutes. There’s no editing. I prepared it in realtime because I didn’t want to cut the tape. It was the first recording I did in my own small studio with a tape recorder. I had to work for it for a while to get it on tape because technically, it was not so easy. You have to concentrate for 20 minutes and if you have some scratch or some thing at 18 minutes, you start again from the beginning. [laughs] I had some problems with my refrigerator in the kitchen. He was producing clicks from time to time when he switched off and on, so I had to turn it off. [laughs] That’s how I managed. It took three months or so, the whole thing, to record it all in all. It’s a very meditative thing. You get into a kind of trance maybe when you play that for 20 minutes. There’s another nice thing that I can show you because I wanted to make every sound just with [the] guitar. I tried something with, to show it to you. [reaches in his pocket] This is a piece of metal that I used. This is originally from a slide guitar, from Hawaiian guitar and I used it as a kind of bow or like, playing the strings like this. To get a kind of, yeah, how to say it, string sound or not the percussive sound of a guitar. The one thing you can do is you work with a volume pedal. It’ll take the attack away. This was the other one that I tried for the second piece, “Quasarsphere,” which is the shortest piece. It goes something like this. That’s an example. [applause] Jeff Mao You mentioned Terry Riley and minimalism and that being an influence on you, especially with “Echo Waves” and obviously with things that we’re going to talk about next. I wonder if just African-American music and this sort of repetition being a thing, an innovation of James Brown and other people, was that an influence on you at any point? Manuel Göttsching Yes. We had a review from the first Ash Ra Tempel that somebody has written, “Ash Ra Tempel sounds like the James Brown Band on acid.” [laughs] Jeff Mao They were on acid too actually, at various points. Manuel Göttsching Of course. Over the years, everything, but it goes back from all my music. It goes back to my studies in classical guitar. What I love to play from these old ancient composers like Cavalli, they all wrote pieces called “Etude,” which is just pieces for rehearsal. They’re not really considered as big compositions, but they’re just for rehearsing your fingers, you right fingers, your left hand and you can, more or less, you can improvise with these passages. You just play very simple chords. You change from one chord to the other one. It’s just for, yes, for rehearsing in a way, for rehearsing your physical training. There, you can start, yeah, you can start. It gives you possibilities to improvise because you can interchange it, exchange it. It doesn’t matter. It’s only for training and it’s also a repetitive thing. It’s just small patterns that you repeat and repeat and repeat to train it. Maybe I was already in that part, influenced. Of course, it was the music, the popular music like Motown. Especially the long pieces, I always loved. I remember I was fascinated from this piece by the Rolling Stones, “Going Home,” which was crazy, about 11 minutes long. Nobody at the time made pieces of 11 minutes. I really liked that idea. Jeff Mao Alright. We’re going to play something now. I guess I should introduce it, but actually I’m not going to introduce it. This is something that we’re going to talk about a little bit, but for now, we’re just going to play some of the music. (music: Manuel Göttsching – E2-E4 / applause) Jeff Mao Okay. That of course was E2-E4, recorded in 1981. Sound pretty good, right? Sounds okay? Manuel Göttsching Mm-hmm. [laughs] Jeff Mao Apart from the music itself, there’s obviously, there’s a legend involved in how this was created. Maybe some of the people in this room know the story behind it. Maybe some of them don’t. I think it might be a good idea just to retell a little bit of that and how it came to be. Manuel Göttsching There are five, six, seven years between Inventions and E2-E4 and a lot of things happened in between. The next step after Inventions was that I had enough of guitar sounds. I always want something new. I do it only once and then, when I’m happy with it, I don’t want to repeat it. I think of something new or different. I started working on keyboards and composing for keyboards and that was my next solo album then, New Age of Earth, which gave me also a worldwide contract with Virgin Records in England. It was a good... Jeff Mao This is a very warm recording, ambient in places and using the synthesizer as you said. Manuel Göttsching Yes. Partly. It’s very much composed as the first track, “Sun Rain” is very much minimalistic composed, kind of a rondo. The second is more kind of a blues, but electronically. It was with synthesizers and different things. At the same time, I started to build more in my studio. I got more equipment. I got more synthesizers. I got a mini Moog. First, I got a ARP Odyssey and sequencers and mini Moogs. Yeah, just the studio equipment grew. But I also recorded some, I worked again with two musicians under the name Ashra. I wanted to keep that up. I recorded two albums, Correlations and Belle Alliance with these guys. I recorded another solo album, Blackout in ‘77. Then, I started performing with, not playing guitar, but as a soloist only with sequencers, synthesizers and keyboard. A good friend of mine at the time, she was a very well-known figure in the fashion business in Berlin, and she made very interesting shows at the time, very multimedia shows, which was something special that nobody else did with performance art, with films and of course, electronic music was something very new. I started performing to the shows, playing just live, improvising for 60, 70, 80 minutes. So, I got a good training as well in this. Yeah, this finally led, then to the recording of E2-E4 in way. I was on a tour. I was invited by my old partner Klaus Schulze for a guest on his tour and when I came back, I was a little bit in a live feeling, so some weeks later, I just recorded it, in the same way as I have had recorded over the years many, many times, but this time, somehow it was something special and it worked with no problems, technical problems, no crackles, no I don’t know. In fact, I didn’t intend to record it as a new album. It was just a session and I recorded, just on a two track machine. In the beginning, there was something. The rhythm was somehow different from what I tried, so I nearly wanted to stop it, but somehow I said, “No, no. Let’s see what happens.” I’m lucky today. [laughs] Yeah, it sounds very easy, so it was very relaxed and maybe this is what it sounds like, but in fact, it was some years’ work to come to this point and some years’ experimental training at concerts and performances. It was just a great moment. Jeff Mao But, when you’re recording this, this is December of ‘81 when you record this, what, I guess my question is: What is the emotion that’s fueling it, because you can talk about being in a trance-like state and maybe that is emotive in some way, but I feel like the reason this piece of music has lived on and transcended genre and places in the world is because there is something very emotive about it and I just wonder if there was, besides just sitting down and playing if there was some emotion that was behind this that you recall? Manuel Göttsching No. No. Just playing. I wanted to play and so I did it in the same way I did many sessions in my studio before and I had many recordings of 30 minutes. Sometimes, it’s only 10 minutes and something was happening and I stopped it. This one just worked for one hour. No, not really a special mood. The only thing is that I felt in a bit, yeah, I thought it’s a kind of live atmosphere, live, me alone live in my studio without audience. [laughs] Jeff Mao I guess maybe that’s what it is, is just the feeling of intimacy that’s still there. Manuel Göttsching Yeah. I didn’t change anything afterwards. I didn’t do any overdubs. I didn’t do any edits. I didn’t change any, not even equalizing or something like that. I just left it as it was. I was a bit surprised actually when I finished and then I said, “Oops. What was this?” I listened to it and thought, “This is quite perfect.” Actually, I was working on another program. I was working on a new solo album. But my idea was to make something more orchestra, more composed. Then, suddenly, I had this tape and thought, “What to do?” All my friends said, “You must release it and you must ...” Yeah, OK. I went to London. I still had this contract with Virgin Record, but it was open. There was an option to continue or not to continue. Virgin, at the time, had developed from a very small independent label to a really big company, so I thought they would’ve made it maybe. They would’ve bought it, but it would have been thrown in a corner and forget it. Two chords for one hour and not even formatted a for a record, for vinyl, so what to do with it? I thought it’s not the right thing. I played it to Richard Branson. I remember when I was seeing him at his houseboat and he had a new baby in his arm and the baby was falling asleep and he said to me, “Manuel, you can make a fortune with this record.” [laughs] I said, “Okay. Thanks for the advice.” Though I left it for two years and then my old friend Klaus Schulze came up. He wanted to create, again, a new label, a small label just for some friends and for himself. He called it Inteam Records. He asked me if I would join him or if I had some music, so I said, “OK, why not take this, try this?” I thought it’s a small label, so we can see how it works. The initial reactions were very not, 50-50. There were some strange reactions here in Berlin. Some people wrote, “There’s nothing, there’s no excuse for this record.” I had “missed everything in the actual development of electronic music. [laughs] ‘I should better listen to Depeche Mode,” they wrote. OK, 10 years, 15 years later, they had to excuse for themselves. Jeff Mao How did that feel though at the time? It’s not like you had high expectations. Manuel Göttsching No. It was not the right time because the high period of the experimental electronic music was over at the end of the ’70s because there was such a huge boom of equipment. The first of the ’70s, they were really experiments from bands like Tangerine Dream, the early Kraftwerk, because before they became pop musicians in a way, electronic pop musicians. Popol Vuh, Klaus Schulze, my experiments. [Hans-Joachim] Roedelius and [Dieter] Moebius with Cluster. This was really interesting. Then, there was really suddenly a mass market for instruments coming from Japan especially with the companies Roland, Yamaha, Korg. They all produced synthesizers, synthesizers, keyboards, keyboards. They got more and more and more. End of the ’70s, it was nothing. Everyone used it and nobody was talking about electronic music anymore because it became a mass market and it became standard in popular music. Everybody was using and nobody was talking anymore about some experiments in electronic music. The old bands, musicians, the older ones, they were not really, nobody, yeah, they were not so interesting in the beginning. The first of the 1980s, there was a new generation. There was a new wave in Germany with German lyrics. First came punk music, then there was this new wave in England, there was synth-pop bands in England like Orchestral Manoeuvres [in the Dark] and Human League, for example. They had chart success and nobody wanted to listen anymore to Tangerine Dream. This was ’70s music. It was only end of the ’80s or beginning of ’90s was what I call “techno period, that this came again into the mind of musicians and producers. They remembered, it became again interesting and was played and used and there were concerts again. Yeah, it took a while with E2-E4. In the first years, nothing spectacular. It was a very slow growing success. It came, I think, first from Detroit. In New York, there was a club, Paradise Garage, where Larry Levan [DJed]. I didn’t know anything about him before. I didn’t know it at the time. I heard it many years later that it happened like this, that he played it at full length and that he even wanted it to be played at his funeral. There was, in Detroit, DJs who played it. They sampled or remixed it. I only found it out in 1989, when it came somehow to England. A English DJ played it and then there were Italian DJs. There were several groups of DJs who wanted to make remixes and versions of it. There was this version of Sueno Latino and they asked me. They came to Berlin, the label manager so I was surprised. He showed me all these bootlegs and mixes that I didn’t know anything of before. Jeff Mao Until then, you had no inkling that this was a record that was being played in a dance environment? Manuel Göttsching Yes, I heard of it, but it was middle of the ’80s that I heard that it was played in New York in some clubs and I couldn’t believe it. I thought, ‘It’s not produced as a dance music, so this is not a heavy bass drum. This is, of course, this is rhythm and this floating and yes, you can maybe,’ but I couldn’t imagine. Jeff Mao I think it adds to the legend of this recording that this a remnant of the time when one of the things that’s so special about DJ culture, at least from that era is that you didn’t have to be, you didn’t have to have made a dance record for it to be embraced by somebody for a dance audience. This was a perfect example of that. I wonder if you feel that there’s any kind of parallel with even this being repurposed as something for a different audience with you using any of your own equipment, studio equipment, instrumentation and taking those elements, whether it be guitar, delay, keyboards, whatever it might be, and repurposing them in a way. Is there any kind of parallel there between what you’ve done to create the music and how this music that’s been created has been suggested? Manuel Göttsching No. For me, it was just a state of the time, what that was, what possible. That’s how I played with different analog equipment sequencers. That’s how I used it, how I played it. My minimal influences and... When I compose and when I record, whatever, I don’t think about how to call it or what might be the audience. Of course, I have my experience, so I know in what direction it could go, but it was no intention like that. So, of course, I just accepted it and I thought it’s a kind of transition from the classic what I call, so-called “classic minimalism” from the end of the ’60s, beginning ’70s until the techno time or whatever, however you may call it, modern electronics. That’s a kind of bridge between in between. That’s what I think. Jeff Mao When you’re re-presenting this music because you’ve performed this live many times in the last 15 years, whatever it might be ... Manuel Göttsching Not so many times. [laughs] Jeff Mao You have performed this though. Manuel Göttsching I perform it, but I started ... Jeff Mao Not in the club, but in different environments. Manuel Göttsching Yes. But I didn’t perform it for many years because I thought it’s impossible with all this equipment to bring it or to carry it and then to install it and to tune it because in my studio I use mixing desks, I used a tape records, all the delays, the drum machines, the synthesizers, and so on. I thought, “It’s just the studio recording that I would never perform,” but the technology has changed and I was interested, of course, in very first computer technology. In the beginning of the ‘80s, I used an Apple II Plus computer. I used the Commodore computer. But these were very rough and very simple computers. Of course, it was not possible to work with them, not even to play these computers like an instrument. It took another 20 years until laptops got technically so fit that with the appropriate programs, like Ableton, it was fantastic. You can use it on stage and play with it, play with it like you plan an instrument. From 2002, I started to think about performing again, solo performance with a simple equipment. It gave me the possibility to perform in Japan, to perform in Korea, to perform in China, to perform in Australia, perform in the United States. I just take a laptop and a small keyboard, my guitar, and that’s it. I had to work out a little different version of it, because I used original sounds, so I didn’t have any separate tracks of it. There’s only this two-track existing, because I didn’t have recorded it on multi-track. I used parts of it, many, many small parts of it to keep up with the original sound. As a second way, I used the internal computer sounds, synthesizer sounds, plug-ins, to rebuild the bass lines, the chorus, the solo melody, the drum set. I used drum samples from my original Echo drum computer. I have the old melodies and I have the new, and I can play with both. That’s attractive. I played first concert in Japan in 2006. Since then, I think I performed every year once or so, like around that. Jeff Mao Do you hear the music in a different way now after all this time? Manuel Göttsching No, I don’t hear it different. I try to keep as close as much to the original when I perform it, so I always perform it quite exactly to 60 minutes and in the same structure. No, every time different... This is my favorite way in music to use what I explained before, sometimes I have basic structures, but with these structures, I begin to improvise. Jeff Mao I want to open this up to questions in a moment. You’ve obviously been working on a lot of other things in addition to re-presenting this music. Composing, doing scores, and whatnot. I wonder just in terms of what we started this conversation off with, in terms of talking about context and the context in which you started, what do you think all of this has taught you, if anything, in terms of how a context can fuel creation of something? Yet, that thing that comes from that very specific set of circumstances, being the Germany, the Berlin of your youth, now creates something that people who have very little direct connection to still have this attachment to, still have some feeling for, and some connection to. I’m just wondering if you have any thoughts at all about that. Manuel Göttsching This is a very complicated question. [laughs] I can only repeat that in the beginning, for me, that was all more free playing with it. I didn’t intend, very much, to become very professional. I was interested in music. What is music? How is music existing? What is it? How to play it? How to ... Why does it sound like this, like that? When I listen to something in the radio, how is it made? When I play the guitar at home, it sounds completely different, so how does it work? I was interested in this side. I was interested in music. Yes, music structures. What’s the difference between a major and a minor chord? If you put in this order or that order? How did old composers, popular composers, how did they compose their symphonies, their pieces? How did Bach do it? Yeah, formulas and trying that out. That’s from my own experience. I’m very happy when something that I play or that I made or that I release, when this is a success. Or, when people like it, and when people like the music. Last time I played in Copenhagen, there were people entering the stage and began to dance. Yeah, I like it. Jeff Mao Well, I thank you for exploring ways to express yourself, pursuing that freedom of expression within your music. And, I thank you for being here today. We’re going to take some questions, but let’s say thank you to Manuel Göttsching. [applause] Manuel Göttsching Thank you. Jeff Mao Does anybody have a question for Manuel? Please, participants only at this point. Thank you. Audience Member Hi. Thank you very much for all the sharing and the music. It has been very inspiring to me. Since you have a record called for Inventions for Electric Guitar, which I really like, do you think there’s still a chance for electric guitar to be reinvented? Manuel Göttsching Yes, of course. You can try. What I did is just an example of what came to my mind. This was the idea to produce every sound that I could imagine, or that I wanted, just with a guitar. To give it a form or structure, I’ve chosen this minimalistic approach to put it into a composition. That’s it. Yes, this is ... Of course, I didn’t follow this anymore, because for me, it was done. I have no intention to continue that. As you can hear in E2-E4, and second part, I used just a pure guitar sound. There’s no distortion, there’s no effect. There’s not even an echo, so it’s just a pure guitar cable into the mixing desk, and that’s it, so you have a beautiful sound. I reduced it more to produce a sound with your fingers. It’s very depends on how you attack with your fingers, if you play with your nails, if you play with a small pick, how you move your fingers on the left hand. It can have a great variety of tonality or atmosphere or changing in colors of the tone. This enough. For my future, I found it more attractive. But today, there are so many effects, and effects, and effects, that’s good. I have to say that the echo, I didn’t use it as an effect. I use it as part of a composition. That’s a possibility. For example, if you use some kind of looper as a live samplers and to create with this a new style, or something, of loopings, put loops together and working with that with more than one, two voices, three voices, or so. Maybe. Audience Member Hi. Thank you for talking to us. Your music is very inspiring. I wanted to ask if you ever use any alternative guitar tunings? Manuel Göttsching I didn’t understand. Audience Member Alternative guitar tunings. Jeff Mao Alternative guitar tunings. Manuel Göttsching Tunings? Audience Member Yeah. Manuel Göttsching Yes, I had to for Inventions, because I wanted to play a bass, or kind of lower voice for bass lines, so I did tune the E string. I just tried something, yes, because sometimes, I have very special chords that are not easy to translate or to transform into another harmony. So, I tried some tunings with that. But, I’m used to the classic tuning, so I most of the time I return to that, because I’m used it and I’m trained with it. When I start improvising, I don’t want to think too much what’s now this note, and the rest. I would have to play too much with my head and not with just playing. If I do a special composition, yes. For example, what I did, I made some tunes with Hawaii guitar. Not pedal steel, but Hawaiian guitar. There are different tunings that you can use for playing with chords. There are several possibilities that I tried out, yes. Audience Member Hi. Thank you. I was wondering how do you decide which recording like yours will be released, because you improvise a lot? How do you make this decision? Manuel Göttsching Yeah, that’s sometimes not is easy. At the beginning it was very easy, because there was no time. We had only one recording, and that we had to use. [laughs] The studio time was over. Of course, it started with the old studio, but when I started with my old studio... With Inventions, for example, I was lucky. When I finished with a track, and when I had two tracks, and then the fourth track. So, there was a limit of technology, and my own limit. Then I said, “Okay, this is enough. I don’t have to do any more. I don’t have to add more instruments or whatever.” It was a danger in later years when the technology getting bigger. You had 8-track, 16-track, 32-track. This was terrible, because musicians were really thinking they had to fill all these tracks, and, “There’s still some space, and you can do this...” Yeah, I was never into that, because I reduced it to eight tracks. But what Jeff said before that to find minimalism, that is a way that you reduce it to some elements. That you don’t put another drum track, another violin, another piano. Just reduce it, and you concentrate on for what the composition should be. Think of classic, older composers that composed piece for a cello. They compose piece for one violin, and then you have only one violin and not a big orchestra. So, you have to express everything in this one voice. It’s a matter of self-control. Audience Member I think the excerpt you played from Inventions for Electric Guitar, it sounds incredibly fresh and not really dated at all. I think you can see a lot of relevance in it in the kind of contemporary post-rock. I was just curious about the approach that people would take with making that kind of music now would be very much based with loop pedals. I was wondering how you made this composition that’s 20 minutes long, and you’re saying you have to just sit there and play each part. Did you have a vision for what each of the parts are going to be? Or, does it start with just this one layer, and then the improvisation builds it? Or, did you have the picture in your head beforehand? Manuel Göttsching Well, I had the 4-tracks, so I could use four tracks and four voices. I think I had the basic themes that I try to play or to explain. I just recorded that, and then from then on, I started developing the other voices. Sometimes I used a kind of second voice, the bass or something, and then some more in contrast to the first or the second voice. I think it was a process step by step, and so I just started with it. Later I did it where I had to have a basis of some minutes to get into the mood, and then to think about it, and then to test it and try it. Today, it’s very easy. You just put in some notes, and you have a basic sequence. Then you try out as long as you want. At this point in those years, I had to pre-record the basic [sequence] in a way, and then rewind the tapes, start from the beginning. As I have shown, I did some kind of diagrams that I thought, maybe, “Here this one, then another part.” It’s divided in some parts that’s changing. There’s a change of harmony in some part. There’s some very atonal parts. It goes back to a more rhythmic, rocky part in the end of the first piece. So, yeah, there’s a structure. Step by step, as far as I remember. I think so. Audience Member Could I ask one small other thing? You said about notating it afterwards for live performance. I was curious because of the way you say that you use the delay not as an effect, but as a part of the composition. How did you notate that delay as a part? Because, it’s not a classical convention kind of a thing. Manuel Göttsching Yeah, that’s not so easy to explain, because echo or delay was nothing special at the time. It was used by Pink Floyd, by all the big bands, Jimi Hendrix, and in all the studios. They never really worked with it. What I did was to play exactly in sync with the echo. That means that the echo or the delay was controlling the tempo of the piece, which was also a great help when I played it, because I had to keep up steady in this temp. I wanted exactly the amount of echo or of the first delay, the second delay, the third delay, because it gives a new combination of notes. It gives a new harmonies, it gives new intervals, when the third note meets the third one, or something like this. Jeff Mao Like phasing. Manuel Göttsching Yeah. Audience Member Hello, and thank you. I’m just wondering, as somebody who’s inspired a lot of contemporary artists and musicians, if there’s any newer music or artist that you’re interested in at the moment or inspired by? Manuel Göttsching Not particular. Actually, I don’t listen so much to music. What I try to find is ... and, that’s what I do myself... to work on something new, new structures or styles, or... this is not only electronic. This could be anything. What I’ve found a bit sad was that electronic music became a little too much like being dance music. It’s either dance or it’s chill out. I think there are many, many more possibilities for electronic sounds or music or for what you can do with it. Very fine and very precise. Working to make it everything which makes it different from the acoustic music or from the old music, and to use that. What I’m a bit missing is something like what happened in the ’60s, ’70s with this minimal music, which was it was not depending on the instrument. This could be electronic. For example, the orchestra, the Steve Reich Ensemble was playing completely acoustic classic instruments, but it could be also electronic. So, it’s a style of music, it’s the structure. Yeah, I think something like this should be reinvented in the next years, by one of you maybe. Audience Member I agree. Jeff Mao Yeah, I think so, actually. Anybody else? Audience Member Hi. Did you ever have the chance to jam with Terry Riley? Manuel Göttsching To jam? To jam? Audience Member Jam. J-A-M. Play music with Terry Riley. Manuel Göttsching To jam with Terry Riley? Audience Member Yeah. Manuel Göttsching OK. No. No, I didn’t. No. Audience Member Did you ever have a chance to talk about his music and your music or share any ideas? Manuel Göttsching Yes, we did. I met him briefly at one of his last concerts here at the... Where was it? Former congress hall. Today it’s Haus der Kulturen. Yeah, we spoke a little bit. What should I say? I always said, “Musicians don’t talk very much, they play.” [laughs] That was our basis for when we founded Ash Ra Tempel. Klaus, Hartmut, and me, we didn’t talk about it. We just met, and we didn’t talk what we are doing. We didn’t talk about what we played now, we just started. We began, and the only discussion was, “Who begins today?” When we had a concert, backstage, we thought, “Oh, you start today.” “Oh, no, not me. You’ll go.” That was all. But, we didn’t discuss the tuning, or we didn’t discuss the chords, or we didn’t discuss... sometimes, we discussed, “We start slow. We start, maybe, a bit more fast,” everything was ... No, we didn’t talk very much, and somehow it worked. We spoke in music, so we spoke in playing. So, maybe a good idea to do it. That’s what happens in a jam, of course, yes. That may be a good idea. The last concert, Terry’s concert here, I didn’t see him. He played with... What was his name, an English tabla player, she played... Huh? Audience Member [unintelligible] Manuel Göttsching Yeah, yeah. He likes very much Indian ragas and performs this. Jeff Mao Anybody else? Audience Member Hello, Mr. Gottsching. I’m a big fan of E2-E4. I actually listened to in Larry Levan Plays from Paradise Garage. Well, basically, when I first heard it, I noticed just constant part of the repetition is a constant part in your music. I just wondered if, at the time, you had any statement or something against traditional music that constantly changes or that was your natural way of composing. Also, I want to know what the chess board means in the artwork of the E2-E4 record. Manuel Göttsching Well, the flow of the music is just how emotionally I played it. That’s completely improvised, so I just changed it how I feel. I don’t count to eight or to 10, or whatever. I think, “Now it’s the right time,” so I just ... The cover, that’s a long story. The funny thing is with the title, E2-E4, it was one of the only pieces of music where I had the title, the name, E2-E4, before I had the piece of music. I thought of a chess game. I was working with this Apple computer, Commodore, and I was writing small programs for graphics, for text. I was doing programming in the language, BASIC, and assembly. Then you start using letters and numbers for abbreviations. You have this hexadecimal code for not 1 to 10, but 1 to 16, and you have A, B, C, D, E. So, this combination, I found attractive as a title.
Then it was the third influence, or the third idea came when I saw the first Star Wars movie with this little robot, which was called R2D2. I found it just funny, because, yes, it’s a machine, it’s a robot. So, this is a program. I thought, E2-E4, is the most common used opening in a chess game, so I thought, “This is a great title,” but I didn’t have any music, so I thought, “OK, I keep it in mind for years.” When I recorded it in December 1981, I thought, “Well, this could be the right piece of music to call it E2-E4.” Naturally, I decided to use a simple chess board as a cover. Jeff Mao We can see picture number seven, actually, real quick, which is the album cover. [album cover appears on screen] Manuel Göttsching I have something else here. This is from our last release is we have an inlay in the card. That’s what I found is it’s a chess board that my father had drawn himself, where every field of the chess board has a number at the appropriate letter and number, because he was teaching himself to play chess without the board. So, just remembering the number and the field. Then playing just out of his head with partners, and so without seeing the board. This was his training board. I found it 15 years ago in his archives. I thought it’s appropriate to use it for my cover. He would have been very happy, I think. Jeff Mao If you’re curious about the actual chess move, it’s picture number eight. Throw that up there real quick. That’s E2-E4. Anybody else with a question? Well, I guess, then the only thing left to say is thank you, once again, Manuel Göttsching, for being here. [applause] Manuel Göttsching Thank you. It’s great. Thank you. Thank you for inviting me. It was a pleasure. I hope I could give you some interesting hints.

Mandy Parnell
The comparative lack of women working in music production and audio engineering can be so glaring that, in 2017, The Atlantic asked, “Why Aren’t There More Women Working in Audio?” While the article cites many talented women, there was at least one obvious omission: Mandy Parnell. The Essex-born, Grammy-winning engineer is a standout among peers of any gender, working with a long list of eminent artists including Björk, Brian Eno and Aphex Twin to expand the preconceived limits of sound. After studying at SAE, Parnell became a trainee mastering engineer at the Exchange in London. Following several years of free work, she steadily accrued paying and often high-profile gigs. In recent years, she’s developed a close in-studio relationship with Björk, for whom she mastered Biophilia and Vulnicura. For the latter, Parnell also tackled the sound of Vulnicura’s virtual reality music videos. That same year, she received the Mastering Engineer of The Year award from the Music Producers Guild. Today, Parnell runs her studio Black Saloon in London and lectures on mastering and the music industry across the globe.
In her 2018 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, Parnell discussed her work with artists like Björk and Aphex Twin, the intricacies of her studio set-up and the importance of staying in touch with the emotions of the music during the mastering process.
Hosted by Chal Ravens So, we are about to get an insight into one of the dark arts of music production, something that is crucial to making a great record but is perhaps a bit invisible to the end listener sometimes. So, I’m on the couch with one of the world’s most revered mastering engineers. Please welcome Mandy Parnell. Mandy Parnell Hello. Chal Ravens Let’s just start with the basics, then. In a nutshell, what is mastering? Mandy Parnell Wow, in a nutshell. Chal Ravens Just in a very, very brief nutshell. Mandy Parnell Brief nutshell. An objective set of ears on the project. Objective set of ears. We’re the first set of ears to hear it when it comes out of the studio. So, often you’re in there for, anywhere from a few weeks to a few years. So, we’re the first sounding board really. That’s what it is for me, basically. Chal Ravens Why is it something that I can’t do at home? Why do I need to go and see you to get a record mastered? Mandy Parnell A mastering studio has full-range speakers. First and foremost, when you’re at home, you have a small to mid-range monitors, so you really have not got control of your bass. It’s possible that your room’s not set up very well. You’re going into a mastering studio, it’s going to be a very fine tuned room. So, it’s going to show us a lot of what’s going on. It’s possible in your rooms at home that you’ve got phase problems, and you’re not aware of it. Often that’s the case with stuff that comes in from bedroom productions. There can be phase issues and often sub bass issues, because you’re not hearing it. Often, I’ll have young producers, engineers that come in and they’re very shocked at what they hear in the mastering room, because they haven’t heard it on their mix. So, we’re often having to go back and remix or try and doctor stuff to make it work for when it goes out there. Chal Ravens So, it’s partly about the room itself, almost an architectural thing to take it somewhere else. So, you used to work at The Exchange and now you have your own studio at home called? Mandy Parnell Black Saloon Studios. Chal Ravens So, when did you build your own studio and why did you decide to take it into your house? Mandy Parnell OK. I left The Exchange. I was working at another studio in west London and helped build that up and redesign it and was working out of there. I got headhunted to go out to LA and worked for a big studio out there. So, for about a year while we were discussing it and doing contracts, and I was going and looking at houses out there, my house was for sale. I’d started working out of the studio in my house, which was set up more as a writing room, and then went into more of a room for me to explore my theories, because I was doing quite a crazy journey into theory of mastering at that time. So, I started working on projects out of there, and then decided not to go to LA and stick around in London and started looking at renting studios. My acoustic engineer said, “Why are you moving? You’ve done some incredible records, some number one records out of the room.” All the artists and producers loved it, because it’s in my house and it’s a converted warehouse, and just a fun space. So, that’s why I’m still there. Chal Ravens I don’t want to get too scarily technical too quickly, but crazy theories? What sort of crazy theories? Mandy Parnell Just about theories of sound basically, and how to master. Exploring theories about gain structuring, exploring theories about signal flow, testing lots of different equipment, really going into a journey about digital audio and file formats, which I’ve had the pleasure of being involved with teams like Mastered for iTunes. [I] was involved with that team, with the MQA [Master Quality Authenticated] team, sort of beta testing. So, yeah, just exploring different theories and how we can get better sound and get the emotion across through these formats, basically. Chal Ravens What skills are needed to be a mastering engineer? Does it help to be a musician? Mandy Parnell No. I’m not a musician. I did my music at school, piano and guitar. Never wanted to play music, never wanted to be a musician. Always loved music, loved finished product. Of course when I was smaller it was all vinyl, so I had a portable record player when I was about this high, and I’d just play records and look at them and be fascinated by them. It’s not necessary. I mean, that’s more necessary I think if you’re in the recording studio and you’re tracking to have a knowledge of music and have a knowledge of pitch. Of course when it gets to mastering it’s finished. I don’t need to worry about the auto-tune, that’s already been done. I think what you need to have is a passion for sound. Chal Ravens Tell us a bit about your particular route into the job. How did you actually end up being a mastering engineer? Mandy Parnell One of my best friends was a housekeeper at the Manor Studios, which was Richard Branson’s residential studio. I was about 15, 16. She invited me down there for the weekend to get drunk and swim in the pool, and just hang out in this rock & roll studio. [laughs] So, on the Sunday before I was heading back to London, the assistant engineer said to me, “Do you want to see the studio?” I was like, “Sure, that’d be great.” I literally walked in there – I have a picture of her with the assistant engineer behind the board. It was like that. [snaps fingers] It really was like that. I was just like, “Wow, how do you do it? How’s it work? What do you do?” Just asked him 100 questions. Came back to London. We had three music production courses in the UK at the time. One was the Tonmeister, which I wouldn’t have got on. I was too young and was a dropout from education. We had one called Gateway, which was in south London, and that was a long way from me, and SAE had just set up, I think it was their second year in London. So, I was very blessed because I was taught at SAE by the people that wrote the course, which I think really helped. Then, I left there, and we did a very big mastering module. Of course when I came into the industry it was very much about reel-to-reel tape to vinyl. There was no digital. It was just at the beginning, really, of CDs coming into it. Still, the preferred format was vinyl. So, I worked as an assistant in different studios and then ended up at The Exchange as a trainee mastering engineer. To train as a mastering engineer is a five-year learning, and then five years to really start perfecting your skills with people still holding your hand. So, it’s a very long process, very long. It’s not a quick thing to be a mastering engineer, in my opinion, from how I was trained. Chal Ravens I’m guessing that you were one of the only women doing that job at the time. Mandy Parnell There wasn’t many. There was a woman that was at Sony Studios called Beryl. She was a production cutting engineer. I didn’t meet her until about four or five years into my career. We did have another female at The Exchange [who] was CD editing, sort of digital editing, [who] helped train me in the copy room, but she left, she didn’t want to do it anymore. She actually went into the reception area and became the studio manager, which was sad. [laughs] Chal Ravens How different is it now? Mandy Parnell It’s not much different. We do have a few more females coming out, but it’s taken a long time. It’s been very active behind the scenes work for some of my generation of female producers and engineers around the world to encourage and mentor females into the industry. People often say, “Why don’t women want to come into the industry?” It’s not just about sound, it’s actually about science in general and physics. We do have a lack, especially in the UK, of young girls wanting to study sciences. So, I’m involved with the Scientific Instrument Maintenance. I’ve done a couple of things for them where we go into schools and encourage girls at a younger age to get into really cool scientific jobs. Working for NASA or whatever, coming into sound. There are some interesting in programs in some of the Nordic countries where they’re actually going in at seven [years old] and taking instruments and recording devices, and encouraging both boys and girls to get involved in it. But it is sort of aimed to show the girls that they could do this. Chal Ravens Did you ever find it in any way intimidating or daunting when you’re starting out? Mandy Parnell Yeah, very much so. You know, I was quite punk rock. I had a mother that had worked in a male industry, so she showed me the way. I was quite punk rock, just through my life and younger years, living in squats, and happened to be quite feisty. Taught me to put my shoulders back and not take it on board. To put on a mask, in a sense. But, yeah, it was tough, especially at The Exchange. We were renowned for electronic music and cutting really loud records. I’d often get challenged: “Well, do you know how to cut a loud record?” I’d have to be, “Can you see where I’m working? Do you really think they’d have me working here if I didn’t know what I was doing?” It’s a bit ridiculous. Chal Ravens Now, looking through the records that you’ve worked on... So there’s over a thousand on Discogs, but you did say to me that there are actually more. I’m struck by how different they are in terms of genre. Just going to list a few here. More recently, Mount Kimbie, Bing & Ruth, Jamie XX, The Knife, Frightened Rabbit, Sons of Kemet, Nils Frahm, Chilly Gonzales. Going back to the ’90s, all kinds of things, indie like Super Furries [Super Furry Animals], some very weird experimental stuff like Merzbow and Diamanda Galás. At the beginning as well, lots of dance 12"s. There’s an early Adam Beyer record on Drumcode. Skint. There’s a So Solid Crew career record. Yeah. Suburban Base record. I was curious about whether you were involved in the dance scene in the early ‘90s or what your relationship was around then? Mandy Parnell I was living in New Orleans, getting my love back. What happened was [that] I was working at The Exchange, and it was during the first recession. They’d taken on some more trainees, which would push me up the ladder. They’d expanded very quick, and they had to eventually meet these new trainees that we trained, and some of them are still mastering and got their own studios, which is great, because we had to train them. But they got rid of them, which pushed me back into the copy room, which I didn’t really like. I’m very hyperactive, get bored really quickly. I’d learned the computer system and taught all my senior engineers how to use it. It was one of the first DAWs to come into England for mastering called Sonic Solutions. So, I taught them all how to use that. I was bored. So, I went to New Orleans and ended up getting married and having a son. So I missed that [dance] scene. But, at the point I went, I had become so clinical about sound. I was going to see people play at incredible halls like Royal Festival Hall and just sitting there and being really picky about sound. I wasn’t enjoying music anymore. So, I went to New Orleans and listened to the most incredible musicians that were pouring their heart out on the worst systems that you’ve ever heard. This is what taught me, or reminded me, I wouldn’t say it taught me, but actually made me look into myself about how music is pure emotion, and that we need to follow the emotion, not become so analytical about sound. It really taught me a lot going back there. So, I missed all the rave scene, which was probably a good thing, because I probably, knowing me, would have got into a lot of trouble through that time, with my character. Came back to The Exchange right in the middle of it, I suppose. But, it was really fun because I started to work with a lot of very, very cool artists. I always remember Talvin Singh, for instance, and working with him on his first album. He was DJing and just starting to work with Björk, and we’d go to these clubs where these guys were DJing, and it was underground clubs. It was just like the coolest thing. His music was so fresh and interesting. Everyone dancing and hanging out. It was just a beautiful time. I’m glad I missed the rave scene. Chal Ravens You did some quite big crossover dance albums as well. Did a very big Fatboy Slim album, for instance. So you saw that side of it, too. Mandy Parnell Yeah. We did a lot of the Skint stuff, worked on all the projects with him. That’s really fun, to work on them tunes and be able to go out and hear them. I just remember few years ago being at Glastonbury and Fatboy Slim was DJing. It was late at night, and we were walking across the bridge, and he was just coming on. He dropped one of the tunes and the whole place went crazy, and it was just so cool to think, “Yeah, I was part of that tune,” and just watch that emotion sort of wave through. Chal Ravens You mentioned that The Exchange was famous for mastering all kinds of loud records. In the late ’90s and early ’00s there were a lot of technical developments in terms of volume, I guess. That period is sometimes referred to as the loudness wars. Mandy Parnell We’re still in it. Chal Ravens So, obviously you’ve fought in the loudness wars in some capacity. Can you explain a bit about what that means from a technical perspective and where you stand on it now? Mandy Parnell The thing is, my role is to follow what the producer wants. I can advise on what I think they should do, but it is very much my role to do what the producer wants. Back in the ’90s, especially with CD mastering, the technology was still being developed a lot and there was lots of constraints. You’ve got to remember it was 16 bit, for instance, 44.1 [kHz], and it was really hard to get the energy that we were used to coming off vinyl through the CD mastering chain. What we discovered, because we had these standards we were supposed to adhere to, was that actually pushing it a bit more and pushing the converters into clip mode – so, this was before we had brick wall limiting, some of the tools we have now – but pushing the converters into a clipping mode, which still happens constantly, made the stuff sound more energetic, more emotionally what we were used to with the vinyl. So, that’s where it really started. I remember one of my bosses, one of my teachers, Graeme Durham, working on a Bomb the Bass record. I was in a CD editing suite, and it used to be on a big video tape, a CD master, to go to a factory, was this big tape called a U-Matic. So, we’d have to analyze U-Matic and check for errors and stuff. If there was any overs, it would come out on the printer. I ended up with a stack of paper like this [raises hand] from this Bomb the Bass [record], because it was just all overs, and I was just going nuts because the paper was just feeding out the printer. [laughs] I was just like, “What the fuck’s going on?” So, I went into Graeme and I was like, “I’ve got this big issue,” because you were allowed one or two according to standards. He went to me, “Just cut it out and sellotape it together and send it to a factory. It’s how we want it and just let it go.” That was the start of loud mastering at The Exchange [with] digital. With vinyl it was always a question of producers would want to come in and they wanted the record louder than the next. That was always a challenge of how we going to get this drum & bass or techno record to be louder than this one. I mean, we really had fun. We were all young engineers and all out and about on the scene and all loved music. So, we’d spend half the night listening to other people’s records, comparing stuff, talking about how it worked, how they managed to do that, experimenting on how we were going to do that. So, that’s how we did the journey. Chal Ravens Could you explain how you make a vinyl record louder, how that works? Mandy Parnell So, of course, it’s level. There’s a lot to do with the mix, with the mid-range. I don’t know whether you’re aware when it comes to vinyl, don’t use phase on your bass, make sure it’s very minor. Really be careful of extreme high tops. Really be careful of sibilance on vocals. If there’s too much there, you have to remember, for us, we can only work on the stereo track. So, if we need to DS stuff, we’re going to have to DS everything in your top range, making sure things are very well looked after. If you analyze some of the hip-hop records, especially the stuff that would come out of America, and we do that, they’d be very mono. Actually, the whole mix will be quite mono, and people going... The English guys will be like, “How can we get our records to sound like that?” The biggest key was actually looking at what they were doing in the stereo field. I think it is true when they say your mastering is going to be as good as your mix. The less we have to do to fix your mix, the easier it’s going to be for us to get a great sounding, loud, fat record, if that makes sense. But it’s just gain. Lots of experimenting with the equipment, with the constraints of the lathe and the amps and what you can do. I mean, there’s things that technically you should do, that at The Exchange we wouldn’t do, because it wouldn’t sound very good, and I think that’s why we were renowned for our cuts and what they sounded like, because we threw away a lot of the theories that people had about cutting records. Chal Ravens Has that changed then, this desire for loudness, are people going in a different direction? Mandy Parnell I wish. I mean, we should be. In theory, with all the different platforms they’re doing like Spotify, YouTube, iTunes, with the loudness normalization. The issue that we have in the industry is the odd tendency to work to a different figure. We’ve got, I don’t know, anywhere between six to eight dBs of difference across these platforms. Well, that’s really hard. Any of us know that are working with staff. I mean, I hear 0.1 of a dB change in level, let alone eight dBs, six dBs. So, it’s quite hard at the moment. There is no norm. We have no standard. We’re trying to discuss it with businesses that don’t want the competition to know what they’re doing. So, it’s very hard to get in and really find out what’s going on. But, I think we’re still in this age that everyone wants it loud. I mean, it’s just getting louder. I did a record the other day and the listening references we’re going to -2 RMS. Hello, that’s pure distortion. People still want it loud. I think this thing of some of these speaker systems – and I’m not going to name them or I’ll get in trouble, I have to bleep it out. But they’re selling them to the public, but what the public don’t realize, they’re actually mono speakers, and they’re not selling them as mono speakers. I’ve had issues with clients who are saying... I’ve had one of the top mix engineer’s tracks in, sounded incredible in my room, and the A&R guy in America said it sounds like a demo. I called him up, “What you playing it on?” He told me. I went out and bought one that weekend, brought it back, listened to it and realized, well, yes, mono. So, we’re back to mono. So, really thinking about that from your point of view is checking your mixes in mono. That’s my mantra over the past couple of years to everyone is, “Make sure.” We’re back to old school. Because, years ago you had to check it in mono because of radio, because of what was going to go onto vinyl. So, really the mono button is a big, use it constantly when you’re mixing. Chal Ravens Let’s just hear a track, shall we? You have done Aphex Twin’s recent album Syro? Mandy Parnell Yes. Chal Ravens Yeah. Did you do the new Collapse EP that just came out as well? Mandy Parnell No. Chal Ravens No. OK. Mandy Parnell Well, I don’t know. Because when I did Syro, we mastered a phenomenal amount of tracks. It wasn’t just them ones. So, I don’t know what he’s been using. But, yeah, I did that one. The most talked about record I think I’ve worked on, maybe. I don’t know. Chal Ravens It was a bit of a marketing campaign for that one, wasn’t it? Mandy Parnell I think with geek people, the most talked about one, if that makes sense. Chal Ravens Well, here we are. Alright. Let’s hear “minipops” then. See how loud it is. (music: Aphex Twin – “minipops 67 (source field mix)” / applause) Chal Ravens You won a Grammy for that. Mandy Parnell No. Chal Ravens What did you know about him? Mandy Parnell Richard used to come to The Exchange all the time to cut his 12"s, and I’d always, at different times, pop into the other studios and maybe offer to make a cup of tea. If any of us were making tea, we’d just make it for the whole studio. You know how it is. So often I’d pop in and make him a cup of tea and have a little chat, say, “Hi, how’s it going?” Listen to a bit of the music and off I’d go. And one of Richard’s friends is an incredible producer called Leila Arab, I don’t know whether any of you know her stuff, really worth checking her out, absolutely. I think one of the most incredible producers out there. And I’d go round and sort of hang out a bit at her house and met Richard there a couple of times. We’d have geek outs because he loves gear, and I remember one time I just got back from the Audio Engineering Society and went around there and we were talking – years ago – talking about different file formats and gear and stuff. So I had the pleasure, very humbling really, to work with Björk on her Biophilia album and actually worked with her on the film, the Biophilia live film that she did. And she recorded it at Ally Pally, and she invited me along to the concert and had an incredible after-show party, at a members’ club. And I ended up in the sort of smoking area and Richard was there and we... Lots of people were there. We had quite an interesting geek out evening. And I was only going to stay an hour because I had a session the next day and I think we walked out and it was light and it was like six o’clock in the morning. But had an incredible evening. A few weeks later he emailed me and said, “I’d really like to maybe collaborate with you on my album.” So that was the start of the journey mastering his album. So when I was involved with the Björk film, I really didn’t know who he was. My partner, Martin, said to me, “Have you seen any of his videos?” So I was like, “No,” and I’d already mastered the album. And I’d really sort of gone in this whole funk area. What had happened when I mastered it, I kept getting up in the morning and pressing play and just wouldn’t really get it. I’d walk away and be a bit like, “I don’t know.” And I’d walk around and just couldn’t sort of sit down and master it.
And I’d worked with this indie band one day and the whole band had come in, and I’d felt really claustrophobic. And it was a really intense session with them, really sort of asking me lots of questions, really sort of not particularly great mixes. And sometimes when you’re working on a particular genre, it needs to fit into a bit of a sonic box, if that makes sense. That’s the best way I can describe it. So I had to work really hard. And I had an assistant and an intern and I said to my intern, “Do you fancy pulling an all-nighter with me?” And he went, “Why?” And I went, “Because I think I’m going master the Aphex album.” So that’s what I did. I went in and I dimmed all the lights and just had the best time. Played it, mastered it, had my own little rave, was dancing around and off I went. And that’s how I mastered the album. But I really had no idea. I had gone on this whole sort of funky... So my partner Martin played me the videos at three o’clock in the morning when I was in the middle of Björk’s Biophilia surround sound film extravaganza that we were doing. That was just an incredible journey. And I just sat there so shocked, just like, “Hey, I really didn’t see it like this.” Anyway, yeah, I was shocked. I just live in my own bubble. I just see the artists that come and work with me. It’s really humbling to work on their art, but nobody’s any different to anyone else, if that makes sense. Some is incredible art, some they’re still on their journey of making it into incredible art. His art is incredible, just like Björk, just like Leila’s. It’s very humbling that I’ve worked with them. Chal Ravens Thank you. It’s definitely one of the funkier Aphex records though for sure. I’m kind of interested in how it’s possible then to master a record really well – clearly, to win awards for it – but without really having the context necessarily, not being in that genre world. Because it almost suggests that there are like hard and fast rules for how to do it, that you could just come at any genre and get it right. Mandy Parnell Yeah, why not? I think the key is, like I said, I spent this sort of time from when I went out to New Orleans, to really understand that music is about emotion. So if you can keep yourself connected with the emotion, then you can work on anything, surely. I often say to people, if you think about when you first started to emotionally connect with music, we didn’t care what we played it on. We didn’t care. I used to have a little mono cassette player, I had my little portable record player. I didn’t care what it sounded like because you were just listening to pure emotion. If you think when you were young and the things that you first heard that just moved you inside, they moved you emotionally. When you’re making music and writing music, it’s pure emotion, it’s coming from your emotional side. So I think for me as an engineer, that’s what I tried to connect with, is the emotion behind the music. What is this piece of music emotionally supposed to do? Is it supposed to make me want to dance, is it supposed to make me want to cry, is it supposed to make me happy, is it supposed to make me go really deep and think it? What is it, what is the emotion it’s trying to tell me? So I often, when I give talks, will play Bob Marley’s “Jammin’.” And it’s just really interesting, if you think about that song. You think how many times you’ve heard that song and on what systems, from good to bad. It makes you do the same thing, you just start... [bobs her head] Everyone does it. If we played it, all of you would just start [bobs her head]. If I hadn’t told you that, we’d all just start going [bobs her head]. It does what it’s intended to do, it doesn’t matter what we play it on. Chal Ravens As you mentioned, you’ve developed quite a close working relationship with Björk over the years. When did you first work with her? Mandy Parnell During the Biophilia project. Chal Ravens Particularly on her recent album, she’s made some quite specific like audio innovations with apps and virtual reality and all kinds of different ways of... things that have required you to learn how to master differently, like multiple formats and so on. We’re going to hear a track in a second. Could you just talk a bit about Biophilia because that record is also an app, and it required you to create lots of different versions of the tracks I think. Mandy Parnell I didn’t really get too involved with the app side. I walked in on the album. It was a fun journey. First of all, I was just going to recut the vinyl, because she wasn’t happy with the vinyl and then it was like, “Can you remaster the album?” Because she wasn’t happy with that. Then it was like, “Can we fly you to Iceland for playback with Björk? Actually can you take a mobile rig with you?” Which was quite challenging. But I did take a rig out there, and Iceland is the most incredible place artistically. All the artists that were there just send all the mastering equipment to the studio for me to have my pick, which was really cool. How cool is that? I mean it was just so cool. I walked there and there was just all this different equipment, sort of mastering spec equipment for me to work with. So I arrived at the studio and I’m waiting for Björk and her assistant arrived. And he set up Pro Tools. I’ve taken my computer system up there, and I think Biophilia I did on CD. So I said, “Well, it’s Pro Tools, where’s the stereo?” He was like, “There is no stereo.” I’m like, “You don’t bounce the stereo?” He’s like, “No.” He was like, “The mixes aren’t finished. Björk wants to work with you to finish them.” And I was like, “Yeah, but I’m not a mix engineer.” [laughs] And he said, “No, you’ll go and work with Björk on finishing them.” So that’s what we did. So I had to learn Pro Tools basically overnight. It was probably [one of] the most challenging experiences of my... at that point in my career, the most challenging. She pushes boundaries, and it’s great. I’m lucky I worked with a lot of artists that push me to push my boundaries. And she is definitely a producer that does that and quite an incredible producer to work with. Chal Ravens So in that situation you actually had the stems, basically, you were looking at the tracks. Mandy Parnell I had the mix. Not even stems. Stems came when we did Vulnicura, we worked on stems. Going forward from there, actually, all the projects I’ve done, it’s been stems after Biophilia. But Biophilia is a mix and she wanted to sort change things, she added more beats and changed vocals. I’ve even got a mix credit on one of them, which I don’t normally ask. I don’t want to be known for mixing, it’s not what I do, but that was very humbling. I didn’t even know that she done that. I was very humbled by that. Chal Ravens What’s it like when you’re working with an artist who is that hands-on at that end of the process? Because I guess a lot of the time you may not even see them necessarily. You just get a message or whatever. Mandy Parnell I think the artists that people really, really respect are very hands-on all the way through. So it’s something that I would advise you, don’t let people convince you to let go of your project or give you bullshit. Hold on to it, it’s your baby, they need to be humbled to come along on the journey with you and take your baby and make it their baby. And if they’re not, then they shouldn’t be part of your team. If there’s any doubt then you shouldn’t be working with them.
That’s how I feel. Chal Ravens What kind of directions did she give you when you were working together? How did she convey what she wanted? Mandy Parnell Björk sees things very visually with her sound, so she will explain things in visual manners. She comps [composites] all her own vocals, she’ll change lots inside the mix. I always joke, we’ll start and I’ll be at the controls and then within about an hour I’m over here and she’s at the controls and I’m sort of sitting at the side of her. [laughs] And then she’d finish what she wants to do and then she’ll get up and I can get back on the controls and then off we go again. I’ll go over there. So she is very, very hands-on and very descriptive and understands sound very well, but won’t talk about it in frequencies, which is fine. Artists don’t need to do that. I don’t need her to do that. My job is to interpret what she’s describing and take it to where she wants it. Chal Ravens What kind of descriptions? Mandy Parnell I wish I could remember, but one of them she was like, “Imagine your ancestors at a rave around a campfire, dancing,” which is really descriptive. [Matthew] Herbert does the same, I remember Herbert saying to me, “Think [that] you’re at an R&B club that’s underwater, that’s what I want it to sound like.” It’s very descriptive. You totally get what sound they’re looking for. Just because they won’t describe it in the sense of what equipment to use and what frequency range, all of us can imagine what them sounds are like. So yeah, it’s quite fun to work with artists that give you these sort of visual guides. Chal Ravens Let’s hear a bit of a Biophilia track. Mandy Parnell It’s my favorite. Chal Ravens This is “Virus.” (music: Björk – “Virus” / applause) Mandy Parnell Do you guys know the apps, have any of you explored the apps? You really should check them out. I mean it’s quite incredible what she’s done with that because it was about teaching music and nature. It’s quite an incredible journey. Some of the Nordic countries have actually made her apps the national curriculum for teaching music in primary schools. And when she toured Biophilia, and she still does it, she has a whole mobile rig. In between gigs, they will go into schools and she will do workshops and get the kids to play with the apps and teach them. And it was a tool to actually teach music, and it’s quite incredible what she did with this project. I mean it was really such a gift for me to be involved with it. Check them out. Chal Ravens I could tell that you were enjoying listening to it again. Mandy Parnell It brought tears to my eyes. She brings tears to my eyes a lot working with her. Chal Ravens I was wondering if, in general, you find that after listening to the same tracks thousands of times in a row, that the albums that you work on you then can’t really listen to you afterwards. Mandy Parnell Some albums. It’s normally just two or three, maybe four months. The big one for me was the Sigur Rós album, the brackets one. I think that’s the first time I ever was nominated for a Grammy, but I didn’t find out during, I only found out a few years ago that it was nominated. [laughs] I mean I’m not really into all that side of things, a bit like Aphex, “What is a Grammy?” That album I really couldn’t listen to, that was the craziest journey of mastering. It was eight tracks, and we were in the mastering room for five days, overdubbed vocals, lots of editing, and they’d been somewhere else and mastered it and really didn’t like it. And so when they came to The Exchange to work with me on it, everyone was very, very tense. It was a big album. They knew it was going to be a big album. We had the record company from the UK, the record company from America, managers, producer, the whole band. I mean it was an intense session. All from reel-to-reel tape. The tape was not particularly stable when it came to the lineup of the tones. So I was having to do a lot of stuff by ear. And every change, if I changed one EQ, one thing, because they was so worried about it, and they knew we had to get it right, I would have to rewind back to the beginning of the track and we’d have to listen to the whole track again. And you know how long the tracks are. It was a very, very intense session. So that album I really couldn’t listen to for, I’d say best part of 10 years. It really messed with my psychology and my head of taking me back to that sort of stress and having to sort of keep control. Because it’s hard. If you imagine all them people coming in and out of the room, and you’ve got to focus, and you’re having to listen to one change and keep [that] thought about where I emotionally intended to go with the track, but wasn’t able just to free flow and do my thing. It was quite a quite an experience. But [it’s an] incredible album, I love it. But they were so, so cool. We just wanted to tweak one song on the album, so eight tracks, just wanted to go back and tweak one song. And if you know the album there’s a 30 second gap in between A and B side, which I argued very hard and they were like, “No, that’s how it’s going to be.” Now when I listen to it, it works but at the time I thought this was crazy because of course we were in [a] DJ-tastic [era] of no gaps and crossfades and whatever. So they went off to Camden while I set the reel-to-reel back up in the morning, and they came back, and some of you might have read, if you geeked out on me, I mean I don’t talk about it a lot, but I am quite crazy with some of the stuff I do. And I work with crystals sometimes in the room with me. So they went out and said that my crystals were very feminine, and they bought me a crystal that was very masculine, that I still work with in my studio, and then yeah, we remastered that track. But yeah, that’s my crazy other science, and when we talk about me exploring theories, I did a lot of exploring of crystals and resonant frequencies. And when I did the Sigur Rós album, the producer kept joking with me about the crystal thing and I was getting a bit... “Why is he like this with me?” I was getting touchy about it. And then when we did the playback session with everyone in there and we were all going around on the floor he said to me, “I’ve recorded a whole album of resonant frequencies of crystals.” I said, “Cool. See you.” Chal Ravens There is sometimes a lot of confusion about what can and can’t actually be done in the mastering studio, for instance, I’ve heard that it’s not possible to cut bass in stereo. That set off a discussion yesterday outside. What are some of the common misconceptions about the possibilities? What are the real rules? Mandy Parnell You can cut bass [in stereo], but we have to mono part of it and the cut will be quiet. So you’re compromising level for some of the things that you do. Phase is a problem, what happens is you’re asking the cutterhead, which is a physical thing and it’s got one stylus, so you imagine it’s cutting left and right, so it’s pushing down on the stylus to make the left-right groove and it’s on the vertical. So what happens is it causes a sausaging effect, the phase, because you’re asking this thing to do something very extreme. So it will cause a jumping record. It’s quite a simple thing if you think about what it is trying to do. If we look on a record, bass is the sort of big swell groove if you just look on a record with your naked eye. If you just look on a record with your naked eye. Top end and mid-range is more... top end will be the very short little grooves. So it’s very much like what we study with sound. Snare drums, if they’re very sharp will cause a kinky groove which could cut, so if it’s very extreme and not compressed very well it could cause a jumping record if we’re trying to cut now. So it’s just thinking about what physically is going on. So it’s not that we can’t cut it, it just means you might not get a banging 12" out of it. If that’s what you’re trying to do, you want a banging 12", then don’t put phase on your bass because you’re not going to get it. And even though we can mono it, you can imagine what’s going to happen. It’s going to cancel out. You’re going to lose some of your frequency response. Yeah. Check things, mono. The mono button is your best friend. It’s my best friend. It’s your best friend. Chal Ravens I think maybe later on, there will be an opportunity to ask some more specific questions about how to get your records ready for mastering, that kind of thing. I just wanted to finish with maybe a quick question about how changes in technology more recently are changing how you do your work, because we’ve obviously now moved from physical formats to downloads, and mainly streaming now, which seems to give you a lot more work to do. Is that right? Mandy Parnell Yeah. There’s a great tool out there that might help all of you understand this a bit better. It’s by a company called NUGEN Audio, and it’s called MasterCheck. Now, what these guys have done... They’ve gone in and basically backward engineered all the streaming platforms, digital radio, and you can play your tracks and other tracks through it, and see what it’s going to sound like through these things. Like I said, the proper means... We’re delivering to those different formats. Years ago, we delivered a master disc to the factory, and we delivered a CD master. So we knew what we were getting coming back. Now we don’t. People don’t understand that YouTube have two ingest centers, and they both sound different. How many people know that? One of them sounds better than the other. They’re not using the same codecs that are going out there. So it’s just simple little things about understanding what you’re going to. So what’s happened in my role is, I say to teams I’m working with, “Alright, we’ll master it like this. But if it goes out there and it gets 20 of these platforms and it’s not working, let’s recall and let’s tweak it maybe for that platform.” The problem is loads of different codecs. They all want different things. We’re not mastering to one particular thing, so we send the high-res WAV. Now, some of the digital distribution companies are really dodgy. The bigger ones are better, but some of the smaller ones haven’t... because they’ve programmed their own ingests. They’re doing some very bad practices. So they’ll do things ... We might send out a 96k, 24-bit file. They’ll do the sample rate conversion. They might just go from 24-bit to 16-bit and drop it. Now, why would we want them to do that? That’s my job. So I’ll deliver 96k, 24-bit; 48k, 24-bit; 44.1, 24-bit; 44.1, 16-bit. So I’ll deliver all of them, but of course, record companies might not understand what they’re getting, and they’ll just send something out. I’ve had some really horrific stuff happen where I’ve sent files to a record company. The girl in the office pulled it into her iTunes. She decided she needed to make an audio CD, burned an audio CD, imported the files back in to send to her producer for him to check, and that’s what was going off to digital distribution, and she had MasterCheck on, which brought it down 6dBs. So the producer came back and was like, “Well, I can understand you bringing my mix down a little bit. It was a bit hot. But 6dB seems extreme.” Luckily, he emailed me, because some people would just go, “Oh, shit mastering engineer.” But he actually emailed me. And I went back and I went, “Well, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I made it louder than your mix. Give me your number.” And we got on a call, and he sent over the files he had, and it took me a day to get to the bottom of what had happened. So we really need to communicate, because we don’t have a solid format to deliver to, and like I said, it can go into people’s hands that don’t know what they’re doing, or the smaller distributions that have some not very good practices at the moment. So it’s about really being open and discussing and not blaming the team, but working with the team, because we’re a team. And like I said earlier, if somebody’s making you feel uncomfortable in the team, they shouldn’t be in your team. Chal Ravens I feel like we might have a few questions. Does anybody have a question for Mandy? Yeah, yeah. Oh, god. OK. Wow. I thought this would happen. Audience Member Hello. Mandy Parnell Hello. Audience Member Thanks a lot for the lecture. It was very useful, and Biophilia is one of my favorite albums of all time, so thanks a lot. And I wanted to ask you, what is your usual mastering chain, and if you use only hardware, or also digital meter, or at what point do you add the digital part of the processing? Mandy Parnell It really depends on the project. So my setup is, I have a playback computer system. Most of the time, I’ll play back on SADiE, which is a mastering software. Sometimes I might play back on Logic or Pro Tools. It really depends what I hear off of SADiE. If I’m not sure... Sometimes with Pro Tools, if there’s inter-sample clipping in the file, when I play it back on SADiE, I might hear a funny sort of... It’s not even distortion. It just does something in the mid-range. And so maybe I’ll play it off Pro Tools to see whether that cleans it up. So I have a playback system come through the Prism converters, ADA-8, generally into an EQ. So inwards connection. It’s very rare. There’s only four in the world of this particular EQ. Often, I might go into a valve compressor-limiters, so the Esoteric Audio Research, and their copies of the Fairchild ... I actually prefer them to the Fairchilds. All the Fairchilds out there now are very old. And the top end is a bit rounded off for me. The guy that makes this stuff is very big in the hi-fi world, and in fact helped teach me to cut records many years ago. We had a lot of his equipment at The Exchange. So I got into them, valve limiter-compressors. Coming to my boards, I have an EMI transfer console, mastering console. Again, quite a rare piece of equipment. In there, I have level, EQ, compressor, filters. It comes out of there, back into Prism ADA-8, to convert it back to digital. Out of there, I go into L2 ultra maximizer hardware. TC Electronics 6000 for brickwall limiting. Then I capture back in with Sequoia, which is another mastering software whose company is really close by to here. Bless them, they’re an incredible team of people, like the SADiE guys. Then it comes back out through another ADA-8 to my monitors. So I have ATC-100s with a sub. Still waiting for them to bring another sub, ‘cause I want to try it with two subs. I’ve been really busy and really hard to get them up there and set it up. To set a sub up takes a bit of maneuvering. It’s a big beast of a thing. So digital stuff... Sometimes I will use the digital stuff at the beginning if the mix isn’t where it needs to be and I need to get in there and beef it up, or be clinical like a doctor with some frequencies. Sometimes I’ll do it at the end. What’s been happening more recently is I’ve been delivering two lots of masters, because of some of this streaming stuff, just to see where we go with it. Because, like I said, everyone still wants it loud. But I know we’re going to get to a point where it’s going to have to be quieter. So I’m delivering a quieter one and then putting another limiter on inside Sequoia. Often, I like the FabFilter limiter. It’s probably one of the more transparent ones and easy to get level out of. I don’t have to work too hard at it. I find a problem for me with a lot of digital things – bearing in mind that I grew up with tape to vinyl, so really learn a lot about not using eyes, but ears – is that I start thinking too much about what I’m seeing. So I’m often having to do stuff and then turn my chair around and listen, and move back and look at it. So, yeah. I’ll do EQ on there. Like Feist’s last album, we did a lot inside Sequoia with EQ, riding things, editing, just all getting in and doing lots of small, little tweaks because of the process of how they recorded and mixed it, because it was very live and we just needed to do a lot of rides and stuff with EQ, just matching different sections up. So, yeah. I can unplug things, I can plug other things in. I have lots of other tools around, but that’s my basic tool set, if you like. Mono button is my best friend. Really, mono button is my best friend. And the key is, I think, and this is a really interesting one for you guys to think about, is really being in control of your monitor setup. So I have a monitor controller, but you can just get a knob. But really, having specific settings. I’ve got marks on my monitor to control that this is where I always work to. I work here. This is my gauge of how loud something is. Alright, it’s calibrated, it’s measured. I’ll work here, because you get used to it. You know how loud something should sound. And then I have a dim button and I have a quiet setting, I have a mid setting, I have a loud setting. So I have that for digital mastering, and then I have the same for vinyl mastering, and then I have the same for doing cinematic mastering. So, yeah. Being in control of your monitor levels. And then the other thing when it comes to this loud stuff is really think about all the old-school engineers that have gone to digital, and some of you might have watched the guys on Mix with the Masters. But a lot of them that came from working on a board, when you talk to them, they’re still working to them standards in respects to levels, if that makes sense. So what I say to people, in the sense of references – ’cause it’s really hard, you don’t have access to music that isn’t really overlimited and really loud – is go back to some of the classic albums. Get the first CD release, because a lot of them were just one-to-one transfers of the tape, the reel-to-reel tape. So that will give you a gauge of where the board mixes were. When it comes to new music, I’ll often say, bring it down 6dBs and use that as your references, because often, I’ll be adding in the region of 6dB gain when I’m mastering. So that way, you’re not going to be slamming your mixes. And then when it gets to me, I’m going to go, “What the fuck are you doing?” [laughs] I’ve got no headroom to do anything. And, of course, when you turn it down, your mix might fall apart, depending on how you’ve mixed it. So if you start with your references 6dB down, I think you’re going to end up with a better mix. It’s going to give more space for mastering. Audience Member Hi. Mandy Parnell Hi. Audience Member How do you... I’m wondering if you have tricks if you happen to lose perspective on what you’re mastering. Mandy Parnell Yes. Play something else that’s not necessarily in the same genre. Audience Member So not references, but just something... Mandy Parnell Just something completely different. Say if I’m doing something really hard and upbeat, I might go play a folk song. Or if I’m doing a folk song and I lose it, I might go play a punk song. Go outside. When your ears are tired, oxygen is the best thing for you. Audience Member Do you have a limit to how long you work on something in intervals or your ears get tired? Mandy Parnell Well, I do. When I work with an assistant, I’ll master the track, and often because I’m training them on critical listening... Like I said, when I take on an assistant for the first year, they basically sit there and listen. They don’t touch a button. Maybe even up to two years. Don’t touch a button. They might do production parts on computers or bounce out WAV files or listen to stuff, but they won’t sit on my board and touch my board. They need their ears to start learning. But what I’ll do is I’ll get them to do the critical listening. So they will record the track on headphones after I’ve mastered it. So I’ll walk out of the room then. When I did the Biophilia album, we had a very tight deadline, and of course, I was... It’s not my place to talk to the artist and put the artist under pressure about what we’re doing and what the timeframes are. My role, especially when you’re working with an artist-producer, is to be very gentle with them, because they’re producing themselves and it’s a big journey to get a record finished. But I worked one all-nighter. I worked two days basically with an all-nighter on the trot. Arriving in a studio 11 in the morning and leaving the next night at 10 o’clock to meet the deadline, ‘cause I need to get it back to London, run all the production parts for it to hit its release date for Japan, which was really important. So going outside. Eating. Brain foods, nuts, bananas. Protein only. Not too much coffee. Lots of water. Yoga exercises are great. There’s some great exercises for your lymphatic system as well that you can see online, to clear your lymphatic system. Your lymphatic system at the tops are clearing your ears. But really going out and having breaks. The minute you think you’re getting tired, get outside. Oxygen is the best thing. Sit outside. Another thing that really happens, I discovered a few years ago, is as you go through your journey, we’re very prone to vitamin D deficiency, which affects our hearing. So make sure you get outside. So it’s really hard to... There’s vitamin D supplements, but they’re not particularly great at raising levels. So one of the doctors said to me, go outside and just expose your forearms. Every time you walk outside, just have your forearms exposed. So something to think about, because we tend to be better through later in the day, more artistic when the rest of the world is sleeping. The energies are very different. Often when you speak to artist, their best work is coming later in the day when the rest of the world has gone to sleep. So really being aware, when you’re outside, get as much vitamin D. But some of the yoga... energize and exercises. I’m working with a yoga instructor at the moment. There’s some great stuff to just get your energy up. But outside... Every time you think you’re tired, play something else. And don’t listen loud. When you sit with some of the top mix engineers, it’s not loud.
Can we play a track? I’ll show them. Chal Ravens Of what? Of just... Mandy Parnell Any one, and I’ll just show the reference. But what you should be doing from a mix point of view. Chal Ravens Should I put the Aphex one back on, maybe? Mandy Parnell Yeah, doesn’t matter. [Demonstrates reference volume for mastering] (music: Aphex Twin – “minipops 67 (source field mix)”) Mandy Parnell The best mix engineers that I’ve sat behind, they don’t mix loud. They mix quiet ‘cause you’ll shoot your ears out. Chal Ravens Another one? Audience Member Hi. Thank you so much again, it was very informative. But I was just curious, ‘cause you mentioned something about riding different... maybe riding EQs or something in masters. And I was just wondering, does automation play a role? Or will you ride a compressor or EQs typically, or do you just try to set static settings, and just leave it? Mandy Parnell Ideally, I’d like static settings. But sometimes, especially now, my job has changed so much from when I started. When I started, you got the reel-to-reel. You just needed to transfer it, and you weren’t at liberty to change things, really. You’d just do very minimal things, and then you’d transfer it. But now it’s whatever it takes, because sometimes, like I said, people are in their bedrooms. They’re not hearing stuff well. They might not have a great convertor, so the convertor is playing something when it comes to mid-range, and not hearing their compressing settings. So I have to ride things a lot more. I just had a client in [unintelligible]. We had to edit between sections because he’d put a limiter on his mix bus, which sounded great for most of the stuff, but when the choruses came in, it was just too much. And we had to really get in there and mess around and tweak it to keep the level of the drums, in a sense, and the vocals, and the sonic picture that his limiter was coming, was bringing to the table. So we had to work, editing between the sections. So what I often say to young producers when it comes to this mixing into a limiter, “Don’t do it. Don’t do it.” Audience Member Like, just don’t have a limiter on your master while you’re mixing? Mandy Parnell Yeah, because the thing is, you’re only doing that to get into this loudness thing. That’s the only reason. And what happens when you take it off to send to mastering, your mix falls apart. And the amount of times I sit there with a mix, and I’m like... And it’s happened with some very big teams, I’m not going to mention. But extremely big teams that cost me a lot of time and a lot of emotion, a lot of energy. The mix will fall apart. And maybe your drums come forward and your vocal goes back. So what I say is, set up another bus. Set up another bus that’s like your mix bus, and then have your limiter on another bus, and just flick it in and out. But don’t mix to it, because even though some of these guys might do that, they’re going to have a lot more experience generally than you with understanding what’s happening there. So I wouldn’t advise it, because it changes your sonic picture a lot. So often what I’m having to do is say to young artists, “OK. We need to set up another bus so that we can turn the output down, but I need your limiter on there, because it’s the glue to your mix.” And often, you’re clipping it, which is going to give a very different sound. Often you’re feeding into it too much, you’re getting louder, louder, louder, and to get your mix to breathe and do what it wants to do... See, you’re clipping the limiter. And then when you take it off, so many things change. So I need a fader to bring it down afterwards.

Pusha T
Born in the Bronx and raised in Virginia Beach, Terrence LeVarr Thornton, better known as Pusha T, is one of the most influential rappers alive. Thornton began his music career in 1992 when he and his brother No Malice formed rap duo Clipse. Their albums Lord Willin’ (2002) and Hell Hath No Fury (2006), both of which were produced by the Neptunes, are accepted masterworks of the genre, each elevating the sonic scope and lyricism of street rap. Together they founded Re-Up Records and released a handful of mixtapes, but eventually parted ways to pursue solo careers on the heels of their third studio album, 2009’s ’Til the Casket Drops. Since signing to Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music in 2010, Thornton has released three studio albums on G.O.O.D. Music and Def Jam Recordings. His 2018 album Daytona, which was produced exclusively by Kanye West, is arguably his strongest and most cohesive effort yet.
In his public lecture at RBMA Berlin 2018, Pusha T discussed working with Kanye West, rap’s competitive spirit, making Daytona, heading up G.O.O.D. Music and the early days of the Clipse in Virginia Beach.
Hosted by Anupa Mistry Welcome to a conversation with Pusha T at Kino International. Our guest today is often referred to as your favorite rapper’s favorite rapper. But as I’m sure we’ll get into, he’s also your favorite producer’s favorite rapper. After honing his sound as one half of the Clipse with his brother, No Malice, he embarked on a radical solo career at the top of the aughts, and in 2015, became the president of the marquee rap label, G.O.O.D. Music. Earlier this year, he released his sleek and precise third album, Daytona, to widespread critical acclaim. Please welcome Pusha T. [applause] Pusha T How are you guys doing? Anupa Mistry They seem excited. Pusha T I’m happy. Let’s do it. Anupa Mistry So we are here in Berlin. 4,228 miles from Virginia Beach, according to Google Maps. And that’s where you were raised and where you became Pusha T. What can you tell us about where you grew up and how it might be culturally distinct from other big cities in America that people might feel like they know more about? Pusha T Well, I’d have to say that Virginia Beach isn’t really a big city, it’s not. And I think that’s what makes it so special about everything that’s came out of there. It’s a military town, actually. So when it came to musical influences, I always knew about what was going on in southern hip-hop, Bay Area hip-hop. Of course, New York. New York was a heavy influence in Virginia at the time. It was just a small town with a lot of different influences, and I would probably base that on the military first. Anupa Mistry You mentioned New York, the New York influence. We know you’re a really avid rap fan. You’ve spoken about channeling Biggie Smalls on Hell Hath No Fury, which is the Clipse’s third record. And you’ve kind of talked about channeling the Purple Tape energy for Daytona, that’s Raekwon’s Only Built 4 Cuban Linxs.... Pusha T Yeah. Anupa Mistry What was it about those iconic records that kind of shaped your world view, or changed your world view as a young listener? Pusha T I believe that both of those albums... Anupa Mistry Sorry, which Biggie album, to clarify? Pusha T Definitely Life After Death. Living in Virginia at that time, you gotta think about it, it’s a military town. It’s also a college town. Norfolk State University, Hampton University, ODU, a little further out, Virginia State. Colleges everywhere. And during this time, the New Yorkers flooded our area, super flooded our area. The drug culture was super heavy. It was really, really a big thing at the time. So just living through that and actually, I actually seen Big in a club. Raekwon was friends with some of my friends. So when these albums hit, it was like chaos through the town. You had everybody in Virginia at the time talking like they had adopted all of this slang of like Wu-Tang [Clan] and you just saw the Bad Boy influence super heavy. And these guys were great. These guys were great. Living through that time, seeing it, it had a major impact on me. Anupa Mistry So you and your brother started rapping together around ’92-ish? Those records had already come out, is what I’m trying to say. Pusha T No, no. My brother was always rapping. I wasn’t rapping. My brother is five years older than me. When he was in middle school, junior high school, he was part of a rap group that the principal called a gang. And it was a duo. It was a group of guys who were all duos, and the producer and DJ for everybody was Timbaland. As far as I can remember... Like I said, he’s five years older than me. So to get his attention as a kid, I would rip up his rap book. I’d kick his rap book. I’d take his rap book, anything to get his attention. He’d fight me, beat me up, I knew it, but I knew that I could get him that way. And this is like... Man, if he’s anywhere between 7th and 9th grade, then what am I, eight? Yeah, like eight. I’m eight, he’s 13. So I didn’t start rapping until probably ’93, maybe even later than that. I graduated in ’95. I graduated in ’95, maybe ’94 or so. Because it wasn’t even... I just remember it not being cool to say that you were rapping. When I was growing up, I remember watching my brother and them be into it, and then when my generation sort of came it was like, “You rap? Get outta here. You better go get on the block. Go get some money or something like that.” But it definitely wasn’t about rap at the time. I had friends who were in the music industry. And I told you Timbaland was the DJ for my brother and those guys. He lived up the street one way. Pharrell [and] Chad [Hugo] lived up the street a mile away. I wasn’t rapping when I knew them. It was just something in the water, who knows. It’s like the weirdest story ever to know how close in proximity we all lived. And we all knew each other. It’s crazy. Anupa Mistry So then, what changed? When did you start thinking rapping could be cool? Pusha T Teddy Riley, producer of New Jack Swing, everything great in R&B during the ’90s. He moved to Virginia Beach. He actually moved next door to Pharrell’s high school. They had a talent show, Pharrell and the Neptunes, N.E.R.D, was discovered. Again, we were all friends at this time. And he was just doing work. Pharrell was writing little parts to “Rump Shaker” and doing SWV things. And I’m like, “This is like a business.” Again, I was like, “Isn’t this for the guys who are on TV? This ain’t for us.” Pharrell really, really drove in the fact of like, “Look man, this thing can happen. It can really happen.” Just seeing the artists that were coming down at the time was promising enough. Like I said, it’s Teddy Riley, everybody was coming through that studio. Future Records, Jay-Z and Michael Jackson, everybody. I was still in school. I was skipping school, going to Chad’s house. And everybody would be over at Chad’s house and they were like writing records and stuff, and I would just be there listening. And I was like, “Man, I’m going to write me a rap today.” The bar was pretty much set, though. I was always into the music. I always knew what was cool in regards to what was cool to say. I could tell the difference. My brother was the perfect teacher for me. I was young. I was like a kid and telling my brother, “Hey, MC Hammer is like the best rapper ever, you gotta see this guy.” And he’d be like, “No, man. He’s a great entertainer. Let me show you what a rapper does.” He sort of gave me that type of breakdown. It was pre-school for rap. Anupa Mistry Well that actually brings me to this really interesting point, which is I think that you have become known as carrying on a specific rap tradition, and I’m wondering if early Clipse had an aesthetic goal in mind similar to what you might have now? Pusha T Making music was just so fun with early Clipse. Just imagine discovering the music business with your friends, care-free, all day. Me and Pharrell talk every morning from nine in the morning already. So it’s nine in the morning, we’re talking, by 12, we’re together on bikes. Bikes turn to cars. Studio. I don’t even know if it was an aesthetic. I don’t know. It was competitive. We would work all day. And this is the reason why I don’t know how to work in studios now. Now, I still don’t know how to pull all-nighters. Guys being there with their Hennessy and stuff and they do like this whole ritual. Weed, Hennessy, three in the morning, five. “Look at me, I’m up. Ah!” [laughter] OK. I don’t know how to do that. I still don’t know how to do that now. But it’s because of the way we were taught, the way I was taught. We’d work, nine, 12 in the morning to ten at night, go eat, and then we’d go to the club. And we’d go to the club simply to hear and watch people and how they reacted to the music. We’d go there, we’d listen, we’d watch, and the next night or the next morning, Pharrell would be like, “Yo man, I’m going to kill the ‘[It’s All About the] Benjamins,’ I’m going to kill that.” Or whatever record was out. And that was the motivation. We were students. We were students of people, students of the music, students of just energy and reaction. We were trying to harness all those things. I don’t even know what the aesthetic was. I know one thing. When I got with the Neptunes and we really found our sound when Lord Willin’ hit, I had stopped listening to muddy, hardcore beats. I was like, “Wait a minute, beats can be like bright and hard and angry at the same time.” But they they still had colors to them. One time, hardcore hip-hop was just like muddy, dark. It didn’t have a lot of dimension to it. The Neptunes took me fully out of that. Anupa Mistry Do you remember the first time you heard a Clipse song go off in the club? Pusha T I really don’t. I can say this though. I do remember watching the maturation of “Grindin’”. “Grindin’” was the Clipse’s first record, and I do remember putting that record out. I felt like every drug dealer in the United States was booking the Clipse for every $2,000 show ever. [laughter] We were just so excited. We was like, “Oh, wait a minute,” not knowing that our base is really keying in on us right now. We were taking that for granted. And we did these shows. And we did these shows for like nine months. And I remember at the end of that ninth month, it was like “Grindin’” was a phenomenon. The video had just hit. People were doing the dances that the little girls were doing from around our way. It was definitely the lunch table beat of every cafeteria. The streets had spoken. The streets really had just spoken, and they understood. They understood exactly what we were talking about. It was a hard sell initially, because people were like, “‘Four and a half will get you in the game’? What is all this?” [They were] shooing us off. But then you’d have this guy who’s like in the streets, and he’d be like, “OK. Wait a minute. What’d you just say? They’re saying that? OK. And y’all are from Virginia? Wait a minute, this is different.” And the beat, this chaotic beat with only like seven sounds in it. What is this? It was a lot of different things that just came together and made a great record. Anupa Mistry I think one of the things that I find really interesting is that Clipse came out and had this credibility, and then merging my two worlds. I was an early Clipse fan, but I really liked boy bands. And then you put out a track with Justin Timberlake. Pusha T Score. [laughter] Anupa Mistry I loved R&B. You put out a track with Kelis. Pusha T Score. [laughter] Anupa Mistry All of that was my shit. But you know, I think we have to keep in mind that those worlds were really divided at that time. Pusha T Shout out to Neptunes. They were the darling producers. They were super producers. They owned, what was it 49 or 51%, Shiv? They owned 51% of the charts at that time. So 51% of the charts, that got to be street records and that got to be pop records. Anupa Mistry But did you have any apprehension about doing those records? Pusha T No. I mean, we never had apprehension because we were just in love with the process of it and in love with the music we were creating. We saw the vision, but people didn’t see the vision. Just to go back to “Grindin’” for a second, think about all the records that were out at that time. Pharrell singing on the hook, he’s with Nelly, he got the voice down to science at this point. He gives me a record and says, “This is your single,” and he’s not doing that. Do you know what the record labels looked at me like? They were like, “Wait a minute. How dare you? You’re playing with us. You’re toying with us.” And of course we proved them wrong with that one. It wasn’t scary, we just knew how to stay true to ourselves and people wanted that. Luckily, you were into boy bands. Justin wanted to be a solo artist. He wanted this credibility. It was like, “Oh man, do a record with the Clipse.” That wasn’t supposed to necessarily happen, but people saw it. Anupa Mistry I think a different type of artist would maybe get clowned for doing something like that. That didn’t happen with the Clipse. Pusha T Yeah, but the records were hot. This wasn’t like a compromise. I didn’t have to rhyme about rainbows or nothing. [laughter] Everybody wanted a piece of the streets. Everybody wanted the edge. That’s what they wanted at the time. Anupa Mistry We can talk a little bit more about the Clipse if you want, but I was... Pusha T Let’s do it. Anupa Mistry OK. You want to? Pusha T Yeah, I love the Clipse. [laughter] Anupa Mistry So after “Grindin’” hits, after you’re on a Justin Timberlake track, how are you starting to think about what the Clipse project is and the narrative that you want to put out into the world? Did the vision start to be more defined? Earlier you were talking about being competitive and having fun. Pusha T Listen, the Clipse were like mixtape artists that could not ever get on a mixtape, because we weren’t from New York. For me, the Clipse, we were always trying to accomplish our street, mixtape rap goals. We just got this guy who goes back and forth with us with hooks and stuff and gives us melody where we need it. And Chad, he likes to play chords, and he meshed all that with these street narratives. No, the Clipse was always uncompromised. Always. It was never about compromising anything for us. It was like, “If you want to be down with us, you can be down with us.” We only knew street hip-hop. At this time, it was like street hip-hop was what ran everything. Anupa Mistry It’s been almost ten years since ’Til the Casket Dropped came out. Pusha T Yeah. Anupa Mistry 2009... Looking back, did you have a sense that that was going to be as long of a hiatus as it has turned out to be? Pusha T Well, I knew that my brother didn’t want to rap anymore. He told me about it on tour. We were overseas and he was like, “Hey, man, I don’t really want to rap anymore. I sort of want to do the solo thing. And I wrote a book. Here, take it.” He was like, “Read it.” Anupa Mistry What were your thoughts? Pusha T I was like, “Oh you gonna write a book? I can’t write a book. You just want to be better than me.” [laughter] I couldn’t believe it, but he gave me a lot of time to think about it. He was like, “Man, you want to do your solo career anyway. You should go ahead. You should go for it because right now, I’m just not on that wave. I’m not on that wave right now.” We’re going through a lot. We’re talking about ’09, April ’09. Everybody who we came into the music industry with, outside of my rap friends, were indicted on a drug conspiracy. It was a drug conspiracy, and everybody got from ten to 34 years. For me, of course it was a terrible blow. For my brother, I feel like – and I’m not trying to speak for him – but I think he saw things a little differently. His kids would go to bible study with their kids. He saw the effects in a different way than I saw it. If you ask me, through the kids. And he was not with it. Anupa Mistry Did you see the shift happening at all? Pusha T Yeah. My brother’s a very... We’ve always called him the voice of reason, anyway. He’s very shrewd, very direct, the voice of reason, [a] no nonsense type of person. When things got shaky with the whole prison situation, indictments, so on and so forth, I could just tell. We made it through it, but again, he’s watching the effects daily through children. His kids, friends with my God kids, and so on and so forth. Money can’t patch it up. They can come over and stay the night, but they do go back home and things are different. I feel like he was over it at that point, and that’s really just what it was. Anupa Mistry Were you ready to go solo when he broke that news to you? Pusha T I don’t know. I just knew it was something that we couldn’t stop. I just couldn’t stop. I’m like, “Man, I feel I’m nice. I think I’m good.” [laughs] He sprung this on me. There were internet rumblings of, “What if Pusha T was solo?” And you got the Re-Up Gang mixtapes, where it was four of us and everybody gets a verse and people were picking their favorites. I don’t feel like I had a choice. I have management. I got management. I got friends that are relying and living off of what it is that I do. It was just, “That’s the next step, let’s go.” Ironically, I think I was like in Sweden and [Kanye West] called, he was like, “Hey, man, want to come to Hawaii and work on this album with me?” I was like, “Sure.” And that’s how I got like all my [air miles]. I’m a million miler, right? So I got all of these miles because I kept flying from like Hawaii to Sweden, Hawaii... I was on tour in Europe at the time when my brother told me this. So when [Kanye] asked me to come, I was like, ‘OK. Boom. If I have three days off, I’ll just fly out there.’ And then he’d fly me out there, fly me back, fly me out there, fly me back. This happened like a trillion times. Anupa Mistry Do you have a jet lag miracle cure or something? Pusha T Listen, what’s that? Jet lag? Who deals with that? That’s nothing. Anupa Mistry So you went out to Hawaii, you delivered two really incredible appearances on Kanye’s record. Pusha T Yeah. Anupa Mistry “So Appalled” and “Runaway.” And you’re talking about, maybe not being unsure about going out solo, but you’ve got this thing of probably... Did you feel like you had to prove yourself? Are we hearing some of that tension or struggle on those records? Pusha T You’re definitely hearing somebody cracking the whip. Ye was like nuts. I don’t even know him either at this time, I don’t know him well. I know him in passing, met him in the studio a couple times. I believe it was earlier that year or maybe the year before, Don C’s birthday gift to Ye was the Clipse coming to perform Hell Hath No Fury in its entirety at the Louis Vuitton store in New York. It was like an opening or something. [laughter] Anupa Mistry I love that you did birthday parties. [laughter] Pusha T Yeah, a couple bar mitzvahs. I do them. [laughter] So, Ye was a heavy, heavy Clipse fan. Heavy, heavy Hell Hath No Fury fan, heavy. Loved the “Freedom” verse, loved the “Freedom” verse from ’Til the Casket Drops. He was just like, “Hey, come work.” And I came out there. I never worked with him before. Totally different work environment than what I’m used to with Pharrell and Chad. Anupa Mistry What was different, specifically? Pusha T First of all, you walk in the studio and it’s like a sign that says, “No phones, no cameras, no computers, no laptops. Everything Mobb Deep, everything Wu-tang, everything Jay-Z.” And it was just like closed off and very focused. Working with Pharrell and Chad it’s like, you got the video game on, you got the TV on, we listen to everything. That might spark something, “Hey, Chad, go sample that sound that’s in the video game. Get that.” You’re taking influence from everywhere. And Ye’s just laser focused. It’s musicians around, it’s great people just around. RZA comes through with a sample pack. Hey! You know. I’m like, “That’s RZA. I met Rae before. I ain’t never seen you, guy.” Anupa Mistry You’re talking about Kanye being a really big fan of yours, but what drew you to him as a collaborator? Was it just the promise of Hawaii or...? Pusha T Well, no. Ye, production-wise, has always been top-notch to me. He heightened, to me, Hov’s [Jay-Z] greatness. Definitely. That marriage was like... Hov was always my favorite rapper, so just as a rapper I’m like, “OK, he’s like the greatest rapper. Cool.” Lyrically, you just, I’m keyed in, I’m listening to him, and then he gets with Ye and these records and it’s like, “Wait a minute, that’s even intensified.” So, I was always like, “OK. Wait a minute. This guy’s great.” You know, Graduation hit. “Can’t Tell Me Nothing” was my every day, every night, every minute song. He was just always innovating. Always innovating. So it was a no brainer. It was like, “I’m going.” Anupa Mistry You talked a bit about kind of the work flow, the work environment, differences between Kanye’s production process and Chad and Pharrell’s, but what about musically? You talked about Pharrell and Chad giving you brightness in rap whereas before you were hearing just darkness. What about with Kanye? What was Kanye giving you that you couldn’t maybe get from Pharrell? Pusha T Nostalgic soul. Nostalgic soul samples. Or, if it wasn’t a sample, he definitely knew how to recreate that feeling. And when it comes to me, he always tells me, “Your voice is the instrument. I gotta strip down every song for you because you’re more of an instrument than I am this time.” To me, he’s found my sound. He’s found the new Pusha T sound, musically. If you go to “Numbers on the Board,” if you go to “Nosetalgia,” if you go to “The Games We Play,” today you go to “Come Back Baby,” he’s found that sweet spot that musically he knows. He just knows. He knows like, “Hey, this is your beat.” We’ll go away to wherever we are recording, and I have faith. I always have faith that he’s going to find that sound. He does. I mean, listen, it can take forever. It can take days, weeks, but he finds it. When we’re doing this whole five album five weeks thing, that all started from just me and him going to work on my album. We didn’t find my album. We found Teyana [Taylor]’s album first, we found a couple joints for himself, then boom! “The Game We Play” comes. He’s like, “Ah! That’s your record. Go write that now!” But this days, maybe a week or so away. It takes time. It’s like an art, man. Was it 6,000? We were like 6,000 records he’s like listening to? Some days it’s just him listening to songs. And he’s like, “Oh! Pull that up!” Start doing whatever he does. Anupa Mistry Is there a method to any of that? Is there a spreadsheet, or like what is the playlist? Pusha T Yeah, you go to Amoeba Records in LA, you grab a whole bunch of records, you buy a bunch, you load them up, and you listen to them. That’s what he does. That’s his process. That’s what I’ve seen him do for me and for all of those projects. Like I said, he finds a sweet spot and creates the magic from there. Anupa Mistry So you’ve detailed a bit of the Daytona process, going away, finding a sound, finding some other records in the process. But you had a record before going into Wyoming. Pusha T Yeah because, what we do is... Before going into Wyoming, right, what I do is, I just go around and I sit with producers. All types of producers, new young, whatever. I hear anything that I like, I take it, I rhyme to it, I rap to it, lay it down and just store it. When I feel like I’ve found my voice on the project, and then found the direction and just the whole theme of the project, I take it to Ye and be like, “Yo, I got my album.” And you know, nine times out of ten he hasn’t heard the verses. I may have given him the beats, I may have given him the beats, and he’ll be like, “Oh I like that one,” or “I don’t like that one,” or whatever. So between me picking and between him picking through that, I write all of those and then I let him hear it. And I be like, “Yeah, we got the album. What’s up? Let’s round this out real quick.” This time, a lot was going on at the time, with him. [laughs] He was like, “Hey man, I actually think I can do this better.” And I was like, “Alright.” You know, I’m ready to come out though. I’m like, fuming inside. And he’s like, “I think I can do it better.” And I was like, “Yo. You do know that you picked all of these beats. You did this. You A&Red this project.” He was like, “I know, man. I’m just telling you I can do it better. Why don’t we just go away? I need some therapy, anyway.” [laughs] So, that’s when Wyoming and Utah and all that started. That comes about from that. When he said that, like I said, a lot was going on with him at the time. There’s always a lot going on with him, but at this particular time a lot was going on and he was like, you know, I felt like he was just asking like just to get his head in a different space. And I was like, “Alright, let’s do it.” Lets just go out there, and I mean, it was quick, I don’t know. A few days? Four days? Week? We were up in Utah in the mountains. House built out, studio built out, getting to it. Anupa Mistry The record you kind of had and put away, what was the theme or the story you were trying to tell with that record? And how might it be different from what we hear in Daytona? Pusha T The thing about it is, I like to write to beats. I don’t like to like write to a beat and then put those raps on another beat because the marriage is just never the same. Rarely can you make that marriage, you know, can you fit it like a puzzle. It doesn’t usually work like that for me. I was definitely on my rap super hero shit, like totally. But it wasn’t as cohesive because, like I said, I was getting it from a lot of different places. Ye, when it comes to me, is big on just sound and having a cohesive sound. He hears me. I honestly think he’s like Hell Hath No Fury competing every time he’s making an album for me, personally. It gets a little bothersome, you know. I like a lot of stuff. I like singing. I like things. But he doesn’t really hear that. It’s so funny because like we’ll find something great like that in that vein and I’ll do it and I’ll fall in love with it and then he makes a crazy beat, like “Santeria” or something. And then he’s like, “See! This is what I’m talking about! This is what this needs to be! I ain’t tryin to hear that shit!” It turns into shit, it’s crazy. [laughter] It’s like, you know, it’s like he does this great, great convincing job of you know, like, “Listen, man. This is your sound, bro. You can’t abandon your sound.” I’ll be like, “Yo, man, it’s one song.” He’s like, “No. We don’t want one song. We don’t. We just want it all like this.” Everybody comes into the room. They’re like, “I think he’s right.” [laughter] I have no backing, no nothing. Anupa Mistry Does anyone say, “No”? Pusha T I mean, I do. I say no a lot. I mean some people do. But I don’t know. It’s just how it goes. Anupa Mistry One of the things that that I really like, that you said about Daytona, is that you’re trying to channel first album energy. Pusha T Yeah. Anupa Mistry So how do you channel first album energy pretty much two decades into your career? Pusha T I just have a chip on my shoulder, honestly. I really do when it comes to rap. Um, cause I don’t think lyric driven hip-hop goes out of style. I don’t believe that. Even with rap changing and the different subgenres of rap and the different sounds, the chip on my shoulder is competing with those sounds. It’s like... I want to be the disruption to all of this. And I don’t want you to think that you can do what I do. I don’t want you to feel like you can do that. I’m not into that. I feel like if you feel like you can do what I do, then I’ve lost. So looking for first album energy, I just try to tap into like the brash, you know, young Pusha T who just doesn’t give a damn. Like, he’s a rebel. That guy? That guy’s loony. Anupa Mistry How do you find that in Utah? [laughter] Pusha T You know what it is? Utah is honestly just getting away from everything else. That’s what Utah is. That’s what Wyoming is. Actually, you find it really good in those places because you have no other distractions in the world and you can hone in on whatever that emotion is in your log cabin mansion room. [laughter] Your log mansion. [laughs] it’s actually really good to do it out there in those places like that. Anupa Mistry We haven’t touched on it too much, but I think... Pusha T You touched on about everything. Anupa Mistry Well, most of us here know that Daytona was whittled down to seven tracks. Pusha T Yeah. Anupa Mistry Gonna be eight, but then it became seven. Pusha T It was gonna be ten, yeah. Anupa Mistry I imagine that was a challenge. Pusha T Sure was. [laughs] Anupa Mistry We could talk about that but we could... Pusha T Of course! Anupa Mistry ...also talk about some of the other ways that you were challenged on this record, musically, not just in terms of Kanye’s kind of work flow, or that kind of thing. One thing... Pusha T I’m used to the work flow now. That’s whatever. But the seven song thing was a challenge because we had more. We had more. We had more that I had fallen in love with, and he hadn’t fallen in love with them. By this time I mean... You guys really gotta understand, I came in with the full, G.O.O.D., Kanye West A&Red album that “Hey, you know, he’s probably gonna put some drums, whatever. Boom.” By the time he heard it, and he had made the decision like, “No, nobody else is touching this,” number one, he gets very selfish. Extremely. And then he got hype and was like, “Oh no! I’m making an album. Teyana’s making an album. Like everybody gets an album! Nas is getting an album!” Anupa Mistry Its like Oprah. “You get an album! You get an album!” [laughter] Pusha T Yes! It wasn’t that, but he found his bounce. He found his bounce, and I really think he was inspired. I feel like he fell in love with the keyboards and the drum machines, and he fell in love with all that stuff all over again right in front of my eyes. I was saying that to say – we were talking about the seven songs. You know, as much as I wanted to have ten, I had to think about it and I was like, “Yo, This man is really doing 35 beats, which is a lot. Like 35 beats is like you’re dealing with me. You’re dealing with [Kid] Cudi, like Cudi’s a whole other monster. Like, you know, like, you’re dealing with Teyana. You’re dealing with Nas, you’re dealing with Ye times two, just cause Ye’s two or four. It was a lot, and then it came to the him, like I said, loving seven. He found seven and he was like, “No I love this. Matter of fact, everybody getting seven. We gonna give every... I’m doing seven for everybody. I like the number. [applause] I was like, “You gonna give me you like the number reason? You like bullying me at this point.” He’s like, “No. I actually do like the number.” Anupa Mistry There’s probably some numerology reason for seven. Pusha T Listen, I’m sure. He could make it up right now if you asked him. What really sold me, because he really knows I’m so, so anti... The idea of everybody putting 25 tracks on an album to get their streams up and all of that is such a poverty way of cheating to me. I’m not into it. So I was like, “You know what? You’re right. We need to be totally against everything and we need have a whole other mantra in regard to what we are doing in this wave.” And he sold me on it. Anupa Mistry How did he sell you on the album art? Pusha T Um, you know, let me tell you. I don’t know if you guys follow my tweets or whatever. Maybe some of you do. But that whole process was really happening in real time. And I was doing radio promo with no album artwork. Album’s coming out the next day. I tweeted. I said, “Ay, listen guys. This album is coming out. I don’t got the artwork yet, but when I get it, you’re gonna have it.” I’m tweeting that. I send that tweet out. I got an photographer who’s done the photos for My Name is My Name, Darkest Before Dawn. He’s done all... He’s done so much for G.O.O.D. Music. We got him in to do a photo shoot. I found a great photo, it’s a photo of myself. I’m happy with it. I like pictures of myself on my album. I like myself. I want to be seen. Yes. I don’t think that’s a lot to ask. [laughter] So I’m like, “Yo! OK, cool.” I found it, I mocked it up. I was like “Hey, this is what I like.” ’Cause it was winding down. He’s doing all these projects. He’s doing mine. I’m like, “You don’t need to worry about this type of stuff, man. Just let me just do this.” At 12, one o’clock in the morning I get a call. It’s him and he’s like, “Hey, man. You know I just don’t feet like this art is capturing the greatness of what’s on this album.” And I’m like, “First of all, it’s a picture of me. I better be capturing the greatness of what’s on this album. What do you mean?” [laughter] “No, I’m telling you that I got an idea. I got this idea. I got an idea. I’ll get back to you. We not putting that out quite yet, OK?” “OK.” That was it. I wake up in the morning... Um, oh no. That’s one thing. You know he told me the price of the art and I was like, “Hey! We don’t have to spend that on my art.” Anupa Mistry $85,000 Pusha T Yeah! I was like, “Hey! I was like, I don’t want to do that! I don’t want you to do that!” He was like, “No, I want to do it.” And I was like, “Alright.” I still didn’t know what it was gonna end up being until the next day, and I had to do like radio... By the time it came out – No! I’m sorry. When the album came out, I was doing radio phoners and I was getting these wild, wild, interviewers who were like, “Listen. I feel a way.” And I was just like, “Oh, OK. You feel a way. What’s wrong?” They were like, “This art is so disrespectful,” so on and so forth. It was like, “Whoa, wait a minute.” I was trying to explain to everybody like, “Listen, this art was done, honestly, just trying to capture... It was drugs, luxury, everything that picture said. Granted, it was from Whitney [Houston]’s bathroom, right? The home bathroom, I believe, not the hotel. I think it was the home bathroom. Anupa Mistry I think it might have been... Pusha T But nobody was trying to play Whitney out or nothing. The picture was just like it was perfect. It was the perfect description. Organized chaos, drugs, luxury, ups, downs, everything I was describing on this album. And that’s what it was. And I’m sticking by it. I love it, and it was paid for. [laughter] And where’d the money go? To the person who sold it. So, with that being said, you know, it was for sale. You buy things you want. You sell things you wanna sell. That’s how it goes. Retail 101. Anupa Mistry When My Name is My Name came out, which was actually five years ago this week, basically, you told Miss Info that you weren’t rich enough to take weak shots. So five years on after your successes, and the “surgical summer,” does that statement still resonate? Pusha T Say that one more time? I told her I wasn’t what? Anupa Mistry You weren’t rich enough to take weak shots. Pusha T To take weak shots. What are weak shots? [laughter] Anupa Mistry That’s what you said. Pusha T Wow. Yeah, but I’m very well off these days. [laughter] Anupa Mistry That’s not what I was asking. Well is it even about the money? Pusha T Its totally not about the money. Anupa Mistry Yeah. Pusha T Totally not about the money for me. This is like art to me, man. It’s art, it’s my passion, I love it. If it was about money to me, I probably would make different records. I mean, if you want to talk about it, I really made variations of the same album for the past 20 years. I mean, close. But I just know who I’m talking to, man. I know exactly who I’m talking to. I know exactly who my core is. I cater to that person. I don’t cater to anyone else. If you want to be down, fine. Come join us. If you don’t, it’s okay. It’s just a little different for me, man, because I feel like there is nobody else out there who does what I do. I feel there are a lot of people who, you know, talk a street narrative. I don’t know... It’s a lot of them. I just don’t think they do it the way I do it. I think it hits some people because there’s some actual gems in what I say. There are actual like... I follow the rules of hip-hop and people who love hip-hop, their metaphors, their similes, their parallels drawn. I talk about current things. I talk about things that hurt you here [points to heart]. This rap thing is like a language to people. It’s a real language that resonates with a whole lot of people, and what it is that I do and the way that I do it – from vocabulary to just being articulate in doing it – that’s what broadens my base a little bit. There than that, it is what it is. You know what you’re getting from Pusha T. Every time. Anupa Mistry Language changes over time. Pusha T Language does change over time, and I think I change. Anupa Mistry Like most of the industry, I think rap has shifted to emphasize business over certain traditions. Why does competition matter now that the parameters have changed? Pusha T I think for me, competition has always mattered. When I tell you about my early days and I tell you about how we even competed with other records, that’s why I don’t know how to work in studios. ’Cause we were busy trying to just hear what was next and be like like, “How do you outdo that?” Competition matters. I feel like the artform was based on that. It was. Hip-hop culture is based on competition. Not just rap, just the whole culture of hip-hop. You know, walking outside, walking outside, having on fresh shoes and saying, “You ain’t got these.” Like its always competitive in every aspect of hip-hop. Fashion, rap, just knowing about you know what hot, what’s next. There’s a competitive spirit in all of that. That’s the hip-hop I was raised off of. So I don’t know it any other way. Anupa Mistry There’s a Daytona track called “Hard Piano” and... Pusha T Yeah. One of my favorites. Anupa Mistry On it you rap, “I won’t let you ruin my dreams or Harvey Weinstein the kid, good morning Matt Lauer, can I live?” Pusha T Yeah. Anupa Mistry This record came out when both of those men were facing and admitting the serious allegations of sexual assault. Pusha T Yes. Anupa Mistry When you are writing a punchline, how do you think through the word play versus the way those references might play out in the public consciousness? Pusha T I rap for an intelligent individual, man. I really do. I rap for people who know what’s going on in society, know what’s going on in current events. We call it sacrificing for the greater good, actually. That’s when we just know what we’re talking about and we know that there’s a certain individual who’s going to know what we are talking about, but maybe the other person might not. It ain’t for them. It’s really not. You know, when I’m talking about Matt Lauer, and I’m talking about Harvey Weinstein, it’s like man. It’s “I won’t let you ruin my dreams. Or Harvey Weinstein the kid. Good morning Matt Lauer. Look at my new digs. The rooftop can host a paint and sip for like 40.” I’m talking about just not falling into any of those wild, weird, sexual-deviant behaviors. And I’m also talking about just my growth. I got different things to brag about. I’m not into this whole... I just got married. Not into the whole chasing 90,000 women and so on and so forth. That’s not it anymore. Times are changing. That’s not the thing. I’m just thinking of the verse. “Look at my new digs, the rooftop can host a paint and sip for like 40. The Warhols on my wall paint a war story. Had to find other ways to invest. ‘Cause you rappers found every way to ruin Pateks.” It’s just setting myself apart from what other rappers are doing, what they talking about. I’m into different things. I’m talking about my rooftop. I could sound washed. Easily. It’s just owning where you are as a person, knowing your space, and being able to say that I’m growing. I’m getting older, and I got other interests. Anupa Mistry Do you feel like... I’ll say rap, only because that’s what you do. Pusha T Yes. I do not sing. Anupa Mistry I would extend this to people making all genres of music in general, but do you feel like rap has a responsibility to be more socially responsible in the language that artists use? Pusha T Yeah. I would say yes. But, I’m saying yes because I’m from the era of “The Message.” That was one of the first rap songs. Rap to me is you talk about what’s going on outside right now. You tell me the story of what’s happening. What do you see? What’s going on? You address the issue. You attack the issue. Whatever it is. I don’t know rap that doesn’t do that. I don’t necessarily listen to rap that doesn’t do that. I may have fun to it, I may bounce to it. Whatever. I’m not necessarily ... I can enjoy it. I’m not trying to solve that puzzle, though. Let me say that. I’m definitely not trying to solve that puzzle. When you hear my records, I want you to try to solve the puzzle. I want you to discover things and say, “Oh my God! That’s what he was talking about!” But I want you to do that four weeks later. I want that to happen. That’s the goal. Man, I may have just now deciphered Reasonable Doubt. That was ‘96. And I needed the book to code it. That’s the beauty of hip-hop to me. That’s the beauty of rap. That’s the art in it. That’s the greatness in it. I don’t know... Everything else is good. Like I said, the other sub-genres and what they do, and the fun you can have with them, so on and so forth... It’s cool, but this right here, this is something different to me. Anupa Mistry So, when you talk about having a message, addressing an issue, attacking an issue, what is the issue at heart when you’re putting out a record addressing a rapper like Drake? Pusha T What is the issue? Anupa Mistry Yeah, what is the issue? Pusha T Oh, it’s the competitive spirit. It’s the competitive spirit. He puts out records and he says what he says, and it’s just about combating that. And coming back at it, lyrically. That’s what it is that I do. I feel like that’s another aspect of what that competitive spirit is, and just standing your ground and showing what you believe in. Anupa Mistry After all of the discussions that your record has brought up – and there’s Eminem and Machine Gun Kelly kind of back and forth this year – what is your sense of how people understand this competitiveness, or this tradition of beef and diss records in rap that you’re talking about? Do people get it? Pusha T I don’t know if people get it. I don’t know. I don’t really know. I don’t know how they look at it. You can look at social media, and you can read comments that say, “Hey, Pusha T went crazy! But he sold less records.” You know? Or you can look at comments like, “Man, that wasn’t that good.” You know? Whatever. “A billion streams.” I don’t really know. I don’t know how people take it. I feel like I know how my people take it. Now, I know what they think. They’re me. So they look at it how I look at it. We chop heads off, that’s it. And that’s really it for me. But that’s the battle wave. And you feel like... It’s funny because people will play with the whole battle notion in their raps. They’ll say slick things, they’ll do this, they’ll say this, they’ll say that. Right? But then when it comes it’s, “Oh, it’s too far! Oh, you can’t do this! I’ma write a whole dissertation about why this wasn’t supposed to be.” Bruh. It’s not even fun at this point. I think you have to be really careful in toying with it. Because it’s like ... I feel like once you play in it, now you have to really play. You have to really play. ‘Cause to me I don’t like, all of the... Even with that whole situation, you gotta really think about it. I really didn’t do... It happened during my album roll-out. So I did interviews during my album roll-out, and of course that was happening. So it’s like, “OK,” and I have to talk about that. But since that I haven’t really talked about it. Because to me it ain’t nothing to talk about. It’s just action. When it’s time for action, we go for action. And that’s it. It’s like war games. Why we gotta talk about it? If we gonna get busy, we gonna get busy. You don’t walk to the bus stop to fight, to talk. You don’t do that, right? And that makes sense. And I’m not... Content is king. So you gotta keep your content to yourself until it’s time to engage. So I don’t really know how people think anymore. I don’t. I’ma tell you what I do notice, though. And I’ve seen this a few times. There’s not a lot of emphasis put on the battle wave and things like that anymore. Before, you could almost be taken out of this game by losing a battle. Actually, people have been. It’s not like that anymore. People be over it. It’s cool. You take the L and go on. People forget about it. “Oh yeah, that happened, but whatever. Dope song.” [laughter] That’s how it goes. And it’s cool, it’s whatever. Anupa Mistry We’re also coming up on three years since you became the president of G.O.O.D. Music. Pusha T Yeah. Anupa Mistry Why was that something you wanted to do? Pusha T ‘Cause I feel like that’s my calling in music. I feel like this is how you mature in music. You have to share the codes with other artists, new artists coming up. I feel like you have to share your experiences, you have to find other artists. Groom them. Show them everything. Show them things musically and just life-wise. A lot of these artists are from different places and different backgrounds. They’re running into tons of money. You give them those words and you help them see their way through it all. I feel like that’s my calling in music for now. I’m working on an album now, but I still gotta bring artists through and be like, “Yo, this is hot. This is not hot. This is what’s coming next. What’s up? We need to go grab him.” And that’s part of like just what we do anyway. My studio sessions over at G.O.O.D. with everybody usually just starts with conversation and a talk about who’s hot, what’s hot, what’s new. Let’s hear it. What does it do? Who likes this? Once you discover all those things, you see if they’re available. You see if they’ll fit in the fold, if they wanna even be down with the fold. People are so self-sufficient. Artists are so self-sufficient these days. Not everybody always wanna be down. Sometimes you find a diamond. You’ll find a record bubbling on SoundCloud, like Desiigner. And you say, “Hey, what’s up?” 16 million singles later... Anupa Mistry Do you think it’s a good or bad thing that artists are more self-sufficient now than before? Pusha T No, I think it’s good. Yeah I think it’s good. It’s good to me, ‘cause it’s something I look at and admire. Having lived through all of these eras... I’ve been in this 20 years now, right? So living through and being the kid who was driving from Virginia to New York, and thinking I’m gonna be the label head, and really meeting the mail boy who is trying to get out the mail room himself... And actually taking it to the A&R when he told me he was the SVP. I went through that. So to watch somebody produce, make their songs, shoot their own videos, have a following, cultivate a following before anything. Pop up with 750 kids at his show, and I don’t know you. It says a lot. And I like to see it. Anupa Mistry What would be the advantage of a kid who is self-sufficient finding a label home then, in this era? Pusha T You can look at it two ways. You can be independent, and you can work very hard, extremely hard, and get everything that’s due to you. Or you can set that foundation, get with the label, and let them sort of blow it up for you. Hopefully, they don’t mess up, and hopefully you don’t mess up in trying to be self-sufficient. If you got the patience, do your thing. If you need the help, and you know you need the help, you probably should go to a label. But you gotta know that. Not everybody is built for the indie grind. I feel like if you know that you’re built for it, then go for it. If you don’t know, then go ahead, go to a label. There’s nothing wrong with either, man. You can get money either way. Anupa Mistry You said that G.O.O.D. Music has become sonically competitive under your presidency. Can you talk a bit more about what that means? Pusha T I feel like under my presidency the albums that have come out, the records that have come out, the sound of G.O.O.D. Music is now competing at a frequency. And it’s not all the way there yet. It’s not all the way where we’re putting out albums back to back to back to back to back, you’re hearing the music constantly. I feel like people know the difference, and people look at us and say, “This is a G.O.O.D. project, hold on. We can wait on this and... When this drops it’s gonna be chaos.” I honestly don’t feel like there was anything more impactful than the five weeks from May 25th to whatever the last release was, which was Teyana’s. I don’t know if there was anything that was more impactful all this summer, between that and the drama. [laughs] I don’t know, musically. I don’t know what was crazy. Great music... A lot of great music has come out, but I think it’s fair to say the noise was definitely surrounding G.O.O.D. Anupa Mistry What have you learned from that roll-out, the way of doing things that you guys did this year? Is there something that you’re like, “No, that actually didn’t work.” Maybe won’t do it again? Pusha T I can’t say I won’t do it again. But what I will say is that I feel like we accomplished something. We’ve done something that we were trying to do, and we didn’t know how to do, since G.O.O.D. Fridays. The whole G.O.O.D. Fridays thing, I don’t think there was a time, a weekly time in music... Everybody was tuned in for G.O.O.D. Fridays. The world was tuned in for G.O.O.D. Fridays. “What’s gonna drop? Who’s gonna be on it?” So on and so forth. And we were trying to figure out, “Yo, how do we out do that?” I think we came close. We came close with grabbing the attention of everybody and making people anticipate what was next with these five G.O.O.D. offerings, for sure. Anupa Mistry There’s nothing about this whole experience that didn’t work? Pusha T Of course. You heard Teyana. She cursed me out a couple times. I feel like in doing things like that, you’re working with... It’s not just the good, you have to make sure that these albums get ingested into the Apples, Spotifys, all of that type of stuff. If you don’t, then it’ll be a little late. You had those type of issues, for sure. You had... I think Ye took his artwork picture in the car on the way to the listening party. I’m sure that’s not really... Anupa Mistry Spent all his money on yours. [laughter] Pusha T Maybe. Probably. It’s things that – looking for the consumer, just giving them the ultimate awareness, and making sure that they’re excited about art in a timely fashion – sort of messed up. Again, putting the albums out, not having them ingested in those particular platforms on time, which caused them to be late, and so on and so forth. That was a bit of a issue. But it was fun, man. Like this was fun. It was a lot of fun, actually. Even the hiccups and hang-ups were like... We’re not perfect. And we like for you guys to go through... I think y’all been seeing since Pablo. He like redid that album with y’all. Really. I literally flew to New York, we did the whole order of what it was, I think we narrowed it down to like 12 songs. Like, “Oh, this is perfect.” We left, we jammed. I woke up next morning, it was 19 songs on it. Mixes still being done. And I just left a perfect album. It’s like, man, you guys are really... I just want you to know, you’re really seeing the inside of something. [laughs] You’re seeing the madness happen as it’s really happening in a lot of these different situations. And it is what it is. I’ve learned to work like this with G.O.O.D. It’s normal to me now. The Addams Family. [laughter] Anupa Mistry So, how come Kanye gets to make the decisions, then, if you’re the president? Pusha T As far as what? Anupa Mistry Well, like... “No, this should be the album art. No, it should be seven tracks. No, I could do it better.” Pusha T I feel like there’s certain things that I personally don’t put as much emphasis on. I’m gonna say, “Listen. These verses are crack. Take this. This song is crack. I love it.” He’s definitely gonna be like, “OK, listen. I produced this, I want it to look a certain way. Why wouldn’t you let the DONDA staff do this? Why would you not want... “ And then he gets into that. By the time I have him fully engaged creatively, you want his genius. You definitely want his genius involved in your project. He’s really passionate about it. I’m not passionate about art. Art like that. Like I said, it could’ve been a picture of my face, “Hey. It’s Daytona.” Bro, it’s like fire. I can’t wait it to get out. The picture? Leave me alone. Anupa Mistry We’re talking about Kanye’s vision. G.O.O.D. Music was, slash is, Kanye’s vision. Pusha T For sure. Anupa Mistry Why should people who are disappointed or angry at Kanye’s current vision of the world buy into G.O.O.D. Music’s vision right now? Pusha T I don’t know that. [laughter] We disagree. I don’t know. I feel like Kanye... He’s been a person who definitely tries to get his point across, right? At all costs. He’s willing to go through all types of hell and damnation to get his point across, and piss people off, and everything, if he believes that it’s gonna pay off in the end. I truly believe that everything that he thinks, and all of his views ... He feels like, “Hey, it’s gonna pay off in the end.” Even though we don’t agree, I personally know that... I know him. I know him, I know his heart. And I know that he’s... More so than anything, he’s all about making things better. Just for the world, for people, he’s about peace, he’s about giving people a shot. I’m not like that. But he is. When it comes to us and dealing in that, and the working dynamic of that, we just agree to disagree. And it’s not like I’m... It’s not an excuse to be made. He doesn’t want no excuses made for him either. He doesn’t. Like I wouldn’t. But I can just say that I know him personally, and I know that he is, and his mind is telling him, “Man, I need to go through these channels to sort of make these others things happen. And I’m willing to exercise that, and y’all can stone me.” But he’ll go for it like that. Anupa Mistry What are you most proud of? Pusha T Right now? What am I most proud of? I had an awesome wedding the other day. So great. [applause] Listen, that even happened during the firestorm of everything. I’m just happy how everything has turned out this year: personally, musically, business-wise, for everybody at G.O.O.D. You guys get to watch the reality show. This is what it is, it’s real. Every aspect of it over here is real with us. We argue, we fight, we disagree. We make great music. We love it. I don’t know if everybody loves it. We do, though. Anupa Mistry I think that’s our time. Pusha T Really? No! We have more time. No way. Anupa Mistry Do we have more time? Pusha T Of course! We’re here. [applause] Anupa Mistry I don’t know. I’m like, looking at it. Unfortunately, we don’t have more time. Pusha T Aw, man. Anupa Mistry But please everyone, give our thanks to Pusha T for being here. Pusha T Hey, thank you guys for coming out. [applause]

Planningtorock
From Frank Ocean’s revelations to Janelle Monáe’s “PYNK’ pants, the mainstream pop narrative has been noticeably queered in recent years. For Jam Rostron, the multimedia artist and DIY provocateur who performs as Planningtorock, that spirit of subversion – in gender, sexuality and politics – has been the engine of their creativity for almost two decades. Raised in the North of England but a longtime resident of Berlin, Rostron writes unabashedly radical songs that question the binary boundaries placed on our bodies. Whether restructuring their face with prosthetics or pitching their voice to discover their authentic self, Rostron’s music is an investigation into the possibility of “queering sonics:” what would a non-heteronormative music even sound like? After the melodramatic pop of their debut album and the personal watershed of 2013’s alt-disco anthem “Patriarchy (Over & Out)” – not to mention writing an opera about Charles Darwin with the Knife – Rostron’s transgressive ambitions only grew bolder on their 2018 album, the emotionally honest Powerhouse.
In their lecture at Red Bull Music Academy 2018, Rostron discussed growing up through music and art, opening up a safe studio environment in Berlin and the commodification of queer identities.
Hosted by Chal Ravens So I’m here on the couch with Jam Rostron, a musical and visual artist whose music often challenges us to think about the status quo, and power structures and gender and family and many other issues. Their new album is called Powerhouse, it’s coming out on DFA in November. Please welcome Planningtorock. Planningtorock Thank you so much. Chal Ravens I thought we could just hear “Transome,” the lead single first, from the new album, just as an opener. (music: Planningtorock – “Transome”)
[applause] “Transome,” new single. It hasn’t been out very long in fact, has it? You mentioned, when we had a quick chat before, that each of your records feels like maybe a separate chapter, or that you couldn’t have made each one without having made the previous. I thought we’d start in the present day really, but we can loop back to it eventually. Could you give us a bit of an idea about where you are now as a musician, and what this album represents for you? Planningtorock Sure. Yeah it’s interesting, this is my fourth album, and if I was to think back on all the albums, the first album I wrote, called Have It All, I wrote that on stage. I was making music on my own here in Berlin and performing as much as I could in small venues, and I would just test material out, super punk. Berlin is a great place for that. And then when I got the chance to actually make that into an album, there were a lot of songs that were about leaving the UK, leaving what I thought was home and finding a new home. And then my second album was really, I would say, in reflection to that. It made me understand that the first album was really my life up until that point, which was a long time, and then from that to have two, three years, four years to make another album, I really needed to live to make another album. So where I am now is, I feel I get more and more direct with my music, clearer, more like “This is what I’m thinking, this is where I am, this is what I need to share.” And I think from recording for so many years now, what I feel for me, music is a language, it’s a space-giver, it creates space. And it’s definitely given me a space to understand myself and to be able to explore personal issues, and also my politics too. Chal Ravens Yeah. On your previous album, there was a definite change in terms of your directness. A lot of the track titles are very bold, “Misxgyny Drxp Dead,” “Patriarchy (Over & Out),” you were very direct with it. Did it take you a while to feel comfortable just being that direct with your words? Planningtorock It took me being disappointed with my own album. With W I really felt like I was being direct and talking about personal issues and also about gender and about my sexuality and also about how I felt about patriarchy. It just didn’t communicate, it didn’t cut through. I love that album, I had to make that album to get to make All Love’s Legal, but I had a bit of a crisis after W, after my second record. And to get myself through it, I really started to ask what music was for me. You know, there’s a lot of people making music, and it’s amazing, so I had to work out what music was for me, what was my purpose? How could I use music? So I set out an exercise for myself, I was like, “OK, I want to write a song about patriarchy.” And I really asked myself, “How do I feel about it?” And my feeling was, patriarchy’s shit, and I just want it to get out the way. It spoils, ruins everything, it’s a terrible invention. So I was like, “OK, write a song like that.” And so I wrote “Patriarchy (Over & Out),” and the lyric is just like, “Patriarchy, you’re out of date, get out of the way.” For me it was a breakthrough, because I think... I feel like I’ve managed to write a song about patriarchy that isn’t confrontational, it’s open, people can connect to it. They don’t take it personally, but they get it. And it was a dance track, it was the first time that I really constructed a dance track that was super dancefloor friendly and energizing, charged and clear. Then from that track it was very easy to write the rest of All Love’s Legal. It was a joke, I told my manager the first song was “Patriarchy (Over & Out),” and I remember she was like, “Ooh.” I was like, “Don’t worry, the next song is not gonna be that intense,” and then the next song was “Misxgyny Drxp Dead,” and she was like, “Whoa! OK.” The nice thing about being really direct and open at the same time is... All Love’s Legal really created a space for me to share, and people completely talking to me about their feelings about these issues and spaces that I didn’t have before. Chal Ravens We’ll talk a bit more about your songwriting process in a bit, but we should work out a bit more about who you are. You’ve lived in Berlin for a long time, where were you from originally? Planningtorock I’m originally from a village called Dunscar, on the outskirts of Bolton, which is North West UK, right up in the north. Chal Ravens What was that like as a place to grow up? Planningtorock I mean there was a bus every six hours at the end of our street to Manchester, so as soon as I could, I would get on that bus to get to another city to meet people, have a life. It was rural, and out in the sticks. So it took me a long time until I found people that I could connect with. Chal Ravens Did you have family that encouraged you to make music? Planningtorock Yeah, definitely. My mom’s a really big influence for me, my mom loves music. It’s a bit emotional for me, because this is very much what this new album’s about. The album’s called Powerhouse, and basically the powerhouse is my mom. She still has a really big record collection, and would always play music every day, especially in the morning, really early, getting herself ready. Loud music. And it was a big influence on me, and it got me really into music. Yeah. Chal Ravens Pop music, or other kinds of music? Planningtorock My mom? Everything. A lot of... Massive Aretha Franklin fan. Big voices with lots to say, basically. I always say that I would watch my mom play her records and literally put the music on like armor, really like, “Right, ready for the shit day I’ve got ahead of me.” I don’t know, it introduced me to the magic of music, what music can do for you. Chal Ravens You were classically trained as well, right? Violin? Planningtorock It’s a myth. Chal Ravens Really? Planningtorock It’s a Wiki myth. I love it, it makes me laugh every time. I delete it, people delete it, then it pops up again. There’s somebody out there that needs Planningtorock to be classically trained. I am not classically trained at all. I am totally self-taught, yeah. Chal Ravens Is violin correct? Planningtorock I did have a violin, yeah, I did. But I wasn’t trained. Chal Ravens You also... But you’re making music at home, is it right you’re also making tape loops and playing with tape and things? Planningtorock Yeah, basically I left school when I was 14, and my sister as well, when she was 15, school was terrible. We were lucky that... Not my dad, but my mom was definitely like, “You can leave school, just stay at home.” So I spent a lot of time at home with my sister, and we... I was born in 1972, so that was early ’80s, so cassette players and tape-to-tapes. We would listen to music, recording music in our own way. Chal Ravens What kind of music that was around at the time did you like? The Smiths? Planningtorock Oh, no, hell no. Sorry. [laughs] Chal Ravens Just as a local band. Planningtorock No, I know. It’s weird, because I think I was really... I was not connected to any... It took me a long time to find music that I liked, but I like pop music a lot. I was thinking about this, because I thought this question would come up, it does come up. Joyce Sims, I don’t know if anybody knows Joyce Sims, but she released an album in the ’80s called Come Into My Life, and it’s really synthy, poppy, beautiful love songs mostly. She wrote it, recorded it, produced it, amazing talent. Her songs were like, I would see her on Top of the Pops, kind of synthy-pop to be honest. Chal Ravens And then you ended up, as I guess a lot of British pop musicians did particularly, maybe in that period, you went to art school. What kind of art were you actually making? Was it music or visual art? Planningtorock How I got into art school’s funny, because I didn’t have any exams or qualifications, and my mom... So my sister’s autistic, so we were both at home, my mom got my sister into a local art school, she hustled, got my sister in there. And then when I came to an age where I could go to an art school, the teachers were like, “Well if you’re as nice as your sister, we’ll let you in without any qualifications.” And then I got into art school at Sheffield, and in the interview they were literally like, “How have you got here, because you don’t have any of the qualifications?” But I just was drawing a lot and painting, trying to make art. But when I got to Sheffield, Sheffield then was a very special art school, you could move between different departments, so you could go into performance, they also had video, I discovered video basically. I could use video cameras, and I started to make video art, and make music to the videos. This is how really I started to make music, but it was for video art in a way. Chal Ravens Performance art as well? Planningtorock No, not then, not at all. How I got into performing is totally different. Chal Ravens What kind of things would you put in your videos then? Planningtorock I put a friend in a video. I would film a lot of my friends and make them do things, and I would put music to it, [laughs] and was very arty. To be honest with you, when I got to art school, I couldn’t believe that I had three years paid to do whatever I wanted. It was phenomenal. It was the best, most important time in my life. I remember a lot of the other students were just complaining, “I don’t know what I want to do.” And I’m like, “F---, this is amazing, I can make work and do whatever I want.” It was great. Chal Ravens And at some point then, you arrived in Berlin. Did you intend to move here? How did you get here, and why did you stay, what did you find? Planningtorock I got here on the back of two other friends who were making an art project here, I had no intention of moving here. I didn’t know what I could do or what I wanted to do. But when I got to Berlin, I just... I think the biggest thing for me was not being in the UK, and not being in the culture I was brought up in. The biggest thing actually was nobody knowing my class, my background, they couldn’t locate me, they couldn’t... I was just freed, nobody could... It was just really freeing actually. And then I liked that, and so I stayed. Chal Ravens So you moved to Berlin in ’99? Planningtorock Mm-hmm. Chal Ravens Your first album came out in 2006, so I guess I’m curious about what you were filling your days with in those seven years in between. What did you get up to? Planningtorock I did a lot of money jobs, a lot, and parallel to that I was secretly making music and recording songs. I don’t know exactly how it happened, but I just started to play live, tried to perform my music live, in small parties, private parties, and it just started to build basically. Then from that, a friend of mine booked me in a music festival in Amsterdam, and I just remember being terrified. I was on stage, and I just had a microphone and my music was playing and my videos, and I was just walking around on the stage just terrified. And a musician called Kevin Blechdom, she’s not really that active now, but she’s an amazing electronic musician, phenomenal, genius, and she saw me after the show, and she was like, “You’re amazing, who the hell are you?” She was living in Berlin and so we formed a friendship and then we started to put on shows together. Then from that I did a gig in Hamburg in the [Golden] Pudel club, and Melissa from Chicks on Speed saw me play, and offered to put out my first record. Chal Ravens I’m gonna play a track from this record which is possibly not that representative of everything that you do, but I feel like it gets at something slightly different. It’s called “The PTR Show.” Planningtorock Oh. Chal Ravens And it’s very brief, actually. (music: Planningtorock – “The PTR Show”)
[applause] I’m detecting show tunes and musicals, and possibly Morecambe and Wise? [laughs] But I wanted to play that one just because it showcases an obvious humor that seems to be quite a key part of what you do. Can you put that in context a bit with the instruments you’re using, you were just making everything on your own at the time. Tell me a bit about why you would end up making a little piece like that? Planningtorock Musicals is the key. I love musicals. And me and Kevvy would make these musical marathons where we would just watch as many musicals as we could in a night. Chal Ravens What’s your favorite? Planningtorock Oh my god. I mean I do love West Side Story. Of course, politically it’s problematic in some ways, but it’s still... I was fascinated by harmonies, by how to put music together, different instrumentation, and also humor and attitude. For me that first album was really about working out what was my musical attitude and how could I use music to express my attitude. Chal Ravens There’s also an element of, if you’re gonna use humor, you have to have a sense of shamelessness, you have to be willing to put yourself out there and laugh at yourself as well. Is that something that you’ve drawn on in general, the boldness of that? Planningtorock Yeah. I think with my first album and my first shows, I had a lot of attitude. It was really a lot of fun. It was very exciting to suddenly have audiences to connect with people, and to be playful, yeah. Chal Ravens I want to fast-forward now a bit to a track called “The Breaks,” which is from your album W. And I want to show the video, because at this point, you also had a particular visual look, which was pretty cool. Can we get the video please? (video: Planningtorock – “The Breaks”)
[applause] A lot of artists have used masks or various other physically altering elements for various reasons. What was your reason to create a kind of face, a new face? Planningtorock That was specifically... I was interested in changing, or exploring, in a way, the gender of my face. If I increased my brow, then, in a way, my gender would become more open and less identifiable. It was a lot of fun. It’s so funny to see that now because that was shot near Schönefeld and it was so hot and the prosthetic was actually putty and it just kept sliding off my face. And we’d have to do it really quick and then it’d be sliding off my face. I make all the videos myself. The reason I do this is because I love it. It’s really, again, like another language for me to play around and understand things. For me, image, moving image, and music together is my favorite... It’s just, oh, I love it. And I get this playground where I can really do whatever I want and become, in a way, who I want to be, and definitely from exploring my personal exploration. Yeah. Chal Ravens Could you explain a bit about your studio, your production setup at the time? There are certain sounds, certain instruments,that you go back to quite frequently. You produced the whole thing yourself? Planningtorock Yeah. Chal Ravens Give us an idea of what your staple materials were for that record. Planningtorock This is interesting. My relationship to gear has changed over the years. My first record I made in the room that I was living in, in Berlin. So it was very, very DIY and it was very, as they say, “in the box.” I’d have a few MIDI keyboards. And then for W I got into more hardware, I guess. Then, it’s really expensive and... I’ve been very fortunate that there have been labels that have wanted to release my music and supported me, but even with that it can be an expensive thing to do, so I started to really embrace digital production. Really from an economic perspective, where it’s like, I love digital software. I think it’s great because it means everybody and anybody can make music and I think that’s very, very important. And it definitely gave me a chance to make music the way I wanted to. And, fortunately, I do really like synthesized sound. So I’ve gone from having quite a bit of hardware and then having to sell it [laughs] and then being more in the box and then loving that. Also, in terms of... For Powerhouse, for example, I recorded that over a period of four years, and everywhere. Wherever I was, whatever jobs I was doing, whether it was being in LA or in London or here, or wherever. And it meant that I could always work. I like that too because, for me, my music is very much about my life, and so if I’m making music on the run, wherever I am, then it’s just feeding it all the time and I like that flexibility. Yeah. Chal Ravens What about saxophone? Planningtorock Love saxophone. Chal Ravens It’s real saxophone? Planningtorock I love the real and I love the synthesized. There’s something about that instrument, it’s sexy and hilarious. It’s just a beautiful instrument, and also there’s so much humor in it too. I really admire anybody that can play the instrument as well. Joyce Sims used a lot of saxophone in her pop songs back in the ’80s, and I think that’s definitely influenced me. As instruments go, I love strings because they just make me cry. They’re so emotional and powerful, and I think that’s why I first thought I’ll try and play violin when I was a kid. But saxophone, yeah, it’s just... Also it just takes up so much space. It’s like. [makes short saxophone noise] Yeah. Chal Ravens Related to the use of the prosthetics, the putty, you have consistently put your voice through different processing effects. I guess there’s a related purpose to both of those things. Can you tell me a bit about some of the things you were doing with your voice, on the early records particularly? Planningtorock Pitching my voice. I mean I spend a lot of time in the studio, and you know yourselves, when you’re working, you noodle and noodle and noodle with sounds. You’re just bending stuff, pushing stuff as far as you can go with it, and I did that with my voice. What I did was, I don’t even remember how it happened, but I sang on a song that I’d written and I sung it higher than it should have been and then I pitched it down. So I didn’t use gear, I just sang it too high and then pitched it down. On a personal level, when I heard that voice it was like, “There I am.” I was like, “Wow.” I really related to that voice more than I related to my so-called voice that you hear, and it blew me away. I just thought that sounded so good and I was like, “OK.” I think W, the second record, was the first record that I really tried that method on. It really brought me closer to myself. It made me get to know myself. I mean, for this record, because also I did for All Love’s Legal and I also do it live as well, it’s interesting because when I first started doing it, people were like, “That’s not your real voice,” but for me it is. It’s my authentic voice. It’s also my authentic voice in terms of my gender identity, of being a queer gender person, for being gender queer. In my private life it really helped me come out as a gender queer person. And so therefore it is very authentic for me. But in terms of actually then writing songs with that voice, it just all started to really come together. Again, it’s about a certain attitude. I could really speak through that. Chal Ravens You have used the same studio for a long time, right? Or you had the same studio for a long time. Planningtorock Yeah. Together with my friend Olof, Olof Dreijer, he’s half of The Knife, we built a studio together here in Berlin, about five years ago now. The studio... Basically two soundproof rooms, and the idea behind it also was that we would share it with a lot of our friends. It was cheap rent. And it turned out to be such a special space. We wanted to create a space also that was for our queer producer friends and female-identifying friends that don’t have gear. We just shared everything and it made for such a special safe space and also an educational space. A space where... Because if you’re producing on your own, it’s lonely. It’s nights and nights, days and days. It’s really lonely and it’s really nice to have people around. And for me, and for Olof as well, because he works a lot on his own, it was nice to have some human contact with people that were also making really, really interesting work. Right now I finished my record, so there are four other producers in there right now, Sky Deep, Paula Temple, and Pan [Daijing]. They’re all in there now making amazing music. It’s an inspiring space, yeah. Chal Ravens Before you released W you also worked with Olof, both with The Knife and Mt. Sims on an opera. Did you know anything about opera before you did that? Planningtorock None of us did. Actually, we all went to the opera here. We were like, “We’d better go and check out what an opera is.” [laughs] We knew it as a recording but we’d never been to an opera. If felt really serious, the deal. Chal Ravens The opera is called “Tomorrow in a Year” and it’s inspired by Charles Darwin. Tell me a bit about working on that, particularly working on it as a group, because I gather that when it finally came to be performed it was quite different to how you’d written it. Right? Planningtorock Yeah. Chal Ravens When you’re so used to having total control of your projects, how was it, firstly to collaborate with a bunch of people, and then for somebody else to perform it? Planningtorock I loved it, because when I’m working on Planningtorock stuff it’s about me, it’s Planningtorock stuff, but it’s very clear. So for me to work with other people, it’s very exciting because it challenges me, it opens up my skills, it just opens me up. How it happened, actually, was it was Olof and Karin that got the commission, but at that time I was still finishing W, and for W I got really into acoustic recording, so I was recording a lot of percussion, and I got really into mics and all that stuff. Olof had never really done acoustic recording before, he was really, really an electronic producer. So he asked me if I would do with him an acoustic recording. So a good friend of mine actually is an amazing percussionist, Icelandic percussionist. We traveled to Iceland and recorded him. Basically he’s the headmaster of a school, and so we went and stayed with him, and in the night after working all day in the school he would record with us, play all his musical instruments. And so we made this archive of percussion, and then came back to Berlin and then slowly made that into the music. What was nice for me for that project was I didn’t have to sing, I didn’t have to think about the lyrics, that was Karin and Matt’s department. Me and Olof just were all about the acoustic recordings and the sounds, so the sonics, yeah. Chal Ravens But when it was performed it wasn’t how you’d imagined it to be? Planningtorock I think because it’s an electronic opera, to replicate that live would’ve been really a big thing. And I think in the end we just were like, “If we just make a really nice surround sound and just blast it out,” as an electronic opera can be, and it worked. It was a bit tricky working with the performers a bit. But that’s like two different fields coming together, traditional and not so traditional. Chal Ravens You went on tour around this period with The Knife, with Peaches, and with LCD Soundsystem. Planningtorock Actually it was earlier than that. Chal Ravens Yeah. Planningtorock That was 2007. Chal Ravens So in the period leading up to W, I guess. Planningtorock Yeah. Chal Ravens How did touring with, I guess what you could call mainstream indie, bigger huge indie acts, LCD especially, how did that impact where you wanted to take your music and your career? Planningtorock They were three very, very different experiences. Touring with Peaches was just like, “Hello.” The crowd were just totally into what I did. With The Knife it was... I think for all three it was really nice to tour with friends, because they’re all friends, but with The Knife it was a bit more of a sober audience, a bit more reserved, so I think I just terrified them. [laughs] And for LCD Soundsystem it was very interesting, because some fans were just like, “What the fuck?” Other fans were just like, “OK.” So I think it made me... I just really enjoyed it and I felt very, very lucky as well because also all three artists really took care of me as a support artist. Back then I’d only just started playing so they really took care of me. But I don’t know if it influenced my making music so much, actually. Chal Ravens Talking of The Knife, I guess they have been an influence on you, or probably in both directions. A particular lyric of theirs kind of inspired the next chapter, I guess. Planningtorock Yes. Chal Ravens There was a track that we were playing on the way in from “Full Of Fire,” which has a lyric. Perhaps you would like to explain how this lyric triggered the next period of your music. Planningtorock Basically, Karin and Olof asked me if I would do a remix of “Full Of Fire.” You know, I love the track, but I’m listening to it and then right at the end there’s this, “Let’s talk about gender baby.” And I’m like, “What is that?” And it’s like, “Let’s talk about gender...” I’m like, “That is such an amazing lyric.” Let’s talk about gender, baby. Like in, “Let’s talk about sex, baby, let’s talk about you and me.” And it’s squished just at the end. I’m like, “That’s a song.” So I made a whole rework of their track around that lyric. And then when it came to my album, I’m like, “I want to write a whole new song just with that lyric.” That’s actually how it happened. Chal Ravens And then you pushed that idea into this feeling of wanting to be really direct... Planningtorock Yeah. Chal Ravens ... Really blunt with the lyrics. Planningtorock Yeah, yeah. Chal Ravens Can you tell me a bit about how that changed the way that you were making the music itself, and how that shaped... Planningtorock I think when I came to write All Love’s Legal, those songs, there was things I wanted to say and share, and I was aware that writing a song like “Misxgyny Drxp Dead” could be a bit intense for somebody. And so what I really wanted to do was make music that felt really fun, really open, really... I wouldn’t say light, but really dance-y and just brings you to a really nice place and also just brings you on the dancefloor, and then to sing about something like that. That was really, in a way, the idea behind that record. And it really worked. The tour for All Love’s Legal was just a party. It was amazing, so much fun, and people were chanting and singing all these lyrics and having a really fun time at the same time. Chal Ravens Yeah that’s something that The Knife had talked about, the idea of your disco tunes being a bit of a Trojan horse for something else. Planningtorock Yeah, yeah. It makes sense. Also, historically, that’s happened also in house music. You had incredible tunes that just make you move deeply and then there’s a lyric on it that you’re like, “Whoa.” It’s a really amazing formula and it works, I think. Chal Ravens Let’s have “Let’s Talk About Gender Baby.” Would you like to introduce it, musically speaking, maybe? Tell us a bit about what you were doing with vocals and production. Or we can talk about it afterwards, if that helps. Planningtorock Classic disco beat, I wanted it to be really classic. And bassline... I’m really proud of this bassline. Basslines are really, really hard to make. I’ve tried and whenever I get one that I like, I’m like, “Ooh.” Yeah, I really like this bassline. Also “Misxgyny Drxp Dead’s” a good bassline too. I hope that’s okay to say that but I do think it’s good. Yeah, cheesy, super cheesy. Cheesy’s good in music. Yeah. Totally went for it. Chal Ravens Okay, let’s hear it. (music: Planningtorock – “Let’s Talk About Gender Baby”)
[applause] Were there any particular disco/house artists that you were thinking about when you were putting together that record? You just mentioned the brass. Planningtorock Yeah. I like all types, like all sort of genres of disco. I like, obviously, the original disco, and also politically as well. And then I like the ’80s versions and the ’90s versions. Chal Ravens Sort of tackier a sound, in a way. Planningtorock Yeah yeah. Chal Ravens You’ve spoken before about the idea of “queering sonics,” and this idea that it could be possible to create a music that’s not heteronormative. So i’d like to ask initially what would you mean by queering sonics. What would that approach involve? Planningtorock I remember when I said that in an interview. I was like, “Queering sonics,” and then I was like, “Oh.” Chal Ravens You’ve got to do it now. Planningtorock Yeah. I’m like, “OK.” I think producing music and working with sound, and spending so much time with sound and finding your own sound. When I first started writing music I was writing music like a lot of other artists that I liked, I think that’s how you start. Then finding my own sound and then, in a way, on top of that, finding what I wanted to do with music and music production. And I like to think in terms of spectrums, also in terms of gender identity or sexuality. There’s a whole spectrum, a diversity there, and it’s the same with sound for me. Sound is like a spectrum of frequencies, of charge, of energy. It’s very, very diverse. Music, sonically, is very diverse, and I think, for me, queering sonics was about, in a way, finding my own queer sound, actually, and using sound to combine my humor, attitude, fun, and a space and a place, eventually a place because of performing live as well with that. Anyway, that’s, in a way, what queering sonics is for me. Chal Ravens So when you walk into your studio and you’re looking around at what to do, what would you do to try to channel that thought? Or, rather, perhaps once you’ve come up with something, how do you work back and make sure that you’re doing it the way that is true to your idea? Planningtorock I think it’s a lot about... It’s not so head-y. It’s actually very, very instinctual, and especially when you spend hours... If I think about when I produced a song called “Public Love,” and on that is a synthesized sax sound, and I just was working on that sound for days, until it was so chunky and aggressive and had so much attitude that then I could put a vocal on it, a lyric on it. It gave me that charge where I’m like, “Now in a way I can sing on top of this sound.” So to actually dissect it, like in a head-y sense, is a bit difficult. It’s more about, again, with that sound that I worked on for ages, then I get to this place where I can communicate something. And it’s communicated through the sound and through the lyrics as well. Chal Ravens Is there an element, thinking of yourself as an artist who also has to see themselves as a business in a sense, and sell themselves, is there an element of the queerness and queering sonics that is anti-capitalist? Planningtorock I think it’s more that in a way it’s a fight to not have... In a way not to have things commodified. You also mentioned this pink washing. Basically capitalism is about anything that you can make money out of, and what does that mean? If queerness as a topic becomes something that somebody can make money out of, then it will get capitalized, and then it gets commodified, and then there are consequences to that and to the integrity of that, and also how that impacts lives and more to do with anyway what really is that? You know? Because we’re talking about people’s lives and people’s feelings, you know? And it’s a difficult one because especially working as a music producer, it’s not easy to make money out of this job. You know, I do a lot of other jobs. I’m lucky to do other music-related jobs, I get commissioned to do like soundtracks and that, and I’m very, very fortunate like that, but last year alone I did seven other jobs. I made music for a documentary, made music for a dance piece, made music for a fashion show, and I’m also trying to make an album between all that. So it isn’t easy. I think a lot about that, you know, when people get offered money in order to make music, in order to express themselves, it’s really important. It’s a complicated topic, yeah. Chal Ravens I’m interested to know about any of the other projects that you’ve done recently because, of course, if you're a relatively underground artists, you do have to look around for other jobs, find other things. What have you done that’s been particularly exciting or that you’re proud of? Planningtorock Well, I wrote... I got asked by a documentary filmmaker that I really love called Nora Mandray, she’s French, and she was making a documentary about the uprising of the right wing in France, which was really intense. Creatively, musically, it was really a challenge to make music to footage of Marine Le Pen speeches. It was like, “Ugh,” and finding the right tone, finding what the documentary was saying and what the music needed to say, you know? That was a great project. I mean, creatively it was really, really challenging. The fashion show was actually a friend of mine who... It was like her first... Oh my god i’ve just gone totally brain-dead, the name of the fashion brand that she works for now, but she commissioned me to make a piece for her first fashion show and that also was quite challenging, and because also she was a friend and I wanted it to be really good for her. And then, actually for the last three years, I don’t know, like before this year, three years before that, I was working with a choreographer called Ian Kaler, and I produced three soundtracks for those pieces, which again was really interesting because it was a time where I could be... I’m going to say this now, just a musician, not a performer. Where I just produced instrumentals. Actually for the last piece I did vocals, but it was really nice just to be with the gear, with the instruments, and just produce music, yeah. Chal Ravens And even though you’re a solo artist, you do have a quite a lot of involvement in your wider community, I guess. You also have a record label. Could you explain a bit about the sort of purpose of the label? Planningtorock It actually, I started this music label called Human Level, and it was after I’d been touring all of ...Legal actually. And the artist rRoxymore, who is also electronic music based here in Berlin, she toured a lot with me, and is an amazing musician in her own right, and also a great inspiration. We spent so much time together, it was just me and her, and she was producing her own music. I was like, “I want to release a 12" together.” Basically I started Human Level so that I could put a record out with me and Hermione’s music. That’s how it started. It was also my way of, in a way, saying thank you back to her. Also, I’m a really big believer of sharing platforms. I’m very, very lucky because people have used their opportunities and their privileges in order to give me chance, to put out my music. And it’s really how it works. If you’ve got a platform, share it, definitely. Chal Ravens That kind of brings us close to the new album. We heard the track “Transome” earlier. What have you done on this album that you couldn’t have done on the previous albums? You were saying that it’s got you to this new place. That track is Auto-Tuned, right, rather than a different type of pitching technique? Planningtorock Actually it is a pitcher. It’s a TC-Helicon pitcher. It’s a little pedal and it actually has a knob on it called “gender.” It can be gender off, gender on, I’m down with that, and gender hard or gender soft. I’m always in the middle. A little hard, a little soft. I’m not doing any promotion, I know I’m not allowed, but it is really amazing. And that’s what I used on this record quite a lot. Chal Ravens I think if it’s gear you’re allowed to talk about it to your heart’s content. Planningtorock All right. Chal Ravens So it’s not Auto-Tuned as we know it... Planningtorock Well, the thing is it’s not strictly Auto-Tuned, but it still tries to put me in tune, and so sometimes it’s like a little bit accidental Auto-Tune. Chal Ravens It still has quite different connotations though, I think, on this record, which, I mean, it’s not out but I’ve heard it. It sounds more, I mean, perhaps more American in some senses. It has a sort of pop and R&B flavor to it. Can you tell us something more about this musical chapter and anything new that you’ve learned? Planningtorock I think, with this record, it is the most personal record I’ve ever written because... And it’s also the record that I feel the most vulnerable. I’ve really shared a lot about myself and about my life. It’s very biographical actually. It features songs about my family and people close to me. When I was writing it, I had up to about 30 tracks. There was a lot of material. And again, trying to, from a lyrical standpoint, what I really like to do is, if I want to say something, and even for this record, something that is so personal... Say, for example, I wrote a song about my mum, and there’s so much I could say about my mum, but just to fit it in a song was such a challenge. To find what it was that lyrically I could use to communicate what I was trying to say about my mum. And it ended up being like kind of an anecdote. That’s what I use lyrically. I really like lyrics that are also not too complicated. That’s why I like pop, in that sense anyway. It’s very to the point and economic, lyrically. I think, for me, I feel, I hope, that I have achieved even more that skill that I’m into. Into writing kind of pop songs in a way, but that have... They’re a little bit different, yeah. Chal Ravens And did you feel the same feeling trying to be so direct about family as you had done with the previous album about patriarchy, feminism and so on? Planningtorock I mean, I think the difference was, talking about things so close to me was, you know, I am a bit nervous about everybody hearing it. And so far the feedback has been amazing. And it’s also something that I had to do. Again, for me, music has really been a space where... A healing space, a place where I could let go of stuff, a place where if you release something, you literally release it and then you get to look at it, and then it’s gone. It’s a relief as well. This album is definitely a healing album and an educational one. Music is my education, ultimately. Chal Ravens Yeah, I mean, it’s a cliché that music is therapy, but clearly that’s why a lot of people start to make music in the first place. Yeah, perhaps you wouldn’t have been able to say any of those things had you not got to that point. It’s a very good album. Planningtorock Thank you. Chal Ravens It’s not out yet. Yeah, talking about gender equality would be pertinent on any day in history really, but particularly today where we wake up to a bunch of women getting arrested protesting against the Supreme Court nominee. I wondered if anything about the mood of the last year or so in the public sphere, fed into what you were doing at all? If you fed off of that? Planningtorock I think... It’s funny, these things are happening and are talked about in the media, but what I feel more and more that this is just part of everybody’s lives, you know? It’s great that the media is talking about it, but just because the media is talking about it doesn’t mean that suddenly “Oh now it exists.” It has existed. Also the politics that we have to live in, you know? I think it’s good that the media is talking about it but what I feel, in my more immediate circle of friends and families, you know, different kinds of families is how we support each other. I think around this topic, the more that we share stories, the more that we believe the stories, and give those stories the space, that’s really important. I feel like for a lot of my friends and families there’s a sense of being quite overwhelmed by the present day. And I think it’s really important that we all take care of each other. This is something that I try and talk about also on the album, this sentiment of care. The power of care. My mother, for example, has been my sister’s carer all her life. This is unpaid, caregiving. Nobody sees it and yet it’s incredible. And it happens all over the world, with millions and millions of people that are doing this, and that is such a beautiful, powerful thing, and so I think it’s how we deal with it in our lives that is really important. Chal Ravens I’d like to open up for some questions in a second if anybody has anything. Perhaps while you just quickly think of something, you did mention your circle. I mean, Berlin, as we’re here, it’s a haven for artists to come and live here and be kind of outside the mainstream, in a sense. But I guess the purpose of making such a pop record is to make an impact beyond that community. Planningtorock Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely. And also I have my friends here and my family is here but I have a lot of friends everywhere. This is going to sound so cheesy, but you know, your cyber friends. And also people that I’ve never met that I have really long conversations with online, so, and definitely for this record, it’s been interesting since my last record came out, which was 2014, how much this talking with people online has, for me, intensified and it’s really important. Yeah, so definitely I want this record to connect outside of Berlin for sure. Chal Ravens Any questions from the audience? Audience Member Hi. Planningtorock Hi. Audience Member I was wondering, being a songwriter and producer of your own songs, is there a special way you approach the process? Because you also mentioned earlier that on one of the tracks you took sounds to a level where it was chunky enough so it charged you to do something specific? Is it always like that or...? Planningtorock That’s a really good question. It took me a while to work that out, but I think it really is that sometimes I will create an instrumental, and then there’s just something, like it had something, and i’m like, “OK, it’s bringing out something in me lyrically. I can imagine I’ll try and sing on something like that.” So that inspires the vocal, and then sometime absolutely flipped. Sometimes I will just lay down a vocal and then, in a way, I’ll build around the vocal, so it’s usually one of the two, yeah. Audience Member Okay. I’ll maybe ask one more question. Is there a special way you treat your vocals, apart from using a TC-Helicon pitch...? Planningtorock Yeah. Audience Member Which mic you use? I’m getting too technical maybe. Planningtorock No, AKG C14. Audience Member 414. Planningtorock Yes, the C414. I love them. AKG, I’m a big fan. Sorry, more promotion. And it’s really affordable. It’s not that expensive and I really like it. Because I pitch my vocal, I have to EQ it a lot. There’s a lot of low end on it, so, and I like a little slapback [delay] and a bit of reverb. And I love digital reverbs. That’s the other thing. There’s this snobbery about reverbs, like, “What plate are you using and...?” I use a lot of Ableton’s own digital effects. I love them. Audience Member Hi, thank you for coming today. My name is Sequoyah. Planningtorock Hey. Audience Member Hey. I used to actually listen to your song “Beyond Binary Binds” in high school. It’s like a really short, one-minute-something track. Planningtorock I should have made it longer, I’m sorry. Audience Member No, no. It was really cool because I would just sometimes want to hear that texture, and so I would turn that on. I remember being in PE and listening to that. Planningtorock Yay. Audience Member But anyway, I just wanted to comment on how you were talking about finding the humor in music and specifically saxophone and certain things. I definitely understand that and I think like a lot of times some people don’t want to find humor in songs, but like there’s a lot of things that I listen to that are horrible on purpose. That’s a separate side of me from like my main musical side, which is like very, very serious and driven. I have another side that loves to find the most horrible things to just laugh at and I just thought that was interesting to hear someone else talk about that. Planningtorock Thank you so much. Audience Member I just wanted to share that with you as well. Planningtorock Thank you so much. It’s true, it’s like it’s a whole... Again music can be, it can just do so many things. You can be so playful with it. I totally hear what you’re saying, there’s like taboo areas, you know? Yeah, nice. Chal Ravens Maybe because you’ve now had several albums, you’ve been able to do a different thing on each album. You know, when you’re at a stage in your career where you maybe haven’t done an album yet, it’s a lot of pressure to choose what you’re going to do I guess. Maybe after you’ve got a few out of the way... Planningtorock Yeah, totally. It definitely took me three albums to get to “Beyond Binary Binds,” for sure. yeah. And that track also was so much fun to make. And playing live as well was really great, it was really cute, yeah. Audience Member Hi. Planningtorock Hi. Audience Member Yeah, we heard a lot about your process with songwriting, making albums. I know we’ll see you perform later tonight, but I just wanted to hear a bit about if you’re thinking a lot about your live performance when you’re writing music, or how you translate one to the other? Planningtorock Good question. All right, really short, when I first started making music and I wanted to play it live, I was like, “I’m going to do it all live.” I got eight musicians to play with me and it was a bloody nightmare, really just so much work and I was just too far ahead and my music at that point had orchestral sounds in it and all this, you know. I had a bassoon player in my first band. Oh my god. Nothing against the musicians, it was just a bit ambitious, you know? So then I just cut it down and I was like, “Playback. Playback, video, me, microphone, done.” You know? I really like those shows as well, when you’ve just got someone on the decks, someone on the mic, there’s something really good about it. And I toured like that for years, you know? Literally my own little show in a bag. But for this album, or apart from All Love’s Legal, when I was touring with rRoxymore, for this album I’m actually producing a larger live show, and I’ve been fortunate enough to get some funding together, so I have a light designer and a set designer and all these things, and the reason I wanted to do this for this show is because, back to humor, I wanted, whenever I tour, when it gets in between the songs, I never know what to say, but I always want to say something, so I’m always like, “Thank you,” or “Mm-hmm.” I’m like, “OK, I want to face that head on.” I want to try and put a show together where I learn how to talk between songs and I have something to say, because it’s a skill. When I see artists do it and they’re just chatting I’m like, “My god, that’s amazing.” And I want to learn it. So for this time I’m putting a show together and I’m rehearsing it. Normally I never rehearse. I have a week, we learn the songs, and it’s on the road. So this time it’s making a show where I can actually talk a little bit. Also with the music playing in the background a little bit, just chatting about some of the subjects that I’m talking about, and it’s really fun. It’s really fun, yeah. Audience Member You said that you have some kind of producer collective here, right? Planningtorock I wouldn’t say collective. It’s more like I have producer friends, in our studio that I put together with my friend, we share it altogether, yeah. Audience Member Yeah, do you want to tell us a bit more about how that works and how you work together or if you work alone in different rooms or if you... A bit about the logistics behind it... Planningtorock The overlaps. Audience Member How you... Yeah. Planningtorock I mean, we have a Google calendar together. [laughs] And we fight a lot for the rooms. Like, “I’m in the big room,” “I’m in the small room.” The great thing is we have this really small social room, we call it the social room, where you can make tea and stuff. And we’re all workaholics. Usually when we see each other we’re like, [makes tired face] deadlines. Then there’s moments where we’ll sit and have a tea and we’ll be in the social room, or one of us wants to hear something, so when I started to finish the album more I would say to the others, “Come and listen to this track?” Or, “What do you think of this?” For example for this record I worked with a mixer, an amazing mixer, called Marta... Holy crap. She has an Italian surname. Chal Ravens Salogni. Planningtorock Thank you, thank you. She is phenomenal, and she would send me the mixes. You know, you send a track to a mixer and usually you hear it and you’re like, “Mmm, going to have to change this.” She would send me something back and it just sounded so much better than I could have imagined, I had nothing to say. So I was literally to my friends like, “Come and listen to this mix.” It was amazing. So for things like this, you know, sharing stuff like that, and also gear. Audience Member Do you also walk into each other’s studios and like, “Oh, I could add this, or I could record this, or do you want to record a violin on this one?” Planningtorock Ah you mean, yeah, actually for this record, Sky Deep, who is one of the producers working in this studio...Amazing guitarist. Her electric guitar is called Janet after Janet Jackson. And her and Janet came in the room and we did a little recording together. So yeah, it’s a really beautiful space for that and we have another tiny space that we pile all our gear in, all our tom drums or cymbals or whatever percussion we have, and just everybody can use it at all times. Audience Member Sounds amazing. Planningtorock Thank you. Chal Ravens Also, on that note of working with other Berlin artists, you briefly had the Aquarian Jugs alias. Planningtorock Yeah. Chal Ravens Is that every happening again? It’s like a techno alias I guess. Planningtorock Aquarian Jugs. It’s so dirty. I mean, it is dirty, it’s meant to be dirty. Yeah, it’s a side project that at one time I would love to pursue more. I produced a lot of tracks on it and they’re really funny and just pure dance tracks. When I get the time, yeah, I’ll definitely... I think I should just put them out, like just put them online, yeah. Chal Ravens Great, well then I would like to say thank you to... Planningtorock I just wanted to ask... Chal Ravens Oh. Planningtorock Didn’t you have a question? You didn’t get the mic. Sorry, I’m just curious what you wanted to ask. Audience Member Thank you so much for sharing so much about so many facets of what you do. Something you said early on, I think pertaining to your inspiration or song writing, you’re talking about being transient, moving. Are there any places that you haven’t been, or you have been that you haven’t written in, that in your mind’s eye you’d like to go and write and have a process in a certain place? Is there like a gemstone somewhere? Planningtorock That’s a really good question. Because for this record it was the first time that I... Because All Love’s Legal I, just for economic reasons, I had six months to record it and get out on the road so I could start earning money. So I had six months and so I just locked myself in the studio basically. So for this album, exactly because I was moving around a lot, I was recording in living rooms, I was recording in airports, everywhere. And I liked that because the studio can be sometimes not an inspirational place at all, you know? Even when we were in New York I recorded one vocal from this album in my friend’s closet, literally, because it was the driest place to get a good vocal. I have to think about that. That’s such a good question. Audience Member You just get back to me on that. Planningtorock Yeah, I’ll get back to you. Thank you. Audience Member Thank you. Chal Ravens OK, apologies for that false ending. Planningtorock, thank you very much. Planningtorock Thank you so much.

Reinhold Heil
The journey from a Berlin dissident punk band to Golden Globe-nominated film score composer in Hollywood might seem incredible, but it’s exactly the path Reinhold Heil’s career traveled. Having learned to play church organ and piano from a young age, Heil received his actual musical education in his father’s record store, where he got into rock, jazz, soul and electronic music. Like many free spirits of the ’70s, Heil moved to the then-isolated West Berlin to study music at Hochschule der Künste, where he became the keyboard player in the band of Nina Hagen, East Germany’s “Godmother of Punk.” After Hagen left the band, the group became known as Spliff, an influential player on the Neue Deutsche Welle scene. Heil would go on to produce Nena’s famous hit “99 Luftballons” and compose the score for Run Lola Run, alongside Johnny Klimek, in the process creating the first original techno score. The score also sparked a decade-long collaboration with Tom Tykwer, including the series Babylon Berlin, the biggest budget German TV series ever produced. Heil was nominated for a Golden Globe in 2013 for the Cloud Atlas score.
In his lecture at Red Bull Music Academy Berlin 2018, Reinhold Heil sat down with Torsten Schmidt to discuss why singers are “front pigs,” breaking into the movie business and how to work with narcissists.
Hosted by Torsten Schmidt So, I would very much like you to welcome a person who’s excelled in two, if not three, different areas that you can do, maybe even four, depending on how you want to define it, but most of all has worked a lot in this very town and had his hands in I’d say at least five of the best ten German pop songs ever, outside of his soundtrack and scoring work. So please join me in welcoming Mr. Reinhold Heil. [applause] Reinhold Heil Thank you. Torsten Schmidt So, when you arrived in this town, what did it look like? When was that? Reinhold Heil September, October, 1973. I was 19 years old, I had just finished my high school, and I had miraculously passed an entry exam into the Hochschule für Musik here in Berlin, West Berlin, actually. And what did it look like? It smelled really bad because our friends, the communist rulers of East Germany, loved to use brown coal, surface-mined coal, for energy. So we had all these brown coal power plants that were sending unbelievable amounts of sulfur into the air. So that was like a constant presence in the air, the smell of sulfur, in West Berlin, coming from East Berlin. Torsten Schmidt Yeah, the coal and the dust and the wind didn’t care about borders. Reinhold Heil It was glorious. The glorious old days. It was just absolutely magnificent. You wish you would have been there for sure. Torsten Schmidt And it just stank. Reinhold Heil Yeah, it stank. A lot. Torsten Schmidt What did you do to overcome the stink? Reinhold Heil You stopped thinking about it, except for the morning when you would cough up the phlegm and it was kinda darkish. Torsten Schmidt Charming. Welcome to a very German conversation. Reinhold Heil So apart from what you voluntarily dragged in there, there was other stuff that polluted the air. Torsten Schmidt We listened to a bit of Mahavishnu [Orchestra] earlier, that was your s--- then, right? Reinhold Heil Yeah, my s--- was different every other year and then everything else was absolute s---. So at that time I was opinionated and I knew this was the best music and it happened to switch every year. So, because I was so much into jazz fusion rock music, so Mahavishnu Orchestra, Weather Report and then I realized everything comes from Miles Davis, so then I listened to Bitches Brew, which still is one of my island records. I wish I would one day do the electronic version of Bitches Brew, and I will actually. Before I die I will do that. So that was my thing and everything else was bulls--- so I completely missed the early David Bowie, I looked down on that, Roxy Music, the whole glam rock thing. So then, 1976, ’77, I was asked by a friend, a guitar player, he said, “I have this singer coming from East Germany, do you want to join that band? It’s going to be very sort of eclectic rock music and old fashioned German music, all kinds of stuff.” And I said, “I don’t know.” So then I had to kind of catch up with all this music that I had looked down on for years. Torsten Schmidt Good thing a lot of that happened in the fenced-in city. Reinhold Heil Yeah, that’s true. Although of course we also, since I’m from... I’m like a country bumpkin from near Frankfurt, and I was for a long time, it took me a long time to adjust to the big city, so I went home a lot over the weekends. And using a car, it was horrible, you had to stand at the checkpoint in the south of Berlin for two hours, then you were let into the GDR, you had to stay on the Transitstrecke [transit route] and there were only two rest stops that you were allowed to go to, and then on the other side you had to stand again and you were checked. As it turns out, after the wall came down, they had x-ray machines at the border, so the amount of x-rays that we all got was also pretty gnarly. Torsten Schmidt Good thing you’re still here with us. Reinhold Heil I’m still here but I have a lot of people who are no longer here from my generation. I don’t know. Of course we can’t pinpoint. There was nuclear fallout from all the tests in the ’50s, so there’s other s---. In any case... Torsten Schmidt Welcome to the uplifting vibe of the ’70s and ’80s. Reinhold Heil It was glorious for sure. Torsten Schmidt Within that vibe you played in a bunch of like proggy bands and a lot of your comrades, there was a big scene of things that were a little different to what was going on in the pop music kind of thing. Reinhold Heil What’s interesting is that people now think there was a scene in Berlin. There were about ten different scenes that didn’t have anything to do with each other and were, again, looking down upon each other, this is the idiotic thing about this time I think. Torsten Schmidt That’s still a very German thing, yeah. Reinhold Heil Yeah. And then there was this time when Nina Hagen came up in ’78, ’79, and then there was the origins of the Neue Deutsche Welle. Record companies came to Berlin and were basically dragging half-finished projects, bands, out of rehearsal rooms and gave them record deals. And I was not super, super successful, I just played in that band. That was kind of one of the instigators of this whole thing and I dared saying in public, “I really think these bands should be left alone until they’re done.” And I got a huge backlash from the musicians who were very happy to be signing a record deal just because they’re from Berlin. Because of course there were no outlets for them. There was no YouTube, there was nothing they could self-release. We all had to go through this needle ear of the record companies, of the A&R managers, those were the gatekeepers to fame or to even being heard anywhere out there. So if you don’t convince an A&R manager that he will give you a deal, and might even be a s--ty deal, you will not have a record. So of course it was a stupid thing to say, I should have just kept my mouth shut obviously. Be nice to your fellow musicians because everybody who gets a deal is another person who gets a chance. Torsten Schmidt Can you recall when you first heard or saw a band with the very not West German name Lokomotive Kreuzberg? Reinhold Heil You know what, I never saw them because I wasn’t interested. They were very famous in Berlin because they did rock theater and they did it very specifically for, you know, apprentices, young people who were learning a craft, and they were organized in unions, like the IG Metall. So they actually got subsidies from the IG Metall but they were real communists, like East German-style communists. In West Berlin. There was the Sozialistische Einheitspartei Westberlins, they were members and they were trained, they did agitation, they did the whole shebang. And of course, country bumpkin from West Germany, completely apolitical, so I didn’t even understand the first thing about it.
And then I met them and they were in the process to actually make a band with the most famous dissident from that scene, from the political system, that they were supporting all these years. So it was... Torsten Schmidt That’s definitely worth reading up on ’cause it is probably a little too complex of how both the West and the East tried to infiltrate cultural and creative scenes on both sides, and tried to finance, more or less openly, certain individuals in order to get their particular messages across. Reinhold Heil Yeah, I don’t know if I would just call it like that because there’s also opportunism. Musicians are, by nature, somehow also opportunists. So Wolf Biermann, who was a Hamburg-born guy, who was a communist, who had deliberately gone to East Germany to live there as a communist, and he was a singer-songwriter and he wrote critical songs. So of course he wrote critical songs about the GDR system. He wasn’t afraid. So eventually they silenced him and he had to deal with a West German record company. I don’t think there was any specific undermining strategy going on, so of course he was happy to sell a s--- ton of records in West Germany. So he had a very privileged status in East Berlin. At some point, since he couldn’t perform in East Germany, because they didn’t let him anymore, he did a big tour in West Germany and they didn’t let him come back. So he was the first big dissident, and then a whole bunch of East German artists, directors, writers, actors, musicians, signed a letter in solidarity with Wolf Biermann, and then the Stasi went to their homes and put them under pressure and said, “You have a privileged status here. If you want to continue having that then you have to withdraw your signature from this letter.” And about 50% did and the other 50% left for the West. So there was a huge cultural brain drain of the GDR into West Germany, and a lot of them actually made it pretty well in West Germany, and others completely withered away. It was a very sad story. And Nina was, because she was the stepdaughter of Wolf Biermann, was of course among the people who left. So in 1976, she came to West Berlin. She immediately, through her stepfather, had a connection to CBS Records in Frankfurt, they gave her a record deal and sent her to London and said, “Look, there’s stuff going on in London.” It was punk, it was the birth of punk, and she was literally hanging out with the Sex Pistols and there was a girl group, The Slits, who was in the whole scene with the Sex Pistols. She hung out there for six months but she couldn’t find musicians for a band that she could then go home and record with. So she came back to Berlin and she met this guy from the Lok Kreuzberg, from that political, East German communist basically, band in West Berlin. So it was really super ironic when you think about it. And I knew that guy and so he asked me, and I was still going to the music academy and I said, “I can’t do it, I need to first graduate.” I was that straight-laced and really... “Yeah, this is an opportunity, I like CBS Records, there’s a lot of my favorite records came out on that label.” That was an issue for me. “Bitches Brew,” for instance, is on CBS Records, a whole bunch of things that are absolutely amazing because it’s one of the big record companies. Yeah, two weeks later he called me again and said... Torsten Schmidt Who is this he? Reinhold Heil This is Potsch, the guitar player of the Nina Hagen Band, who used to be with Lokomotive Kreuzberg. And he says, “We tried two other keyboard players, we think that you have to be, you have to come, you have to meet everybody and you have to go to the rehearsal room with us.” And that’s what I did. And I couldn’t help it, I had to join that band. It was just too good an energy. I had never experienced anything like that. The drummer was just unbelievable, the kind of energy that he has as a drummer. Torsten Schmidt His name was? Reinhold Heil Herwig Mitteregger. He’s still a really good friend of mine. We had not that much to do with each other in the last 30 years but still good friends. So, yeah, all of the sudden I had a professional record deal and I was still going to the music academy. So I went from the Bahnhof Zoo to Kreuzberg, Paul-Lincke-Ufer. By the way, Paul-Lincke-Ufer used to be a s--hole with rehearsal rooms. Now, probably in that same rehearsal room that we were in in 1977, ’78, there’s probably some banker now, in a fancy apartment that’s... Torsten Schmidt And there was Hardwax Records in between, and all these things that were important for it. Reinhold Heil Paul-Lincke-Ufer is great, I would totally move there now. So anyway, yeah. Torsten Schmidt Maybe to give people an idea of this, this fantastic little video that shows different iterations of Nina and the band in a short clip. Reinhold Heil Oh that’s good. Torsten Schmidt Maybe can we see the first two or three minutes of video number one, please? (video: Nina Hagen evolution montage) Well, there’s a bit of variety in that material. Reinhold Heil Yeah, you’ve asked yourself, where was I? I was not in the picture anywhere and actually I was audible only in one of those little snippets. So there were three snippets from when she was a pop star in the GDR and then there was our... The first piece on this album [holds up a vinyl copy of the album] called “TV-Glotzer,” which was actually a cover version of a piece by The Tubes, who nobody is aware of anymore I don’t think. Torsten Schmidt That song in particular has a lot of drama in itself. Is it worth playing it from the record? Reinhold Heil Yeah, I saw that they have vinyl players here, so I thought, OK, let me dig through my archives, which are in boxes in my garage of course. [takes record out of its sleeve] This is a Japanese pressing, and they were supposedly better. I’m not sure if it’s really that much better. Torsten Schmidt Now that you play it it’s going to be worth only half of it now anyway. Reinhold Heil Yeah, it’s a virgin pressing. I don’t think I’ve ever played this. So this is about 40 years old, maybe 38 or something. And it’s that very record. Torsten Schmidt Maybe before we listen to it, there’s different stages in that song, and as you were involved in the way it was created can you probably give a few pointers to what happens in it? Reinhold Heil You mean in the lyrics? Torsten Schmidt In both the lyrics and the way the song evolves. Reinhold Heil The song structure is really exactly what’s in The Tubes’ piece, and The Tubes’ piece is called, “White Punks on Dope.” So it has lyrically nothing to do with it, which is always, by the way, the best way to deal with a cover version. Just write an original version in the other language because you will never get anything musical if you try to actually get the meaning across. We’ll come to that. Torsten Schmidt We might, yes. Reinhold Heil We might come to that. All right. So, Nina, of course, just wrote her version of what it is like for an East German to come to West Germany and see what’s going on on television, so it’s all colorful, it’s overwhelming in terms of the amount of stimulants that are coming down on you as an innocent East German. And I think that’s basically what the song is about. So “Ich glotz TV,” I watch television and I switch through the channels. Torsten Schmidt But glotz is stronger, it’s leering... Reinhold Heil To stare, yeah. Torsten Schmidt Yeah, staring, leering, somewhere along those lines. It’s definitely the kind of thing that parents and grandparents would say to you when they would want you to stop watching that evil machine. Reinhold Heil Right, it’s basically the equivalent of the iPhone now. Just stop staring at the screen. Quite harmless. [puts needle on the record] You know what, I actually have this thing and I haven’t operated it in a few weeks. Wait, let’s do it properly. Of course not. There you go. (music: Nina Hagen Band – “TV-Glotzer (White Punks On Dope)”) Torsten Schmidt [applause] So there’s bits in there that any German over 25 would remember, and the rest that they wouldn’t, but there’s also, I want to say at least five or six decades of pop music in that song, it’s that super... I don’t want to call it classical but it really draws from blues and boogie woogie and that kind of stuff and then it gets into all of a sudden punk happens and then... Reinhold Heil And then jazz rock happens. Torsten Schmidt Then jazz rock happens, then it somehow preempts nu-metal, and then it almost preempts like massive rave anthems. There’s like everything in there in like a short amount of time. Reinhold Heil Yeah, we were not aware of any of that, of course. That’s always the nice thing. You’ve just got to be innocent about what you’re doing. You just do it for the fun of it. Seriously. The most memorable things that I was ever involved with have a background of complete innocence and fun. Playfulness. Not thinking about money, not thinking about success. Yeah, thinking about groupies, but maybe in the far distance, future. But, you know. So, seriously, and I have been involved in projects where the people said, “Wait, we have to make another record because we need to pay our taxes. We didn’t know we had to pay so much taxes.” I said, “Well, I told you, you had to pay a lot of taxes for your incredible income that you’re making with your super hit.” And then they go, “Yeah, but we have to make a record.” And I go, “But you’re not ready to make a record.” And they made the record anyway, so... And then it wasn’t successful, and then they couldn’t pay their taxes anyway. Anyway. So what I’m saying... Torsten Schmidt He’s basically saying whatever comes in, put a certain portion aside. Reinhold Heil Put it aside, for sure, and put something else aside for the uncertain future. Or maybe don’t, because there won’t be any now. We always... Punk was always about no future. Now, what the hell, right? So yeah. I think that’s really what that was. It was having an amazing band to play with, it’s this absolute energy where there was no click track, there’s no computer involved. I was able to afford synthesizers. You know, all my money went into synthesizers. Torsten Schmidt Which ones did you use on there? Reinhold Heil Well, my first one was my Minimoog. I still have that. And then for this particular band, I bought a Yamaha CS-80, which was just fresh at the time. Torsten Schmidt OK. Advances were good then. Reinhold Heil That was... Yeah. My entire...the other people needed to live from their advances, but I was still in school and my dad supported me. And actually, my mom supported me. My mom gave me 5,000 Deutschmarks for that CS-80 that I still have, of course. Torsten Schmidt Okay. I was gonna make a really bad Berlin hip-hop joke about your mom giving you money for the synth, but f---ing hell, 5,000 Deutschmarks for a CS-80? Reinhold Heil No, the CS-80 was 13. So I got my advance, that was three, I had saved up five, and my mom gave me five. Torsten Schmidt And how did you pay the five people to move the machine? Reinhold Heil Yeah, I know. Actually, I think I got a bad back in the context, because we then had to leave the Paul-Lincke-Ufer, so there were no elevators. And we had a rehearsal room at the Theater des Westens on the third floor. That was s---ty. Torsten Schmidt So you took the CS-80 out and on tour? Reinhold Heil Yeah. And then when we went on tour, of course, we had roadies. So that was good. Torsten Schmidt Yeah, but how many times did you have to repair the chips on it, then? Reinhold Heil It only got an overhaul once, in ’96. Yamaha was nice enough to... ’Cause I told them I was going to emigrate to the States, and then they called me and said, “Send us your CS-80.” I’m going, “Why?” “Just send it.” So I sent it, and they sent it back and it was all fresh. It was beautiful. Torsten Schmidt OK, so you are the one that’s responsible that there’s no replacement chips around anymore. Reinhold Heil No, no, that’s not true. Actually there is one guy, and I just found him, I’m so happy. It’s just a half-hour drive away from me. He has, easily, at any given time, he has about ten CS-80s sitting in his workshop, and he’s making them good again. And so I have no idea. I mean, the density of CS-80s in Los Angeles must be amazing. Torsten Schmidt I mean, on that little deviation there, the machine is known for Vangelis mostly, I guess. And what other things? Reinhold Heil Yeah, I don’t know. For me, of course. ’Cause I played it like nobody else played it. Torsten Schmidt All right. Reinhold Heil Sorry. It’s true. Torsten Schmidt So, did you schlep it into the Hansa studios as well? Reinhold Heil Yeah, of course. I schlepped it into the Quasimodo even when I was still playing with my jazz rock band on the side, because that was conveniently just down from the third floor of the Theater des Westens, into the basement of the Quasimodo. So yeah, I got a bad back in this context, for sure. Torsten Schmidt Maybe the bad back was also due to the performances, ’cause the backing band somehow had its own life pretty soon. Reinhold Heil Yeah. Nina left us. This is why I’m only in one of those snippets, ’cause we had a run starting in the summer of ’77. Started rehearsing. Our first gig was in February ’78, then we produced the record, we did a tour when the record was out, in the fall of ’78. We did another tour all the way through Europe in the spring of ’79, and on that tour, or right after that tour, Nina left the band. So that was it. It was basically, it was just under two years. And then I graduated from the academy four weeks later, which was very traumatic, the whole thing, just to go through all of that. And then we were sitting there as a backing band of an amazing front person, and we were super traumatized by the fact that everybody just wanted her, and there was this petty jealousy in the band of her. Looking back, how could you be jealous? Why aren’t you just happy that you were standing behind her, and that you’re part of the project? So, but you know. Torsten Schmidt But there’s rumors she also made it a little harder for you to be happy by claiming a pretty strong part of the shares for her. Reinhold Heil Well actually, it wasn’t really like that, because originally we actually formed a company, and we were equal shareholders. And the only way she got more was because she wrote more music, and she wrote pretty much all the lyrics. So she got a much higher share from the back end, but that was very justified through the creative work. And we had a publishing company together, so the publishing share was our socialist contribution, it went into... And I think this is still a good model. I actually came up with that model because I learned something about copyrights and publishing rights, and I said, “Well, we should have the capitalist competitiveness, that whoever writes the best pieces and the most of them gets more money, but there should be a socialist aspect to it.” I still believe in this kind of combination, by the way, so I’m very much anti-neocon, economy that started with Miss Thatcher and Mr. Reagan and is now about to drag us all down. So, I’m also not Communist. I’m not pro-communism, because I really don’t think that would work very well, but this kind of interesting mixture between having an incentive to actually contribute something and at the same time being taken care of is nice. Torsten Schmidt So, the tragical state of social democracy in the Western world is probably our lunch. Reinhold Heil Well, I don’t know. I think it wouldn’t be so tragic if the social democrats would remember why they exist, right? But let’s not get into politics. But this politics kind of went into this business model, so to speak. So we were a company, we shared the royalties, she got a little more. And of course that wasn’t really enough. And interestingly enough, Wolf Biermann was the guy who was saying, “Hey, Nina, we are in capitalism. Don’t behave like we’re still in the GDR.” So that was one of the things. The other thing was that Frank Zappa’s manager at the time was Bennett Glotzer, and he had an eye on her. So he kind of helped undermine the band. There were drugs involved and all kinds of things. Torsten Schmidt Edit suite. Reinhold Heil There’s a scene in the movie called The Doors, which is the story of The Doors, that two lawyer types would take what’s-his-face aside, and talk to... Torsten Schmidt Jim Morrison. Reinhold Heil Jim Morrison. Sorry. Sorry about my Alzheimer. And they talk to him and say, “It’s not about the band, it’s about you, man. You should go solo.” And I think that’s exactly what happened there. So then she went solo, and she went really downhill, because she just randomly took musicians, and then she kind of stabilized and had a deal with CBS in America, and had a pretty good run. Torsten Schmidt How many albums did you guys record with her? Reinhold Heil Two. So we recorded this first album in Hansa. And then the second album, we already had it composed, and arranged, and rehearsed, and tried out on this European tour in the spring of 1979, and then she left the band. And then of course we had negotiations about how to separate, because we had contracts. Luckily, we actually had contracts, because otherwise we would have just been dismissed by the record company, by her, by the management, and so on, and so on. So we kind we had a bit of a negotiation, a strong position of negotiating. We could have blocked her for many years. Of course, we didn’t want to do that, but we said we want to get something out of it.
So what we got out of it was the publishing rights, and the fact that we actually did record that second album. And this was after we were already sort of hating each other in public. We recorded an album. And the plan was that we were going to record the backing tracks at Hansa Studios here in Berlin, and that she was going to sing in Stockholm at the Abba studios without us being present. And at the last second, she changed her mind, and she came to the Hansa studios. And we had actually a really interesting week with her in the studios. And it was sort of the beginning of my career at a producer, ’cause I wasn’t her ex-boyfriend. That was Manne, our bass player, so there was. Torsten Schmidt Manne Praeker. Reinhold Heil Manne Praeker. It was a bit of a problematic situation. And I was the one who studied music production, more on the classical side. So I was like super interested to produce her vocals. And I did that. And I kind of learned how to do it. And of course I had the experience of one and a half years in the band, that if you wanted to contribute an idea, you don’t go and say, “I have an idea, and it is blah blah blah blah blah” You just say it surreptitiously, and you float it. And then when she says, “Hey, why don’t we do this?” You go like, [does a thumbs-up] awesome. ...It’s one thing to deal with narcissists, problematic personalities. If you want the situation to function, of course. The other thing would be to say, “You’re a narcissist, let me just walk away from you.” Because that’s what you do with narcissists, usually. But unfortunately we’re in the entertainment industry, so we have to deal with narcissists, and if we’re not a narcissist ourselves, then we are an enabler, automatically. And the more aware we are of that, the better, you know? Just at least understand what the situation is psychologically. So that was a very, very interesting learning experience. And there was this guy Edu Meyer, who was one of Hansa’s engineers who had worked on all the Bowie albums. He wasn’t intimately involved in the production, but he came and... He lived out in Britz, which is not far from here on the other side. And he had the home-grown marijuana that was just the best stuff. It was like champagne, it was amazing. I’m not much of a marijuana guy, but this was so good, and it actually helped us go through that week. [picks up a record] So, should we play “African Reggae,” maybe? Torsten Schmidt Give peace a chance. Reinhold Heil From that album? No? Torsten Schmidt Maybe. I mean, considering we’re already 40 minutes in, it’s like... Yeah, but “African Reggae” would be the one to look for right now. While you probably tell us one or two things about the historical importance or significance of Hansa Studios, have you tell us a little bit more... [Heil puts the record on the turntable] Oh. Oh yeah. OK. Maybe let’s get a quick idea of it, then. Reinhold Heil No, no. I can, we can talk about it. Hansa Studios was in this old ballroom at the wall, and looking out at the wall. And at Potsdamer Platz where you cannot imagine how it looks unless you look at photos. It was this beautiful, old turn-of-the-century building that was the only one of it’s kind, and there was basically no man’s land around it. Here was the wall, and then there was more no man’s land, and there was the second wall, and you could see Hitler’s bunker. There was this little hill in the no man’s land that had been Hitler’s bunker. And when you walked onto the platforms on the Western side, you could overlook this situation, and sometimes you would just stand there during the day and go like, why is this moving? And you realized there were hundreds and hundreds of rabbits, because they didn’t have any natural enemies and they weren’t heavy enough to trigger the mines, the landmines that were in the... Torsten Schmidt In the death strip. Reinhold Heil In the death strip. So, yeah, that was kind of interesting. Torsten Schmidt But on the more uplifting, musical side, what were the things that were recorded in there? Reinhold Heil Yeah, well the Berlin trilogy of David Bowie’s mainly. And then a whole bunch... I really don’t have an encyclopaedic memory of what was recorded there. Torsten Schmidt Like Udo Jürgens, Frank Zander, Depeche Mode. Reinhold Heil Oh, for sure. Depeche Mode later, yes, in the ’80s. All the really, really good Depeche Mode stuff. Construction Time Again, one of my all-time favorite albums, actually, really good, was produced there. And, yeah, it had this big hall that wasn’t particularly suitable for recording. And perversely, because it was still the ’70s, they had all these walls blocking off so that it wasn’t... That the ambiance of the room wasn’t so prominently featured. Until we did the second album, when we said, “Hey, let’s put the drums on the stage and record the room.” So we kind of insisted on that. Hansa guys weren’t interested, they wanted the dry ’70s sound. So anyway, this is then “African Reggae.” So this is from that second album that we recorded at Hansa Studios, with her not there, but then coming and recording the vocals. And the vocals are really, really chaotic. There’s a s--- ton of stuff that you don’t hear that we had to sort through at the end. It’s very, very improvisational. And unfortunately, it’s also a long piece. (music: Nina Hagen Band – “African Reggae”) Torsten Schmidt Right. “African Reggae,” the Nina Hagen Band. [applause] And I guess that something that we will get to a little later as well is, you can definitely see a lineage of why something like Maurizio and Basic Channel also happened in this town. It wasn’t only the love for Jamaica, but there was people experimenting with off-beat things in this town beforehand. The band that’s playing on there, what happened when you got abandoned? Reinhold Heil We decided to stick together somehow and do something. Actually, this is a time when our manager kind of came in and really played a big role. This guy’s name is Jim Rakete, and he was a photographer, really, originally. He wasn’t a music manager, and slipped into it because he was so fascinated with Nina. So two years earlier, back in ’78, he became our manager, and then later became Nina’s manager, and had a management company for about, not quite ten years. And he came at this point, and he said, “We have to do something like a concept album. And you used to do rock theater,” which was the other three guys, not me, “So let’s do something like that.” And we did it in English language, it was called the Spliff Radio Show, and it was the story of a pop star. The rise and fall of a pop star. Actually, we did it a year or two before Spinal Tap, and it was a little bit similar. It was maybe not quite as funny. And so we got ourselves a front person, and we called them “front pigs,” because of course we were traumatized by Nina, so we called the front person... Torsten Schmidt It’s also an old military term. Reinhold Heil Front pig? Torsten Schmidt Yeah. “Frontschwein.” Yeah. Reinhold Heil Right. So we hired the front pigs. We were not the backing band who was hired by a famous star, we were the backing band hiring front pigs. So we should have just gone to therapy, I think it would have been a lot easier, but... So we did this project, and it was also pretty energetic. And our Australian front pig that we hired, his name is Alf Klimek, was an amazing, energetic comedian and actor, and not much of a singer, but he was really good. So we toured Germany over, I guess, two years with that, and we sold many records, but never enough to go into the charts. So we sold something like 35,000 every six months, it wasn’t enough to get into the German charts at the time. Just to give you an idea how many records people bought. This stuff. It was amazing. Like people had, you know, like the Nina Hagen Band album I think sold 500,000 in Germany. The first one. The second one, maybe 350 or something. And the Spliff Radio Show ended up selling 250, which is a gold record, but over many years. So that was kind of the foundation. It was a bit of an underground hit, maybe. And of course, we had a lot of people following us because of the Nina Hagen Band, so it was easier for us to start. And then, we changed the direction. We fired all of our front pigs, and we wrote some German stuff again, and we sang it ourselves, although none of us was a particularly great singer. So we kind of just blended in with that Neue Deutsche Welle, the new German wave that started with Nina, but then had bands like Ideal, most prominently Fehlfarben, all these kinds of things. Really, really good stuff, actually. DAF, Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, still pretty much my favorite band from that time, which has a lot to do with Conny Plank, the producer. One of my regrets is never going to Conny Plank and becoming his assistant for a year or two. Missed opportunities. Torsten Schmidt Well that Rhineland countryside life is not for everyone. Reinhold Heil [laughs] Yeah. I was kind of happy to be in Berlin. And stuff was obviously happening, so there wasn’t ever the time where I had to go look for stuff, it just came to me, luckily. Torsten Schmidt Ironically, the song that then all of a sudden propelled you out of that slow-selling, underground following thing did not have only German lyrics in there. And I guess there’s a bit of a story. Reinhold Heil Yeah. We then went back to Paul-Lincke-Ufer, by the way, with the Spliff Radio Show, they let us back in there, which is remarkable. And we started recording. We had an eight-track tape machine. And then there was a room in Moabit, least likely to be a cool place in Berlin, but it was like a giant hall, and they had a food großhandel. Torsten Schmidt Wholesale. Reinhold Heil Yeah. And there was a cooling section, so that was fairly well insulated, and that became the Spliff studio. So we called ourselves Spliff, we rented a place that was suitable to be a studio, a rehearsal room where you could actually record. We bought a recording desk, that was what we toured with, because we knew we wanted a recording desk. We didn’t have enough to buy two desks, so we bought the recording desk and toured with it. And then we produced that album, 85555 in 1981. Here’s the original pressing. [holds up record] This is Jim Rakete’s cover design. He used the American way, of doing a paper back with the silver foil, very nice. And he did horrible photos of us. He put us in suits and shirts. Torsten Schmidt That’s one of the most expensive photographers you can find in this town and this country. Reinhold Heil Hate, hate, hate every photo from that era. So we did these weird minimalist German songs, and we changed our approach. Everything had always been played live by the band, rehearsed to death, so every note was there. And then we played it live, mostly without clicks, and that was the two Nina Hagen Band albums and the Spliff Radio Show album, all done this way. And now we had our own studio, and we had our own 24-track machine, and Neumann microphones, and the minimum, bare minimum what you needed to do a professional recording. And, of course... Torsten Schmidt Bare minimum, Neumann, yeah. Reinhold Heil It was 120,000 Deutschmarks that our publishing company gave us in advance, in order to get us the bare minimum. We had an Otari 24-track machine. Our desk we already had. We had to have two big JBL speakers. So today, how much do you need? 5,000? Torsten Schmidt Yeah, but that Neumann would still help. Reinhold Heil Yeah, but you have all these copies now that you can buy for 350 that don’t sound that much worse. So it’s a different situation. Of course, you can also no longer make money with music, so there’s the trade-off. Torsten Schmidt But then I guess you kind of did... And before we usher in video number two, so the people would know what to watch for. You got rid of the front pigs. Who is singing on that track? Reinhold Heil I am singing on that track. I also wrote it. I wrote it in about five minutes, and it’s one of those silly things that kind of follow you, like a piece of s--- that you stepped into. And I don’t hate it, because I always... People say, “Well, don’t you hate this song, because it makes you so unhip, because it’s such a schlager?” And I go, “No, I don’t hate it, because... I actually love it because I moved in it.” Meaning, the royalties from that song enabled me to buy a beautiful loft with my own studio in it, in Schöneberg. So I don’t hate the song. Torsten Schmidt And a lot of kids around Germany and other countries got to... Reinhold Heil And so, of course, long, long story... And I’m so sorry about my tangents. I always go off on tangents. And I asked him to keep me in check, and it’s almost impossible, I know. Torsten Schmidt We have whips hidden... Reinhold Heil But you asked me about the Italian. Why is there Italian in there? So it’s a song that longs for Italy. I love Italy, and it’s full of stereotypes of Italy. And the reason why it’s called “Carbonara,” is because we went from that rehearsal room in Huttenstraße in Moabit, to the next corner, and there was an Italian restaurant, which wasn’t Italian, it was run by Lebanese people. Torsten Schmidt Like almost any Italian restaurant in this town. Reinhold Heil Yeah. And the Lebanese lady there was so nice. Whenever we had a record done, or whenever we were getting ready to go on tour, she would stand in the kitchen for a day and cook Lebanese food for us. It was so amazing. So, and of course we ate carbonara for six Deutschmarks and 50, and drank a Coke, because we really didn’t have that much money, right? So we did that almost every day. So that’s where the inspiration to the song comes from, and it’s all about the fantasy of going to Italy and meeting one of those beautiful Italian girls. Torsten Schmidt Video number two, please. (video: Spliff – “Carbonara (live in 1982”)
Well, there’s Italians in the room as well. Reinhold Heil It’s live. It was live. Oh my god, the other guy sang so much better than I, I am so out of tune, and they are actually really backing me up. They have more practice. Torsten Schmidt What did change with that song? For the band, what did it change? Reinhold Heil Well, we had number one album with this album. And there were actually some other really, really good songs on it. It’s totally worth listening to. And this was just... It made it to number five in the singles charts. It was funny, because there were people who were placing bets that we were going to completely flop with this, when we first presented it, because of the context that we presented it into that was at ZDF Rocknacht in Westfalenhalle. 20,000 people who came to see Foreigner, Meatloaf and Saga. And they threw us in there as the opener. And we played them an album that nobody had heard because it wasn’t on the market yet. It was December ’81. And people were like, “What?” And the second night, we actually, luckily... They had two nights. The second night, we sprinkled in a few pieces from the Spliff Radio Show that a lot of people had known. So it was a much better night. But the response in a 20,000 auditorium, playing this completely new album was absolutely flat. Nobody was interested. So then we went on tour and it went, took like four or five months and then it was number one. Because people were able to listen to the recording at home, so they understood what the lyrics were and I guess, it didn’t translate into a giant Westfalenhalle. Torsten Schmidt So when you’re right there in the middle of Westfalenhalle you’re playing... I mean, flat is better than getting bottles thrown at you. But still, how much did you want the floor to open and swallow you? Reinhold Heil You know, I don’t know. It’s interesting, because we had our fair share of embarrassing appearances. We had certainly concerts that weren’t attended well. Stuff like that. So at least there were a lot of people there and we were very much in a fighting spirit. So we didn’t give up. It wasn’t, “OK, this is the end of it.” Although other people around us were crying, literally crying and saying, “This is the end.” And we didn’t feel it, like that. We knew we had something good at our hands. Torsten Schmidt But outside of, what at the time for many people would be considered a novelty hit, you had other material on the album that people loved. And with the next album, you had another big hit that we’re not going to listen to, “Das Blech,” which... Reinhold Heil I actually had that for that first album already, but I wasn’t done with the lyrics. So luckily, we had that on the album right after. But actually, that second album came out nine months after the first one. Which is ridiculous, when you think about it. Torsten Schmidt That’s pretty brave, though. But then again... Reinhold Heil It wasn’t us, it was the record company. Greedy, greedy, greedy. Oh look, they had a number one. Let’s put the other one out. Torsten Schmidt “Das Blech,” as you say, you wrote the lyrics. What are the references in there? Reinhold Heil References? You mean, what are you talking about? What the lyrics are saying? Torsten Schmidt Yeah. Reinhold Heil Well, it’s you go into the club and you take in the club scene. And god, it’s really not a deep lyric. Should I give you the philosophy behind what it’s like to go into a club... Torsten Schmidt No, no. There was talk also about references... Reinhold Heil There were references to James Brown, of course. There were reference to classical music, how I hate classical music, how I love the dance music and it had a four on the floor beat. It wasn’t techno but it was kind of... Disco, if you want to call it that. And it didn’t have a chorus, it actually had... The chorus was instrumental, it was all synthesizer. So it was very unconventional and it just had a clever, little hook line and it had that little banter about what it’s like in a club. Torsten Schmidt Maybe we should play it, even though we were not going to. So just that you get a feel for it. Reinhold Heil Yeah like, you know, James Brown’s coming and talking to me and says, “How dare you steal black music.” (music: Spliff – “Das Blech”) Torsten Schmidt So “Das Blech” by Spliff, which, hard to believe, was a massive, massive hit then. Reinhold Heil Yeah, I don’t know massive. It went to number five, just like “Carbonara” did. Torsten Schmidt I mean, that’s in times when number five meant more than the entire top 100 would sell in a week these days. Reinhold Heil Yeah, but that’s the time. There were people selling millions of records at the time. And it wasn’t us. Torsten Schmidt What I found more interesting though is, there’s other tracks on there, like “Die Maurer” or “Glaspalast,” and I would to listen a little bit to “Glaspalast,” with you probably telling us what the song is about and then how... Reinhold Heil I can’t tell you because that’s a Herwig Mitteregger song, and he always wrote metaphoric lyrics, which I loved, I adored his lyrics. My lyrics were always on the nose, pretty clear, “This is the story I’m telling and ha, ha, ha. Or not.” And I actually learned how to hate that. This is why I actually also stopped writing songs and went into producing. I just didn’t see myself as an entertainer and I loved people who wrote more [Bob] Dylan-inspired lyrics, for instance. And it didn’t matter whether the music’s like Dylan, but just metaphoric poetry for lyrics. And Mitteregger is like that. So he’s talking about the Glaspalast. I don’t know what it is... Torsten Schmidt What is your guess? Reinhold Heil I don’t know, it’s some sort of ivory tower. What’s your guess? Do you have one? Torsten Schmidt I mean I was like, what, seven at the time or so. And it just felt with all the Cold War paranoia that there’s a lot of that in, ’cause the track is a bit paranoid, too, in a way. Reinhold Heil For sure, but it’s also very cinematic. So we were always thinking about creating movies. And this is kind of funny, because now I’m working for movies. But we were trying to produce these movies in people’s heads when they listen to the songs. “Glaspalast” for sure one that does that. One of my favorite tracks. There’s a lot of synth in there. (music: Spliff – “Glaspalast”)
[applause] Yeah, I haven’t heard this piece in a long time. It’s a very obviously anti-war song. So, you know. It’s not that metaphoric. I guess the Glaspalast is the people who send the hundreds of thousands of people out to fight, and they’re sitting... Anyway, yeah. Torsten Schmidt You were hinting at it being cinematic and that obviously became your second career later. At that time, you already had a first interaction with the TV and scoring world, right? Reinhold Heil Yeah, it was Tatort, and we did a feature film and we did it with technology that was not suited for doing movies, movie work. So we used stopwatches and we had no idea what we were doing. We also didn’t even ever ask somebody who would do it. So it was kind of, it was pretty awful. Torsten Schmidt But I mean it’s not entirely bad. A lot of other people... Reinhold Heil The Tatort was pretty bad, I think. There’s one piece I really liked that was at the end of it. But... Torsten Schmidt But doing a Tatort was not a bad thing... Reinhold Heil You’re not going to play one of those, are you? Torsten Schmidt No, no, no. Reinhold Heil Oh, good. Torsten Schmidt No, this isn't, ain't Nardwuar. But doing a score for Tatort was a thing that a lot of other German bands, that people would search out for nowadays, which do a lot, like Can, Irmin Schmidt, Popul Vuh, tons of people, would try that... What is the format? It’s a weekly... Reinhold Heil It’s a weekly, it’s one and a half hours. It’s different teams of crime-fighting cops. So you have these different stars and it’s as federal as the federal republic of Germany. So you have each ARD station is doing their own kinds of Tatorts and I guess they have two months to do them, because it takes the round. I don’t know. So we did the [Horst] Schimanski Tatort. That of course, was pretty legendary in the ’80s. He was pretty good. Pretty funny. Torsten Schmidt Everything that happened during the Spliff times also led you to probably like a next step in the career, and I would love to see 20 to 30 seconds of clip number four. (video: The Stripes – “Tell Me Your Name”)
So the quality of the recording is sadly not there but it’s something that’s pretty tough to find these days. How did you hear about this band? Reinhold Heil I was at the office in Frankfurt, CBS records, in A&R manager’s office. And I was going through a list of 45s, just while talking to him, absentmindedly going through. And then of course, stopping with one where there was a picture of a very cute girl. And I took it out and it said, “Ecstasy.” I said, “Oh wow, she’s into sex overtly? Hmm. Let me listen to this.” And they put it up and it was this song by The Stripes and they were singing in English and she was singing in English. It was called “Ecstasy” and she was super sexy. And I said, “Well this is not something that would sell but she’s good. Her voice sounds really cool.” So I didn’t think much of it and then six to nine months later, the A&R manager called me up and says, “Well the band split up. We kept the singer, obviously. She’s moving to Berlin and we’re giving her a solo deal and maybe she’s looking for some musicians and they’re looking for a producer. Would you want to do it?” I said, “Sure, we have a studio. Why not.” So they were clever, they gave us this 120,000 and they got the biggest million-selling hits produced in this s--ty little cooling room in Moabit for very, very little money. I mean, the productions were ridiculously cheap for them. It was very profitable for them. For us, too, but it also destroyed our band, because she became so big that the entire management, the entire infrastructure that we had created for ourselves was basically... This band was sucking the air out of the room. And we felt like we were almost superfluous and it was really diminishing our drive as a band. Because I was then very much focused on it and produced... The first album, we produced really quickly, like in about four weeks. Then of course, with the success, you get that Fleetwood Mac effect. The third album took five months and I had two off days in the five months. It was completely ridiculous. And the success went down from there, from the four weeks of having just fun and not thinking about anything. To, “Oh my god, we need to be internationally competitive now. We have to do all this, put a string section on and this and that.” Taking five months to do it and I think from the first ... It was a million. The second was just over half a million and the third was about a quarter of a million. So we’re halving the success with tripling the effort. Torsten Schmidt So before we get into the laborious efforts of trying to keep up something, maybe let’s skip “Nur geträumt” and rather go to number five, video number five please. (video: Nena – “99 Luftballons”)
Reinhold Heil [applause] So these were the early days of MTV, where in America and in Britain they were already producing really elaborate and expensive music videos. Very creative. By some of the best filmmakers they had. And we in Germany didn’t do that. And we also didn’t want to spend that money and we didn’t think that any of our stuff would sell outside of the country. So what happened there was, this was a Dutch TV station that invited Nena and they produced something like a really cheap music video on one of their Truppenübungsplätze so where they did the war games. That’s why they were able to actually detonate something at the end, for reals. But it was kind of a s--ty video. And then CBS took that, gave them a little money for it and that was what was running on MTV in America. Didn’t prevent the success, obviously. Torsten Schmidt Who made the call? Because the first song that she had out, which was... I want to say a number one hit, “Nur Geträumt.” Reinhold Heil Number two. It actually flopped first. It came out, we produced it in January, came out in May, with a cover that showed Nena on it, but she kind of looked like she was emaciated. It was a pretty awful photo. Very artistic but she just didn’t look the way she really looked. And it was kind of a cheap, stupid looking cover and didn’t do anything. So completely flopped. And then she was invited, the band was invited to a nationwide broadcast with only German language songs. And they re-released the single with a different cover. And then it went number two. And started this whole craziness. And after that, we produced the album in the fall of, I think ’82. Torsten Schmidt I mean the first song was a pretty traditional boy meets girl or girl dreams about boy kind of scenario. Classic bubble gum kind of pop. And this was at the height of East/West tension, nuclear paranoia to the max. And this song about the 99 balloons that somehow... Reinhold Heil Trigger World War three, yes. Torsten Schmidt But at the same time, catchy as hell. How did the Americans take to it? How did they even hear about it? Reinhold Heil Yeah. That was an interesting thing. The lyric, by the way, written by the guitar player who was a, what they call, gypsy. He was a roamer, I think. And he was one of the sweetest people I’ve ever known, he’s unfortunately no longer with us. Pretty genius lyricist and he came up with that story. And it was just absolutely magical. And actually how it even became a single was a thing, because people in the band and around the band were all saying, “This is the next single.” And I was going, “But this is not a conventional piece of pop song.” It’s very different, it has these three very different parts, it has a little funky thing and then it goes up tempo. I don’t know. And so was the A&R manager of CBS records. So we had a long conversation, about an hour long, where we were debating whether this could be a single or not. And at the end, we were going, “OK, f--- it. Let’s just do it, see what happens.” And it was really the stupidest conversation you could imagine. Because everybody else who had heard the song was like, “This is amazing.” And we just had to overthink it. So... Torsten Schmidt And how did it reach... Reinhold Heil And then America. So America was, there was another big phenomenon in the ’70s here, which was called Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo and it was the story of a girl who at 14 had to prostitute herself at the Bahnhof Zoo in order to finance her heroin addiction. And her name was Christiane F. And she also became a musician and she had an album out, in ’82. And she traveled the world. It was very underground, it wasn’t mainstream at all. So she went to Los Angeles and a very famous radio DJ, Rodney Bingenheimer, interviewed her, and at the end of the interview asked her, “So what are people listening to in Germany?” And she reached into her little briefcase and pulled out “99 Luftballons.” And she played it and people called into the radio station saying, “Can you play that again?” So this is how it started, where CBS records US, in New York didn’t give a s---. And the A&R manager there, I met him about a year later. He told me the story. He was totally in my face, he didn’t care how bad he looked in the story. He told me that his girlfriend was from the publishing company, who also administered the rights to this song, and who had become aware of it, because there was some airplay going on, and who had told him, “You have to release this. You have to put this song on the release schedule.” And he was not interested one bit. Until she finally decided to no longer have sex with him, because of that. And I actually believe that and I actually believe that there might be tons of other reasons why she didn’t have sex with that guy. He was a complete fucking dork. [laughter] Anyway... Torsten Schmidt I mean, it’s a Greek theme. There’s Greek plays about that. Reinhold Heil I guess. So she said, “No more sex unless you put that on the schedule.” He put it on the schedule on a Friday so he could have sex on the weekend, I guess. On Monday, is being called into his boss’s office and said, “What’s with this German girl that gets all the airplay, are we doing anything about that?” And he’s like, “I just put it on the release schedule.” And his career was saved that way. But it’s basically a one-off. It’s a one-hit wonder. It’s considered a one-hit wonder in the States but absolutely everybody knows the piece. So if I want to make myself important, I just bring up that I produced it. Torsten Schmidt In America. Reinhold Heil In America, yes. Torsten Schmidt Why do you think she never caught on in the same way she caught on in Germany, for example? Reinhold Heil They didn’t tour there and they didn’t get any support from the record company. I mean, they toured pretty much everywhere else. I don’t really think they every did a proper America tour and I think that’s what it really takes. And then all the international production was no longer exotic sounding. So there’s your clever strategy of, “Oh we need to sound international.” No we don’t. Torsten Schmidt Which is kind of interesting... Reinhold Heil We have to sound like ourselves, you know. And that’s the big lesson to learn for everybody, from pretty much any story you will hear. Just sound like yourself. Be confident and find something, find something for yourself that’s kinda cool. And then stick to it. Torsten Schmidt Speaking of which, it might be worth watching 45 seconds of video number six, which is where she was on Top of the Pops in England, and you can get an idea of how they translated the lyrics. Even if you don’t understand the lyrics, it will sound like a different song straight away. Reinhold Heil Well, of course everything had to go really fast. It had airplay in America already, so, “We have to do an English lyric version!” Which is true. They had to do an English lyric version, because American mainstream radio would not play foreign language songs. No Spanish, no “Despacito,” nothing, at that time. Those are all completely separate markets, and so then who was going to do the lyric? It was a guy who played keyboards for Barclay James Harvest, who they had by chance met somewhere. And he had a little demo studio at home, and he put it on the drum computer and made a little arrangement for himself, because he’s a keyboard player so he could do that. Everything was nice and metronomic, whereas in the German version, the beginning and the end are freely performed. The keyboard player wrote the music, played the string synthesizer pad, and she was singing simultaneously in the studio. So we did click track for the rest of it, but the beginning and the ending, completely free. And of course he did it with the drum computer, and his lyrics were pretty much not fitting on this thing. And how she pulled it off, I have no idea, but she did pull it off to somehow squeeze these words into this free-played opening and ending of the song. And I lobbied the s--- out of everybody to try and get a better English lyric and it didn’t happen, because it had to happen so fast. Torsten Schmidt So please, 45 seconds of that tragedy. (video: Nena – “99 Red Balloons” (live on Top of the Pops))
How does that feel, when you worked on something real hard, you have a vision, and then there is some dork somewhere saying, “F--- off. No?” Reinhold Heil Yeah, well I wasn’t the boss of the whole thing. I was also just an enabler. Management was more important, record companies were more important at that point, and I wasn’t a powerful producer. I was there every moment, and I was telling them my opinion about everything, and sometimes they would listen and sometimes they wouldn’t. In that case, they wouldn’t. The vindication that comes later is kind of painful too, because the guy sued us. He didn't to, he actually wanted 100% of the lyrics because “99 Red Balloons” was not a translation of “99 Luftballons.” Torsten Schmidt So hang on, he did a wack job, and then he used that as justification? Reinhold Heil Yes, and he won in Great Britain, because the judge just thought that made sense, but he didn’t win for the rest of the world. But he actually got all the lyrics, and so everybody else got correspondingly less money for it. It was kind of funny. Torsten Schmidt Okay, maybe there’s the root of Brexit right there somewhere. Reinhold Heil Maybe. Torsten Schmidt Speaking of being right there, you were, outside of being a producer, you were a keyboardist mostly, or a key player. How does that feel when you write and compose something, and then you have some other guy perform your stuff all the time? Reinhold Heil Well, I didn’t write “99 Red Balloons,” so I didn’t write any of their material. It was kind of the other way around. People were very respectful of Spliff as being really, really good musicians, so there was now a really good and very successful album that came out simultaneously, right after our successful stuff came out, right in the middle of it, and they were going, “Oh yeah, of course it’s not that band that’s playing, it’s the Spliff people.” And that’s not true. I mean, I play certain things on that album, because...but I didn’t write them, so it was the other way around. I became a session musician for my artists when I thought, “Well, the funky part, come on, you can play that better.” And then we’d try it for awhile, and he says, “Why don’t you play it?” And I played it, and so it’s on there now, but most the stuff is for sure him, and all the drums, that’s the drummer. There was a lot of hard work going into making it a thing that the band actually did, and they did the arrangements, they worked the music. I was hoping they would get the glory, and they kind of did. Torsten Schmidt I guess they kind of did. How many keytars did that guy own? Reinhold Heil In the studio, there’s never a keytar. Torsten Schmidt But I mean, there were a lot of kids who were like, “What is that thing?” Reinhold Heil Yeah, it’s nothing, it’s just a thing that works on television. But there’s a new keytar by Roland, and I’m not saying that it shouldn’t be pursued, especially since it’s lightweight and very powerful and wireless. It’s the opposite of why I had it, I had a thing that was called Moog Liberation. It was not a liberation, it was a burden. It was hanging around your head like this, the weight of about five guitars. And it had a power supply in it, no it didn't have a power supply...It had a synth in it, and that sounded s--ty, so you had to send that to a module at an Oberheim SEM. I did that only during the radio show, it was just so stupid I just couldn’t go on with it. And then MIDI came, and it was a little bit better, then the Yamahas came out. Then when you see Uwe, the keyboarder from Nena, he always has that thing, and pretends that he played that on the record, of course he didn’t play it on the record. Torsten Schmidt Don’t ruin it. No, but at the same time I was really glad when Flake of Rammstein, told us that he, as a kid, like many kids when they saw performances like that, would start painting or drawing little keys on cardboard and then building their own little synths, and then just play around. Reinhold Heil Yes. Of course, because it looks so stupid, you’re stationary behind this thing. This is why I always stood behind my keyboards, I couldn’t sit down. Now if I would play live, I’m 64 years old, I would definitely sit down. I have not even 20% of that energy that I had back then, I would practice for hours to jump as high as I could possibly do it, which required to be on a certain offbeat when you jumped, so that you could come down and hit some accent exactly right. That required real energy and real practice, I wouldn’t do that anymore. Torsten Schmidt You didn’t need a gym then. Reinhold Heil No. And then we stopped playing live and I got all fat, that’s true. Torsten Schmidt Still, when the gym wasn’t needed, maybe speaking of keyboard sounds, there’s this guy. (music: Nena – “Leuchtturm”)
[applause] I guess what’s kind of interesting there is how there’s different worlds coming together. You’ve got a very synth-heavy sound, you’ve got something that hints at certain elements of maybe even dance music and underground dance music, and then at the same time you’ve got this super macho guitar riff, which is a combination that worked a lot in pop music at the time. Like Trevor Horn and a lot of people would do, I don’t know, let’s say Yes, “Owner Of A Lonely Heart” and songs like that, which would really try to... Reinhold Heil Yeah, that was of course much better, because it also had Art Of Noise people in it. So you had the Fairlight sampling stuff, you had the origins of break beats, which we didn’t have at all. So like that kind of visionary thing that Trevor Horn had going, and what else was happening at the time that had break beats already in the early ’80s. I don’t think we were that groundbreaking with any of this stuff, and again, this is also from the first album still in ’82, so it was very playful. The band was very playful, and this was one of the pieces where they allowed me to do something. So I did the beginning, the whole little bubbly thing with the echo sound, that was actually a modular, it was a Roland System 100m that that was done with, and we used a lot of my Jupiter-8 on the album, otherwise it was all Oberheims. Beloved, beloved Oberheims. I adore Tom Oberheim. He’s one of...I don’t have many idols, Miles Davis, Igor Stravinsky, Tom Oberheim maybe. Torsten Schmidt He’s a sweet, sweet man. Reinhold Heil Yes, and he’s a genius. I have a four-voice that I just had restored, it’s just ridiculous. But I do everything in a box, by the way, so everything I do for movies... I have a modular, I use it every once in awhile, but really if it has to go fast and if I have to reproduce something, you know. Torsten Schmidt Using that as a segue into your second life, and speaking of box, I mean it sounds super minimal, but at that time or somewhere around that time you also owned one of those Fairlights as well? Reinhold Heil Yeah, I bought a Fairlight in ’84, and I bought a IIx series, IIx which comes from 1978, ’79, you know, so it was already at the end of its lifespan, and the [Emu] Emulator II had just come out, and I wanted one, and we were going on tour, and I couldn’t get the Emulator II, because they kept pushing the release of it. You know, “vaporware,” you know what I’m talking about. So I bought the IIx and I took it on tour, which was an absolute frigging disaster. You know, eight-bit synth, it’s super legendary but you have nothing in there, there’s no sample memory in there to speak of, eight-inch floppy disks, stuff would break, collapse in the middle of a gig, and it was just pretty awful. And I bought it because they promised me I would have to only pay the price difference once the series three came around, which was two years later, and then it was another 100,000. It was ridiculous, yeah, definitely not... Torsten Schmidt I mean, 100,000 then would get you, what, like two houses? Reinhold Heil No, no, no, not quite. An apartment in Berlin was already several hundred thousand, but you could’ve gotten an apartment for the Fairlight, yes. A small one. Torsten Schmidt Why? Reinhold Heil No, that’s a good question. There’s no reason, there’s no reason. Because I could. And status, I don’t know. I don’t think I ever made anything super famous with it. I did good stuff with it, but not anything that became a huge hit or anything. Torsten Schmidt When does this whole thing become a bit of a trap, when you’re like, “OK, I’ve got this advance money coming in, I’ve got some new royalty checks here, I’ve got a little bit of that and this,” and it’s like, “Oh yeah, of course I’m going to... Instead of an apartment I’m going to get another machine?” Reinhold Heil Well, luckily I did get the apartment first so. And there was a thing, you know, West Berlin was entrapped here, so there was a lot of tax incentives to stay in West Berlin. Actually, it was not a bad time to invest in gear. Torsten Schmidt Jumping ahead in time, why and when did you leave Berlin? Reinhold Heil I left in early ’97, and yeah, I don’t know, I was a producer for the rest of the ’80s, I was very unhappy about that at the end of the ’80s, because I thought it was going to be all glorious, because it started with “99 Red Balloons.” Basically started at the top and then worked its way down, which wasn’t surprising because “99 Red Balloons” is a super unusual situation, with so much luck to make it a world hit. Yeah, but I was also frustrated about the fact that I was just polishing other people’s music. I don’t want to say “turds,” but, you know, other people’s music, and then make it as good as possible, wasn’t the same as writing songs. And I wasn’t really going to go out and do songs, although I actually did produce a solo album in the ’90s. Took me five years, because I was completely OCDing about it, and never released it because I was chicken, because I would’ve had to show myself, basically pull my pants down in front of everybody. And somehow I couldn’t get myself to do that, because of fear of rejection. After so much success, I had fear of failure. And it was really bad, and it’s really, really a sad story. Now also at the same time, I saw that lots and lots of little labels came up, and that kind of gatekeeper thing with the A&R managers was still there, but actually a much bigger variety of musical styles were possible.
I was going, “Yeah, the market is flooded with stuff, what do they need my solo album?” Reality, I was just chicken. So that album is actually still sitting around. I finished it in ’96 and then I moved to the States. I was married to an American woman and she wanted to go back to California, so I moved to California, without a really good plan of breaking into the Hollywood business. And I don’t think I actually ever really broke into that business, and especially because I moved to Santa Barbera, which is two hours outside of Los Angeles, which is way too far away. Torsten Schmidt You’re not attending the film composer Monday brunch in Malibu then? Reinhold Heil No, but I can now because I live in Woodland Hills, it’s just 20 minutes through Topanga Canyon, I could go there. I actually wanted to, sometimes it’s supposedly good, but actually we have a Topanga composer junto, with people like Cliff Martinez and Charlie Clouser, it’s actually really nice, it’s very intimate. Torsten Schmidt That doesn’t sound like an entirely bad breakfast coffee. Reinhold Heil No, that’s not a breakfast, that’s a different thing. It’s actually just for the people around Topanga, so and it’s always in the evening. Yeah, so then I sat in Santa Barbera and I didn’t really know what to do. I actually tried to produce an album with Nina Hagen, who lived in Topanga Canyon at that time. And there was a deal with a record company in Germany, and so I built my studio in Santa Barbera, and I had Nina over, and it completely ended in failure, because I was thinking, “Oh, let me just do an album the way Nina is, let’s just have Nina have the reins.” Of course it was exactly the opposite, because Nina needs a structure, and stuff needs to happen really fast, as long as she’s still interested. She has ADD of the heaviest degree that you can imagine, and she’s at the same time the biggest talent that I’ve ever seen. I mean, on this level like Michael Jackson or so, like completely genius, extemporating lyrics that rhyme, have a rhythm and are funny, for instance, just like that. And I couldn’t get the record finished, because she just lost interest because I was fiddling around with it for too much. So that was my first thing that I did over there, and that was not good. And then the only sort of saving grace was that I had, just before I left, I had met Tom Tykwer, and together with my friend Johnny Klimek, was the younger brother of the guy who was in the Spliff Radio Show, which is why I knew him, we had done a score for Tom’s second movie called Winterschläfer. And so then I put my house on the market, I sold my beautiful apartment in Schöneberg, and I bought a house in Santa Barbara, California and left. And as I’m leaving, Tom gave me the screenplay for Run Lola Run. And I read it, and called Johnny back, Johnny was back here in Berlin, and I said to him, “Even if they don’t pay us any money, we have to do this movie, it’s going to be unbelievable.” Torsten Schmidt What had Johnny done in the meantime? Because he had a bit of a career. Reinhold Heil Johnny had a career in the ’80s with their band called The Other Ones. So they had a few hits, and they were actually also successful in some other countries and had toured. And then they were sick of that, or Johnny was very sick of that, and then he started in ’88, ’89, he started with the techno pioneers. He produced Dr. Motte, and he produced Paul Van Dyk, and had a few solo projects on the side for himself. And then by the mid-’90s, he was sick of that, because he said it became really repetitive. So he was looking for doing something with me, and he realized that I was just sitting around because my girlfriend had died in 1991, so I was in a bit of a slump. I was producing this solo album in my beautiful palace of my studio in Schöneberg, didn’t have that much to do with other people, met some actors, some directors, and got very interested in the film thing, but also was not confident enough that I was able to do that, because I had been in the music academy but I hadn’t studied composition. So I knew music theory, I had written songs, I had ideas, but I thought, “Maybe you can’t do that, since you didn’t do the proper education.” So that took me a lot of years, and then all of the sudden, this opportunity by chance comes up. Of course, it wasn’t that much by chance, because Tom Tykwer had been a fan, he had been in the audience when we played with Nina Hagen. Of course, he had mostly looked at Nina, he was 15 at the time, and sometimes looked over to me because he also played piano. And so when Johnny said that he was working with me, he said, “You don’t mean that guy.” And so that kind of sold him because he had been a fan of the band, and then he wanted to work with me, and so the three of us became sort of a little film music band, and learned in our stupid way how to put music to pictures, how to start telling a story with music, and not having a perfect hit song structure with an intro, a verse, a bridge, and a chorus. Torsten Schmidt As far as division of labor goes, is it easier to work with a director that has no musical ambitions, or do you get in the way if... Reinhold Heil It depends, it completely depends. I mean, in this case it was really nice because he was the boss. You know, that’s the thing in film, it’s a very collaborative thing, film, with so many different arts, and everybody heads a department, there’s a director of photography, a screenwriter and so on and so on. But at the end of the day, there needs to be somebody who calls the shots, and the director is the one who calls the shots, sometimes it’s a producer. Tom was a producer as well, ’cause he was co-owner of a production company, he was also an “Auteurenfilmer,” so he had written the screenplay himself. So it was very clear, nobody had to do the elbow thing like in the band, where everybody’s fighting for dominance of where to go, which direction, which pieces to write and which pieces to do how. So that was a really really nice experience, to go, “You know what? This is kind of cool.” We just offer him a bunch of possibilities, and he just takes his pick, and there’s never a fight, it’s actually always fun. So that’s how that was. Then I was in California and they were here, and we did Run Lola Run. We started here, in Berlin, with the opening, the introduction, we did that in Johnny’s bedroom studio, and then they came over for a few segments, several weeks, and we actually made most of the score in Santa Barbera, in sunny California. It was all about techno and all about Berlin. Torsten Schmidt Shall we watch some of that? Reinhold Heil Sure, why not? (video: Run Lola Run snippet) Torsten Schmidt Writing a pop hit is stressful enough, and writing a solo album, as you told us as well. Now, here you’re entering an arena where you are starting to compete with the Michel Legrand’s and god knows who. Reinhold Heil Yeah, yeah. We were painfully aware of that, and this is why of course Run Lola Run was the perfect entrance, because we would use a familiar vernacular of electronic dance music to score a movie. So there had been other movies at the time, cause we did this in early ’98, late ’97, early ’98, and I think the year before, was Trainspotting. So there was of course a bunch of techno music in Trainspotting and the difference was that in Trainspotting, they used pre-existing music, they licensed a bunch of stuff, Underworld, and really, really, really cool stuff. You can see that the second “Running Two” in Run Lola Run was actually very much influenced by Underworld. Yeah exactly. But, you know, the difference was that we were actually using this style of music and we were working to picture, and I think that hadn’t really been done before, so I think there’s definitely something ground-breaking about that approach. To use a pop music style and actually use it to score a picture in an almost traditional film scoring approach. And, of course, orchestrally, we knew very little, so whenever, then, other challenges came where we had to record an orchestra, we needed to first study it and learn it. So that went on over the years and I think another highlight where that kind of hit us on the highest level was Perfume, and this was in 2005, 2006. We spent about a year writing that score, and it was all orchestral, and we ended up getting the Berliner Philharmoniker under Simon Rattle to perform it, which was kind of... It broke our neck financially, but it was kind of worth it. Torsten Schmidt Which is obviously a very different situation for the director as well, ’cause I mean there he was relatively new with Run Lola Run, and Perfume was one of the biggest-selling German language books in the world, translated in so many languages. Reinhold Heil Yeah, there was pressure. And it wasn’t his own production company. It was actually Constantin Film, so, Bernd Eichinger had gotten the rights for the book. This was actually a movie that was made about just that. There’s a movie about Bernd Eichinger getting the rights for Perfume. Torsten Schmidt Eichinger, probably for context, is the guy who produced Das Boot, The Neverending Story, yadda, yadda, yadda... Reinhold Heil Yeah. The Name of the Rose, things like that. So then Tom was hired as a co-screenwriter and director of Perfume, and he told us in 2004, he said “This is gonna be challenging. Better get rolling right now,” and so we started writing some sketches and very melodic themes, and we did them with some avant-garde ensemble in New York, recorded them really cheaply and sort of had some MIDI mixed with chamber stuff as layouts already before the movie was shot. And this became sort of the blueprint for Tom’s way of working and avoiding using other people’s music to temporarily cut the film. It’s like the worst nightmare of a film composer is the temp music, because by the time the composer comes on and is supposed to write something original for the film, the editor, the director, the producers have seen it a thousand times with somebody else’s music. You know, there might be John Williams or something on there, and you go, “How am I supposed to now come up with something that’s my own idea?” And it’s very, very hard to get that through, and often it means that you just imitate, because otherwise they will fire you. So, there’s the phenomenon of the so-called “temp love,” and in order to avoid that, Tom just said, “Let’s write a whole bunch of music before we even start shooting the movie so then we can temp the movie with our own music.” Torsten Schmidt But you would need a lot of confidence and trust from the director in order to get into that position, I guess. Reinhold Heil Yes. Yeah. Torsten Schmidt Shall we run that example? Reinhold Heil OK so, Perfume, this is from the middle of the film where Grenouille, the guy with the extremely sensitive nose, smells this beautiful girl from like a mile away, ’cause she’s driving by in this stagecoach and he’s then following her. We turned it into a beautiful aria. I think I have to tell you something about the creative process. Wasn’t this also about the creative process? Very interesting, because Tom was shooting... This piece did not exist before the movie was shot. So he was shooting it in Spain, and he had like a very, very simple melody in his head, and it was just like a semitone thing. And he said, “How am I gonna record this?” This was just before iPhones, like literally a year or so before the iPhone, and he didn’t have a little mini recorder on him, so he called his own phone number and left a message and sang onto his voicemail. So then, six months later, we’re sitting in Munich, in post-production, and he says, “Wait, we can call the voicemail. There is a bit of melody.” And so we call the voicemail over and over and over. The problem is, with voicemail, with like telephone, especially with cellphone technology is, they scramble this, they compress it and they compress it optimized for speech, not for pitch. So, the pitch was all over the place and he could not get it together anymore. So we got vaguely inspired by that, it wasn’t really intelligible, what he had sung there. So, but that was the origin of the beautiful soprano piece that we see there, and the rest is just me on the keyboard with a tremolo string sample and then translated onto the page and played by Sir Simon Rattle and the Berliner Philharmoniker. (video: Perfume snippet) Torsten Schmidt Charming. Reinhold Heil Charming young fellow. He wants her scent. [applause] Torsten Schmidt So, how different is the process for working on something like that, with the Berlin Philharmonic, having Sir Simon Rattle there as another gatekeeper, rather than sitting there with your JP8 and the strings on there? Reinhold Heil Well, the thing was, again, this piece didn’t exist beforehand. We had another orchestra session in the middle of this because we got the idea with the Philharmoniker, Simon himself had the idea, cause he, of course, was aware of the novel. He was aware that this was gonna be a big project and Simon is not only a genius musician and the leader of the best band in the world, actually, at that time. I think the Philharmoniker, under Simon, were the best band in the world. Absolutely. Unbelievable. If you ever, I guess it’s over now. He’s gone, right? Is he gone already? Yeah. So, he had the idea because he’s also, of course, a clever marketing person, and he realized that being on this project was gonna be cool. And then, of course, he was a little disappointed with how easy the music was that we wrote, and we, of course, wrote it for the film and everything had to pass muster with Tom, and maybe with Bernd, although Bernd didn’t really get involved. And so we had another orchestra, and we pre-recorded a bunch of this stuff with them, and then we had to, because the Philharmoniker deal wasn’t done, we had to keep them ready to potentially be the orchestra. Then I had the wonderful job to call them up and tell them, “Sorry it’s not gonna be you. It’s gonna be the Philharmoniker after all,” which was probably the s--tiest thing that I’ve ever done as a film composer. So, sorry. And it wasn’t my decision, but you know... Torsten Schmidt Someone’s gotta... Reinhold Heil Somebody’s gotta do the dirty job of telling the poor conductor, who is fantastic. Really, really a wonderful musician, and some snippets made it in there, illegally. So, I don't know, I can’t tell you about the process. I mean, we just worked our asses off for months and months and months, and the film was cut in the meantime, and then it was changed again, and then we had to change the music, and it was basically like babysitting the score. It was totally, it’s not the Hollywood method. The Hollywood method is they shoot the film, they cut the film, they think about who to hire and then they hire a composer, composer gets confronted with a cut that’s pretty close, or maybe not, to the final cut. He’s also confronted with the temp music, and then he starts writing, and he’s a pro and he knows how to do it, and they do it with the best orchestras, with the best technicians, and the best studios, and everything costs a million dollars, and then it’s done. And in our case we didn’t have the budget, we didn’t have the experience, we didn’t have the best musicians, and then after all, we did have the best musicians, but they weren’t experienced with film scoring. So, we of course didn’t give them a click track. Usually you give film players in London or in Los Angeles or in Prague or in Budapest, wherever they are, they play with click tracks. You don’t hire the Berliner Philharmoniker and give them a click track. That’s just not gonna happen. So we did it with streamers, and Simon is a f---ing genius, the way he conducted this. If it wasn’t the first pass, it was definitely the second pass that was just right on. And then the film was still cut a little bit and I had to do a month of music editing, and then it was just done. It’s the opposite of the Hollywood method. Torsten Schmidt Speaking of Hollywood method, and we strongly encourage people to go into your back catalog and look at different examples, but you got even more work in the long-form narrative, AKA binge-watching world, and scored and worked for a lot of different TV series. Reinhold Heil Yeah, that just kind of turned out that way. I don’t know why, but it just turned out that way, and I actually, then, ended up enjoying it quite a bit cause you can start developing things over time because you want to kinda stick to the same thematic material but you want to, obviously, not do it exactly the same way all the time so you have to mix it up and always work it to picture, and you become better in, what I said earlier, the storytelling aspect of film music in a way. And I just put together an album for Deutschland 86, which is the second season of Deutschland 83, which was somewhat unsuccessful in Germany and successful in the rest of the world three years ago. Torsten Schmidt Well, it was probably a little too close to home for most people here. Reinhold Heil I don’t know. I really loved it. I loved working on it. And it was on RTL, so people didn’t really watch it cause it has too many commercial interruptions, and RTL then hated not having good ratings and it took them a long time to find another partner. Now they have Amazon. So, this is gonna come out at the end of the month on Amazon, Deutschland 86.
And it’s the same hero, so it’s a lot of the same thematic material, and a lot of it plays in South Africa. It has to do with apartheid, with the ANC, Angola, Libya and Berlin terrorism, 1986, you know? All based on true historic background, but, of course, dramatized. So, I was able to use a lot of the material from the first season and then make it African, make it Saharan and all that stuff. It was kind of cool. Torsten Schmidt So, you would stick with a character across different seasons and... Reinhold Heil Yeah, not always. I mean, obviously, you want to write a bunch of fresh stuff, right? But there were some themes that were just too connected to characters or to the show itself, so then you find a twist to bring them back. Torsten Schmidt Maybe before we open up for questions, shall we run a little example of some of that TV work? Reinhold Heil Yeah, I don’t know. There’s this really short one and a half minute trailer for the schlockiest show I’ve ever done, which is Helix. That was on the Sci-Fi Channel. It’s a sci-fi show that I very much enjoyed cause it was really a bunch of crazy stuff that I was able to do. There’s three different scenes there, just cut together for an appearance at Comic-Con and the end of it is the main title, which is just a 12-second piece of easy listening music in a horrific, super-schlocky, sci-fi horror TV show. Torsten Schmidt Alright. Reinhold Heil Do you have that one? Helix? Torsten Schmidt Please think of your questions as we run this. (video: Helix snippet) Reinhold Heil The epitome of artistic subtlety and metaphoric work, right? Torsten Schmidt Questions. Audience Member First, I have to say I’ve never heard another synth player use portamento in such a nice way as you do it. And then I read that you, at some point, formed some kind of self-support group with two other producers, Gareth Jones from Depeche Mode and Udo Arndt. What was that like? What did you talk about? Reinhold Heil Well, self-support group. It was a breakfast, you know? Monday mornings. We just went somewhere for breakfast and shared the misery of how it is to produce other people’s music. We all were in Berlin, we were good friends and we worked together on the second album of The Rainbirds, the three of us. Udo Arndt had produced the first one, I had just played some keyboards on it, and then the second one was like another one of those elaborate, “Oh now we have to follow up this breakthrough album with something amazing,” so then we had three producers working on it with Fairlights and Akai samplers and crazy s---. Then we just met on a regular basis and we sort of planned to do a whole bunch of productions together. Crazy thing is, producers don’t get that much money. They get three points and really not that much up front, so that kind of ended fast, and we had to kind of go our separate ways, in terms of the work again, but we’re still good friends. So it was...the support is just being able to talk to another person who understands the situation and you just tell them something, “Oh yeah, of course this is what’s going on.” Just to be able to process it is helpful. It wasn’t really any help, per se, there was never a solution to the problem of having to produce an artist. Audience Member So, what were the problems, exactly? Reinhold Heil Well, you know, things like I hinted at, like all of a sudden, everything has to be higher and better than what they started out with, and when they were successful with what they started out with, you’re like, “Why don’t you just keep on going, and you just keep on having fun and let your creativity flow, and don’t overthink it, and most certainly, don’t think about what other people will think, or what the record company will think. I’m here to protect you from that.” And then you realize you can’t because it’s not like you’re locking them into the studio. So, I think that’s the biggest frustration, is to see it go downhill once the success comes. All of a sudden the fun goes away because there’s so much pressure and that’s very sad. Because I think the best things come without the pressure, when people actually love each other and they make the music because they enjoy each other’s company and they get triggered by each other’s creative sparks. That’s kind of a thread throughout my career, and my career is not that extensive, in terms of my productions. It was several years and it was several projects. There was actually one project where I was really, really, really happy about it, they made such pop music. They were classic pop songs. I was going, “This is going to be a smash hit,” and then, the production took five months and they were talking about stretch limousines and groupies during the production. That thing never even took off because they didn’t even have the innocence that other people had during their first album. So, you know, that was another confirmation of how stupid that is, so I really didn’t want to do it anymore and I haven’t. Torsten Schmidt Damn the ’80s. Audience Member Hello. I have a composition question, kind of a technical one. I guess when writing for TV or film, you’re often given a piece or some imagery that might be 30 seconds or it could be ten minutes, and you know when you’re watching that, when you want a certain moment, a musical moment to happen, do you have any tips or tricks on how to frame your tempo or your timing to get to that point from when you started? Reinhold Heil Yeah. The storytelling thing, it comes with experience. I don’t think about it, I just feel it. And then I don’t get to necessarily do it the way I want to because then there’s a spotting session and of course, you also get the temp music. There’s one tip I can really give you and that is if there’s temp music, and if you know that the scene was cut around the temp music, don’t copy necessarily the temp music, but stick to the pace of the temp music. Figure out what the beats per minute are, if there’s some changes, just stick to that, and you will see that whatever you come up with, it can be completely different, but as long as the pace is the same, it will match, and they will be happy because they’ve gotten used to that kind of pacing. I give you an extreme example. I did one film with Tom Tykwer, which was called Drei, not a very successful, very art-housey movie from 2010, and we didn’t have the budget to do the music beforehand, so there was temp music in there. Some of the temp music was Radiohead. It’s like the worst, right? So you have a song, and Thom Yorke opens his mouth, and you have thick emotion coming from the screen, and you go, “How am I gonna match that? It’s not gonna happen.” So, I had a piece, it was just a piano piece, it was like the opposite of a Radiohead piece, and we’re like, “Maybe we should try this one,” and Tom was like, “I can’t do that. No. No. It has to be something like that.” So, my piece was in a completely different tempo and they had a beautiful montage that was already done. The editor, Mathilde Bonnefoy, was also the lady who cut Run Lola Run, she’s just amazing, had done this beautiful quadruple-screen montage of events that had a certain flow to it that was kind of slow and absolutely one of the most magnificent visual things I’ve ever seen, and then there’s this Radiohead piece, and I’m going, “Oh f---.” So what I ended up doing is, I used a pocket calculator, I determined the beats per minute of the Radiohead piece, I knew my piece wasn’t anywhere near it. I couldn’t possibly run it at that beat per minute, and then I tried different factors, divided by four times three, divided by three times two, or whatever, and I just tried all of them and realized, “OK, this is closest to the Radiohead piece.” So then, I used that tempo that was at a certain factor of the Radiohead piece and, of course, it worked perfectly because the flow of these beautiful, slow montages was still working with my piece. And it took Mathilde, who was the editor, it took her two weeks to convince Tom to try it, and we ended up having it in the movie five times. So that was a humongous success on my part, as a film composer, on a pretty much insurmountable problem, and it was solved with a pocket calculator. It had everything to do with the pacing of the temp music and how the scene was cut around it. Audience Member Amazing, thank you. Torsten Schmidt Well, if there’s no more questions right now, I would very much like you to join me in thanking Mr. Heil for his time and being here tonight. [applause] Reinhold Heil Thank you. It was fun.

Title: Carola Stoiber, “Mad” Mike Banks and Dimitri Hegemann

Carola Stoiber, “Mad” Mike Banks and Dimitri Hegemann
When trying to explain how Berlin developed from a cultural wasteland into a flourishing techno hotspot just a couple of years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the “Berlin-Detroit Axis” is often invoked. Indeed, Berlin’s scene wouldn’t be what it is today if not for the creative exchange between a few forward-thinking figures on both sides of the Atlantic. On the Berlin side were early techno enthusiasts Dimitri Hegemann and Carola Stoiber, who together with Achim Kohlberger founded UFO, Berlin’s first acid house club, in the late ’80s. In 1991, Hegemann then opened Tresor, a club that would significantly contribute to the modern aesthetics of techno. Both Hegemann and Stoiber had been inspired by the raw sound that developed during the ’80s in Detroit, a city facing massive structural change after ongoing de-industrialization. Drawing parallels with the newly reunited city of Berlin, which at the time had hardly any infrastructure at all, they felt their city would be uniquely receptive to Detroit’s utopian techno sound. After inviting “Mad” Mike Banks and Jeff Mills, founders of the collective and label Underground Resistance, to play at Tresor, they developed a close relationship with the Detroit artists. Eventually, in 1991, Underground Resistance’s “X-101” was the first release on Tresor Records, the label later managed and A&Red by Carola Stoiber.
In this very special lecture at Red Bull Music Academy Berlin 2018, the three long-time cultural collaborators talked about the connection between Berlin and Detroit, the importance of local scenes for city development and what Detroit can learn from Berlin today.
Hosted by Torsten Schmidt Well then, 20 years ago we started this thing [Red Bull Music Academy], about 12 minutes in a taxi away from here, and it is pretty safe to say that none of us would be sitting here today, nor would have even thought about starting such a thing, if it wasn’t for these fine people here and the work that they did when we were all wee little teenagers. I would like you to welcome with the uttermost respect and joy Carola Stoiber, Dimitri Hegemann and “Mad” Coach Mike Banks. [applause] So, this might run a little differently to what you expect maybe, and what you’ve heard so far. And in order to get you in the mood, courtesy of DJ Adlib, who runs the editing team on the radio, here’s a little something we prepared earlier, just like on any other good cooking show. (music: Medley – “38 Years of Techno from Around the World”) [applause] Well if this was applause, it was applause for an entire culture, ’cause we’ve heard tracks that are from the last 38 years, I wanna say? Can I get a quick show of hands for people who recognized a track from the city or the area that they grew up in, or do currently live in right now. Really not? Come on. We had a lot of you covered there. Well, that went well, fantastic. Well, you heard things in there from Detroit, from LA, from Paris, from Belgium, from Berlin, Germany, from Durban in South Africa, and a bunch of others, and I guess the idea was to show that even if you don’t use any vocals, even if you don’t have any classic signifiers of placing something geographically, it is a language that’s spoken around the world right now, and it is super versatile, and even if you’re only hearing a few bars of something, you can instantly get a feel of “Oh, I know this is from that place.” And we somehow believe, with all these hyped places that there are in the world, people put way too little emphasis on their actual surroundings, and that is what we want these fine people to talk about today. Carola, where were you raised? Carola Stoiber I was raised in North Germany, in a very small town with maybe even 200 people living there, and there was nothing going on, so I decided very early that I had to move to Berlin. Torsten Schmidt I mean at that time, Berlin was not the most natural place to move to. Carola Stoiber No, that was ’84, when the wall was still up and there were not a lot of young people influxing the city. [There were] a lot of older people. Because of the status, everybody was quite scared to come here to part of a city that is surrounded by a wall. But the thing I decided to do was, there was already a special, open-minded subculture or music scene going on that was different from all other cities in West Germany. [In the] western part I didn’t know yet that they... Torsten Schmidt You were not from Berlin either, right? Dimitri Hegemann No, no actually, and I didn’t want to leave my home, a small village and all, but I never heard a “Yes” from the mayor or somebody. I had some crazy ideas in mind. I was really inspired by the Woodstock festival; about the values of freedom, the green idea, community, togetherness. I liked that a lot and I wanted to bring Woodstock into my small village, and they said “No, you better leave it.” And then, I actually really didn’t want to give it up, but I was looking for an alternative life concept in my 500-people village, and there was nothing, you know. You have to understand Germany had nothing in those days. Not like maybe the Detroit guys, maybe the parents had the soul, and before that the blues. [But] our parents’ generation had nothing, so I moved to West Berlin. Torsten Schmidt Whereabouts was this? Dimitri Hegemann What? Torsten Schmidt Whereabouts was this? Dimitri Hegemann Whereabout... Torsten Schmidt The place that you lived. Dimitri Hegemann Westphalia. And actually I loved it, to grow up [there]. The world was okay, but we hadn’t had cultural input. It was very low in the generation of my parents. They were in the war, nobody talked; it was difficult. And so we had a big desire for something new. And when these new sounds came, like psychedelic [music], Jimi Hendrix, and the long hair, and to live in a community together with friends, and build your own microcosms, those were the ideas that I really loved. The hippie movement. Torsten Schmidt How many times were you offered to get beaten up in those sort of surroundings? Dimitri Hegemann Beaten up? No. Torsten Schmidt I mean, where I come from, ’cause I mean 200 and 500 [inhabitants] makes my 1,200 village almost feel very urban already, but people at least were courteous enough to go like, “OK, with that kind of hair, I’m gonna beat you up, let’s go outside.” Dimitri Hegemann Oh, OK, no. I was clever enough to escape, but... Torsten Schmidt First rule of self-defense: Run. Dimitri Hegemann No, I had this vision of, I don’t know, it was really peaceful. And with this romantic view, I entered West Berlin. Also Detroit once, I said, “Wow, everything is so beautiful,” until Mr. Banks explained what’s going on. Well anyway, Berlin was really an island, as Carola said. It was really an open-minded scene since years [previously]; since the student riots, since the ’20s actually. And because of the wall. I always liked islands, and it was controlled by the Allied forces, by France, the British, and the US force; so if you were young enough, and on time in Berlin, you didn’t have to join the army. So you can imagine the young boys who moved to West Berlin at the right age, 18 or so, they created a new consciousness. It was very critical, [but] I missed the train. They caught me for the army, but I could get back later to Berlin. Actually I must also say, the city developed me, you know? Torsten Schmidt In which regard? Dimitri Hegemann They had the music, they had sounds. I am a curious person, and they had something that I had never seen before. I was a country boy, and so these big Hinterhaus, the big courtyards, and then the nighttime [activities], I had never seen these things you know? Actually I was shocked when I saw a small shop saying “Bakery” and a fashion designer was inside. All these small... Torsten Schmidt How dare they? Dimitri Hegemann “How does this work?” So I had to learn a lot. I was quiet, and my interest was watching night people. I found these small spots. We had no curfew; later on we can talk about that. So you could hang out until the morning, and meet some weird philosophers, talking about weird things, but that was amazing for me. I studied musicology. Musicology is about the history of music trends, and in the days when I moved to Berlin, punk was a subject. Torsten Schmidt Did people in Detroit care at any stage about mere things like curfew? Mike Banks Not really. Detroit got a curfew, but you could always hit an afterhours or something like that if you really wanted to just hang out. But yeah, the curfew was put in place by the auto companies so the auto workers could get to work on time. That was the idea behind it. Of course, it’s very dated now, but man we had fun in Detroit after hours. There was always something to do. The nighttime economy, or what Dimitri be talking about, is much different. The economy is a little illegal, but you could have a whole lot of fun, so I never felt any curfew, I didn’t feel no particular restriction to time, other than trying to get to work the next day. Torsten Schmidt What sort of work was that? Mike Banks I did construction work. Sometimes, I’d get fired, get in trouble. Getting into it, union versus management, that type of stuff. Or mechanical work. I did evictions for like 12 years. Torsten Schmidt That’s probably a concept that’s a little alien to most people outside of the States, could you explain what that entails? Mike Banks It’s simple. You don’t pay your rent, then some guys come knock on the door, put you out. Put your stuff in the street. And we get paid for doing it. So it was like, “Yo man, you know you ain’t got no cheese, you gotta roll. And we ain’t gonna tear your stuff up, we’re gonna respect you, but you gotta respect us.” And I was the littlest guy on the crew. The crew is huge, so you don’t wanna mess with them. Put you out, rain, shine, sleet or snow. Guaranteed. Torsten Schmidt That sounds super heart breaking. I don’t think it’s the easiest job to do. Mike Banks Hey you know, people make bad – a lot of folks love vices. Gambling, too much smoking crack, drugs... If they was down on their luck and we knew they was really down on their luck and they was working hard, the bailiff would give them a break. It wasn’t up to us, we was just the movers. The bailiff would have had to make the decision, and a lot of times, even though it sound like a bad thing, it was a lot of beautiful moments in it. Torsten Schmidt Like how? Mike Banks This one little girl was like, “Momma, why are we getting put out?” Her mama was trifling, she on crack. And she said, “That’s just how it is,” and I told her, “Little girl,” I said, “That ain’t how it is. Your mama’s on crack, and she don’t know s---, so if you go to school and learn something, this won’t happen to you.” And she said, “That’s what I’m gonna do.” So, it’s some beautiful moments, even in the pain. It wasn’t like we the bad guy all the time. My boy got shot up doing it, and we was trying to help that family out, and he got killed just because it was a misunderstanding. But yeah, it wasn’t a bad job, I even had laughs on that job. Some people could get put out and still be smiling. One guy came to the door buck naked, and he said, “Have at it.” And he had s--- everywhere, put s--- on all the doorknobs, anything we touched, it had s--- on it. [laughter] So he got us that night, he won that one. So he figured a way to beat us. So yeah, what can I say. Torsten Schmidt Maybe to give people a better understanding of the city, and where the city was at that stage, at the time... and probably you could comment on that, after we see it. Could we see video number five for maybe three minutes ten? (video: Detroit news report about a fire at an afterhours) Now, that’s some pretty disturbing footage, and what’s even more disturbing is when you try to look for something to illustrate it, and you see the different levels of language that were used, and some of the stuff, not even with what you’re seeing, but with the way things get portrayed, it’s almost unbearable to watch. Mike Banks Yeah, what the newsman forgot to tell you was that 20 years before that, the police had just been catching people at random and beating they ass. People got tired of it. “You have to live in a certain area.” “You can’t go here, you can’t go there.” I was six or seven years old when that happened and I remember the tanks and the soldiers and I was playing with the soldier’s bayonet and all that s---. But the news, it’s the same news you get now from Detroit. Shootings, stabbings, blah blah blah. They forget to tell you the good part. It was a black shop owner on there. There’s two sides to every story. There’s a black shop owner on there. It’s people that actually got jobs, it’s people that pay taxes, it’s people that is intelligent, it’s people that know what classical art is. It ain’t a town full of monkeys that just tear up s---. That’s the description you just saw. It’s the same s--- we watch on TV every night on Fox News. Every night, how many people got killed in Detroit, and the dumb s--- they got killed over. Nothing has changed, and part of what me and Jeff was doing with Underground Resistance was to paint a different picture, paint a picture of dreams and hope and futurism. And the one part that the brother said about, “There’s some cats that just don’t care,” that was true. When my man said that, he said they don’t care about race, religion, nothing, just getting what they gotta get. Now that is true. But you hear that in all the rap lyrics. It’s pretty common across urban America, so it can’t be just a Detroit problem, it’s a US problem. And you can imagine, this guy that’s supposed to go to Vietnam and go fight, and kill some other people about some s--- he don’t even know about, after something like this happened, ’cause they did draft people after that happened. They did draft them, and they sent them over there to kill some other people that probably just wanted their way of life, you see what I’m saying? So it’s a very ironic place to live in, and I think, in our current situation; I think you all understand what I’m talking about when you see what’s happening right now. It’s always been there. It’s always been there, lurking around but, you know, there’s good people as well, and if you want to paint a picture, a one-sided picture, own a news station, own a radio station, own a record company. You know, you guys are getting one-tenth of what we capable of musically, and that’s what you are also about to illustrate, that we do have a future. We do think. We do want to do better. OK? Carola Stoiber I know that you don’t want to talk too much about this, but that’s why I’m telling it now. When I came to Detroit the first time, and I saw what they are doing there, it was something very special, for me, [in] a dangerous city like I’ve never seen before, until then. And they were... Mike and Jeff and UR are creating [their] own space with the label, the distribution. They had the meeting point for the musicians there. People can talk, and they helped each other out, and started labels, created jobs and had other people also following up. So also 430 West, Lenny and Lawrence Burden [AKA Octave One], that’s something I remember now. Many more also started their own labels, and they are also still around, so that’s something very important that should not be forgotten in the report of Detroit these days too. Torsten Schmidt And I mean, it transcended beyond that. I remember Dego, and all the Reinforced crew when they first went to see Detroit, and they were like “Oh, so what do the rest of us need to know about that camp?” ’Cause you were not doing any PR or whatever. And it was like, “All you gotta know, them’s brothers for real.” That was Dego’s words at that time and... Mike Banks Yeah, Dego and them hung out with me. We went to the Brass Key Lounge, it’s a stripper club. And they was really enjoying the bass, ’cause they was dropping Detroit electro and Miami bass, and they mixed it together, and they loved it. They used to be a group called Manix, and they was on Kevin Saunderson’s label. And they went there, they was young, and I took them around and showed them some sights, and they had a good time running around with me at night in Detroit, just like Mark Ernestus did. I gotta mention, there’s two people that’s not here that I wish was here. One guy is here, he’s lurking about, he always lurks, and he’s lurking in here somewhere, but he was also critical in the Detroit-Berlin connection. And the other guy you might know: Jeff Mills, my old buddy from Detroit, and to me, one of the best DJs in the world, bar none. I mean, he kept me from trying to DJ. I figured, “Ain’t no sense in me trying to DJ, [laughter] I could never be this tight. This dude is tight.” So as well, I think you should also imagine Mark Ernestus, Hard Wax records, Esco, the whole Hard Wax crew and Jeff Mills sitting here too. They just can’t be here right now. And this is a rare opportunity that I come, and it’s happened to happen in Berlin, and it’s rare. And I thank Torsten and all of the guys, Many and all them, for cooking it up that we could come and explain to you guys just what you can do with your music. ’Cause if you figure, if we made it through that, you can do some tremendous things too, for your own city, for your own town. Because Berlin, obviously, flowered from the music, and then only Berlin has come back to help flower Detroit. I’ve been trying for years. Most of my friends is over here DJing. A lot of them in Europe. Some of them deserve to be here, others just choose not to live in that s---. OK? But guess what? We get so many visitors, from all around the world, come to our little shop, sign a wall, spread some love. Some of them even stay. So the city is getting these weird people from around the world moving there, and that’s kind of cool to me. So it’s a little love coming back. You wanna talk about irony? We got Detroit Techno City, we got no techno club. We got a piece of a club here, piece of something there, but they usually get shut down once the owners figure out they’re making money. So Dimitri is trying to put an anchor down from Europe in the city, to help so our DJs can stay home and have somewhere to DJ at, you feel me? Torsten Schmidt Did you always feel welcome? ’Cause there were rumors at that time when certain labels purchased an address in Detroit just to get a Detroit postcode on the records? Mike Banks Oh yeah, that’s still going on. They won’t stand up in my face and say Detroit nothing, ’cause I know they fakes. Fraudulent, impostors, we could just go on and on, but they know who they are. They didn’t live my experience, and certainly I’m the kind of guy, I didn’t ever feel like I was in a bad place, until I got out overseas, like, “Damn, that’s a nice city. Oh this is a nice city. This is a nice city. What’s that woman doing walking alone?” It was a trip. It was a trip. You really don’t realize how cheated you get. You know like when my man told me in Spanish, he said “If y’all can count to ten, you get an A. You count to five, you get a B. And if you can’t pass that, you just go and sign up for the military.” So I counted to ten, I got A. They didn’t have high expectations for us, and that’s what happens when you get corporate control. When corporations control life. A corporation, if they make Red Bull, they good at it. If they make a car, they make a good or bad car, you decide. But they shouldn’t control art, and they shouldn’t control cities and infrastructures. We got a city where the school curriculum is dictated by corporations. “We need all the workers, teach them how to make cars.” That was the expectation of our school curriculum. Torsten Schmidt Which is probably one of the ironic things: On average, [compared] to the rest of the States, the high level of African American education. That people like Ford, despite their bizarre world views, thought, “OK, if we educate certain people, they will become better workers.” Mike Banks Yeah, yeah, yeah. The auto companies, they did... My grandfather came up and worked at Ford. And they figured, “They can build a car, they ought to be smart enough to build a car.” And it was way beyond that. I mean, if y’all want to see some art, come see some of our cars. We got some bad s--- rolling round there, OK? That’s what art is perceived as, it’s mechanical. If you haven’t been taught classical European art ever, well what the f--- is a Renoir, what’s a Rembrandt? I don’t care about that s---. But you let the right car roll up with some classic good work, like the back end of this turntable? That’s what we look at as art. A lot of us. Now there’s people there that do understand art, we do have art museums, we do have culture, OK? But average guys I know, they recognize art through mechanical ability, and it’s something to be thought about. You get a lot of high-end, upper-crust people, and they judge art by what they were brought up on.
You know, most of you got builders, or somebody in your family that build something. Also those guys are looked up to in the community too as skilled people, so we do got a lot of pride in the skill in our building work, and you gotta come there to see it. Torsten Schmidt Do you think that engineers are not getting enough credit for their creative artfulness? Mike Banks Yes. Yes, if you look at engineering, and you really look at it, it’s art. It takes a knowledge of the now, and what can be. And it’s just like with you guys, budding music people, you have to have knowledge of the now. If you don’t know where this music come from, what you doing? What are you doing? Do some research. Do some research, look into some things. You can’t go into the future without a good foundation, ’cause you can’t launch your rocket if your rocket just tips over on the pad. In other words, if you got no foundation in what you doing, you might not know what you doing. That might be a good thing, but usually it’s a disaster. You should know some things, and that’s what the people sitting up there on the couch are for. You should know why you want to come to Berlin. All y’all want to come to Berlin, you should know why. It’s because some older cats realized its potential, and that’s the key word of this discussion. There’s potential in what you can do. You can get rid of these corporate assholes, you can get rid of the right wing, you can get rid of a lot of things, you ain’t gotta talk protests or nothing. Just be independent, keep doing your sound, and people will hear it. That’s how this city changed, ’cause he believed in the sound. He wanted a sound that could unify people from two completely different things. He’s trying to explain it to us, and we like, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about,” but he found the right guys, ’cause we weren’t scared to go to East Berlin, we weren’t scared of nothing, ’cause that’s what we come through. None of them guys in Detroit are scared of much, if they really from Detroit. OK? Torsten Schmidt So in order to understand how you guys got together, it’s probably first important to understand how you two met first. Carola Stoiber Do you remember? Dimitri Hegemann Yes, you knocked at the door, I think, in the morning, 10 AM, because I was in an interview. And it was just how to start a label, from a US radio station, and we were into it, [wanting] to start something very small, in West Berlin. No idea how it works. And I think Carola, I remember that you knocked at the door and said, “I’m ready to support this mission.” Carola Stoiber No, no, no. I was studying and I met you because we did a test feature [at the] university for radio. So we needed to find somebody to talk to, an interesting subject, and blah blah blah, and that’s when he and his partner were about to start, so that’s how we met. We did this interview, we did this test feature that was broadcasted then in the end. And then the other time in the bar, when we met again, you said, “Why don’t you come and become our secretary?” And nobody knows why that happened, why he asked, and I said, “Yeah, of course, let’s try that.” So I started [as a] secretary on a typing machine for what we all didn’t know was supposed to be done. Dimitri Hegemann Yeah, back in the days, Berlin had [its] own music, I must say. I came with a 4/4 beat to Berlin, but we had different sounds. These people, I was really surprised they could not even play an instrument. They called it the genius dilettantes, they make noises. But this was very special for Berlin. Their music described the city. And I was a curious person; I am still. I wanted to get in touch with them, and so I said, “What about doing a festival?” We finally called it Berlin Atonal, and then we started the festival, and so I got into the music again. It was a new format, for new sounds, and for new ways also in filming things. So, John Peel, maybe some of you remember John Peel, the British DJ, radio DJ, supported it worldwide, and I was completely surprised. It was sold out [in] three days, SO36, ’82. And then we went on, and I found more interest in this music, and there was one band I picked up from Sheffield, you know... Carola Stoiber Dimitri Hegemann Clock DVA, yeah. They came up with a Mac 2000, they were quite sophisticated. Sheffield is a city in England where all these big names, electro bands, came [from], Cabaret Voltaire, Human League and Heaven 17, and others, and also Clock DVA. So we signed him. We made this record happen, and through our independent distribution, EFA, [and] their partner in Chicago, Wax Trax!, they [wanted] to release it in the US, the Clock DVA. And I was curious to see Chicago for the first time and I said, “Can I come and check it out?” He said, “Come over.” And when I was there, in this office he had a bucket full of tapes he didn’t like. Jim Nash was the owner there, he died recently. He said, “Dimitri, take anything you want. We don’t take these.” So I grabbed a lottery box, took one thing out and I listened to it and there was this phone number, “313.” I called it from Chicago and on the other line was Jeff Mills. I said, “I’m interested. I’m from Germany and I like your music. Are you into it?” And he said, “Yes, do it.” And we released it in, I don’t know, ’88 or ’87? And so we were in touch with Detroit, first time. And already in ’89 the fall of the wall happened. But I must also say nobody was interested in this music here. We had a hard time to bring records and CDs to record stores, “Can you take some?” And so it was hard; [only the] strong survive. But in 1990 the last Atonal I managed, I brought Clock DVA over to Berlin and also the project with Jeff, Final Cut. So that was the first visit [by] Jeff in Berlin. And we had no hotel rooms, and so we’re sleeping on the ground, with a sleeping bag and so it was real underground. But a year later already we stayed in touch and Carola was always in between, kept the red telephone to Detroit. No iPhone, no internet. Maybe the fax machine, if it worked, so we got new information. But one year later, on March 13th, we started the venue, the Tresor club, and Jeff [Mills] and Mike [Banks] and Robert [Hood], it’s a UR concept. It was new. We were not informed, like daily news [would come] over. [Every] two months and we do this Underground Resistance project and that was perfect timing. And you must understand that Berlin was anyway in those days a special situation because of the fall of the wall. And Carola you can say you were in New York [at] this seminar when you bought this holy cassette with this track on it, “Sonic Destroyer.” Carola Stoiber Was it a holy cassette? It was in ’91 and I was in the US, doing an after-university drive for six weeks and then I ended up in New York. I fell in love with New York so I came back and told them that I should go to the New Music Seminar because it’s really important for the future of the music and the label, because I wanted to go back. And this is where I met Underground Resistance and the whole crew, and they were just ready to conquer the world with their sound, that was their statement. And so it’s important to know also that, of course, there [are] some parallel lines in the development. For us, we discussed it earlier, it seems [like] there’s years in between, but it was not, it was sometimes weeks or months. And also the parallel lines are important because at the same time there was Hard Wax record store in Berlin that was and is still an important store for the music that was out because they bought it, they sold it again. So that’s “Multiplikatoren,” I don’t know how to say that in English now. And they were also looking for the DJs who were able to perform the music for Berlin. So at the same time they were checking if, I think it was Blake... Mike Banks Damon Booker. Carola Stoiber Damon Booker [could] come over to present the music they imparted and we were doing the same thing pretty much then for the club, because they found a space and the club was about to open so we needed music too. So that’s also this kind of... Snowball. Torsten Schmidt But by then you already had a different role, I guess. I mean earlier I was thinking, “Hang on, secretary? That doesn’t sound too punk rock for a punk rock label.” But that sounds a lot more like the person running the label. Carola Stoiber Yeah, I mean that’s how I started. That’s what the bosses liked... You had the woman that was typing there. But then it all happened and everybody had to step out and do something. It was not that, “You’re the head of this, or head of this.” We were three people, so we just started to take what’s possible. And then also by accident, I didn’t know that I would meet them there in New York and they would be ready. And then it was all fitting. Dimitri Hegemann I really must say, I must give credit also to Hard Wax. They took over the bookings for us because they were in touch with all these labels from Mike and so many new artists. It was a lucky moment that we had real serious help from Hard Wax regarding the booking. But I must also say, in those days, we had really no idea if this music would take off or would work. We thought maybe it’s a trend, like punk. Comes in, gets out, like jungle. We had no idea. For instance, at Tresor club, we made a contract just for three months. Who makes a contract for three months? “OK, maybe we have at least ten shows and maybe we’ll see what’s going on.” And I think the atmosphere... We took much more risks and we had a lot of passion. And I also remember when the cats came over from [the] US, some of them did not know where are we now. Are we in the East or the West? Where are the Nazis? [laughs] It was a very interesting historical moment because this techno thing was a common subject for the kids from the East part of the city and the West part. Both discovered it, it was not somebody like me or anybody, said, “This is what you have to eat.” They liked it. Mainly, in my perception, it was a success dependent on the spaces we could use. The darkness and the dark rooms were very important. To meet in dark rooms and not to leave at 1 AM in the morning, we could stay there forever. This was a great freedom. A great feeling of freedom, of a new beginning, and then Dr. Motte and the Love Parade came also, so that was... Torsten Schmidt Before we get there, maybe so people get a bit more of a sonic idea, Calum was so kind and put together the transition of Jeff’s first project into UR, and I guess you guys released both of those things, at least over here in Germany. And let’s probably listen to that for a second. (music: Final Cut – “Open Your Eyes”) (music: X-101 – “Sonic Destroyer”) Dimitri Hegemann [applause] I remember when this tape came on and I had played it to friends and in the night, in another club, the E-Werk, we were very, very excited, and I met Daniel Miller from Mute Records. I played it to him close to the toilet. “Listen to this on the walkman,” and he was excited. He said, “Dimitri, you must wait with the release.” We were very, very excited and this song became a big smash hit in all [the] clubs it has been played [in] and it started something new. I think we released it in September. We opened in March ’91, and we released [it in] September ’91. Even a “Boulevardpresse” [tabloid newspaper] came. I never forget, like The Sun, and they had a young journalist who was so amazed about this record. He said, “Can we do an extra issue of 100 white copies?” in white vinyl, and we made them and it was so great. So everybody was in this fever. And this was really a new beginning of music, and also this music brought the people really together. It has been played in all venues, in the Love Parade, in all the clubs. And I must say today, 25 years later, or 28 years later, 30 years later, an evergreen. It’s still good, despite all the new technology. Torsten Schmidt I mean the track is called “Sonic Destroyer,” and it still has a little bit of sonic energy in it that translates to now. Can you remember, you went to May Day one, right? May Day one? The rave? Mike Banks I don’t remember. I can’t remember, man. I might’ve went to May Day one, but I know when we kicked that off, just like the other night, two nights ago when we kicked it off, the boys still remembered it. Whoever was behind us was in trouble. But the song was to rip off the head of any DJ in front of Jeff. ‘Cause they would always try to out-spin him, so it was to destroy the DJ.
Also destroy record companies, corporations, anything we felt was trying to get ahold of us. And I should point out that we have released a record on UR that is UR013.5 and we have been selling records to Hard Wax a lot. That was my first guy, was Mark Ernestus, Hard Wax, and we had been selling them quite a few records back and forth. Jeff was a radio DJ. They was putting a lockdown on Jeff about playing Public Enemy. He was getting pissed off. I was a session guy just like I do sessions for y’all. And that’s how me and Jeff met. And I worked on that first track, “I told you not to stop.” We got the sample from Apocalypse Now, where my man said, “I told you not to stop. Let’s go.” And they shot up the whole boat full of people. And the next track was “Sonic Destroyer.” That’s an Oberheim OB-Xa doing that, [makes descending synth voice] all the voices of it. And a DX100 on the bass. Digital. Yamaha. So for you guys into synths, that was a power combo. But the reason we went with Dimitri was ’cause we trusted Mark. Mark was saying that Dimitri was good people and Mark was reiterating that. Mark came over to Detroit, he was the first one I saw, and me and him hung out and we became fast friends and we still partners to this day. Mark’s only concern is the record. The record. The record. The heat. Mark’s a little bit of a hustler. “It’ll sell Mike, it’ll move. This one might not, this one will.” He’s a business owner. So he came over, we did a lot of good business together. We had a lot of good times running around Detroit at night and laughing and joking, but we built the trust. I’ve worked with Mark. Jeff kinda worked with Dimitri and then me and Carola over the facts. So there was a trust building, but what we did know with this techno stuff, we saw how London was just way too fast for us. We couldn’t keep up with London. London was vicious, man. So the guys would come back, Juan [Atkins] and Derrick [May] and Kevin [Saunderson] would tell us all the London stories and I had heard enough. US radio; you might ask yourself, well why did none of this techno music go off in the US and you gotta think about it. None of the European labels had the money to pay the US game and truly the hip-hop had bumped us off. It was just so powerful. The hip-hop was just killing the game and that’s what really pissed Jeff off ’cause they wouldn’t let him play Public Enemy. He’s on the main radio station in a mostly all black city, Latinos, and Arabs, and we can’t hear Public Enemy. So Jeff smelled a rat. I already knew it from doing sessions that it was fraudulent. The whole major business, I’ll tell them right now, it’s a fake. Y’all listening to fake s---. You listening to one-tenth of what music could be. Your heroes are just bulls---. There’s so much production and guys like Just Blaze and Ango and all these people back there working behind this artist. Some of the artists, this many of them: Truly talented. Most of them is frauds. And they just build them up, like a lot of these DJs out there, like my man from PCP was telling you, they frauds. They build them up, they get publicity agents, they pay them $10,000 a month. Anybody can be a top DJ. Don’t believe that s---. You need to make your own s---, put it in your own city, make your own club, put your own records out and somebody will come to it. You gotta have faith. And that’s what I see. All y’all moving to Berlin, it’s too late. [laughter] Berlin already did it. You need to go somewhere, Warsaw, Poland or Brisbane, Australia. Take your ass there and start something. You know they already... It’s down, they got it. You can pay $5, come on in the club, they got you. What you looking for here, it might not be here. You need to do something else. I’ve been listening to y’all dreams and stuff, you come back to Detroit, you see what that music could do for your own city. We ain’t the best in the world, but I tell you what, we got a lot of beautiful moments, and it covers up all that... What they show there. Covers it up like nothing. I feel rich. I got friends, food and music, just like you got here. And when you leave the Red Bull [Music Academy], guess what you’re gonna take with you. Not your track for your EP. You’re going to take 30 friends from all around the world that you’re going to be friends with forever. I don’t even know if the corporation knows that that happens. But I think that they do. I think they do. OK. You may hear whatever you hear, but if it’s 30 friends from around the world, that kinda refutes the norm. You gotta look at s--- a little deeper. I do. Plus I’m an infiltrator. I don’t care who give me the mic, if I can tell y’all, stay independent, do your own s---, start your own distributions, compete with Mike, come to Detroit, I’ll teach you how to do that too. We destroy bulls---. When you’re down in the clubs dancing and there’s gay people and drag queens and nerds and everybody together, that destroys order. It destroys it. They don’t know how to manage this s---. They’re trying to get you under control. And if you keep listening to the radio, you can come to Detroit and see a whole bunch of programmed mugs. They programmed for violence and f--- you. That’s pretty much it, man. And that s--- is... It ain’t like what they got here. I watch my city de-evolve into... We used to think David Bowie was cool. Edgar Winter. Gino Soccio, [Giorgio] Moroder. We had all kind of different color heroes. George Clinton, Sun Ra, Gil Scott-Heron. We had so much diversity in the radio, it was reflecting in the city. That’s where Detroit techno really come from. From diverse radio. Good TV programming. Y’all keep supporting this bulls--- and you gonna see... You won’t ask how it is to live in Detroit, you gonna be living in it. Trust me, you’re going to be living in it. Someone is going to put a hat on you and tell you to shoot this guy right here. “’Cause we don’t like him.” OK? And you ain’t even gonna ask the question, just do it. So if you get programmed, that’s on you. I come from a city that wasn’t programmed. Now I live in a city that’s programmed. It’s tough to watch the kids on their way to prison, to the hotel. It’s really tough. I try to tell them, “Brother, you’re headed the wrong way.” But, you know, a hard head makes a soft ass. I can’t save them all. And I do care about y’all. Torsten Schmidt Word. [applause] In order to introduce, video number seven, maybe you could tell a little bit about the power that music and radio can have if we listen to “Rock Lobster?” Mike Banks Oh, yeah. Yeah. I can personally tell you that this song right here, y’all ain’t gonna believe it, but we had a lot of gangs in Detroit and guys were gang-banging, and Mojo would play this next song and before he would play it he’d say, “Not a shot will be fired in the next hour. Not a shot will be fired in anger or hate in this next hour. Prepare yourselves and take a ride to ‘Planet Claire.’” And here you go. You’re supposed to drop it right there. [laughter] Torsten Schmidt Well I heard the story mildly different but with “Rock Lobster,” but it sounds like a pretty good Mojo rendition anyway. Who’s Mojo anyway? Mike Banks Electrifying Mojo is like Bruce Lee’s teacher. He’s like the Shaolin, the head monk of the city. He was our spiritual guide, he was our musical guide, he was our diversity clerk, he was the guy that educated us through our ears and through rhythms and textures and music and he had a big gumbo pot full of music from all around the world. I think our market was so abandoned, I don’t think the major record companies care what Detroit listened to. So, I mean the DJs could pretty much go at it however they wanted, and they played what people needed, not what they was told to play. They play what we needed. And it really, really, made for a more tolerant city. Yeah, we was broke, but we was progressive as hell. I think we was truly 30 years ahead of the rest of the world by this one DJ... Well it was him, Jeff Mills, Alan Oldham, DJ T-1000 and a few other DJs that really... The spirit was, “Man I’m about to drop some new stuff. Check this out.” And guess what. We had import records coming in. We don’t have imports now. Y’all better watch it in America. We don’t have nothing from Europe coming over there. We gotta go to the suburbs to get something from Europe. We used to have imports... Think about this, nobody in Berlin sends us no records. We only get them from Hard Wax. It’s like we’re smart enough to make the music, but too dumb to listen to it. Nobody markets their music at Detroit. OK. That’s an irony like a mug. We don’t have no modular store in Detroit, but techno come from there. We don’t have an Ableton store in Detroit, but techno come from there. They looked at us the same way with music. Like, “Whatever. I ain’t spending no money in there.” And so guess what, we had some of the best independent, crazy music in the world, and this track here, literally ended gang fighting ’cause once you go “Rock Lobster” and you put your hat on and do the “Rock Lobster,” you really can’t be too tough anyway, man. Guys be like, “Hey man, what’s up with that “Rock Lobster” man?” You like, “Dog, that’s what’s happening. The women like it. F--- you. [laughter] I’m down with them. I ain’t going with your ass.” That’s how it was. Cats went and it was the new wave and it was cool and you could come to school and look crazy as hell and not get your ass beat. And I think that was a great time and I’m glad I lived through it. (video: The B-52’s – “Rock Lobster”) [applause] That’s how... You can’t imagine... I mean, I know they don’t paint that picture of Detroit, but you can’t imagine that getting played but it was one of the hottest records there. We was really wide open and your radio stations and your countries and towns should be that wide open. If it ain’t, you should complain and ask... All you guys got good music, it should all be on the radio. A lot of y’all. Everybody got good music and you got no outlet. The only place we could go was underground. And that’s how all this happened over here. There was no way we was going to get on the radio. And I don’t know if you guys saw Christian Rich when they was here in the first term, but they do... I’m sure Just Blaze could talk about it too. But you ain’t got no money behind the record, you ain’t getting on big radio. You can forget it. Whoever wanted to be a pop star, you a popping fool. Some bulls---. It’s some bulls---. Torsten Schmidt So you guys then got these tapes, and as you called it earlier, the holy tape. How do you turn the holy tape, and make sure it gets to kids all across the world, and turn the holy tape into an actual project and a cultural artifact? Carola Stoiber Back in the day, that was quite a process. You got a DAT, pretty much, then it had to go to the mastering plant for DAT, and then it was sent to the pressing plant and then... OK, vinyl is still on, so then the mother plates, the father plates had to be pressed and you got the white label and you had to check the sound. They needed to approve the sound, so you needed to send the white label to the US by post. Takes a little while, too. Then they send a fax, “Everything fine, you can press.” Then the pressing started and you had to get the cover printed, then the finished product ended up at the distribution, hopefully with no mistakes. And then from there on, the distribution people, label managers you had, started to offer it to the stores that were buying this kind of music, and then they sold the record. And if you’re lucky, you sold a few. Then more, coming more and more. And yeah, that’s how it went, and that’s how the records ended up on the turntables of the consumer. Dimitri Hegemann It was no big competition in those days. Actually there was no sound of Berlin. It didn’t exist, people say. Detroit techno really opened our ears and eyes, and it was a kick off of something very special. And I remember when Juan came and stayed in Mike’s house, and we did some work on the reel-to-reel tapes in the night. There was no digital editing, and so... and then cut here, [makes cutting motion] then duplicate the parts of the tape, and it was really handwork. And yeah, and people bought records in those days, it’s nice, vinyl. We have changed. Everything has changed now. Torsten Schmidt Did you guys, then, while there was no sound of Berlin, start developing sounds of other cities as well, let’s say Detroit, Brighton, to a degree? Carola Stoiber I don’t necessarily agree that there was no sound of Berlin. There were people already coming also from the guitar music, cross-over industrial stuff, and started to do purely electronic music. They weren’t so known yet. And then the Detroit techno came and proved to them that they should go on with what they were doing. And then pretty soon, also quite a hard way of techno came from Berlin people. So don’t necessarily agree, it was... Torsten Schmidt I’m staying out of this. It’s your office argument. Carola Stoiber No, no. It was there, but it was maybe hidden. Still a little bit hidden, and Detroit made it come out. Dimitri Hegemann It’s a different view. I mean, when Basic Channel started, that was for me a real value that made electronic music rich. Most of the stuff back in the days, was that people tried to copy this or that. Torsten Schmidt Which had its own charm at times. Dimitri Hegemann What? Torsten Schmidt Which had its own charm at times. Dimitri Hegemann Yeah, but I mean I didn’t realize it so much, I didn’t take it serious. Now it has changed, you know? The technology is here, Berlin is a city of techno. We have, as Mike said, Ableton, we have Native Instruments, we have incredibly many clubs here. We have nighttime programs, we have the best bookings here. Every weekend I think everybody’s in town. It’s a techno city. Techno is pop. Torsten Schmidt Which is interesting ’cause at that time, I mean you were pretty outspoken about it, and you, at least then, viciously hated pop music. Mike Banks Yeah, I mean I didn’t hate it ’cause of the artists. I mean actually, I liked Elton John. I just say it like it is. Torsten Schmidt Big Aerosmith man as well. Mike Banks Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, I like all of that. I like music, but I learned in the studios, and again I holla at Just Blaze, but I saw some of the dirtiest stuff being done. They bring in three big old church girls to come sing something and say, “Hey could you do a little dummy lead?” And then you know, the lady would do the lead, 50 bucks or whatever. And then they’ll bring in, some girl that do 500 sit-ups a day and all that s---, and they’ll bring her in and have her try to mimic what the other woman had put down. And if she couldn’t get it tight, they’d take a sampler and pitch her up, and put her in tune. And of course, the big woman got $50 and the other girl’s on the front cover of the album. I started to learn from the asshole out of the industry that it was fraudulent. I was like, “Man she didn’t even sing that record. The other girl sang it.” So I knew better. And it was disappointing. Jeff was getting disappointed on the radio, so you had two guys that was... We had dreams like kids, too, we wanted to go out and be in a band, and travel round the world and all that, but me seeing that, I started to realize that man, this is a fraud, this is terrible. And they would mail the tapes to Detroit because the Detroit session musicians cost less money than LA or New York. So they get us for 100 bucks, 50 bucks, and then in New York or LA, that same session, the guitar work or the keyboard work, it might be $1,800, $2,000 an hour.
So like I said, I know I can’t blanket cover every artist, I like Childish Gambino and Kendrick Lamar, I’m just shocked they on the radio. I’m shocked that Chance The Rapper... And so maybe it’s somebody out there thinking right, but y’all know what I’m talking about. This stuff is just so bubblegum, man, and cliché man, it’s just like a formula. They throwing formulas at you, man. You do that s--- with Tylenol or cough medicine, you don’t do that with art. You can’t make art into a formula, man. So you know, if we allow them to take the art, we gonna be in some serious trouble as humanity. I’m literally up here 35 years in this, trying. All we was trying to do with UR is inspire creativity from other places, and we figured if enough of it went around the world, like what happened here in Berlin, it’d be a lot of nice cities to go to and hang out in all night. At least you ain’t gotta sit up and just listen to bubblegum all day, man. I can’t do it dog. My reality is not bubblegum. My s--- is some used bubblegum on the bottom of my shoe, that’s my reality man. So just to show it, nice bubblegum fresh in the package, it don’t hit it for me, man. I need some real s--- like Alice in Chains, or something like that. You know what I’m saying? Torsten Schmidt On that note, are you legally allowed these days to talk about what session work you were working on? Or how did that actually work? ‘Cause most people don’t actually have a grasp of how that world actually works. Mike Banks We were good musicians and we would ask the studio owner, “Hey man, if somebody need a guitar, or a bass, or whatever.” Amp Fiddler did it too. Amp Fiddler was one of the crew. And we hang out at big 24-track studios and it was a way to make a little cheese, using your skill. Better than doing evictions or standing up 30 stories in some building; if you fall, you’re dead. I found it easier, easier to do. And I also met a lot of great guys, like Jeff Mills, Duane “In The Mix” Bradley. I was starting to get on some serious records, and that was cool. I met my studio guru George Clinton, just sitting around like we do in the lunchroom where we talking. And he give me advice on how to separate the bass drum from the kick drum. Spacial... Torsten Schmidt Hang on, isn’t that the eternal quest? Mike Banks It’s one of the battles of mixing, but I also was privileged to see tape looping, and Erik was back there showing the ladies tape looping. But I saw tape looping and didn’t think nothing of it, and then you got whole industries based on that Detroit invention. George Clinton was a part of inventing tape looping. It was him, I believe Jim Vitti, an engineer, but George Clinton did that. And for all the people that think that George Clinton is kinda like a space cadet, no he ain’t. My man knows the mixing board. And he knows big mixing boards, Neves, the SSL. He ain’t no little guy when it comes to mixing. He know what he doing. And furthermore, he’s very forthright about sharing. And so I figured if George Clinton could be a good guy, and Ralf Hutter, another very dear friend of mine. If Ralf Hutter from Kraftwerk could be a nice guy, I don’t see why none of y’all gotta take no s--- from some of these bulls--- DJs. Telling you, they ain’t that big. They spinning other people’s records. They a DJ. There’s nothing wrong with being a DJ, but don’t get out of place, OK? Torsten Schmidt In order for some of these DJs to get where they are, they had to figure out how people get their things to sound a lot better. And, I mean earlier on you disclosed two or three machines that you were using; around the time of those releases you were extremely protective of that. Mike Banks Yeah, yeah. Torsten Schmidt But you clouded it well. I mean, it added to the mystique. Mike Banks Yeah, I mean I was extremely protective against Europeans. I figured, s--- if they take your country, it would be nothing to take your track. So I wouldn’t let ’em nowhere near the studio, nor talk about what we used, or allow none of my guys to do it. I traveled around the world a little bit now, and I know better, I know some good people, and I figured I’d share what I know. I can talk about machines that’s 30 years old, that’s no problem. I still got an edge, you know what I’m saying? I keep my secret weapons, but... Torsten Schmidt And at the same time, sometimes it makes the people really happy ’cause in the case of Tom Oberheim for example, who wasn’t really aware that you guys even existed, and then he would know, “Oh ‘Jump’ is done on one of my machines.” And when we played him “Sonic Destroyer,” he was like, “Oh, those kids are doing that?” Well they’re not kids anymore, but yeah. Mike Banks Well you know my biggest thing with gear, is that some people just get way over analog. And yeah, we use DX100s, DX27s, Casio CZ-101... We pretty much use whatever we can get our hands on. Everything was discarded technology. When the DX7 came, that made a lot of the big boys, the big eight-voice synths available to us, the Oberheim... Torsten Schmidt How did you get a hold of a DX7? Mike Banks Oh I didn’t get a DX7. I was just glad it got made. I got a hold of some of my other keyboards... Torsten Schmidt Wasn’t there some church involved somewhere? Mike Banks Yeah, but I don’t wanna talk about that. Torsten Schmidt What, we can’t talk about church anymore? Mike Banks Yeah. No I got some friends and they love... One of my friends is like a Oberheim freak, if he was here he’d be at Schneider’s trying to figure out how to get the modular out the front door without being seen. He was... Torsten Schmidt That doesn’t sound too church-y. Mike Banks Yeah, yeah. He was something else. But yeah, no. Digital technology was also part of Detroit techno. I don’t think Derrick May would mind, but the Mirage sampler, Ensoniq ESQ-1, these type of... We pretty much used whatever we could get. And the keyboards, it was all pawnshop gear. Mostly pawnshop or Craigslist type of stuff that you would get. Or other ways. So, evictions, stuff like that. It’s a good job to have when you need gear. Gear to me, it don’t matter. Me and my girl from Korea, we was working last night, we threw up a couple pieces and got on with it. You don’t need a lot of gear, you need a lot of heart, you need a lot of thinking, you need a lot of love, you need a lot of passion in your s---, you just can’t study... All that stuff’s too slow, too slow. Nothing can beat me, computers can’t beat me, man. They too slow. I think people, if they came to the jam room, you could see it. It’s the techno that’s coming out like that. It’s up to the recorder to catch it. It just comes out, it come through, and you do it, and it’s not thought about. It’s just felt.
And I think a lot of the best records, ones from Chicago, Detroit, even the new ones that get made, like if you notice my man from PCP, he was just like, “Yeah just do it, bang!” Guys who make tracks tend to be like that. They not going to over think, and probably a lot of them ain’t got a lot to think with anyway. So it ain’t a lot to do but make the track. God blessed them with what they got, and like me too, it ain’t like I’m no damn Beethoven or something, it’s just, get it done, knock it down, and capture the moment. That is always what I tell y’all, all the time. Catch the moment. Torsten Schmidt So with this competitiveness, how did you guys feel when you, all of a sudden, had to somehow deal with that in everyday life, in everyday working life? Did you feel like you were competitively kept out, and only let in to a certain degree? Or how did you manage that? Carola Stoiber What level? Label work? Torsten Schmidt For example, yeah. Mike Banks He talking about between us. Carola Stoiber Oh. Competition between us? Mike Banks No, some... Carola Stoiber I’m lost now. Torsten Schmidt No, I mean, earlier Mike was saying they were at least suspicious of the European interest, and... Carola Stoiber Our opinion was pretty... Then referring to pretty hippie. We were there and there was new music and we thought this is a new movement, and this is a worldwide movement without the communication skills, or techniques that are there now. And that was global, and equal, and no VIPs and no VIP rooms in the club. And so I think we didn’t see it so much, as competition between us... Mike Banks They was... I could tell it was good people. I just want it with my heart. Jeff felt the same way. And we felt the same way about Mark Ernestus, and as y’all can see, these are people who are the pillars of Berlin, the Berlin electronic scene. There’s many others, just not here, but something about ’em was good. We had been approached by people from Holland, people from England, and they just talked, it was too fast, I wasn’t feeling it. And I felt like if we was going to get one of our records up, I really wanted Jeff to get out here and crush, ’cause I like competing. And I knew Jeff, and I still say this, y’all can put whatever DJ you want to get, whoever making all this big money, you put The Wizard up there, he will bust they ass, guaranteed. They don’t know nothing ’bout no records. They can talk all the s--- they want up here, but my man is good. When you go see him DJ, that’s the real DJ. Derrick, them guys DJ. Some of them boys in Chicago. And I’m not knocking none of these guys. Some of the DJs that came up here... What’s my man, Dixon, when he was telling y’all about being tired and working, that man was telling you right. It ain’t easy. And I could feel his frustration. But there’s many, many frauds out here. Y’all need to look into some of these people. I’m from Detroit. Are you really from Detroit? How many records you got out? What records do you have out? Damn, you don’t have no records out. You just came to Berlin and said, “Yeah I know Mike and Jeff.” A lot of people know us. They come to the record store. That don’t mean they down with me. So I’m just saying, be careful ’bout all this worshipping DJs. And Detroit, you do good, you do a good job. I seen Jeff in clubs, where the man bring the record and say, “Hey yo bro, play this. Me and my wife got married to it.” And he better play it right, ’cause that’s the biggest drug dealer in the city, right there. So it’s spin or get f---ed up, for real. And Jeff will lay it down, you know what I’m saying? No fear. They’ve DJed under way different conditions, so I’m just saying man, y’all should be careful ‘bout cats with... If you wanna see a real DJ, I’ma tell you what a real DJ can do. They can mix two live drummers together. Live drummer on this deck, live drummer on that deck. And ride ’em. Now you see somebody do that, give them the thumbs up. I guarantee 95% of them guys can’t do it. Y’all don’t even know what I’m talkin’ about, but anyway. [laughter] Torsten Schmidt Well... Mike Banks Old school know what I’m talkin’ about. Torsten Schmidt You also had another little answer to throw in, in the competitiveness with other labels, from other countries. You had the venues. Dimitri Hegemann Yes. Yes, venues play a very important role. I think techno wouldn’t have had this success in Berlin if the venues would have not been here. And the reason why Berlin has so many venues is we had a strong bombardment, in the Second World War, so we had a lot of niches. You won’t find them in London or in Paris. And then we had the wall, and when the wall fell down and the parades started, and this euphoria was there, the euphoria to start something, and the question: How to celebrate this new freedom? So in this moment techno hit Berlin. I talked to my man, kids from the east waiting for something, “Please come over.” We don’t know if it works, but it worked out. We did not know this. We did not know that techno had this strong influence on Berlin’s urban development. So because techno changed the city, this model of... We have seen in Berlin, that maybe five years after the wall was open, there was still no police control, so you had the feeling you could start and experiment, and I must say, many people started an experiment. Not just the clubs, it was also maybe a gallery, or coffee. Because there was nobody who said, “You can’t do this.” It was very weak. You tried something out, and maybe after two years, “Oh no, it’s not my thing,” or, “It is my thing.” And you all together gave the city a direction, and the direction was conscionable. Now, today, in the year 2018, it became a strong economic force. Berlin without this nighttime... and techno is guilty of everything. You, Mike. But when this came over it influenced other things. Other business came over, like the hostels came up. We have now 60,000 beds. EasyJet came over, and brings every weekend, brings 10,000 people who want to try something out. They say, “There in Berlin is something we do not have in our own city, let’s check it out.” And everybody brings at least one idea, so we have a creative atmosphere in Berlin. I don’t know where you will go after all this nice two weeks, or four weeks. You should take something home, and you should start your own scene, build it up there. Don’t come to Berlin, it’s fully booked. [laughter] It’s better you find your own way. Mike Banks Well hey Dimitri, maybe you should tell them about what you wanna try to start. Dimitri Hegemann Yeah. Mike Banks The foundation. Dimitri Hegemann Yeah, we wanna do, Mike and me, we talked since a while about an idea because if we are gone maybe one day, what about our dreams and our philosophy? So we think about to start a foundation, maybe the Underground Resistance Foundation. And it should work somehow, let’s think big, like Greenpeace. It’s about spaces, it’s about people, about operators who want to do something, and have this problem to own a space, or to have to give it up after two years. It happened to me three times in my life. I build something up, then a landlord comes, “F--- off, go away, close it down.” So we think people really do this idea, and risk and bring passion into a cultural mission. They should have space; doesn’t matter where, in Scandinavia, in Africa, in Asia. And if they cannot afford it, as it was in my case, they could ask our foundation, and we check it out and say, “Wow, your concept is great, we will buy this building, and we will give it to you for 100 years, for 3% of the price.” Just an example, a million, and you pay 30,000 a year, that means two-five a month, and you find out, “Wow I can bring my friends for studios, I can open a coffee shop, I can open a venue.” This is a plan we have in mind, and we will publish it soon. And how do we finance it? We think the values we have in our foundation are good values. It will keep this movement up, and we take properties out of the speculations, and gentrification. We think people who want to do something should own the building. So we think about a network, worldwide, so we can work together. Because what made Berlin really important also, and also Detroit, is this tiny place, like Submerge, where the people meet. You come to Detroit metro and you don’t know where to go. There’s only this one spot, the building of UR. In Berlin, back in the days we had Tresor or something else. I was in Chile, in Santiago de Chile, where we met Mike, and there was a big movement of techno. But when the clubs were gone, the DJs, Luciano and Ricardo, they all moved away, and now there’s nothing. The clubs keep this movement alive and that’s why we want to do this foundation, to keep culture venues alive, to make culture venues. And some of you might be not musicians, maybe they’re more let’s say, a promoter, operator, they’re important too. Because it’s not just the music you write, it’s also the party, the place where the community comes together. The dark rooms, no curfew, and you have a party all night long. It’s very important because new ideas get born and you get together with people, and it’s about sharing ideas, it’s about interacting [with] each other. It’s a social thing. And I think this foundation will keep you informed. And when you go back, stay in touch through the net with us, you will hear about it. Join us. We will ask people to donate something, even if it is a song, this is the way how we think that it will survive. We [may] ask even Red Bull maybe, or a company, or Jeff. Because this idea should keep on living. It’s not me, or Mike, or anybody. It is this great philosophy to live together because I’m 100% convinced that everybody sitting here is a member of, or participates in, the big movement, in the peace movement. It’s an idea, it’s an investment in global peace. Torsten Schmidt To illustrate that... [applause] To illustrate that, maybe video number one? (video: Happy Locals initiative) You can applaud if you want, but I guess all these things do not require any major funds from any state institution, any brand or any benefactor with questionable sources of income. A lot of those things, all they require is an open heart, and a willingness to actually invest time and get together with a person that’s probably closer to you than you think. So that’s definitely a lot of food for thought there. How does that tie in with another initiative you’re working on called Happy Locals? Dimitri Hegemann Yes, the Happy Locals. I mean, how to build a community, like this movie you just saw here, is an initiative. How to keep young people in the countryside, in small cities. We said already, we don’t want that you all move to Berlin, or somewhere. You should stay in your small city, and what we do... What my experience was after now 30 years after the fall of the wall, is [to] give young people space and let it be. And say, “Yes.” This is a message I tell mayors in small cities because the problem we have in Berlin, in Germany now, young people, if they don’t find any platform where they can express their selves when they are 15, 16, 17, 18, they wait till they’re 18 and then they move. They move to Berlin and it’s sometimes very tragic because Berlin, they don’t find this job, they end up as a taxi driver. Because they wanted to change the world with all their power, and they need it [in their] home cities. So we try [to] tell the mayors and the administration, “Keep these people in your home and give them a space, in self-administration. Say, “Yes,” and give them a job maybe.” Sometimes it’s pretentious maybe, one person or two persons, but they run it and then they start an independent, small movement. This was the reason why Berlin became so popular, because there was not this big control by authorities. We could do what we wanted to do and this is what we’re working for, it’s called happylocals.org you’ll find it on. And it make young people happy and it’s also about identification. If you grow up in the city and there’s nothing going on and you just wait, you go back, you don’t come back. You go to a bigger city and the problem of this vacuum, if all these open-minded people move away, the problem is that the right wing mainstream comes up, is rising, taking this vacuum and starts trouble. So I think culture is also a tool, a weapon against this movement, and this is why I really support this. Carola Stoiber I keep my fingers very crossed for this. And also because when you said before that you didn’t want to leave your hometown and you had to, so hopefully there is a chance that a lot of people can stay these days, and not have to leave because of that happy... Holidays. Torsten Schmidt There’s that, and I think it’s probably not to be taken in an offensive way when you’re saying, “Stay, don’t come to Berlin.” ’Cause I guess a lot of people had to go to a different place but that means don’t forget where you come from. You’re always free to go back once a month, invest where you are and if you make any surplus, invest that into local structure and make sure that, I don’t know, if there’s one kid that’s sat like you on a school bus with UR on the headphones and PE or whatever, and there’s another kid now 20, 30 years later that will probably get that same spark, you already did something good. Carola Stoiber Yeah, and I wouldn’t say that so sharp that “Don’t come to Berlin," or, “Stay in your village.” It’s always a matter of where you meet people that [have the] same state of mind, where you feel comfortable with [them] and where you feel [a] certain energy and power. Maybe that sounds really emotional now but it’s how I think. And if you are with the right people then you move something, you can move something. Even if you don’t know the direction yet when you sit together, but something will happen with the art and the music you do then, and that’s pretty much free where that could happen and these days we have a way better way of communication, where you can also talk to people in the city or in the village all the time, depending on where you are, so I guess it’s pretty open. Torsten Schmidt On the note of meeting people, I would like to play a bit of music and have all three of you think about how you met that person first and then probably tell those stories right after. (music: Drexciya – “Aqua Worm Hole”) Torsten Schmidt So, Drexciya, “Aqua Worm Hole.” Who wants to go first? Mike Banks Well, I will. Yeah, that’s James [Stinson] and company, Drexciya. And I met them, Derrick May called me and said “Hey man, go get your thing man, some guys in my house they crazy as hell.” And one of them was saluting every time the record would come on and the other one was playing with Derrick’s knives or something crazy. Derrick was real worried about them. It’s like, all the guys said, “Oh, you need to be on UR, let me call Mike.” ’Cause people come up and audition music and Derrick and Kevin and Juan be like, “Hey man, you need to go over there with Mike.” ’Cause I like weird music and stuff. Not that they don’t, but if its especially strange. And I feel like they are a part of urban reality ’cause they had a hell of a fantasy there, ’cause I don’t think none of them seen the ocean ever. So I said, “OK, well fellas, let’s hear the tracks.” And when they played them, everything was on 4-track, and everything was like two minutes or barely over a minute and 30 seconds long sometimes and they needed edits. They didn’t really need mixing. They just needed edits so a DJ could use it sometimes, ’cause they weren’t aware of fading in on the record or any of that kinda stuff, they just did ’em. Me and James Stinson became fast friends, as did me and Gerald Donald and Dennis Richardson, I should name him. And Tyree, James’s brother who’s not available right now. James, me and him really became friends and I decided to start... I thought the music needed to be out, that’s how I felt. I didn’t know what would happen with it. We pressed them up, we sent them out to the distributors and all that, and nobody wanted it. Nobody wanted Drexciya. Nobody. So I was like, “OK, I’ve got a record store, I know Detroit will want it. It’s electro. ’Cause Detroit love electro.” So I just put it in the store and all the Detroit DJs bought it up for about 2, 3, 2 and a half years and then a guy came from England. And I remember him, his name was Ed DMX and he heard it and he just was jumping around, “This is the... Ah man, this is the bomb blah blah blah blah blah...” And he bought them, bought some copies and then the next thing you know the Aphex Twin record label was calling us, he had a record label called Rephlex. And he was calling, asking about Drexciya and all that stuff and I was like... They had a lot of stuff that was dreamy, like that one was kinda dreamy. I liked the hard stuff, of course. And I thought OK man, you want to license it or do something. And James had a lot of kids, he’s got a lot of kids. I can’t walk in his shoes; he needed some cheese and the Rephlex people was very, very nice and I know they cared about it, the music. So I kinda gave the go ahead, do your thing, and he released the album with Rephlex. And all of a sudden, all them records I had just started selling. Gimme 2,000, gimme 3,000, I couldn’t figure out what was going on. And I guess it was the fact that it was on Rephlex. Same thing happened when Dimitri put it on Tresor. And I thought James had the potential to be an international artist ’cause he had a decent temperament. You know I can’t send them all out here, ’cause some of them boys, I wouldn’t leave them alone with nobody’s sister man. James was a good person and I thought he had a chance at traveling and seeing and doing like we had did. I thought he would be a good representative of black folks. He was even-keeled, he was smart and not only black folks, just Detroit. I don’t like to send the dangerous ones out here ’cause they not good at representing. James would’ve been, but unfortunately he died and that was sad. He was a good friend. He worked for us at Submerge for four or five years. He ran the record store and he met Ralf Hütter. That was his like, ah man, that was his life dream. Ralf Hütter walked in the store and sniffed around. It was a few people, and people was really happy, and Ralf Hütter, like I said, nice guy. Really good guy. Always talking about music, but he really made a big impression on James and James wanted to have a career in music ’cause he was a truck driver. He drove trucks, and yep, good dude, I miss him a lot and that’s all I can say. Carola Stoiber Yeah and that’s why he came, you sent him to Tresor Records. Because back in the golden years, when some records were sold, we also did pay advance payments on records to be sold, so that’s why that was possible to pay him some money up front for his kids and hopefully... Mike Banks Yeah ’cause UR don’t pay no money up front. Carola Stoiber ... Stop the truck driver action and that’s why one record then came out on Tresor Records and I had the same problems like you had in the store, because Tresor Records was quite known for very hard stuff, not so dreamy. And the team was saying, “I don’t know about this record and this is too strange,” and I said, “No no no, it is good, it has to go out.” And it was also very, very successful but then unfortunately he died and never came over to do something live. He couldn’t make it anymore which was quite sad, yes. Torsten Schmidt Did you ever meet him personally? Carola Stoiber Yes, I did. Torsten Schmidt How did that go down? Carola Stoiber I don’t know the first time, but I know of course in Detroit you were driving in cars and trucks, so we were driving and talking, listening to music in the car. He had to pick something up at home, where also his studio was, in there. But of course, no way that I could come in there. Wait in the car. It’s all hidden territory. So I then go in the car, then go to have breakfast somewhere. Another time we went fishing on Belle Isle. He did this crazy stuff. So he said, “Now we go fishing.” I said, “Where?” “Here in Detroit, Belle Isle.” So we were sitting there doing this with him, talking about what we should do for promotion for the record. It was quite strange. [laughter] Torsten Schmidt I mean the man was big on water and I guess, not that I would know any, but geeks around the world, saw a pretty logical conclusion between certain tracks that were hinting at submarine warfare on UR and then it was only logical that someone had a different outlook. Can you somehow explain a little bit about the theoretical concepts and the narratives that were perpetrated by the Drexciya records? Mike Banks I think the best way to describe that is a movie out there called Dagon, and that movie was very much a favorite. It’s an old movie. It looks like a European movie, it’s really strange and... Torsten Schmidt What are you trying to say? Mike Banks It involves fish people. He was all off into mutated, Creature from the Black Lagoon stuff. Yeah, he was way off into that, like your hands turn into gills, and they was really deep into that. It used to disturb me sometimes, some of the s--- they be thinking about, I just listen to them and be like, “Yeah, yeah, let me hear that track.” [laughter] A lot of them is like, I’m telling you, them boys... I put their sound out ’cause I think the world need to know how twisted up you can get. You can get twisted up just staying in the hood the whole time, and everybody ain’t got their hat on crooked and selling dope and going to prison. They different guys. Carola Stoiber Drexciyans are underwater warriors that were, this I can’t exactly remember, from the slave boats. They either jumped down or the children. And they just... Mike Banks That was The Quest. Carola Stoiber Yeah, no, but the Drexciyans, I don’t know, they were the warriors that were rising or, how you say, the next generation of the... Mike Banks Yeah they was the... Carola Stoiber ... Of the people that went on the slave boats. Mike Banks Yeah when they would throw the women off the slave boat. Carola Stoiber See that’s... Mike Banks ... They would birth, the fetus would birth underwater, and a lot of that was based on The Abyss, that you can breathe oxygenized water. Anyway, these guys exist at the bottom of the ocean and they ain’t the nicest guys in the world. They trying to understand humanity, which they look at as inferior because they pollute the ocean and they like the guardians of the ocean. Kinda like some f---ed-up sea shepherd. Torsten Schmidt But I mean a narrative with the Afrofuturistic power that would put Wakanda to shame. Mike Banks Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean actually large parts of The Quest, me and James, I wrote most of it based off of The Abyss, the movie The Abyss. But James and them already had a concept of the Drexciyans and the warriors and stuff, so we just built on his concept. I would never say I came up with the concept for them, but I liked that they had an imagination, and that’s what hit, resonated with me the most. I was always taught that a person with no dreams is a dangerous person. With no hope, with no dreams, certainly they don’t carry much of a future with them. Unfortunately in Detroit you can get real, we called it “grayed out.” You get grayed out, you done seen so much that... It’s like the same as a soldier, when they in the war. You just expect to die at any time ’cause you living like that. So, guys like that, obviously, I ain’t got no time for them ’cause my man in a casket anyway. But this guy right here got a dream, even though it’s kinda freaky and I’m trying to understand it. I thought the dream had a sound to it, they had characters to it. It was very intriguing to me that guys from neighborhood like what they come from, which was tight, it was a tight neighborhood, they were from the East side, that they could imagine like this, and I thought they were very unique and their ideology was very unique and I think I guessed right. I think I guessed right and I’m glad I bet on James Stinson. Torsten Schmidt There’s another person that’s very strongly connected to all of your work and was a member of UR as well, in the beginning. Where’s Robert? Mike Banks Rob Hood? Yeah Rob’s my dog, Rob is a... Yeah, that’s my man. Rob, one of the hardest working guys in UR. He came in, a young rapper with a [Roland TR-]505, and the 505 was played out at that time. That’s all he had. What he lacked in equipment he had in heart and Rob Hood, like I said, he wanted to help. He liked the UR ethos that we had and me and Jeff liked him. He worked, like I said, he worked his ass off and he was always trying to produce tracks and learn more or help us with artwork or whatever he could do to make the team successful.
He was a team player and that’s why Rob is an honorary lifetime member, to me, of UR. He’s one of the circle, and he helped early, in any way he could: Packing boxes, answering the phones, sending faxes. His early attempts at tracks, he didn’t have no gear, so we would kinda hand him the gear, whatever we wasn’t using. And that was a lot to throw at somebody ’cause you spanning 20 years of technology. “Hey man, here’s a 707, this a 303, this how you hook it up,” and it was a little much, but Rob... And it’s just like with you guys, you going to find that one piece of gear that talks to you. And Rob finally found it and you can hear a lot of his early experiments on a label that I distributed called Hard Wax. You can also hear some of Gerald Donald’s early experiments, he had a label called, what was it Mark? L.A.M.? I forget but I dropped a lot of their stuff. I knew it wasn’t ready yet but I wanted to encourage them to keep banging. Rob and Gerald Donald kept banging and they are who they are right now and we are extremely proud of Rob, Eunice and their beautiful daughter Lyric, and I sometimes, occasionally, around the world, I see him and we just get the biggest hug and all that stuff. Yeah man. He’s very appreciative of the time we put into him and we very appreciative of all that he did with UR. He caught hell ’cause every time he bring a track we be like, “No, that ain’t it. No, that ain’t it. No.” Then he finally came with something on a, was it X-101? Yeah. It sounded like germs or disease or bacteria and I liked it. I was like, “That’s kinda sweet. It’s like some decay s---.” He was finding his sound but to me, Rob Hood really defined himself on Axis 007. It was on Jeff’s label and he did a doublepack, and that’s when I knew Rob had it, he had it. I mean if you know anything about electronic music you’ll see where he’s heading now. So I’m very proud of all our guys that eventually get out the basement, ’cause that’s where he was at, and come out here and represent. I’m very proud of Robert Hood. Dimitri Hegemann I must also add that his albums on Tresor, like Eternal Empire, it’s a classic. It’s actually 25 years ago. That was minimal music that still really functions and works and he influenced a lot. Then he moved to Alabama, became a preacher and if anybody’s here on November 9th, the day when the wall fell, Robert is playing and preaching for the first time. We arranged something... Mike Banks That’s next year right? Next year? Dimitri Hegemann Next month. Mike Banks Oh next month, OK. Dimitri Hegemann In one month. In Kreuzberg, in St. Thomas. And this is very exciting. So he will play in a church, electronic music, and then he will talk to the community. So this question comes up, I think it would be great if, is techno a religion? Is it? Or not. I would love to start this debate because I mean the electronic community is already a faith community, and why not, if it works in America maybe. We have great advantages. Text and radio frequencies. Anyway, he is coming at 7 PM. I want to announce Robert is there, and for the first time he is preaching also. I’m very curious. Torsten Schmidt I mean the gospel spirit, that’s probably something that was kind of tough to understand and learn for most Europeans and people in other cultures as well. How strongly informed, despite all the harshness, Detroit music is by the gospel. Mike Banks Oh yes, it’s very spiritual. That’s why I be at all the students, at the participants at Red Bull, about, “Get out of that book and start feeling something.” Many of us learned to play instruments in church ’cause that’s the place they had them. Or your mother make you do it. “Go take your ass and learn how to do something, play an instrument. I’d be so happy if you was in a band in church, instead of making down in that basement, calling the devil and all that.” Yeah it’s very spiritual and I think one of the masters of it is Derrick May. You can listen to his records and it’s just really, really something extra. Rob’s, every time, everyone once in a while, I might get the feeling. But I think all the guys, there’s something extra, something to it. You can’t really put your finger on it and I don’t think you really should put your finger on it. It’s just there. Its just a spirit of creation, I guess, creating something good. Torsten Schmidt In order to illustrate some of that and a little more, could we please watch video number four. (video: Galaxy 2 Galaxy – “Hi-Tech Jazz” (live)) [applause] I guess we could’ve played one or two others in a similar vein that work well in the morning when the sun comes up. It doesn’t always have to be a beautiful place somewhere in the middle of Japan. But... Mike Banks Yeah. No, that was... They waited til the sun came up and we started the track. Yeah, it was special. I mean, that’s what I be talking about the feeling. We felt it. When they did the sax, the melody, we couldn’t even hear the keyboards no more, it was so loud. So yeah, we got a lot of love. And that’s what we take back to Detroit with us. Everybody that come and visit us. You know, people be writing really good stuff on the wall in the basement, and it really goes a long way in helping us deal with what’s happening in the D right now. I can go in the basement, look what people wrote, and it really does carry me through, I can say that. So, it’s a give and take. We give y’all music, people give us back love and it sustains us. So, can we do the questions? [laughs] Torsten Schmidt That’s... Mike Banks I told everybody we wouldn’t be... Torsten Schmidt Alright, so in order for you guys to muster up all the strength and focus for the questions, maybe we play something early from the catalog, in order to get you into the right uplifting mood there. (music: Davina – “Don’t You Want It”) [applause] Yeah, Mad Mike, Davina, “Don’t You Want It.” What a joy, and what an opportunity to thank Carola, Dimitri and Mike for being here and sharing with us at length. Please give it up. [applause] Now, the magic microphone comes floating. Questions. Audience Member Hi, I’m Emma. First, I wanted to thank Mike for taking the time to tell these stories that I’ve wanted to ask about over the past two weeks. It’s been great to hear some of this. And then actually, I had a question for Dimitri. I had the opportunity to pick your brains earlier this year in Switzerland at some festival, and we were talking a bit about how it is in places outside of Berlin, in terms of influencing legislation so that venues can stay open, and nightlife can continue, and I know that’s something you’ve campaigned hard for. I was wondering if you had any advice to people who are living in places where it’s not so easy to do things legally, and how best to try to open up spaces, whether to just break the law and go ahead with it, or to try to be legitimate enough to influence something politically. Dimitri Hegemann Yeah, call me. I’ll give you my email, and then we have to... We’ll see, it’s a special case. But mostly decision makers, you can get their interest if they see numbers, and influence. If they see money coming in, and what you’re doing. And this is in Berlin, now, they understood, for instance, as I said, we have no curfew, the night is open, we have nearly 200 venues, they open in the weekends. And crime rate down. Not up, down, despite everything is open. So, the best thing is, if we can... Torsten Schmidt Are you reading different media than anyone else? I mean, the media always tries to tell people that... Dimitri Hegemann No, I mean, I’m talking about the electronic music venues and clubs, what the influence is, and how they can help a city, the urban development influence. So, we have to talk about a special case, but normally there is a way. But you need this one person, this one woman, this one man, this operator who wants to run it. He must be crazy enough, he must bring this passion, then it will work. And if we look in Berlin, all these people who run a spot here, they’re all crazy, you know? Nobody is normal. It’s always a niche business. You cannot learn it. So, if you have it, then you will make it. And we encourage you to do that. Torsten Schmidt And all facetiousness aside, it is actually worth it to go to these legislators and show them the real numbers, and go, “OK, there might be a local tabloid that might wanna portray the situation in a city like that, but this is what actually is going on. This is how crime rates are going down. This is how this and that happens.” Dimitri Hegemann Yeah, it’s very simple, actually. And especially if it’s a small thing. We have a lot of examples in Germany, or it’s in the Netherlands and Scandinavia, when the small spots become so attractive for all the people surrounding [them], because this is [a] desire of the people, to go to such a space, and to meet people [with similar] thoughts and thinking. And this is the reason why it works, to meet your people, to meet my people. This is that... Mike Banks You know, that’s how he got the attention to Detroit. I keep saying it. Out of all these countries over here in Europe, like I was telling y’all, nobody came and said, “Hey, you should play Derrick May on the radio.” Nobody from Europe. None of these guys’ record companies came. Dimitri was often coming to Detroit and talking about you guys, the nighttime economy. He was telling the city government about the money that you’re missing, the tax money that you badly need to help your people, you blowing it, ’cause you cutting off at 2 o’clock. So, he had all these statistics and numbers, and they go, “Yeah, yeah, yeah,” they just waiting for him to drop dollars. That’s what they was really waiting on doing. Sometimes, you put a little s--- in the game. You fly ’em to the club. When our guys came over here to the club, they came back like, “We need to open some clubs, 24-hour,” They partied their ass off up in here. And Dimitri brought some city officials over. They came over, they saw it, they experienced it, they lived it, and they still talking about it. And now, we’re getting a little traction. I think the Mayor gave us until what, 4 AM now? And Cornelius has been over there... That’s our manager, for UR, our longtime friend. But Cornelius been battling for it, Dimitri been battling for it, and they got 4 AM. And now we just need to make a club for ’em to go to. But it’s real. This stuff, the economic minister of Berlin told us that they make 900 million dollars a year off electronic music. Three aircraft carriers. EasyJet, Ryanair, three of ’em, to add it to the airport. The guy that’s building the airport here in Berlin, he’s a friend of mine, Dr. [Philipp] Bouteiller. Brilliant man. Gives us information, information on how to build a future city. For Detroit. Everybody be teasing him, ’cause the Berlin thing is over budget. But the reason it’s over budget, [is] because so many people was coming here, because it’s so attractive to be here. I pay $300 a month for 15 gigabytes a second, for years. I had to pay special money to get an internet line put in in my neighborhood, because they like, “Ain’t nobody got no phone over there. They ain’t got cable. They ain’t got nothing.” I mean, it was a trip, but soon, you guys here in Berlin, you’re gonna have five gigabytes, wireless, free. So, when you share that information with a mayor of a city, and say, “Yo man, you got this billionaire running around putting up internet lines,” that’s what I’m talking about, y’all. You gotta see that. You can’t let millionaires control your communications, you can’t let ‘em control your art, you can’t let ‘em control when you go to sleep. What kinda s--- is that? “You gotta be in bed at 2 o’clock.” Your mama don’t tell you that, when you get grown. [laughter] You got the city government saying, “Y’all go to bed, so you can get up in the morning.” What if I got a night job? They ain’t even... I mean, OK. [laughter] I just get frustrated. Dimitri Hegemann It is also interesting, I mean, the department in Berlin, the institution who cares about tourists that visit Berlin, they announced that two-thirds of most people coming, two-thirds come because of [the] alternative culture of this town. Clubbing is one half of it, but also, a cool gallery, a cool restaurant, all the small spots. A cool haircutter. Everything! I mean, there’s many possibilities, but that it worked, that it finally started, was because techno came over, and we had these parties in the night. And therefore that has influenced a lot. That encouraged people to go their own way. So this is my perception. And we had a great framework. Detroit has not... I mean, if we would have... Framework, I mean the curfew. The 2 AM. If Berlin had the 2 AM, can you imagine what this means? A collapse. And you won’t be here, maybe. The nighttime has a special quality, and the best ideas I ever had in life came after 2:30 AM I think. And I don’t know where you come from, but I mean just think about that. And for Detroit, they have now, actually, after we talked, Mike, you met the mayor for the first time. We didn’t open the nightclub, but you started racing. Drag racing, and they have a night ambassador now. Mike Banks They do. Dimitri Hegemann So, finally, they have somebody who cares. When the mayor goes to bed at 10 PM, you know? 10:30 PM, they go to bed... Mike Banks He finally listened to me, ’cause, like I said, I got a little convo with the mayor now, because of Dimitri. And we’ve been racing illegally in Detroit... I mean, it’s the Motor City. Why don’t we have a racetrack? You got all these... Like all y’all is music artists. We got all these artists with these cars, that need to get off. So, we end up doing it in the street. That movie The Fast and the Furious, and all that? All them people was down there listening to the guys talk so they could get their lingo right with the movie, and all this kinda stuff. But I’m saying, you got the Motor City, no motor sports in the Motor City. Got the biggest illegal drag racing scene, probably in the world. Fastest cars in the world. And they running down the street. So, two plus two is four. When I finally got his ear, I said, “Hey man, why don’t you just make drag racing inside the city? We got an abandoned airport right there.” And they did it. The new mayor, he said, “You know what? That makes sense.” So we did a racing day. Omar [S] wasn’t there. I wish Omar... ’cause Omar is my man, he races. But $275,000 we made in five hours. All the little bad boys in the neighborhood out there looking at the cars. They got in free on they bikes, they rolled in, and gang banging ain’t got a chance against race cars, ’cause that s--- is mano a mano. They see their daddies, and 50-year-old men, “Set it out, run that.” Big money bet. $30,000, $40,000. It’s excitement, you know what I’m saying? So that’s what got me away from being real bad. I was kind of bad, but I wasn’t as bad as I could have been. So, it’s a very necessary thing. And because of Dimitri, and because of the music, we got a little bit of an audience with the city government. I was so proud of a councilwoman, what’s her name Corn? Audience Member You talking about Raquel? Mike Banks Say it. Audience Member Raquel... Mike Banks Yeah, Lopez and... Audience Member ... And Mary Sheffield. Mike Banks And Miss Sheffield. They came over, they seen it, and they brought back positive [feedback]. And Adrian Tonon, our nighttime man. We actually got a nighttime manager, and soon we’re hoping we’ll have a nighttime economy. More people getting employed, blah blah blah. Hopefully at the racetrack, so we can race safely. [laughter] Torsten Schmidt That sounds like you know something about racing. Mike Banks Yeah, come on... Yeah, they don’t wanna know about no race car. Let’s ask another question. Torsten Schmidt Alright. Next. Audience Member Hi, I’m Tornike. Thank you so much for this amount of inspiration being poured on us. My question was to Dimitri. I guess, from this perspective, it looks really romantic, if that’s the right word to say, to hear about how you came to Berlin and started this movement that’s made these big changes, and how did it feel back then? What were the biggest emotional struggles you had to go through? If this question makes sense. Dimitri Hegemann I mean, I made the experience. If you fail, it is a special quality, too. Because even the whole thing with Tresor, for instance, we went like a normal human life. Went up and then everything collapsed. Then we tried to get up again. It was never like this. [makes constant upward motion] We always had the problem. And it’s not really easy to survive. We have many people working for us now and we are a team, but we use this freedom. It encouraged me again and again. But you need one person, or two [people], who really run it. If you have this quality, in a way, or this passion, then you’ll find the people. And it’s very, very important. I think we also inspired other people who manage to do something, but it’s maybe outstanding in a way. I think somebody must start, even if it is small. People will find out, and find the right people. Not the right people, I mean people you like. And this is important, that you find your people, and that you work with values. I have seen already, in Woodstock, with the peace idea, violence-free, and with the green idea, and the freedom and tolerance, these are good values, they stay forever. And even if you start a very small spot, if it’s a Dada club or something like that, I give you the advice, you find the right people, they will find you. And you should start in the place where you come from. But it’s romantic, in the way that you... For me, it was that you could realize it. That was enough. Even if sometimes the thing is very popular, everybody knows it. But from the economics, it’s bad. You cannot say you’re so popular, and you’ll make so much money. No, it doesn’t work. And also important, is to give something back. To remember where it came from. I tried this also with many talks with Mike and Mike’s team and so on. And you feel good, if you let it go. Even if we do the foundation one day, I would love to put everything into the foundation, and the foundation cares about us, and it can give many people a direction, what to do. I think the time is over, mostly, that somebody, or a label tries to make as much money as they can do, because I must realize that many, many labels go this way. And promoters, especially. Promoters do the big festivals, but they don’t care. And looking back to the Love Parade. The parade actually, I mean, some promoters organized it, but the parade is a symbol of a feeling of togetherness. The desire to come together with people who share ideas, the same ideas and values. And that’s the reason why it became so big. And it became so big that 1.5 million people got together. But the management could not handle it. They couldn’t give them enough social input. But I think if we would start it again, with something, it would be packed immediately. This is a desire of people, to be together, and to work together. And this is also, I think, one of your challenges. When you go back and do something. And we are ready, we still can move Mike. Me and Carola will be coming, and maybe try to help some more. Torsten Schmidt Carola, anything you would like to add to that? Carola Stoiber Keep on with passion. Torsten Schmidt As simple as that. But as essential. Mike Banks That’s right, that’s right. Torsten Schmidt Alright. Coach Banks, any closing remarks? Mike Banks No, I’m good. If y’all good, I’m good. I know y’all are tired. Thank all y’all for hanging in there with me. I know y’all are tired, and I know y’all gotta get back in the studios, and all that. And I’ll be back there with you. So, thank you for sitting and listening to all this. Hopefully it’ll have some impact on you. Torsten Schmidt Well, thank you. And to class of 2018, please join me once again in thanking Carola, Dimitri and Mike. [applause] Carola Stoiber Thank you guys.

Title: Moor Mother

Moor Mother
Moor Mother is a Philadelphia-based artist, musician and activist who utilizes her multi-genre practice to speak to consciousness, identity, blackness and the sociopolitical global landscape. She started to record and release music in 2012 as a solo project under the porous, playful rubric of self-defined sounds like “project-housing bop,” “slaveship punk” and “blk girl blues,” and her output is a patchwork quilt of spoken word, poetry and fractured lyricism alongside guttural electronics, dissonant textures and fragments of instrumentation. Her discography is vast and expanding, with albums like 2016’s Fetish Bones and 2017’s The Motionless Present critically acclaimed exercises in power electronics and intense vocalizations.
In her lecture at RBMA Berlin 2018, Moor Mother discussed her upbringing in Maryland, Black Quantum Futurism, her addiction to collaboration and her writing process.
Hosted by Aaron Gonsher Please join me in welcoming poet, musician, activist, Moor Mother. We were just listening to “Deadbeat Protest,” from your 2016 LP Fetish Bones. I wanted to start us off with that music, so that people could get a sense of where you’re coming from creatively. What can you tell us about where your head was at when you were first making that track? Moor Mother It was simple. I’m part of a DIY scene in Philadelphia, and I was just frustrated after an event, just feeling like no one really cared. It was the start of this performative activism, that now, I feel like has always been, but as far as my life, it’s been really rampant now. A lot of people are just doing activism or whatever, or giving a fuck just for the ’Gram [Instagram]. It’s just pissing me off, in the early... Is this language okay? Aaron Gonsher Yeah. Whatever you want. Moor Mother It was making me upset. It was pissing me off about the state of things, and it just happens with everything. It happens a lot with poetry. You write something that seems to be about a little small situation you’re dealing with in your scene, but it reflects on this greater picture of what’s happening in the world. And I was just... That’s just really what happened. Aaron Gonsher So when was it actually written? Moor Mother Maybe 2014 or ’15. Aaron Gonsher One of the things I’m really interested in that song, is that you cram so much information into basically a minute and 23 seconds. Did it take a lot of revisions to get to the point where you felt like the message was exactly what you wanted it to be? Or were you rolling with something that was more improvisational from the outset? Moor Mother No, the words were already there, the words are the easy part. The hard part is, “Can I sing this right? Can I get a decent recording of me performing this correctly in my bedroom?” So it was a lot of, maybe I took about three takes to get it right, and I still wasn’t really happy. But it was like, the deadline’s coming, I’ve got to get this done. It wasn’t for a while that I listened to the album, and I was like, “Fuck. This is good.” Before I was like, “Ugh, I’m not singing this correctly, I don’t, ugh.” All the shortcomings that come along with your process, I was focusing on a lot of that. But the words, that’s simple. I love punk, so there’s so many punk songs, especially by Bad Brains, where they just repeat certain things over and over again, but I’m like, “Ugh, I got that attitude. Yes, I feel this.” Aaron Gonsher It’s like Bad Brains, or the Minutemen, too. When we’re talking about people who can just fit something into a minute long, but there’s so much information. Did that desire for brevity come from punk originally, too? Moor Mother Yeah, to get all the information in a short amount of time, for sure. Aaron Gonsher One of the things about “Deadbeat Protest” that is also really interesting, is that I introduced you as a poet and a musician and an activist, but I think all three of those really coalesce in what this song is saying and how it’s being delivered. Moor Mother Yeah, I think I get this activism thing, because I just care, you know what I mean? I give a shit. It’s like, “Woah, this is activism.” But it’s like, what are other people doing? I don’t understand why this is so hard. I just had a show recently, and one of the curators was like, “Yeah, your music’s a bit difficult to get into.” Aaron Gonsher That was from a curator? Moor Mother Yeah. And then I was on stage, and I was just like, “Difficult?” It sounded like a poem, but I was like, “What you mean difficult?” It’s not like I’m doing some fantasy. What do you mean? People are getting shot. It’s happening every day, so why all of the sudden when I come on stage it’s intense and difficult? What are you all watching, what are you all listening to? Why is this some radical thing that’s happening? Aaron Gonsher I don’t think activism has to be a dirty word either, but it is quite rare in music. Moor Mother I don’t think it’s a dirty word, but right now it’s a buzz word. Anyone can be like, “I participate in self-care, I’m a radical activist.” They take things and squeeze it, and then I’m just hanging with this empty lemon or something. I don’t need a label to care and want to be invested in my community, and want to have some compassion about what people are going through. It’s not like it’s just my one friend. It’s a whole world situation. I try to think about situations that are happening all over the world that no one is talking about... i.e., domestic violence. Aaron Gonsher When you talk about your community too, what community did you come from initially, what can you tell us about the community where you grew up? Moor Mother I grew up in Aberdeen, a small town in Maryland. There’s a place called Washington Park, where I spent my early high school, everything up until about 11th grade. It was a community where everyone just did for themselves. We couldn’t get food deliveries to come, because everyone was always robbing the pizza man and stuff like this, which was funny to us. It wasn’t like, “This is dangerous.” It was like, “Whatever, it’s the pizza guy. Who cares?” Or it’s a taxi, “Run out of there.” We had our own taxi. We had people that had stores in their closets. We had candy ladies. We had a guy to fix bikes. There was really no need to leave and it was no need to feel like we didn’t have anything. I didn’t grow up like, “Oh, so poor. Oh, drugs.” It was like a utopia, it was beautiful. People from that community were always in communication, were always saying, “Washington Park for life.” It was a very important thing that I haven’t seen anywhere else, because so many people are being pushed out, so many people are being evicted, so many condos... It’s like the condo revolution. Soon you will all have a condo probably, and that’s just the reality of it, really beautiful. Aaron Gonsher Did you take that self-sufficient philosophy into your work when you were starting to enter DIY communities as a musician, as well? Moor Mother Yeah. That has influenced my entire work, living in Washington Park. I was just talking about wanting to tap dance, and instead of having the idea of being like, “Mom, can I get tap-dancing shoes?” me and my sister was like, “We’ve got to get all these bottle caps, and we’ve got to put them on our shoes.” Just that thing of being like, if you want to do something, find a way to create it. So when I moved to Philadelphia, I was thinking that I was just gonna study and be this photographer, and not get into this crazy thing, music. But it just found me, and they kicked me out of school, and this is what I do. Aaron Gonsher I do want to talk about Philadelphia eventually, but I’m curious to hear what the musical diet was like in your actual household, because I know your father was in a couple of choirs at the church. Moor Mother Yeah, very what you would call spooky gospel music. Where you’re like, “Wow, are now ghosts entering the room?” Not like the R&B gospel, which is popular now, because you have so many R&B musicians that are making gospel records. For instance like a Mary Mary – I don’t know if anyone listens to gospel here, but it’s very R&B from where it came from of being spirituals and ways of singing prayer, to gather around each other. It’s all about healing. So yeah, a lot of gospel, a lot of R&B, but not the R&B that you folks know. Not like Destiny’s Child and stuff like that. R&B like Patti LaBelle and Stephanie Mills and James Brown, stuff like that. Real crunchy and dirty. Aaron Gonsher When did punk enter the picture though, if you’re going from gospel like Mahalia Jackson and James Brown, then you’re getting into Bad Brains eventually. How did that go down? Moor Mother I was also big into hip-hop, Public Enemy, MC Lyte, a lot of stuff like that. Then hip-hop changed to being a lot more dance-y, like MC Hammer and C+C Music Factory, and all of this stuff, which is cool, I’m not against that, but I still had this hunger for this type of hip-hop that was speaking about the stuff that I was seeing in my neighborhood and growing up. So I just searched, I just was searching, asking kids in school, “What are you listening to?” Then I found Bob Marley, then I was like, “Woah, this is really different, this is kind of punk.” From Bob Marley, I found punk. Stuff like early Nirvana. Operation Ivy, I loved that group when I was starting out in punk, and just stuff about communities coming together, dealing with racism, stuff like that, kind of punk. Aaron Gonsher Did it feel like this omnivorous music taste was more the norm where you grew up, or were people slotting into very specific areas? Moor Mother No one was listening to this in my neighborhood, and I bought a pair of those JNCO’s, you know those pants, this is Berlin, I’m sure everyone has a pair on right now or something. [laughs] Probably not. I remember the kids being like, “What are those pants, Camae? You from Washington Park.” But that helped me, being from this neighborhood, because I was already cool, so I didn’t have to really do anything. My brothers and sisters were all cool. They were so cool. I had that thing where I could do this, people would be like, “It’s okay, you’re just going through a phase, you’ll be back.” But not in a way of disowning me, because I’m from Washington Park. You can’t. There’s no getting rid of me in this kind of way. It’s just like, “OK, you’re doing your thing, you’ll come back around.” But now people see me, and they’re like, “You were always weird, I’m glad you stuck to it. I’m glad you’re doing your thing.” That’s cool. Aaron Gonsher Could we play video number four, please? (video: clip from Fight the Power... Live! /applause) That was a video from the Fight the Power... Live! VHS from 1989. Moor Mother I’ve got to get that VHS. Aaron Gonsher Were you at that tour? Moor Mother I went to that tour. That changed my world. When Terminator X was like, “Put up your fists” – I’m from Maryland, so I went to Baltimore to see concerts, and oh my goodness, I’ve never seen anything like that. It was all these black people with their fists up, and my little fist [was up]. I was just like, “Oh.” Aaron Gonsher How old were you then, if it’s a little fist? Moor Mother I don’t know, but I know my little fist, it was little. It was little, but it was strong. I’ve never been that young and felt so strong in my life. Aaron Gonsher How important were Public Enemy to you, not just from that experience, but in general musically, lyrically, politically to what you’re doing today? Moor Mother Everything. Just being... to tell the truth in this way. They had this line, where they were like, “Fuck Elvis.” I’m coming from Washington Park, I hated Elvis. I hated anyone like Elvis. And John Wayne, I hated cowboys. So I’m like, “Ugh, this is the truth, this is allowing me to walk around with a crown on my head.” Just this power, to be motivated, to be okay no matter what someone from the outside is telling you that you’re lacking or you’re living in some type of poverty or drug-infested area. You know nothing about us, it’s just confidence. Aaron Gonsher There was also a quote in that video, where he says, “Armageddon has been in effect.” I feel like that connects really strongly to Sun Ra, “It’s after the end of the world, don’t you know that yet?” These are two people amongst very many others whose philosophies and music would come to be grouped under Afrofuturists, Afrofuturism. Was this sense of Afrofuturism already seeping into your awareness early on in this music? Moor Mother That’s more of an academic framing, but the idea that is Afrofuturism has already been. So Public Enemy is not a start of anything, they’re all coming from this history that is so rich. Whether you want to call it African-American classical music, or black classical music, this is all a part of a history. That’s why you see Flavor Flav bugging out, because Chaka Khan is right there. We just played Pitchfork Fest with Irreversible Entanglements, and Chaka Khan was on there, and we were on the side stage freaking out. Because there’s a history, Mahalia Jackson, all of these people, you have to study this to understand the richness of what you’re doing. You’re not alone, so many people have been speaking this idea. When you think about Afrofuturism and they talk about Sun Ra, as if the Dogon tribe never existed, or these places, these indigenous ideas of the future, never existed. They called Galileo or whoever is the first astronomer? That’s crap. What? The Ferryman is the first astronomer, but you’ve got to do the history to understand how rich the information is that’s been provided for you. Aaron Gonsher Personally, when did you start becoming more aware of that history in the way you just... Moor Mother Afrofuturism? When I moved to Philadelphia – I’m not good with years – I did this event, Wine + Spirit + Mind, that the AfroFuturist Affair put on, this organization in Philadelphia. My partner, Rasheedah Phillips organized [it], and [I] performed at that and then started learning more. There’s a charity ball, the AfroFuturist Affair Costume and Charity Ball, performed that. I was already a curator in Philly, and I had been tapping these artists to perform that were under the umbrella of Afrofuturism, but they didn’t know it. It was just what they were making. Aaron Gonsher I feel like we skipped some time there. How did you end up in Philly in the first place? Moor Mother I went to school to study photography at the Art Institute. Aaron Gonsher Why photography? Moor Mother Good question. When high school’s over, then everyone’s going to college, I was like, “Oh, I better get out of here.” What could I do? I like Gordon Parks, I like photography, so let me try that out. Not like I was a photographer before. I don’t even have many baby pictures. No one was really taking pictures when I was young. I just thought it was beautiful to document what was going on in communities. Aaron Gonsher At the time that you moved to Philadelphia, you wouldn’t have considered yourself a musician already at that point? Moor Mother A rapper, I would say I’m a rapper. And that’s what happened at the Art Institute. There was a party and there was a cipher, and there was a young woman that got in the cipher. And I was like, “Well then I got to get in here.” Then, that’s where I changed my life pretty much. Got in the cipher, she was like, “That’s good.” I was like, “You’re cool.” Then we just started meeting up in the dorms, rapping over A Tribe Called Quest albums. Then being like, “Hey let’s do this.” Then I was like, “I really like punk too, let me turn you on to this.” Then we were just this hip-hop duo called the Docs, then to Paradocs. But there was some German band called the Paradox, and we were so pissed, we were like, “Germans, why do they get this name?” Because we thought we created it, and no one else had it. Then slowly but surely, we got a band. Then that was the Mighty Paradocs. Aaron Gonsher How aware had you been of Philadelphia’s musical legacy, at the point when you’d arrived? People like Billie Holiday born in Philadelphia, people like Sun Ra living there for his entire life. Moor Mother I didn’t know anything about Sun Ra yet, but I knew Patti LaBelle, and I knew the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Will Smith and all of that, DJ Jazzy Jeff. Hip-hop in that way, but I didn’t know exactly what it was like musically. That’s why when I came there, I was like, “I’m just gonna be a school kid.” But then, of course, of course I would come to Philadelphia and organize like I did, because the foundation was there. Of Sun Ra playing open in the parks, and stuff like that. Aaron Gonsher At what point did you become more aware of the history of activism in Philadelphia as well, and how was integrating with music, and how might you have taken that into the things that you ended up doing there? Moor Mother The first thing that I got into in Philadelphia was gathered around this bombing that happened to the MOVE Organization in Philadelphia. It happened in the ’80s, but when I got there, there were nine members in prison. It was a lot of organizing around awareness of that, and helping to release these people that were locked up. One of the more popular persons that people know in the world is Mumia [Abu-Jamal]. Aaron Gonsher Just for reference, there were nine people in prison for a cop who had gotten shot, but he got shot by one bullet, and they had terms of 100 years each. Moor Mother And the police in Philadelphia dropped a bomb on their house, so this is the first time that people have seen on the news the police force dropping a bomb. Usually that’s saved for the military, so it was really crazy. There’s actually a really good documentary, and the guy’s name, the mayor was Rizzo, and we have a statue of him in Philadelphia that people put panties on every so often. That’s about as far as we got. I don’t understand why it hasn’t been pushed over or something. I forget... Aaron Gonsher When you first moved there, were you already aware of what had been happening with organizations like MOVE? How did that enter your consciousness in the city itself? Moor Mother They took it to the street. So as a kid, as a musician, I was able to see this and be like, “That’s fucked. What can I do? What can I participate in?” And also, we had this reptilian in office, Bush. So that was like heavy protests in Philly. Of course I’m going to be there. It was not even a discussion, no discussion. You see it, you have some sort of emotional response to it, and you make a decision, then you get involved. That was, to me, the end of the golden era from where I’m from, of a protest, because that was almost like we were coming out for war. It wasn’t like we were just walking around with signs and having little chants. No, we had gas masks on, we covered our faces. We were there to start some trouble, to aggravate the system. Aaron Gonsher Was the majority of Philadelphia’s musical community as active in what you’re talking about, or did it feel like it was confined to a very particular group of people doing a particular thing? Moor Mother Yeah, because the only people I knew were the college kids. So we were all MCs. We wouldn’t walk around. We could say we rapped and we were participating in ciphers, but we wasn’t like, “We’re musicians, we’re part of a scene.” We were just trying to build ourselves up to figure out what can we even do as so-called rappers and writers. It was all early works in progress. It wasn’t really groups that I can name that were involved in the protest that I know. When I came, the Roots were the band, the Roots were the biggest thing from Philadelphia. So they had an event called Black Lily, that’s where Jill Scott and Floetry and Musiq Soulchild, all of these people started. We would sneak in to get in on the open mic, and that was the first time I performed in Philadelphia. My song was, “Nowadays It’s All About The Pussy.” I did that at this neo-soul club, they were like, “What is, wow? Nowadays it’s all about the pussy.” They were just like, “You shook something up, that was really cool.” I just kept going back and doing whatever I could, just to be a part of it. But I wasn’t in the door, I wasn’t that cool or known or popular to try to collaborate with the Roots or anyone. I was just a dirty kid that could rap. Aaron Gonsher But you did have your own event series at one point, right? Moor Mother Yeah. Once I got the band, all of our stuff was pretty political, we couldn’t find venues for that, because neo-soul was what was happening in Philly. So I just started an event called, it was first called the Mash-Up, then that venue closed, then we called it Rockers. And I did that for ten years every Wednesday. Aaron Gonsher Every week? Moor Mother Yeah. Then it went to a monthly. Then Rockers was the coolest scene. It was like they had the underground punk scene, but we were underground from that, so it was like... It was beautiful. Aaron Gonsher How exhausted were you after ten years of doing a weekly party? Moor Mother I mean, you hear some of the songs. Well, just because there’s two ways to do things. You can do things like the Penn University/Donald Trump model, which is you have an idea, you create a business, you get money. My way was just like, “We need a place to play. Oh, these other groups need a place to play. Let’s just do it.” I never really made any money or even thought about that to the end. I’m like, “Damn. I probably could have had some money,” you know what I mean? Or got paid from this. I did all of this, and I have nothing material wise. But, what I have actually is all of these musicians that were playing Rockers are now amazing, and touring the world, and really had a chance to develop their voice just like I was using it to develop my own voice, you know? It was kind of like that. Aaron Gonsher How did you find your voice developing over that time? A lot can happen in ten years. Moor Mother Yeah, when I was doing the Black Lily, I would just rap like this. Saying a lot of stuff, but I couldn’t move outside of that, because I probably would be trembling. It went from that to stage diving. Just getting more free, basically. Free. Aaron Gonsher Could we play video number five, please? (video: The Mighy Paradocs live) That was the Mighty Paradocs, then, that you were talking about? Moor Mother Yeah. Aaron Gonsher Another song that’s maybe less than a minute, but with a lot of information crammed into it. Moor Mother Yeah. I mean, there was a so-called natural disaster, which was called Hurricane Katrina. The only relief, when I was writing this... I was like, “The only relief was a 40 OZ of hurricane,” you know? No other relief had came to aid these people after this so-called natural disaster. Aaron Gonsher There were, I think, five people in that band? Moor Mother Yeah, five people. Aaron Gonsher You were also in another band, Girls Dressed As Girls. Moor Mother Yeah. That came a little later. Aaron Gonsher When did you start to think that there were things you wanted to explore as a solo artist that you had to do separately from what you were getting out of these groups? Moor Mother Well, because it was five people, we had to decide a time to meet, talk about the songs, go over all of this stuff, and I was just like, “In the meantime, I want to make music.” So, I just figured to save up to get this iPad, so I can work alone. I was just thinking of trying to make beats like J Dilla. That was just like, “I should make some beats,” But they were not like J Dilla, even though I was like, “This one kind of sounds like something J Dilla would do.” I think the inspiration came with the soul samples that he would use. That like what I could relate to. I’m into hip-hop now, into punk, but there was so many of these soul and blues artists that inspired me, so I wanted to tap into the memory and make an archive of all of this stuff that I love that had really nothing to do with... like, I can’t sample Whitney Houston while we’re playing the Mighty Paradocs. You know what I mean? Or, just things that I just... little loops, things that I loved, so I just went crazy and made maybe two or three beats a day. Then it got to be a lot of them, you know? Aaron Gonsher Let’s listen to one of them. This is “Programma” from Sleep Study. Moor Mother Well, “Programma” came a bit later. Aaron Gonsher Bit later. But still made on an iPad? Moor Mother Yes. Aaron Gonsher Alright. Moor Mother And, in bed, and on earplugs. Aaron Gonsher Let’s play it, and we can talk a little bit more about the iPad, because I am curious about that. This is “Programma” from Sleep Study One & Two. Aaron Gonsher That was “Programma” for Sleep Study One & Two. The thing I’m really interested in about the iPad is that I feel like when you’re learning how to play guitar, bass or drums, people are always going to have some other artist that they’ll reference, of like if you’re learning guitar, you have to go check out this person, or bass, you have to go check out this person. But an iPad, there’s not really something that you have to measure yourself against. Did it feel more free for that reason? I mean, maybe King Britt in Philadelphia uses an iPad. Moor Mother Well, I mean, I never check for people. The people that I like, I can’t do. I like Aretha Franklin. I can’t do Aretha Franklin, Alice Coltrane. I’m checking for things that I can’t do, but what’s interesting about Sleep Study is when I started getting into these different little idea of... Sleep Study is basically making music in bed while everyone sleeps and not waking up anyone. You make the beat, you make the words, you do it all right there. That’s just a fun little thing for me, I guess. I don’t know how that is even an example for anyone to be like, “OK, let me make some music in the flat, see if I can not wake anyone,” but still bring this passion and still be aggressive in this way. After I had made all these hundreds and hundreds of beats, I was like, “What little quirky things can I do to push myself in difficult situations with the iPad?” Aaron Gonsher What were some of the other ones? Moor Mother So long ago. What was another one? That’s terrible. I would have to look at my little SoundCloud from back in the day. Just limitations outside, walking to work. What albums can you make? What’s that sound like making a couple of songs on your way to work with the cars and everything’s going on? Can you actually rap out loud? All of these different kind of things, because every time I would make something on the iPad, I would learn something. How that one stops, for a while, I didn’t even understand how to fade out, so it was just all these abrupt like, “It’s over. Take the drum. Take the drum,” you know? Kind of like an MPC, just the drum out. Yeah, it was all really organic. Like I said, the first idea was to try to make some stuff like J Dilla. Once I realized that was not going to happen, [I] just accepted whatever I was making, you know? Aaron Gonsher When you’re making a song like that, am I right in assuming it starts as a poem, and then you’re translating it into this soundscape sonic world? Moor Mother Yeah. And sometimes I have the beat, and then I’m like ... Like the first Sleep Study, it’s just me making up stuff, like what you call a freestyle, which then I learned is really difficult, because I couldn’t do it live. I was recording all this stuff, but I didn’t understand how to perform it live, so my live show was totally different of songs that I could do live. That’s the first record, Fetish Bones. I was playing like two different worlds, sonically. Aaron Gonsher Talking about Fetish Bones a bit... There’s so many different samples and references throughout that record, and we’ll play some music from it soon. I was curious to hear what your approach is when you’re sampling. What sort of philosophical weight might need to be a part of something you’re sampling in addition to the actual sonic element of it? Moor Mother It’s all stuff for archive. It’s all stuff that’s been haunting me. Stuff that I was scared of as a kid that now I can’t get enough of, like Mahalia Jackson. When I was a kid, I was like, “I better not mess up around whenever Mahalia Jackson songs are on.” Just like, “This is so intense to me.” Yeah. It’s more of stuff that reminds me of my family growing up. I’m sure we’ll talk a little bit about this later, but to me, music’s a form of sound, is a form of time travel. So, of me being able to tap into all of this stuff that I grew up with, all these sounds that I have fallen in love with, and to be able to always access that. I can always go back to some samples or something that is part of me growing up, part of my life. Aaron Gonsher Let’s listen to something from Fetish Bones, another thing. Moor Mother OK. Aaron Gonsher This is “Creation Myth” from Fetish Bones in 2016. (music: Moor Mother – “Creation Myth” / applause) That was “Creation Myth” from Fetish Bones. There’s a lot going on there, but I’m curious to hear you describe this track and what you were trying to accomplish with it sonically and narratively. Moor Mother Well, it all came together not as a plan. I made the soundscape because I was thinking of this idea of sound from the beginning of the universe being created. I said, “OK, what does it start with?” The soundscape was its separate thing. Then I had wrote a poem... I try to be a part of this... I’m a part of the collective now. But there’s a collective called Metropolarity in Philadelphia. They do like a sci-fi zine. I had submitted a poem, and it didn’t make it. Even though they were my friends, they were like, “It wasn’t good enough.” So, I wrote another piece, and this was the piece and they accepted it. I really liked it, so I’m making the album and I’m like, “OK, I’ma put this on there. I’ll just read this poem on top of it.” The little song in the beginning was how I would set... I would do that a cappella to start my shows. I’m actually going to do it at my next show. I kind of forgot about doing that. Yeah, so it all came together. Even listening to the recording, I hear this one word I made a mistake on. It’s pilgrim, and I was like, “Pilgrum,” or whatever. I was like, “Oh, I don’t got no ...” It’s like the deadline’s coming. I was just, “Okay, I’m satisfied with it as much as I can be,” on an honest level of speaking about this. So, it kind of just came together of me just putting pieces together, because that’s basically how the album came together was like, “OK, this is what I do for my live set. What is good enough to make it on this vinyl record and that I can perform?” Because I’m also recording myself for the first time right after I bought studio equipment for the first time to set it up. It’s not like I’m... It’s just like, “Buy the equipment. This is what I think I need. Set it up. OK, here’s the mic. Do it,” you know? It was all experimental in its creation. That’s just how, like I spoke about earlier, how poetry works. You have this idea in your head, and it continues to reflect. But with the poem, I wanted to write about race riots throughout time in America, so that’s what I basically did. I start from... We just heard the song, and I’m like, “What’s the first line?” Something about, “1866, and I bled through the summer being slaughtered by whites.” What I’m talking about, 1866 to 1919 is the... What do they call it? The Blood Summer, basically, of all of these riots happening. It was like this Blood Summer, being bled through the summer, because there was so many killings and mass killings of black people in America. That’s why they call it Blood Summer, Red Summer. That’s they I put that there. Then I talk about everywhere from Oakland, to Crown Heights, to Jasper, Texas. It’s really mainly due to the research. The research is the most important thing with that poem. Aaron Gonsher The narrator, like you said, is moving through all these different timelines. That was something that you mentioned earlier about your work with Rasheedah and collapsing these different timelines. Can you talk a little about, first of all, who Rasheedah is – you mentioned her in brief – and what the Black Quantum Futurism philosophy that you two practice is, and how it manifests in your work? Moor Mother OK. Like I said, I did this event called Rockers in Philadelphia. It really started to be a hub for creative weirdos, creative geniuses, that would start to come. Rasheedah would come to see my band, the Mighty Paradocs. We became friends. Rasheedah was working with this thing called the Afrofuturist Affair and asked me to perform, but also to help curate some artists, because I had already been working with such rich artists in Philadelphia there were outside the box. We started in that way. Then Rasheedah Phillips wrote a book of time travel short stories and asked me to make a soundtrack for it. That was pretty much the first project that we did together. It was really successful, so we just continued to work together. Then Rasheedah wrote a theory, which is Black Quantum Futurism. I created all the sound work, and I also wrote essays for it and poetry for it. We created some zines. We have Sun Ra zines. We have zines on non-locality. We have zines and ritual causality. Then that worked to the book, which is Black Quantum Futurism: Theory & Practice (Volume 1). The second book is From the Congo to the Carolinas, really thinking about temporality on a slave ship, on the plantation. Yeah, it’s really powerful stuff. It definitely comes out of Afrofuturism, but it’s this idea of reinventing technology and redefining who gets to speak about what. Rasheedah Phillips is a practicing attorney in Philadelphia. I was a coach of sports. So, it’s like, “Are we allowed to think about temporality? Are we allowed to think about our future? Are we allowed to participate in anything we want? Physics, mathematics. Do we actually need to have these degrees?” Redefining what technology is, you know? Aaron Gonsher What is technology? Moor Mother Technology is anything you want it to be. I always speak about liberation technology being Alice Coltrane playing the sitar. Just very natural things that they tell us is not enough. Of technology being like these degrees from these universities, and these computers, and all of this stuff that’s not accessible. But, what we find out, once you do the work and study history, Apple or Microsoft didn’t invent the first computer. Or, these kind of things or ideas of what the computer was, or ideas of travel. It kind of speaks a lot to this idea of the savage and the civilized. You know, “Well, our boat looks like this.” Like, “You couldn’t have a boat. You were savage...” Understanding the history of people, especially from the African continent... We’re explorers. They traveled the world. It’s not like we had to wait for some English man to come with a boat to be like, “Oh, we’re seeing another...” You know what I mean? It’s just like this other idea of who is defining what is technology, and who’s holding the power behind that? Aaron Gonsher In history, not just moving forward inexorably, but moving backwards and jumping around? Moor Mother Yeah. It’s moving forward because of propaganda. I mean, you would think everything... In America, you would think that your life started from coming off of a so-called slave ship, or the time of Jesus, or anything that they put out as propaganda for us to believe where we came from. Aaron Gonsher How does this manifest in your personal musical work in addition to that with Rasheedah? Because, music is something that is quite often locked into this linear timeline, not just when you’re playing something. You strum a guitar, it makes a sound. You press a key, it makes a sound. That’s linear. Then songs are also... Most often, there’s a beginning, there’s a middle, and an end. It’s all very nice and tidy. How does the work that you do and the work with Rasheedah subvert that? Moor Mother That’s propaganda as a start, a middle and a end. That’s what’s driving everyone to be like, “We got to kill each other or screw each other over, because there’s going to be this ball of fire from the sky if we don’t have our picket fence and our house by this time, if we’re not married by this time.” All of that is bullshit. Things come around. How can I make a song without paying respect to who came before me? I’m not walking around like, “I’m the first one to talk about a protest.” Are you crazy? No. There’s so many people that laid down this foundation. How could I forget? How could I act like I’m starting something new or something, you know? That’s just how some people grow up. I didn’t grow up in that way to cut off what came before me. I naturally was moving in more of a circle as far as my ideas of time. That’s just my music. Everything is the now, you know what I mean? So many things are happening and returning. Aaron Gonsher I think someone else who might have been traveling that same circle was Octavia Butler, the writer. I’d like to play something from a release you did with Rasheedah that also uses the words of Octavia Butler. This is “The Autonomy of Shori.” Do you want to introduce it, or do you want to talk about afterwards? Moor Mother I’ve made so much music. I would have to hear it. Aaron Gonsher Let’s listen to it then. Moor Mother I mean, I made it. I’m definitely sure I made it, but I’m like... Aaron Gonsher OK, this is “The Autonomy of Shori.” Aaron Gonsher That was “The Autonomy of Shori.” Did it jog your memory a bit? Moor Mother Oh, yeah. Aaron Gonsher What can you tell us about that release and why Octavia Butler is credited on it, as well? Moor Mother Well, because Rasheedah and I were reading from one of Octavia Butler’s books. We have every one of them. Aaron Gonsher This is Fledgling? Moor Mother Yes. That was kind of really random how it came. I had this little thing I was singing. Then I was like, “Oh, it’d be cool for you to read some of this. Let’s read some together like a little conversation behind it.” Yeah. Whenever I listen to that, I’m like, “Is that me reading? Is that you reading?” It was really natural how it came. Then I got the Pharoah sample at the end, which I put on there because that track in particular was one of those archival tracks that I was speaking about earlier that just makes me feel good and has all these sounds that hits all the triggers within me. I’m like [hums like music is playing], which y’all don’t know, because you don’t know all the samples. It was more like archival, which further led to us making the full project sampling different audio books of Octavia Butler and putting little soundscapes behind them. Octavia, the most important thing for me that I get from... Well, two things. The first book I read as a serious reader was Kindred. I recommend everyone should read this book by Octavia Butler. Then the idea of visualizing and writing down what you want for your life and how powerful that can be. Octavia Butler, the early stages of her career, wrote about she wants to be one of the great novelists of the world and all of this. All of this stuff came true for her, so I actually did one, also... I do it all the time, but I did one before Fetish Bones came out. Everything that I wrote down came true, besides one thing. It’s just this motivation to be like, “Whatever you see and you dream about, you can have these things.” Aaron Gonsher Could that one thing still come true, though? Moor Mother I mean, it actually did come true, but I just couldn’t go at the time. It was just to play anywhere on the continent of Africa, basically. It was like, anywhere. I was invited to go to Sierra Leone to work on some music with an artist, but my schedule was so crazy that I couldn’t make it. But, I know that it’s coming, so I don’t even sweat it. Aaron Gonsher You mentioned your schedule there. You must be on the road 150 days a year now. How do you stay creative during that time? How do you allow yourself to stay creative without thinking, “I need to be productive creative”? Moor Mother It’s so hard. It’s crazy hard. I didn’t understand the idea of touring and taking some time off, because as a musician, that’s my job. If I want some money, I do a show. It’s hard. I’m supposed to be finishing my third solo album now, and I’m stressed about it. There’s no other way to look at it but saying, “I’m stressed about it,” because I only have certain amount of times to go home. I’m building up laundry from touring. I got a cat, you know? It’s so much. But, regardless, it’s going to get done. But I want to do like three albums at once, so how am I going to do that? I’m also a visual artist, so I do gallery shows. I’m also writing a play that’s going to go up in Philadelphia next year in June. I do workshops. I do a lot of different things. I’m in five groups, or something. Aaron Gonsher I was going ask if collaboration and all of your collaborations make this easier or harder. I mean, you had, just this year released with DJ Haram, 700 Bliss, Irreversible Entanglements. You’ve played with The Bug. You’re playing with... Moor Mother Yeah, Zonal. I got to do that stuff. Aaron Gonsher You’re playing with Roscoe Mitchell. Moor Mother Yeah. Aaron Gonsher What do you get out of collaboration that makes you want to keep entering into these situations? Not that it’s a negative thing, but I mean, there must be something that makes it really valuable to you, that you’re still chasing. Moor Mother I think I’m obsessed with it, because even I’ve said, “I can’t do any more collaborations. I got to do my own thing.” Just two weeks ago, I’m like... There’s a rapper from New York named Elucid. I’m like, “We got to do an album.” So, we’re going to do am album that’s going to come out... What’s the other project? Oh, this is kind of top secret, but this artist that I really admire, I’ve got to do something with him. That’s added – Aaron Gonsher They’re going to remain top secret? Moor Mother Yeah, because it has to happen first. Now, that’s like seven. Aaron Gonsher What do you think makes for a good collaboration, separate from the actual musical result? What are traits that you look for in collaborators that might be different from what you hear on the surface of their music? Moor Mother It’s all been organic. All the collaboration have been organic besides these last two. Well, even that’s been organic. Well, the last artist in particular, his music just speaks to me in a whole different level, in a level of reminding me of home. So, it’s like I got to do a project with him. But, everything is natural. With 700 Bliss or with Irreversible, we got together to do an event on police brutality. It wasn’t like this was going to be a collaboration. Then they were like, “Hey, let’s go into the studio for like six hours and see what happens.” I was just reading from my book, and then all of a sudden, it’s an album. Then after the recording, I said... and, this was right before Fetish Bones came out. I was like, “All I want to do is play a jazz festival in Spain. That’s all I want to do from this project.” You know, like, “What? Why was that my goal?” But that was my goal. Then turns out I had played in Spain like five times before Irreversible even came out, so it was just like, “This is natural. We’re all friends. Of course, we’re going to get together and do something.” Kind of like how doctors are like, “Hold this heart while I cut this brain out,” or whatever. It’s just like we’re collaborating – Aaron Gonsher I’ve totally been in that situation. Moor Mother Yeah. It’s like we’re collaborating on this body, but it’s kind of like we’re all in the hospital. We’re bound to cut something open together, kind of thing. Aaron Gonsher There are a lot of people who have been collaborating with each other over the last week and will continue to do so in the future. Moor Mother Oh, that’s cool. Aaron Gonsher Do you have recommendations for how to sustain a healthy collaboration, how to make sure everyone’s voice is getting heard, everyone is satisfied? Like you said, you have seven. Probably more to come. Moor Mother Yeah. I think it’s about trying to get to know each other. I know it’s like a short time or so many weeks, but it’s like when you have an understanding of what someone else likes and is coming from with their passions or desires, and you’re like... Like 700 Bliss, for instance. I’m like, “Well, I know you like this kind of sound. Let’s put that in there. Then I have this idea about this sound. Let’s put that in there. What do you think’s...” Just trying to put each other into the music versus pulling ideas from the sky or however other people do. It’s just like, “What are you into? Let’s honestly include our interests in this, so we’re all being heard.” I’m very much an idea man. I have a lot of ideas. That’s an issue for me, because I’m like, “Oh, you’re a tuba player. Come here. Guess what we could do?” You know what I mean? Just going through ideas and trying things out, but definitely not putting one part of someone’s story or feeling like my story is more important than what you would have to say. It has to be like a communication and also music styles that you all like to be added in there. If you’re just like, “I like hip-hop and jazz, and I like blues and folk,” all of that should be represented in the music. Aaron Gonsher You’ve mentioned them a couple times, and I think it’s important for us to actually talk a little bit more about Irreversible Entanglements. The group came together in event against police brutality. Who are the people in Irreversible Entanglements, and what sort of creative itch is that particular group scratching? Moor Mother We’re all in the tradition. Keir [Neuringer] is on sax. Luke Stewart’s on bass. Tcheser [Holmes] is on drums. Aquiles [Navarro] is on trumpet. Then I’m the poet. We all study music, so it’s really easy. We don’t have to sit around and be like... I mean, of course, there’s so many albums. There’s like, “Hey, check out this John Coltrane album or this recording.” We do that a lot, but everyone has listened to so much stuff. I find myself really learning more, because they all went to school for music. Yeah, I’m lucky in that way. They know their history. They know where this music came from. We’re not coming into any place like, “This is our brand of jazz,” or anything. No, we’re playing improv. We’re playing hard from the information that we’ve done the research on, so it’s kind of like we’re very well informed kind of style. Aaron Gonsher I don’t think you need to go to music school to have stuff to share with musicians, though. Moor Mother Well, I mean, these cats know a lot of stuff that I missed out on, straight up. School’s cool. This kind of camp, all of this stuff is cool, because you’re never done learning. There’s so much stuff that I want to learn, like every instrument. Where do you go to learn that? My ears are always open. I’m always hungry to exchange information, but by no means do I feel like I got to go to some person who’s a celebrity or whatever. I see everyone as having information that could be added to something, you know? Aaron Gonsher What information do you think you have? Because, all these people are obviously wanting to work with you. There’s clearly something there. Moor Mother Oh, yeah. By no means am I thinking that I’m not good. I’m a fucking great poet. I’m really good with words, because I’ve lived this particular kind of just upbringing that most people in this time that I meet have not experienced. A lot of people are living this isolated existence where they’re so far from their culture or from people that look like them. So, they’re like, “Oh,” really excited when they get a chance to be around something that’s related to their history. I grew up around that. I have it all in my head and my heart. So it’s really easy for me to pull from all of this stuff that’s reflected throughout the world. Aaron Gonsher Well, let’s listen to some of Irreversible Entanglements- Moor Mother OK, cool. Aaron Gonsher This is an excerpt of “Fireworks.” (music: Irreversible Entanglements – “Fireworks” / applause) That was “Fireworks.” It was just an excerpt. If you haven’t heard the entire album, it’s hugely recommended. We’ve talked a lot in this lecture about time, and collapsing timelines, and your time in different places. I wanted to end by asking you, what do you think makes music timeless? Moor Mother I think what makes music timeless, I guess, would be what else is it being used for? That’s why I feel like jazz, and blues, and gospel are so important to me, because they were not just used for you to tap your foot... or, the artists that I like. There are some jazz musicians that just want you to tap your foot. But it was not just used as that. It was used as a form of liberation. That’s why I called jazz, and gospel and blues liberation technologies, because they’re not just for the tapping... It’s not just for that. It’s way more. Gospel also was a form of secret coding. It was also a form of respecting the dead or a way to be with someone that’s sick. It’s just like all of these different ways that this sound was used to heal or transport. That’s what I’m interested in, a way to make music that can also be healing towards me every time I listen to it or that can send me back to a time with my father that has passed away. It’s seeing music and sound as an original form, of technology. Aaron Gonsher I think that’s a good place to end. Moor Mother Alright, cool. Aaron Gonsher Thank you for joining us today. Moor Mother Thank you. Aaron Gonsher There is going to be a microphone roaming around this room if any participants have questions for Camae. Did we cover everything? Audience Member Hello. I’m OG Lullabies. I’m from Washington, D.C. Moor Mother Oh, awesome. We’re from the same state. Audience Member We are. This isn’t a question. This is just me... I psychically knew we would meet one day. Moor Mother What? Audience Member Yes. Because, someone randomly sent me a link on Instagram. People are always sending me links, but anyway. I just want to say thank you, because when I stumbled upon you, it gave me clarity in my own philosophies and spirituality and how to connect that in my music, and my voice, and how to respect the silence of my politics, and also respect when I feel like elaborating or being particularly vocal about how I feel in America as a black woman producer and instrumentalist. So, just infinite thanks. Thank you so much. Moor Mother Thank you. Congratulations on being selected to be one of these artists to be a part of this project. That’s really cool. Audience Member Yes. Moor Mother What’s your artist name? Audience Member I’m OG Lullabies. It means Zero Gravity Lullabies. Moor Mother Cool. Do we follow each other? Audience Member No, no, but we – Moor Mother Send me a message. I want to check you out. Audience Member You did Always On with Moogfest, and I did it too. I was like, “We’re like almost there.” Because, I knew that it would connect all the way eventually. Also, King Britt has been reaching out and give me lots of awesome advice. Moor Mother Oh, that’s cool. Audience Member He’s also the triangle that’s going to be in the [unintelligible] when we... you know. Moor Mother OK. Audience Member OK. Moor Mother Cool. Well, looking forward to meeting you again and chilling. Audience Member Yeah, yeah, totally. Yeah. Aaron Gonsher Any other questions? If there are no others... Or, if you’re too shy to ask it now, then maybe come up to Camae afterwards. Thank you. Moor Mother Also, shout out to Sneaks. [applause] They’re incredible artists. I’m so happy that they’re here. Get to know them. If you don’t, you’re going to be lamer. That can happen at these things, OK? So, it’s an opportunity, but you can leave lamer. Alright? Aaron Gonsher Alright. Let’s get another round of applause for Moor Mother. Thank you.

Marc Acardipane
German producer/DJ Marc Acardipane is a man of many aliases. Chief among them is the Mover, under which he creates weighty, deceptively simple electronic music that sits at the intersection of hardcore and techno. No matter the name, he’s weathered the peaks and valleys of an over 30-year career. That career began in 1989 when he and Thorsten Lambart founded the label and electronic music group Planet Core Productions (PCP). At the peak of the hardcore scene in the ’90s, Acardipane tracks “Stereo Murder” (as Marshall Masters) and “Six Million Ways to Die” (as Turbulence) played in clubs all over the Netherlands. Then, in 2003, he teamed up with Scooter for a remix of the 1997 track “I Like It Loud,” which hit the Top 40 charts in Austria, Germany and Hungary. Recognized by some as one of electronic music’s most unsung heroes, Acardipane’s popularity has continued to wax and wane in the years since. Following the newly mastered reissue of 2002’s Frontal Frustrations and his latest release as The Mover, Undetected Act from the Gloom Chamber, Acardipane may finally get his proper due.
Speaking at the Red Bull Music Academy Berlin 2018, Acardipane recalled the early years of PCP, hardcore techno and his many aliases and reflected on his creative approach and the lessons learned from excess and the music industry.
Hosted by Vivian Host Won’t you join me in welcoming Marc Acardipane? [applause] So, the first track I played when everyone was filtering in here was by PCP [Planet Core Productions] and it was called “We Are From Frankfurt.” I think we should tell people a little bit about growing up in Frankfurt. It’s gonna recur a lot in this conversation and is a pretty important part of your identity. Tell me a little bit about the neighborhood that you grew up in and what kind of stuff you were up to when you were a teenager, let’s say 15 or 16. Marc Acardipane I start really early with the music when I was eight, learning classic guitar and when I was 12, also electronic guitar. 16… Vivian Host Just put the mic closer to your mouth. Marc Acardipane I hang around in bunkers because then you can play loud music, was interested in football, and then by 16 I start also buying drum machines, synthesizers. Vivian Host What was the impetus to start buying drum machines and synthesizers? Who had you heard that had one that made you want one? Marc Acardipane Actually, my teacher for electronic guitar, he was playing in a really bad punk band. He got the 808, he got the [JBL] MS-20, an 8-track recorder and I really liked that. But the major thing was because all my members from the band didn’t wanna go the way [I did]: “Live from the music or die.” I wanted to do that, they don’t. Then I thought, “Okay, with electronic music I need nobody.” Vivian Host And you also thought at that time or shortly after that electronic music was sort of the future of rock music in a way. Like rock music was getting to be, I don’t know, this old dinosaur and electronic music was a place that you could put those same vibes. Marc Acardipane It’s a generation thing but this comes a little later. When I was 16, there was no techno. Techno came out 18, 19, 20 when I was like that. Of course that was the new generation, rock & roll was over, so I see techno as the rock & roll of today, definitely. Vivian Host So there was music that was hard and made with synthesizers and stuff. Stuff like Belgian New Beat and EBM that you got onto at some point before techno, right? Marc Acardipane Yeah, I was in Majorca and there was a girl and everybody thought she’s my sister and everybody, the others thought I’m her brother but we never met actually and then we met and she gave me Front 242 Official Version which is a Belgian record, it’s kind of electro body music, really nice sounds, electronic. I didn’t like the groove, I was more into the Detroit techno stuff which was more groovy but I didn’t like the sounds of Detroit. It was not hard enough for me. So, that was the idea maybe to mix something out of that. Because we were really in the hip-hop scene at the beginning, but we mixed up breakbeats with techno sounds and rap and all the hip-hop crews – we play on battles – they thought we are totally mad because we [didn’t] fit in there. And then one day, you look in the mirror, you say, “OK, I’m white and I’m not coming from Compton, so we need our own street music in Frankfurt,” and that’s how hardcore techno was born. Vivian Host So, what were some of your favorite hip-hop artists back in those days? Marc Acardipane N.W.A. I got all the records, I have also the World Class Wreckin’ Cru with Dre, I got the first 12”, “The Dope Man” from N.W.A, and of course Public Enemy, the first record I have. Run DMC. We are based in Frankfurt, we had all the Americans there so that’s why there was a really strong hip-hop scene. Vivian Host I think we can hear echoes of that same vibe that’s in those records that you mentioned… Marc Acardipane Definitely. Vivian Host Later on when we hear your music. What were the first clubs that you were going out to? I mean, there were some pretty famous clubs in Frankfurt. A place called Dorian Gray and then I guess a little later, place called The Omen. Were those places that you would’ve been going or you were only in hip-hop shows? Marc Acardipane No, in the beginning at the Dorian Gray it was Friday, it was called the techno club. They played more electro body music, which I don’t like except Front 242. And later, The Omen came later, I think ’91 when the whole techno movement starts. Before Omen was also more commercial clubs. I didn’t go to hip-hop parties, only when we played there. Too much trouble there. Vivian Host I don’t know, you don’t seem a stranger to trouble [laughter]. We’ll get to that later. Marc Acardipane You say that. Vivian Host This club Dorian Gray was kind of crazy because it was at the airport for one thing and it had a Richard Long soundsystem, so a very famous guy built the soundsystem. I was watching some videos and it looked more like a little bit fancy and more like a discotheque but also quite developed for that time in the late ’80s. Did you like it there? Marc Acardipane That’s true. Yeah, of course, but I came more later so the usual Frankfurt techno weekend starts on a Friday at The Omen with Sven Väth. Then you hang out until 12 o’clock in the morning, then you try to stay awake until six, seven in the evening, then you go to bed. At four o’clock you get picked up and then we go to the Dorian Gray because at six DJ Dag took over and then it goes until 12 in the morning. Then you hang out in the park when the weather is good, whatever, then in the evening, we had this other club called XS which was a chill-out club. We have some tea and then later you go home and that was the Frankfurt weekend. Vivian Host Sounds pretty tight. Did you get all the guys that were in your hip-hop crew with you, did you take them over with you to the techno side? Marc Acardipane We were already techno. I don’t know how we’d be in this... I don’t know, it was an accident. I was never planning that we play on hip-hop battles. We know a lot of hip-hop people from Frankfurt, of course. They hang out in our office. We also did a label, Dope on Plastic, with them together. Vivian Host I’m just wondering because… Marc Acardipane There was no techno parties, so the first year we playe – I don’t know if somebody knows here, Nine Inch Nails, KFMDM (Nine Inch Nails was an American group) - we played support for them, real concerts. The real [techno] parties started in ’91. Then, all of the sudden we played there. Vivian Host I wanna show video number one. Unfortunately, we didn’t get the subtitles but I think it will be fun to watch anyways. (video: PCP interview filmed inside Music Hall in Frankfurt, January 1990) All right, that was a video of yourself and your partner in Planet Core Productions, Thorsten Lambert, from January 1990 on German TV and I’m sorry we don’t have the subtitles. But you’re talking about how techno is the future, you’re kind of over rock & roll ’cause it’s like AC/DC, Led Zeppelin – it’s not really possible to go further for you with that music. You said that punk was destructive but techno is telling us about the future, which I thought was a really interesting sentiment. The other interesting thing that happens in there, what club is that? Do you remember? Marc Acardipane The Music Hall in Frankfurt, we rented it to check some tracks. That’s why nobody’s there. Vivian Host So, you’re playing to this club with no one in it but what you said is that you rented out the club just so you could go play the tracks and hear them.
Speaker: Marc Acardipane Yep. Vivian Host And I guess see if they were gonna work to release. Marc Acardipane Exactly, yeah. White labels from DAT and stuff like that. Vivian Host At this time, 1990, were you already DJing out in clubs? Marc Acardipane No, this starts more in ’91. We also were not so much DJs in the beginning, we were more a live act. In the beginning we were FBI – which was Free Base International – then later PCP. Vivian Host Yeah, I guess I was wondering if when you finally made a record, that you gave to a local DJ? You’re going through this process where you’re testing out your records and you’re seeing is this any good, does this need a better kick, is this strong enough to work in a club? I was wondering that and I was also wondering what peoples’ reaction in Frankfurt was to maybe the first release on PCP. Marc Acardipane The first release was played by DJ Dag in the Dorian Gray [club] but much funnier story is PCP 006 which was “We Have Arrived,” the first distorted track ever, which is also on Wikipedia. When we played the first time live, the sound engineer run to me, he say, “You’re destroying my PA,” but he didn’t know that the whole track was already distorted. Nobody heard that before. It was also in the Music Hall, it was the big rave from Sven, was the first rave in Frankfurt where we played out. Vivian Host This is Sven Väth that you’re talking about. Marc Acardipane Sven Väth. You know him? [laughter] One of the biggest DJs in the world, still. Vivian Host So, Sven Väth was supportive of you guys when you started. Marc Acardipane Yeah. His first interview on MTV, he had our member jacket on. There was only I think 11 jackets with the PCP. It was the same that N.W.A had. He did his first interview on MTV with it. He was with us in the crew, yeah. Vivian Host How did you meet Sven Väth for the first time or become friends with him? Marc Acardipane We were really wasted after a party and I was in the restaurant and he sits in front of me, it was four o’clock in the morning. I was telling him, “You’re a great DJ, but the music you produce with the other guys,” because he’s not a producer, “it sucks.” I invited him to my studio and two weeks later, he came. I think nobody ever say that to him before because it’s more like everybody licked his ass. Vivian Host So he came to the studio. Did you guys make some stuff together? Marc Acardipane A few tracks, yeah, for my compilation Frankfurt Trax, which was on CBS at that time. Vivian Host There was this series, Frankfurt Trax, that you were mentioning which were these very dense compilations – 10 tunes, 12 tunes – that were really pushing this sound that you were developing. But one of the notable things about these compilations is that a lot of the tracks were produced by you guys under different names. Marc Acardipane Exactly. Nearly every track on this compilation is produced by me. Later, when we had some artists, there was a few. I mean, we always tried to [make it] Ttat people really believe that all these artists exist. In my head, they exist. We had this little program on the Atari where you can make phantom pictures, so that’s how we create our artists. Then there were things happen, like one magazine doesn’t believe [us]. And then there was a guy in Italy, he pick us up from the airport and I look at him and I say to Thorsten, my partner, “Do we know him?” He looked exactly like Ace The Space (that’s a track we’ll hear later). We put him a beard on, give him the record, make a picture, and send it to the press. [laughter] Vivian Host Can we actually show photo number six? OK, so… Marc Acardipane That’s Ace there on the right. Vivian Host Bottom right. That’s Ace the Space. Marc Acardipane [points to left] That’s Nasty Django, Lil’ Pepe Castro, and this is his father, it’s T-Bone Castro. They’re from Cuba and this is Marshall Masters. We had this name long before Eminem, from ’90s. But really funny is you can’t do girls with this program, so that’s why we didn’t have any female artists. You see T-Bone nose is a dick. Really [laughs]. Vivian Host OK [laughter], so this program... That’s good. It was funny. I like it. This program was actually something people were using to make mugshots, right? Like criminal mock-ups. Marc Acardipane I think so. I don’t know. I think so. Vivian Host I think that you told me that you made nearly all of these characters almost in one night. You were having a wild night with… Marc Acardipane It’s called the Night Where It was Bright. Vivian Host Why is it called that? Marc Acardipane I don’t think I tell this here. Vivian Host OK, so you can ask Marc later what happened but you and Thorsten, your partner in PCP, stayed up all night long on this computer. Marc Acardipane Exactly. Vivian Host Making all these different characters. Marc Acardipane On the old Atari ST. Vivian Host And they all have different personalities for you, right? Marc Acardipane Yep. Vivian Host Can you just talk a little bit more about what kind of tunes those different people we saw make? Marc Acardipane It came after a while. First, you produce the track and then we sit down, “OK, what fits?” But then after a while.. It’s like T-Bone Castro, for example – his 909, the closed hi-hat is broke. All the tracks is with a open hi-hat [laughter]. Nasty Django, it was more like the dirty, young style. It was not like I sit down and do it, but for me it was freedom. Because, I don’t know, I do also The Mover. The Mover is really kind of depressive, dark but I’m not everyday like that. One day, I’m happy; one day, I’m not happy. That’s all the characters come off. Marshall Masters is more like ravey, party. Ace the Space is a gangster – that’s why his first track is “9mm Is A Classic.” We get also these nice shirts with “Ace The Space. What’s the rude boy number?” With the 9mm on the back. It was a great seller. Vivian Host Maybe we should actually hear “9mm” so you can hear what it sounds like. This is actually the first record I ever bought. It was a big record in Los Angeles where I’m from. This is by Ace the Space, “9mm Is A Classic.” (music: Ace The Space – “9mm Is A Classic” / applause) Hell yeah. So, this may be obvious to some people but what is that noise that we’re hearing in the beginning of that tune? Marc Acardipane You mean the synth? Vivian Host Yeah. Marc Acardipane That’s the famous “Mentasm” hoover sound coming from the MKS-50 or the Juno 2 [ed. - It was actually Juno 1] by Roland. Vivian Host So, kind of made popular by Joey Beltram. Marc Acardipane Exactly, Joey was the first one. When I heard the track, I said, “He’s an alien. Where did he get that sound from?” This is maybe a thing that you guys don’t have anymore today, there are coming sounds you heard them somewhere all the time. But with us, we heard sounds that you never heard before in the beginning. I remember when I heard “Mentasm” in the club, it was unbelievable when it hits and then the second track was “The Dominator” from Human Resource and then we came with the street version, “9mm Is A Classic.” Vivian Host Something else is happening in this record with the sample, which is from a pretty famous hip-hop record by the 45 King. We can hear a little bit of that. (music: 45 King - “The 900 Number (Acapella)”) You really worked that record for Ace The Space. Marc Acardipane The funny thing, I don’t know if there’s a track with a beat because I only know the acapella. We had only the record with acapella but I never heard the track to it. Is there a track? Vivian Host Yeah, there is a track. Marc Acardipane Never heard that one. Vivian Host Back then, obviously there were a lot of hip-hop records that came with acapellas, so sampling… Marc Acardipane Every record on the B-side was always the acapella. Vivian Host It’s so different now, the hip-hop artists kind of gathered that they don’t want their stuff sampled anymore. But back then… Marc Acardipane Nobody cares. Even Chuck D., I remember he was saying in an interview, “Everybody can sample our stuff,” because hip-hop is based on samples so why they should complain if somebody else sample it. I never had any trouble and I sample a lot. Vivian Host Well, you’re one of the lucky ones then. So, what did you have in your studio back in 1989? Marc Acardipane ’89… Vivian Host What were all these early PCP tracks made on? Marc Acardipane In the beginning, it was only the [Emu] Emax, emulator sampler with a half megabyte of sampling time. It’s a lot. And a 909, that’s it. And a cheap Roland mixer. And two effects. But they were not mine – so it was not my 909, not my mixer and not my effects but the sampler was mine. Vivian Host Who did these other things belong to? Marc Acardipane The 909, I don’t remember. The other one was from a guy from a metal band. He was a drummer in a metal band and he quit with them and he had a studio and he had no use for it, so he put it in my apartment. Vivian Host I ask because we were talking before about how a lot of your tracks have become these huge hits and they’re so effective and people still love them to this day and sing along to them and they’re still considered such classics but actually, there’s very few elements in most of them. Marc Acardipane That’s true, less is more. Because she told me yesterday that a lot of you ask for mixing and talk about that yesterday. 80% of a good mix is the selection of the sounds. If you have too much, the biggest mixer in the world can do nothing with it. I worked with Jimmy Douglass, you know this guy? He’s mixed Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, Missy Elliott and all that stuff. He got 500 platinum records. He mixed one to three tracks of mine and they sound worse than my demos. It cost me a lot, but I learned a lot because I did wrong with the sounds and then I fixed it and then it sounds good. When I listen today to my old songs and why they sound good, we didn’t thought about that… or I didn’t thought about that in the past. You had not so much options, so if the sound doesn’t fit, you look for a new one until it fits and then it fits. That’s the most important. Vivian Host So what you’re saying is rather than slapping an EQ on something… Marc Acardipane Exactly. Vivian Host And being like, this doesn’t fit, let me try to take out this frequency or let me move this around, you didn’t have that option so you’re just like, “Boom, let me just make a new sound.” Marc Acardipane Exactly. Like the first mixer, you got treble, bass, and that’s it. So, OK, you also have to say that the analog synths have a much nicer curve than plugins, of course. When you look at a Moog and you look at it on analyzer without EQing, you get a nice low end, not too much and not a lot of shit. From the plugins, they have a lot of low shit, a lot of high frequency so you have to [EQ it] out. But a lot of people do too much. They put on the sound 10 plugins and maybe also experience that in the end, you put all 10 off and it sounds better than before. So, you need a good basement. Sh-t in, sh-t out. And also, “We fix it in the mix. Oh yeah, it’s not mastered.” I hear that so much when people play me tracks. “It’s not mastered.” When it doesn’t sound good un-mastered, it also will not sound great when it’s mastered. Vivian Host We were also talking about how, of course you ended up trying out these different mixers and mastering people, some of whom were quite famous and worked on big pop records and Major Lazer and all this. But in the beginning, all these tracks that we’re gonna hear for the next while, you were doing everything yourself. I think that there’s a lot of your style, the PCP style, that has to do with the way that you chose to mix the songs or the sounds that you chose to use. You weren’t necessarily jumping all over the place. You had sounds that you liked, you had a mixing style that you liked, that was different than a lot of the records that were coming out at that time. Marc Acardipane Exactly, yeah. Vivian Host Can you talk a little bit about what was on your mind back then? Granted, you didn’t know as much as you know now probably but... Marc Acardipane When I remember today, I had a lot of compressors but from the view from today, I had no idea how they work. I always tried to have different things than the others have which means if everybody got the Mackie board so I don’t have a Mackie board. Because that’s also part of your sound. The most thing for me important is pre-amps: distortion, saturation, third harmonic. That’s your sound. Even if you take a plugin synthesizer and put it to a nice pre-amp it will sound ten times better than before. Even if you have them both there, you don’t hear much of a difference but as soon as the kick comes in, everything but the pre-amp stands in front. My mixer is my sound. I got it back. Three months ago. Because I was also on the digital way then but it’s good. Now I have both but I can’t live without the analog. Vivian Host A lot of your sound in those days was coming from the limited pieces of gear that you had but also the way that you used those pieces. You didn’t want to have... Nobody wanted to have the same sound as... Even if everybody had a 909, everybody was trying to work in the 909 to not... Marc Acardipane That’s your drums and it’s so easy on the mixer, was one to eight is your drums. It’s always your drums. Your snare is your 909. Maybe 808, patch it. Nowadays, there’s too much options. Everybody from us have folders with millions of snare samples. Do you wanna sit there [makes snare sounds] Better create your own. There’s a guy, he’s pretty young and we talk a lot together and he was saying one good thing after I introduced him to the old-school production; he was saying, “Man, back in those days, you all had the same stuff but you all sound different. Now, there’s so many options and they all sound the same.” Which is a big problem I see. Vivian Host In a minute, I want to talk more about the ethos too because I think that was part of it, as everybody had a very strong kind of feeling about what their style was, what their ethics were, what their commitment was to the music that they were making and what they were trying to say. But before we do that, we have an MPC here and I think that you can actually illustrate this point about what your tunes are composed of or at least the early stuff. Marc Acardipane I played my whole life with the MPC. I start with the 3000 – the same that Dr. Dre have, my hero. Always when I play live – and I have here the 16 pads – I see the simplicity of my songs. This is one of the biggest hits in hardcore history. It got a kick [plays kick]; it’s from the 909. It’s got the tom [plays tom]. Got the crash [plays crash]. A vocal sample [plays sample]. And the melody [plays the melody]. All together, it sounds like this [plays track]. That’s all [laughter / applause] Because our brain – I don’t know if somebody ever told you – can only fix four elements at the same time which is the rhythm section, normally two instruments and the singing. OK, we don’t have singing here. Everything more is confusing and a lot of people do too much. They say, “Layer the synth 10 times.” Why? Look for a good one. You know? Also back in the days, you don’t have 20 reverbs. You had maybe two and a delay. You take one sound and everything sounds like completely with a nice room. Today, it’s too much and then it sounds like shit. Vivian Host Do you have another song on there you wanna play for us? Marc Acardipane I have a lot. What do you wanna hear? Vivian Host OK, that one was “Stereo Murder” that we just heard. Right? Marc Acardipane [scrolls through MPC banks] You wanna hear another one with a hip-hop sample? [plays song] That’s it, and the vocal. Also one of the hits still in the Netherlands, played since, I don’t know, 25 years on every hardcore party and then the whole audience sing it, “Ain’t no party like an alcoholic party.” You have the acapella? Vivian Host No. Marc Acardipane It’s from Tha Alkaholiks. I don’t know if you know, from New York [From Los Angeles]. Vivian Host Hip-hop group. Marc Acardipane I even put them in the publishing, so I also never get stressed. I don’t know if they ever heard the track but at least we tried to get them some money. Vivian Host So, what was people’s reaction in the beginning when you were making this music that had all these hip-hop samples and it was super fast and super tough? ’Cause I understand, you said it to me a couple times that people sort of considered you the gangsters or the hooligans of techno. Marc Acardipane Yeah, that’s true. Vivian Host Tell me more about it. Marc Acardipane Hardcore was really negative for the people. We always get disses. In the beginning, they like it but then not so much anymore. I don’t know because everybody try to get his style or the labels they had to put down to the people. Even the people don’t wanna hear that. Because in my experience, also today the young generation always want to have energy music. They wanna have hard music, they want rave. They don’t want, I don’t know, boring music and there was ’94, ’95, a lot of boring music, so everybody tried to diss us. I don’t know. Don’t book us. That’s how I came to Holland. I think it was ’96. Everybody split up in Germany with the sounds. Before, it was all techno and one was harder, one was softer. But then came all these styles and this was the beginning of the end, I would say. Vivian Host We’ll get a little bit more to your career in Holland for a minute because your music ended up becoming so big there, being affiliated with a culture called gabber. But… PCP starts in 1989. Actually, we need to talk about “We Have Arrived” [by] Mescalinum United, which is one of your first big tunes and is the reason your music starts getting to New York City, where you find these people that are kindred spirits in a way. People like Lenny Dee, Frankie Bones, Adam X, also hip-hop guys who have become ravers, techno guys. Marc Acardipane Yeah, I met Lenny from New York on the wasted party I told you guys before where I talked to Sven Väth the first time. It was raining outside, we all leave the club, nobody was there anymore and there’s sitting these two guys. One was Lenny Dee from New York, the other guy was from N-Joi from London who mixed later The Prodigy’s “Firestarter.” He was a techno artist at that point and then we go to the car and I thought, “Hey wasn’t that the guys who play in the other club?” and Thorsten said, “Yeah, I think so.” “What are they doing here in the rain?” We go there and nobody told them which hotel they are in, so they sit there and we take them home and Lenny saw the studio and he said, “Can you play something?” I play him “We Have Arrived” and he listened to this track, I don’t know six hours, really, and then he gave me money and said, “Man, I wanna release that in America.” This became then the first record on his label, Industrial Strength, and we released it also in Germany, so it was a sub-license for him. For us, it was really good because in Germany it’s always like that: If somebody from America play it, it’s much cooler than if we play it. Typical Germany. In Holland, it’s different. To become known or respected in Holland, you take a few years. I had the hit of the year in Holland, ’96, and I was not even invited to get my Grammy… or not Grammy, they call it different, I don’t know. I saw it in a magazine a year later. They sent it then to me. Now they love me, but there’s a big difference. Germany’s always like, “Yeah, yeah.” That’s why it was a good thing that Lenny came to Germany and play our music. I remember on a Mayday, he played all our white labels and all the German DJs [were like] “Oh, what is that?” I say, “You have them.” They all had them but they never listened to them. This was the problem. Lenny helped us a lot at that point. Vivian Host I guess your music had a huge influence on those guys. Frankie Bones said that you made the perfect music for playing in warehouse parties in New York and he felt like your music, I’m paraphrasing here, but basically was the music of the apocalypse. He heard it, he felt that it was very dystopian and he loved that about it. I guess that fit New York in those times because New York was still quite destroyed and there were empty warehouses around. Marc Acardipane I played there only once, ’96, at Lenny’s party which the police interrupt us and close the party down. Vivian Host Oh, that’s interesting. As big of a hip-hop fan as you were, you didn’t actually go to New York until later. Marc Acardipane No. Vivian Host So what else can you tell me about this Mescalinum United track, “We Have Arrived.” Why was it called “We Have Arrived?” Marc Acardipane I think I had the feeling, or we had the feeling at that time, that this is the sound we’re going for. Before it was a lot of testing and it was all good records, but “We Have Arrived” was like when I did it, I know that’s it. From that point we go. Vivian Host So this was kind of your opening statement to everybody? Watch out. Marc Acardipane And it was released on a white record without name, without nothing. Do this today. It’s not so easy. Vivian Host But that helps create the mystique around it. Marc Acardipane Yeah. Vivian Host All right, let’s hear it. This is Mescalinum United with “We Have Arrived.” (music: Mescalinum United – “We Have Arrived” / applause) Marc Acardipane And like the distorted sound was also like an accident because back in the days when you had like a cheap mixer it had not much headroom. So you always come to this point where everything was distorted, but it sounds shit. So you go down, do it again, do it again. But at that point I thought, “Well, I leave it like that.” And you hear also the reverse cut is all done with tape. Real, cut it. Vivian Host Can you explain a little bit more about that? Marc Acardipane Tape? Yeah, two-track tape? And then… Vivian Host But what did you actually do? Marc Acardipane Turned it around and then it’s reversed. Or you also do the arrangements, but before you record, you have to... That you don’t have a problem later with the reverbs, because I just heard the track before we edit it and it’s really funny because at the drop, it stops and then the reverb sounds off and then the kick comes back in. And so this was the editing point that it gets that impact when the whole thing comes back. Vivian Host Did you use a lot of tape edits in those days? Marc Acardipane Yes. For all the reverse cuts. I liked that. I heard it from Detroit and so we also get a machine. Vivian Host Who are some people that were making music around this time that you also liked besides hip-hop people? Like who were some people within the electronic music realm that you thought were… Marc Acardipane Underground Resistance from Detroit, Richie Hawtin, Canada. Detroit. Vivian Host Close enough. Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Marc Acardipane Joey Beltram, of course. Cisco [Ferreira] and [his group] The Advent, Aphex Twin. Yeah. Vivian Host Yeah, actually you met, I guess, Aphex Twin at around this time because he ends up remixing this record of yours maybe a year later or something. Marc Acardipane I was with the guy when we bought the DAT machine for Richard (Aphex Twin) in Belgium and send it to him. And then this label R&S asked me who I would like to remix this track [“We Have Arrived”]. I say, “OK Richard.” But we met after in England when we played together. He really did two remixes; he normally only do one, but he liked it so much. And he also, he say in the magazine, the B-side of “We Have Arrived” is the best track ever made. And when Richard say this, this is like, “Wow!” you know? Because Richard was god in Germany. The Mover not. And England was the other way around because when I played the first time in London, I was that big on the flyer [makes size gesture] and he like that [makes small size gesture]. And I said, “What?” So he got the same problem like me. When you come from Germany, nobody cares. He comes from London [ed. - from Cornwall], nobody cares. But in the rest of the world, Aphex Twin was like huge. I mean until today. Vivian Host Yeah. If you listen to his early tracks, you can definitely hear the influence of the hardcore sound for sure. Maybe we should listen to a little bit of the B-side of “We Have Arrived.” Marc Acardipane You got it. Vivian Host Which is called “Reflections of 2017.” So already back in 1990, 1991, you were thinking about the year 2017. Marc Acardipane There’s also a funny story. Vivian Host OK, let’s hear it first and then we’ll hear… Marc Acardipane Because the track is normally completely different. It’s with the Oberheim, it’s a keyboard. Then something happens. I don’t know. It got the hanging in the sound and I leave it and record it to the end and did some reverse cuts and that’s it. But normally, the synth plays something totally different, so you can never make that. That’s what I also like in the analog. You never know what happens. You know, you’re on the wrong MIDI channel or something, I don’t know. And you will hear – it’s a really weird sound, but that’s Richard’s favorite. Vivian Host OK. Will you point out when the weird sound happens? Just point at it? So… (music: The Mover – “Reflections of 2017” / applause) Marc Acardipane And here you can hear like how I try to be different. I mean, take any synth and try to copy that sound. It’s not so easy. Vivian Host Yeah, I guess you had the help of the synths sometimes doing what they wanted as well, right? Marc Acardipane Yes. Vivian Host Late at night in the studio, what’s going on. Marc Acardipane Or the [Pilldriver] “Apocalypse Never.” Vivian Host I don’t have that one. Marc Acardipane There’s also, I don’t know, there’s a track that Nina plays – Nina Kraviz is playing at the moment and there was also a really stupid story. I was sitting like that in the studio [lounges] and I had the keyboard was, like, here. It’s downstairs. Here was the computer and I had a sound, also in the Oberheim, same synth like that. And I had no idea. And I was sitting like this, I was a little bit tired. And then I fall from the table over the keyboard like [makes motion] and I said, “Wow, that sounds cool.” And then I played a whole track with the elbow, and this is really true. And that’s the track that Nina plays now since couple of months always at the closing track [laughs]. Vivian Host Wild man. So that song that we heard, “Reflections of 2017” is under The Mover alias. And The Mover was actually your nickname in Frankfurt. Why were you called that? Marc Acardipane Because I moved things. I born in April and things that… How do you say in English? You have people say, “Oh, you cannot. You cannot do that.” I can. When I went ’96 to Holland, I say, “OK, I go there and be the number one,” and everybody was like, “Ha, ha, ha.” One year later, I was. Or like ’92 I said, “Oh, in one year techno parties will be in big halls in Germany. Frankfurt Festhalle, Dortmund Westfallenhalle.” And the journalists like, “Ha, ha. Never.” One year later, it was. So we always have to believe in things if they happen or not. You know there’s also things that doesn’t happen. But if you put like before, “Oh no, this will never happen.” It will never happen. And this is with all things in life, not in music. If you’re saying, “Yeah, I want to become a big star.” But then say, “No, I never make it.” You’ll never make it. You know? Believe in yourself. Vivian Host So going back to the 2017 part and The Move. The Mover is, for me anyway, your darker and trippier alias. A little bit different than the guy who’s like let’s all get drunk and whatever. Like it seems more introspective and it seems more… Marc Acardipane It’s me, yeah. Vivian Host Dark. Marc Acardipane It’s the most me. Vivian Host Tell me a little bit about what this idea of 2017 you had was back in those days or why this number? Why this year? Marc Acardipane Over about two years, I had dreams and episodes five times a week and it was all happening in 2017. So it has nothing to do with the music actually or that I was planning something to do with the world, the future. But we still here. Vivian Host So what were the dreams specifically? Were they something apocalyptic or dark about the year 2017? Marc Acardipane I don’t want to tell. Vivian Host OK. But you were putting the idea into this music of what you were seeing in your mind? Marc Acardipane Yeah. Vivian Host Interesting. Alright, fair enough. We can just listen to the records… Marc Acardipane I never told nobody. I think there’s only two people I told in my whole life. And it’s Thorsten, my partne, and Shawn, my longtime music partner also. Vivian Host So when after you start putting out this music, like what were the first big huge raves that you were playing as PCP? Marc Acardipane I think the really first big was Hellraiser. Vivian Host What year would that have been? Marc Acardipane Mayday or Hellraiser? Vivian Host I don’t know. What year was it in? Marc Acardipane ’93. I think they were both in ’93, but I don’t know which comes first. Hellraiser is in Holland, in Amsterdam. Big huge hall. Really famous. And Mayday. Where was it? In Dortmund. We had the fight. That’s why you’re asking me, huh? Vivian Host No, I was just wondering when you realized that this music that you were making was getting really big and I think the experience of going to play. You know, like maybe you’re playing around Frankfurt or something. But this experience of going to a rave and being like, “Oh, there’s thousands of people who love my music,” is a huge… Marc Acardipane I think it was in Holland because Holland had so many raves. They put like, I don’t know, ten posters in the city and then in the evening, there was 10,000 people. And in Germany we only had the Mayday once a year and there was like 10 - 12,000 with a big campaign and Holland’s a lot smaller than Germany. I think it was in Holland, yeah. Vivian Host But you’re right that I do want to show the video of Mayday. So we’re gonna play a video of Mayday, which was a pretty legendary early rave here in Germany. It happened in Dortmund, but was actually put on by the Low Spirit crew, who are from Berlin, who are sort of headed up by WestBam, like one of the first big DJs of this scene, and his brother. And there’s kind of a rivalry between German cities, right? Or there was back in those days. Was there already a rivalry when you went to play the rave? Marc Acardipane Of course. And after… You know, there was Low Spirit and they had a lot of commercial acts. So WestBam he was okay. We had no problem with him. But they had also like Marusha, Mark ‘Oh was really commercial. They were in the charts, so they always want to have their artists shining. And on this rave also Moby played and also Lenny Dee. And they cut off Moby’s sound. Prodigy was also there, I think. Yeah, The Prodigy was also there, but it was before they became big or really big. Yeah, they tried to do the same with us, but then there starts a fight on stage because we were planned for 15 minutes. We asked for 20 and they cut [us] at minute 11 when we play “9mm Is A Classic,” which was ’93 hit of the year in Germany, because they don’t want that we are shining there. And Moby destroys his keyboard. I will not destroy my keyboard. And with Lenny, they put out all the high frequencies during his DJ [set]. With Jeff Mills they were all cool because he was with them [in their camp], but Lenny not. And the party [was] called the Judgement Day… [For] real huh? And then we did the track was called “Low Spirit Suck My Cock,” which was on Thunderdome and sold 180,000 copies and since this day Low Spirit hate us of course. That’s how we became big in Holland also – because they try that we not play anymore in Germany and they had big influences. And then we became big in Holland. where the Thunderdome comes from. Vivian Host You guys were pretty good at doing hardcore diss tracks. There comes the hip-hop thing. Didn’t you do a diss track against these guys that did this rave hit called “Who is Elvis?” Marc Acardipane Oh yeah. Vivian Host OK, so there’s a song called “Who is Elvis?” and it sort of rips off this song by LA Style. Marc Acardipane No, no. Vivian Host In a way. Marc Acardipane No, there was AMV, which was the first German techno distributor and I worked there every Thursday, not for money. I go to the shops and check that all the techno records are in the right position. And my partner (my ex-partner Thorsten), he also worked there a little bit so. And then we had this record called “Who is Elvis?,” which became a chart hit, so it was good for the distribution – and the distribution owner, his name is Alex Azary. And then the guy who did the track give it to another label (because there was at that time more handshake deals) and so we were really pissed off. So we did the record called “Friends of Alex” and instead of “Who is Elvis?” we say “Fick dich doch mal” which means like, “F-ck you.” And we were selling out in all 35,000 copies. We were three times on the position to hit the charts, but they didn’t let us in because of the word “f-ck.” At that time, it was not cool to use that. Nowadays it doesn’t matter anymore. And now, it’s a legendary track. It’s really funny because we didn’t do the sample. It was, I record a rapper and he had to do it over and over again. And after I say, “Now you do it the tenth time,” he say “Eh, fick dich doch mal!” and I cut it from there. [laughs] Vivian Host But having an MC with you as a live act was a really important part of your show, I think, as PCP and even later on. Marc Acardipane PCP we had two, and then later on with Ultimate MC from Trinidad. Yeah, I met him in Trinidad. Vivian Host Who were the MCs in PCP? Marc Acardipane Thorsten, my ex-partner, and Pan. They were from the early beginning, but there’s also like an act. It’s not only MC. I don’t want to call them real MCs. It’s psychos. Vivian Host OK, well let’s play video number two. This is PCP live at Mayday from April 30th, 1993. (video: PCP live at Mayday, April 30th, 1993) We can actually play video number three too. So that’s earlier on. You guys only played for 15 minutes, 17 minutes. Marc Acardipane I think nine or 11 or something. Vivian Host You can see it in this video number three, you can see you guys kind of getting told to stop and then it starts. (video: PCP live at Mayday, April 30th, 1993) So what happened there? They just cut you off and just went… Marc Acardipane Yeah, we have two other videos from the other side from GTO, these guys from England. And you’ll see that Röttger Williams, the boss of, or he was the boss of, Low Spirit, he came to the engineer and said [makes cutting sound] and then he ran away. So there was like... How do you say in this in English? There’s not the stairs. It’s like that [makes movement] with the… Vivian Host A ladder? Marc Acardipane Yeah, exactly. So he was away and then the guy cut off and then we throw the guy from the stage. It was really high and then the security want to get us. And then my fighting teacher was on stage. He was in front of me. And he had some chuckos [ed. – Nunchucks] and Lenny’s friend took the chuckos and put it on the ladder so the security cannot come up. And on the other side, the other DJ starts already, but nobody cares. So everybody’s stay in front like, “PCP!” Vivian Host Wow. That’s like the opposite of a peace, love, unity and respect, huh? Marc Acardipane They didn’t respect us. Vivian Host Yeah, it was a different time then. I mean there was a lot of... Especially with the hardcore scene, you guys were up against a lot of people I think because this kind of music was often dissed by people as too hard, too fast, too crazy. Right? Am I wrong? Marc Acardipane Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Vivian Host I mean, I think that you guys already came with this attitude, but did you always feel like you were having to fight against someone to get the respect that you deserve? Marc Acardipane No, no, no. Definitely not. I’m a vegan. I’m a really nice guy, but like that, if you want to f-ck with us, you know? I mean this was disrespect when we have 15 minutes and they cut us at 11 when we played the hit of the year in Germany. It was not that we were over the time. This was on purpose what they did. And this I don’t like, you know, that we always fail. Vivian Host So is there at this time, was there something like this is what guys from Frankfurt are like and this is what guys from Berlin are like? Did people have a different image in the scene? Marc Acardipane No, not really. I mean, there was like Tanith, for example. We didn’t have any problem with Tanith or some other guys from... But it was also way back. There was always a problem also with the hip-hop between Berlin and Frankfurt. I dunno why it comes from. With Low Spirit, this was only because they were commercial and we don’t like that. They had this whole starting with the fake. You know, Marusha, she was everywhere and she not really can sing and she try. Somebody else was singing the record, so it was fake. We don’t like that because you have to be real in the music. And I think maybe also the track you play first from the video, it’s called “Konstablerwache,” which is a drug seller place in Frankfurt and when you go there and the people say, “Psst, psst how much you need?” So we took that and make, “How fast do you need?” And that’s why in German when you ask, “How much you want it?” And people scream out, “800.” “OK, I give you 800 BPMs.” And so normal people maybe, I don’t know, it’s too hard for them. We found it… I found it funny. Sven played it in the radio and on the next day it comes from every car in Frankfurt when you go outside because everybody knows this, “Psst, psst how much you need?” Vivian Host Yeah, you guys were amazing at figuring out how to make a hook, whether it was… Marc Acardipane And this track is done in 20 minutes because there was a journalist there and he say, “How long you need for a track?” “20 minutes.” And then I did this track. And then I cleaned the studio and then I heard that Sven was on the radio. So I drove there and say, “Come on, play it.” And then he fall from the table. He loves it so much. Vivian Host Yeah, I mean it’s kind of amazing. So there’s all these samples that people can grab onto and like identify the tracks. Even if they’re not DJs, they can know, “Oh, this is the track where it says ‘nine millimeters.’” “This is the track where it does this.” But also writing these very simple lines that people can actually sing along to I think was a real strength of all of this music that you did in the ’90s. Marc Acardipane I think it’s a talent. Yeah. Vivian Host I actually have video number four just to illustrate this point. This is from Rome in 2005, but it’s people singing along to your track like sort of acapella. (video: The Mover live in Rome, 2005) Marc Acardipane Amazing party. Because the organizers thought there’s coming three to 500 [people], he had two security guys. And then 5,000 people show up. It was Lory D and me. It was a big stadium for horses. This was in the hall of the place. We were all happy that nothing happened because the promoter was really in fear that if there’s some fights or whatever, but everything was peaceful. Like me. Vivian Host So peaceful. Lory D, of course, being a hardcore techno legend from Italy. From Rome. Yeah, I mean there’s more high-budget, beautiful photos I could show from later from these... Like Thunderdome later on and these bigger raves. But I kind of like these old ones ’cause it gives me the feeling of what it was actually like to be there with your head shaking around ’cause it’s so loud. Anyway, what song are they singing in that video? Marc Acardipane That’s “Into Wasteland” by The Mover, which was in Rome the first techno track that ever became big. Lory D was like what Sven Väth was for Frankfurt or WestBam for Berlin, Lory D is for Rome. And this is the track where everything started. And I didn’t know that when I played the first time there. I was like, do they sing the song? And I put the fader down and I hear that they sing it. Vivian Host Is this one of your favorite songs that you’ve made as The Mover? Marc Acardipane One of the three, yeah definitely. I really love that song. You’ve got nice atmosphere and nice emotion. Vivian Host OK, let’s hear a little bit of it in its actual original state. Now that you’ve heard it sung acapella. (music: The Mover – “Into The Wasteland” / applause) So that was “Into The Wasteland” by the Mover. What were you using to make that? Marc Acardipane I think that was two Oberheim synths, the 909 and that’s it. An 808. But I think it was a sample, the snare is 808. But it’s also really simple. And it’s funny on this track because in a way it’s kind of commercial, but it’s not. You know what I mean? If you put like the drums away, put a guitar in and let the guy from Coldplay sing over it, it can be a radio hit, you know? [laughter] Vivian Host How much did you think about that at a certain point, because by ’93, ’94, you’re playing everywhere in these giant raves. People are playing your songs on the radio. Like depending on what country you’re from, hardcore is a very underground or niche music, but actually in Germany, Holland, Belgium, and maybe Italy, it’s like giant. It became giant. So were you thinking at some point about how much these tracks were going to sell? Marc Acardipane No, never. I mean, we had some things on our label. If we sell under 3,000, we stop the label. But we never had to do it. At this time, the sales were really good. But we had also labels where in front we only press 500 to keep them cool. But we never thought about sales at that time. Also you made enough money for everything. We also… we didn’t have to play or DJ or live. You could live from the sales. Nowadays, no. Vivian Host I think that you guys did some cool stuff in the marketing, though. Of having these different aliases and having different... You had different labels at one point. So people, rather than putting everything under your own name, you had a lot of different things that people could buy into that seemed like they were buying all different people or all different things. Marc Acardipane Yeah. Yeah. I think at that time it was great. Nowadays, it would be really difficult to do that. Or you want to have 80 Instagram accounts and Facebook accounts. I think you’d go mad because the focus is not there today. Like back in the days, you produce a record, you press it, you do some white labels, you send it to the shop. He’d give it to some DJs. They play it, they get a good reaction. You sell it to the shop. The people come to the shop. They order with you. Then you have a hit record. But nowadays, you don’t have that anymore. For example, you go to a techno club and you say, “Oh wow. I like the music,” then you go on Beatport, put “techno” in and like, uhhh. One million releases this week! There’s more labels than artists on Beatport. That’s really true, and so it is confusing. And then back in the days, you’d go to your favorite record store and you say like, “Ah, that guy played last Friday there. I like his sound. What kind of music does he play?” And then you select your 100 records and then you find something. But nowadays to find a record is really hard and that’s a big difference to the past. There was also not so much. It’s too much today. It’s on the one way, it’s good that everybody with a low budget can make music, but there’s also a lot of fakers because sometimes it’s not bad that you work your ass off for one year to buy some equipment to do music. Then you really know you want to do it. Because nowadays with the correct software, everybody’s doing music and release any shit with maybe loops. It was really funny. One year ago, a friend called me and say, “Hey, check out the Beatport Top 10,” and there was seven tracks with the same shaker loop. Back in the days, we didn’t have loops. We had no presets, nothing. You maybe find out, “OK, that sound comes from that synth,” but you still have to do it. That sometimes is good for the music. Vivian Host Yeah. There was no tutorial on how to make the Hoover back in those times. Marc Acardipane No, no. There was no Facebook, no YouTube, no nothing. Vivian Host So I mean… Marc Acardipane I wish we had. Vivian Host You do? Marc Acardipane Sometimes, yeah. Vivian Host Why? Marc Acardipane Yeah, because to get, for example, from Germany to America in ’92 forget it. Today, it’s easy. In three months, you can be a world star. If everything works right on the point and you’re a little bit lucky and everything looks good. It was not possible back in the days. You know, you have to find a label. I saw now, I don’t know a couple of years ago on YouTube, there’s one track of me called Cyborg Unknown “The Year 2001” which was played in Detroit on a dance show. You have also the video? No? No. But I didn’t know at that time that they play it there. I didn’t know it was big then. I know now from YouTube, somebody recorded and put it on YouTube. Vivian Host Are you saying the Detroit New Dance Show? Marc Acardipane Yeah, it’s so funny. Then they played the track there. But we didn’t know. Vivian Host What song was it? Marc Acardipane ’91, ’92. It’s the first dance ecstasy. Vivian Host Alright, well we’ll look that up later. I didn’t get to that one. So you mentioned Thunderdome, which I think was kind of important in developing the aesthetics around hardcore. I mean, you guys already had stuff going on. There were people also in the Netherlands making this music and other places. But it really becomes that hardcore starts to have an aesthetic and a vibe. Tell me for you what Thunderdome was and this was also kind of the start of these big raves that we have now, like Mysteryland and Tomorrowland and all this stuff. Marc Acardipane That’s true. But for me, the CD was bigger [to] notice than the parties because I, just last year the Thunderdome guys asked me because they put out a book soon (or it’s out, I don’t know) and they asked me the same question. For me, it was the CD because when Thunderdome 3 came on the TV in Germany, the advertisement, it was like everything changed with this dog, with the pitbull. That was the one where they sell 180,000 copies. So it hits in the charts in Germany and from that day everybody was like, “Ooh, what is this? Hardcore? Cool.” Then it was the parties. But I think we didn’t play so much on the first Thunderdomes. Later on, when they were really big, like ’97, ’98, there I play. But before, or I dunno, maybe I don’t remember, but I don’t think so. Vivian Host So they were advertising a compilation CD of Thunderdome, which was.. Marc Acardipane They had a nice advertisement with this pitbull dog. That was their logo. Vivian Host And so you had tracks on these Thunderdome compilations… Marc Acardipane Yeah, four. I think, four. Vivian Host They were selling a lot. Marc Acardipane Yeah. It was the “Low Spirit Suck My Cock” on. The other three I don’t remember which one. Vivian Host I’m just interested in it because I feel like the Netherlands took this music and really were able to market it to a worldwide audience eventually. And also give it a sort of... Like really tie it in with kind of like horror movie aesthetics or end of the world aesthetics. Like if you look at the names of the Thunderdome compilations, they are Fuck Mellow, This is Hardcore From Hell, The Fifth Nightmare, Caught in the Web of Death. Marc Acardipane That was not us. So the Holland people really like the horror. I like aliens. Vivian Host You like what? Marc Acardipane Aliens. I don’t like horror movies at all, so. But in Holland it was so big. Like you go there and you sit in the hotel and you see a commercial advertising insurance. The kid is a gabber – which means he’s a hardcore fan – because otherwise you will not sell your insurance. And I have like school books with my picture on front of it and it was so weird for us because in Germany, hardcore was completely underground. Everybody hates it. And in Holland it was like pop music. If I come from the hotel and go in the taxi, “Hey Marc, where are you going?” because I was with ID&T then. This is the guys, the label from Thunderdome, and they put me on TV for one week, 45 minutes every night. They put the same live show so everybody knows me there. And gabber is like, they have a bald head, $3,000 training suit and [the word] gabber comes from Hebrew – it’s another language, it’s a Jewish language – and [it means] “friend.” So it’s like punk or the mods or whatever and they’re called the gabbers. So it’s not a music style. A lot of people think it’s a music style, but it’s not. So in the beginning, the hardcore was called house in Holland. And then the gabbers listened to the house, so they called gabber house. We bring the name hardcore to Holland and then... Vivian Host And then they called it hardcore, but the subculture around it was called gabber. Marc Acardipane Yeah, the gabbers listened to it. This is the same, like I don’t know if you know the group The Who, it’s a big English rock band, and they were listened to by the mods and the mods they wear long suits, driving the Vespa and they have also really short hair but the mods, The Who were not the mods so it was like the punk. There’s a lot of confusion but if you go to a Dutch guy and say gabber music he would look at you like, “What?” Because he knows, but here in Germany everybody thinks it’s a music style but it’s not. Vivian Host So I guess Holland was pretty good to you. Did you move there at some point? Marc Acardipane No, never. I always think it’s better you come somewhere and you come back. If you live there, you’re maybe not so interesting anymore. Vivian Host At what point... I mean one of the things that changed too was that in the beginning a lot of music was called house or a lot of music was called techno. All styles of electronic music and then at some point the genres, like you were mentioning it’s hard to go on Beatport and find certain things that you want because also there are things split into so many different genres. What point did you see hardcore music start to become all these different strands of hardcore? ‘Cause somehow we get, there is terrorcore, hardstyle, what else? Marc Acardipane Hardstyle is completely different. So there was a time in like 2003 where I say goodbye to hardcore, and then the hardcore goes really bad and then there comes another style, which was hardstyle, which sounds a little bit like in the beginning of hardcore and became also a style, then this get bored and then they come with the rawstyle. But in the beginning in my time there was the rave hardcore, that’s what we did. Then there was the terror, which became, if you ask today, Drokz he’s really the famous terror DJ, the “Low Spirit Suck My Cock” he says everything starts with that, when we did this track. We did it on 220 bpm, only for fun. Then it became a style, but I never was a hard terror DJ. There’s certain styles also with breakbeats, I don’t know how they call that… Breakcore? Yeah, breakcore. but I’m not a friend of all these styles. For me it’s all techno. Vivian Host Who was doing the terror? Dutch people? Marc Acardipane A lot, French, English, American, Australian. Nasenbluten. Vivian Host Oh yeah, Nasenbluten from Australia. So you weren’t making like 220 bpm. Marc Acardipane No, I did this one record, and that is all. For me, there must always be a groove. I like to make the people dance. You also can dance on 220, but maybe only for three minutes. Vivian Host Only long enough to do the live show, as we saw. I want to play something else from another one of your aliases. This one is from Pilldriver. What’s up with Pilldriver? Marc Acardipane Also a track that Nina supports in the moment. I did it in ’95, I had an A-side, and I needed a B-side, and I had not much time, and I thought, “OK, let’s do a kick, filter it, put some delay on,” and it was actually the first recording, so actually the whole track took seven minutes. Nobody cares about the A-side anymore because it became a huge hit like Carl Cox played it, Laurent Garnier, all the really famous techno DJs played it. And it’s only a kick drum. Vivian Host Don’t mind if I do. This is Pilldriver with “Pitchhiker.” (music: Pilldriver – “Pitchiker” / applause) Marc Acardipane There’s no edits, no automation, nothing. Just one recording, with one 909 kick, with delay, preamps, EQs. Vivian Host So that was from 1997. Marc Acardipane Five. Vivian Host ’95? Marc Acardipane Yeah. Vivian Host Was that on Cold Rush? What was the theme of this label, Cold Rush? Marc Acardipane Can I say that here? [laughs]. It was Cold Rush records. The little names [Ed. – catalog numbers] was LOST, so “LOST 001,” “LOST 002.” This is 009, and the idea was, this is probably the last record before you die on an overdose in a big hall in a rave. Vivian Host That’s pretty dark, man. Marc Acardipane [laughs] I know. Vivian Host What was your life like then, at this time, around ’95, ’97? I mean, it’s interesting to me because, you know, you make this dark music, and then you play these really hard raves, and then does it become a self-fulfilling prophecy that your life becomes darker because you’re doing all of that? Marc Acardipane It’s experience. I mean, I was nearly dead two times on an overdose. So, but this is not like I sit the whole day there and be depressive. It is not. But music is all about… it was my life, only in the studio. But I stopped then with the drugs. It was ’92 or ’93, so really early. Yeah. Vivian Host But you didn’t mind making music for people that were having these experiences? Bad trips and all that. Marc Acardipane No, because back in the days you say “E is the key.” It was a step for most of the people into that music, which I understand. Nowadays it’s really dangerous because you don’t know what’s in there. When we start, there was no business around the drugs so they were clean. Until the day they were not clean, and this was the day where I nearly died, and then I make a deal with God, I say, “If I survive this night, I stop.” That was Mayday 2 in Cologne. Vivian Host So, kind of early on, into this. Marc Acardipane Yeah, four people died on this party. It was the first punch Ecstasy in the history of techno. Vivian Host Obviously that was a pretty dark experience, but you just thought, “I need to not think too much about it, I need to just keep going with this.” And keep making fun party tracks. Keep making stuff that the ravers are going to way. Marc Acardipane It’s also like, I don’t want to say like it was shit that I did that because now when I play I know how the people feel. As a DJ, you need to know how they feel. And they’re on drugs, of course. If you never took drugs or experienced anything, I don’t think you can play for them, you know. But on the other side, you also can talk to them, and tell to them about your experience that they don’t do the same mistakes. Today the mistakes can be done really, really fast. Vivian Host Yeah, I’m sure you’ve seen a lot of crazy things in your many years of throwing parties. Marc Acardipane Yeah at this party, one of these four I saw dying. I was on the bridge, and they took him out from the hall, and he was like white, soap comes out of mouth, and his girlfriend was next to him crying, and I was like, “F-ck.” I had like from the feet to the back [makes banging sound] what was in my head, and then my whole life... You know from the movie comes from the past, all your life really fast. Then in this moment, a friend touched me. He was driving us, and I said, “Put me to the trees somewhere where I can touch stones, bring me out of here.” I actually had to play there but I didn’t do it anymore. Vivian Host Nowadays people, especially club promoters, party promoters and DJs are also dealing with the same issues still, and also dealing with the issues of what people do in the club, how they act, or who’s coming to the club, should we let these people in? And I know you said that you get asked quite a bit, especially in the German press, about hardcore because there’s been a problem at some parties with neo-nazis or white power people affiliating themselves with that genre. Have you ever had to take a stand on that as a DJ, as a person playing in raves one way or the other? Marc Acardipane End of the ’90s there became a problem that political companies try to filter their people into the hardcore party with also the bald head. I didn’t play on that particular promoter’s parties because I know that. I don’t want that. Then, I don’t know, two or three years later, I was playing in Germany, my MC is black, there were 10 people put their hand up in the “Heil Hitler” thing. So we leave the stage. There were 6,000 people. I didn’t saw any security, so I thought it was better we not jump in. Then it was May and I sent an email to all the promoters in Germany, and I canceled all my bookings until December with the last sentence: “We don’t entertain neo-nazis.” Then I get like SMS, like “You f-cking n-gger friend.” Then they tried to punch me three times in the club. Vivian Host But a lot of people that you knew were playing these parties knowing that this was going on. Marc Acardipane Exactly and I was really pissed off with them because they only think about the money, and in that moment you should [band] all together because there was never anything in the hardcore scene like that. In every scene you have some stupid people, but it was never like that. But now it’s not anymore. It stops then after this, there was a big discussion, and a lot of people came later to me and said, “Wow, it was great that you done that.” In the beginning it was not so like that. There was also not the big internet thing; then there came out wrong stories because I say there was 10 people put the right hand up, and then later it was like “Marc said all people from West Germany are nazis,” which I never said. We found out. I found the 10 people, and they lived 50 kilometers from Hamburg in the north. Vivian Host But not so far from you, I guess. Marc Acardipane Exactly, and you know, the scene is small. It took a couple of months, but we found them. Vivian Host So in a long career you have to make a lot of different decisions, and one of the decisions that you made is to let a very huge German group called Scooter use one of your tracks that was a big hit already, called “I Like it Loud,” a track that you made as Marshall Masters. Tell me… Well, first of all, I want to hear the original of that song. What can you tell me about making this? Did you know already when you were making it that it was going to be a big hit? Marc Acardipane Right after, yes. We did this whole track in five hours, and I was sure it would become a hit. (music: Marshall Masters – “I Like It Loud” / applause) Vivian Host So, what happened when Scooter came calling asking to use that song. Marc Acardipane That’s funny because the story I just tell with May, where I cancel all my bookings… Two, three weeks later, Jens Thele, he’s the manager of this group – I knew him for a long time – he asked me. And then I thought, OK. It’s like [when] you split from your girlfriend and you take the key and throw it out. I thought, “If I do that, I cannot go back.” But then I thought about it for three weeks, and I say, “Ok. Do it.” Vivian Host Why did you ultimately decide to let them… Not only did they use the song, but you guys were actually in the video and connected to the song. It’s not like they just paid you for an extended sample, it was a collab. Marc Acardipane No, not a sample. I have the whole publishing... No, no, it was… I say, “OK, I want to be in the video.” Yeah, because then I also have something out of it. Otherwise everybody would think it’s their track, and it was big in the Netherlands ’97, and in Belgium ’98, we hit golden record there. It’s the most sold track ever in the hardcore. Scooter did it in 2003. Six years later, actually. Vivian Host Can we watch video number five? Marc Acardipane Oh god. (video: Scooter vs Marc Acardipane & Ultimate MC – “Maria (I Like It Loud)”) Vivian Host So that’s Scooter vs Marc Acardipane & Ultimate MC. Marc Acardipane Was their biggest hit. Vivian Host “Maria (I Like It Loud).” Marc Acardipane Still get publishing, every year. Vivian Host I bet you do. This is off an album called The Stadium Techno Experience. Became the most played dance track on Viva and MTV, and actually, a huge track at sporting events, is, I guess it’s no surprise to anyone. Even the Philadelphia Flyers used to walk out to that song at one point. It made it around the world. How do you... Marc Acardipane Tiesto though actually also covered it, was it this year, or last year? You know, DJ Tiesto. He did it also. Vivian Host So, it’s interesting to me that that video is stylized kind of like a battle. Marc Acardipane That was my idea. Vivian Host You and Scooter. Marc Acardipane Yeah, really funny, the guy who filmed it went at the end of the video, H.P. [Baxxter], the MC from Scooter, and my MC stand next to that, and the camera guy say, “I give you 500 [euro] when you hit him.” [laughs] Vivian Host But you didn’t. Marc Acardipane No, not me. My MC’s name is Dick Rules at that time. But now it’s another one. He’s from New York, and he grow up in Frankfurt. Vivian Host So, how do you feel about this now. Do you think that that was… Are you happy with that decision? I can only assume that the royalties from that were good to you? Marc Acardipane Let’s say if the other thing doesn’t happen before, I had never done that. Vivian Host What do you mean? Marc Acardipane Yeah, if this right-wing shit where I cancel my bookings doesn’t happen, I would not do that; I didn’t give them… I wouldn’t allow them to do the cover version, never. It was like a bash in the face of the scene to see, like OK, I cannot come back. There’s no way back. Vivian Host But you were kind of sick of the scene by then? Marc Acardipane Not of the scene. When nobody say anything, and everybody only look like that [makes short vision movement], it just doesn’t work. I come from Frankfurt, and in Frankfurt we grow up all together. We have, from every country in the world, nations, everybody live there peaceful together, and I don’t like that. Then, as a DJ, as an artist, you have to stand for the things, you know. Most of the Dutch DJs, they’re like from Indonesia, they’re Jewish, they’re from Africa, from whatever, and if they also have to see that, and stop to play for these kinds of promoters. I don’t say that these promoters were right wing, but they allow these people to get in, and that’s the problem. You have to be there before. If you see that, you have to stop that. And that’s like, in Frankfurt we never had this problem. Vivian Host So, did you take a break for a while at any point? It seems people like to write that they haven’t heard from you, or heard any music from you, although I know you made some tracks under the Resident E banner that are also considered some of the first, or some important hardstyle tracks. I’m curious to know what was going on in between 2004 and 2016 for you. What you were feeling about the music, what you were listening to? Marc Acardipane I think after the Scooter thing, I get a new location with a really nice studio, and I was thinking about – I remember I just told somebody here – when I was sitting there, “When was the last time I really feel good when we do music?” And it was with Shawn from Trinidad. And at that moment he called me. I didn’t hear from him for eight years, I think. And he was in London, he said, “Oh, let’s do our album.” We always had the plan to do an album electronically, really dark, but with vocals (he’s a singer) and with orchestra. That I did for six years, but it never came out. I met him in ’96 when I was working in the studio in Trinidad. It’s a really big studio where Puff Daddy recorded the B.I.G album. He was the week there before we were there, but nobody knows Puff Daddy in Germany at that time. A bit later Shawn worked with them. Then Shawn was actually an engineer there, and then one night I was sitting there and he said, “Oh, can I sing over the track?” I said, “You are a singer?” He said, “yeah, yeah.” Then he go down, and I took him to Germany. We did “I Like It Loud,” he’s the original voice. Then he left again because of his girlfriend, and then he came back in 2004. Vivian Host So you made this record, but you didn’t put it out because you didn’t like it? Marc Acardipane Yeah, it was a really strange story. We did in the beginning – we did the whole album, I liked it, it was cool. But it was not sounding like I wanted to. The feeling was right, but the mix was not sounding cool, and maybe five years later I know how to mix it good. This was where all the Americans came in and help us with the mixing, but then the whole vibe was gone. There was no emotion anymore in the tracks. We go on, and put the first versions we had, and work on them, but in the end it was a pain in the ass, and then we stop it. Vivian Host Had you moved on to producing digitally at this point, or some mix of digital and analog? Marc Acardipane Mixed up. Mixing was more digital. That’s the problem. I should have never sold my board at that time. Vivian Host Yeah, because it was also trying to do new things, right? Learn new things, do things in a different way than you had done a lot of your big hits. Marc Acardipane Yep. Vivian Host What can you tell us about working with digital coming from an analog background? Anything that you learned that you need to do digitally that you didn’t have to concern yourself with when you were just using a Moog and a 909? Marc Acardipane It’s also from EQing. I don’t know with analog, you boost 15db without problem. Digitally you can do it also, but you would not do it because you see it. Or with the graphic EQs (OK, now you can also use without graphic EQs) but that’s the point, the compression sounds weird. Nowadays there’s some okay plugins. You cannot touch anything, I don’t know. I think it was the sound. With the analog, it was much easier. Because what I say, in the beginning, the harmonic distortion, everything fits together better, everything glued to itself. It destroyed the master bus, it’s kind of a little compression there all the time if you use the right board. You don’t have this in the digital. You can do it digitally, but a lot of American mixers say, “Oh, yeah, I mix everything in the box now.” OK, what they get is recorded analog. If they get the singer recorded to a nice Neve pre-amp, and compressed with 1176, after you can go with a digital EQ on it, but if you don’t have that, you will have a hard time to get it right in the DAW. Vivian Host I want to hear something from this new record, which is called Undetected Act from the Gloom Chamber. I think you had a track that you wanted to hear from it. Marc Acardipane “Shadow Deception.” Vivian Host Why this one? Marc Acardipane I got this Moog synthesizer, and this was actually the first sound I did in it, and I know this will be the hit record on the album, and I was right. All the major DJs play it now, but I think you have to go a little bit in the middle of the track, when the break comes because before it’s only groove. Vivian Host All right, I’m going to do my best. Marc Acardipane I played it the first time in Lyon, and everybody was dancing, I was like, “Yeah. All right.” It was really funny, a big company like Dior, asked an English company to do this advertisement. And they ask a guy from Rome which tracks are cool, and one of them was mine, so they choose the one, then they go – it’s unbelievable – then they go on Soundcloud, found my track, upload it from another guy, and pay him. And release it with Dave Gahan, a one-minute video. The whole track played one minute. Vivian Host The business side of this is super crazy. Marc Acardipane I mean, there’s Discogs, you can find out who owns which track. You cannot ask somebody, and pay him money. I mean, this is completely childish.

Peder Mannerfelt
Swedish producer Peder Mannerfelt embraces the versatility of modern production and electronic music through both his collaborations and solo work. Beginning with bad approximations of funk and dreams of drum & bass during high school, Mannerfelt soon realized that the personal computer held more promise than a guitar. Beginning in 2009, he has applied this interest to the more experimental and abstract side of electronic music via Roll The Dice, his duo with Malcolm Pardon, and his own techno-minded alias the Subliminal Kid, as well as contributing production to Fever Ray’s debut album and 2017’s Plunge. Today Mannerfelt runs his own label, exploring contemporary techno, and regularly DJs and performs live.
In this lecture during the RBMA Bass Camp Stockholm 2019, Mannerfelt retraced his steps from teenage bedrooms to Berghain, touching on influences, production and performance approaches and the politics of club culture.
Hosted by Calle Dernulf Hi, and welcome to Red Bull Music Academy Bass Camp Stockholm. My name is Calle Dernulf and I’m incredibly happy to introduce an experimental sound creator and musician, Peder Mannerfelt! [applause] Peder Mannerfelt Hi! Calle Dernulf How are you? Peder Mannerfelt I’m good. A bit tired. But at least I made it here. Calle Dernulf You just finished a gig at Berghain. What was the mood like? Peder Mannerfelt We played the final set, until ten o’clock yesterday morning. It was very intense, but a lot of fun. Calle Dernulf And you performed as Aasthma? Peder Mannerfelt That’s right. Calle Dernulf You and Pär Grindvik. What is it that you do as Aasthma? Peder Mannerfelt We don’t really know. We’ve worked together for quite a few years in various ways. He helps me with my record label in many different ways. But we realized that we had never made music together. So we started doing that. We don’t really have a plan. We just started DJing together, like we did this weekend. Calle Dernulf Did you dream about being a rock star when you were young? Peder Mannerfelt Oh yes! That was my goal all along. I wanted that from an early age. I played the guitar at first, and wanted to become a rock star. But that’s not quite what happened. Calle Dernulf How do you feel about that rock star status when you compare it to being a star DJ at Berghain today? Peder Mannerfelt In hindsight I think I made the right decision. The CDJ [is] a bit more fun than playing the guitar. It’s easier. I wasn’t that great of a guitarist. I never really fully committed to it. I ended up fiddling with pedals and the such instead. Others had more talent than me. Calle Dernulf Was that a way to move away from it since you felt that you weren’t that great of a guitarist? Peder Mannerfelt Probably. I wanted to make electronic music, but didn’t know anyone who did. Everyone played in a band: hard rock, grunge, punk and hardcore. I didn’t know anyone who owned a synthesizer. It was almost like a mystery... I knew that I wanted to make drum & bass. But I had absolutely no idea how to do it. My big brother had computer software in which you could edit a track. So he edited a few songs together, which was awesome. But that was all there was. Calle Dernulf For the past 15-20 years you’ve had [aliases like] the Subliminal Kid, Roll the Dice and a lot of collaborations. Peder Mannerfelt Yes. Calle Dernulf Why are you so attracted to collaborations? Peder Mannerfelt It just happens. I get easily bored, so I always look for something new. It’s much easier to get something done when you’re not on your own. Even in my solo projects I still work with Pär Grindvik. If you work on your own, the process can take such a long time. When is it time to move on, when is it done? Just realizing when you’re done... It’s so easy to just keep going and keep adding things. But if you’re two or more people making the decision to move forward is much easier. “OK, now we’re done!” And not let things pile up. Calle Dernulf Do you feel an obligation to deliver when there’s someone else involved? Is that also a part of the collaboration? Having to step up to the plate. Peder Mannerfelt I’m not sure it works that way. I like it when you can involve different people in the process. You work with different people in different ways. You don’t always have to stay in the same role. With one person you might focus on the beats. Or I might be in charge of the musical part, even though that’s not my strong suit. It’s fun to try on different roles, such as doing the lyrics and such. It’s a lot of fun, and that’s the most important thing for me. Calle Dernulf Let’s get back to the dream of being a rock star and when you started fiddling with effect pedals instead. At this point you had to have realized that it was sound in particular that was important for you? Peder Mannerfelt Right. In his basement, a friend of mine had one of the first Pro Tools interfaces. We spent the entire final year of high school recording bad funk. Calle Dernulf Bad funk? Peder Mannerfelt Very bad funk. After school had finished, I went there on my own to record other things. I took a sound technician course. It’s not that long ago, but at that time the internet didn’t exist in the same way. All kinds of information is available right away today. Today, you can learn a lot on your own, which is awesome. That wasn’t possible before. YouTube has really made a huge difference. You had to find information in other ways. So I took a course at the SAE Institute for six months to find out if this was something that I could pursue. Calle Dernulf When did you realize that you would be able to accomplish the things you wanted to do musically? Peder Mannerfelt About five years ago, I’d say. Mastering all this has been a long journey. Working with music software is like learning a new instrument. You get a flow in your work. Calle Dernulf It’s interesting that you said “five years ago” since you’ve been releasing records for a long time and produced other artists. That attitude might be a bit too humble, without a sense of reality? Peder Mannerfelt It wasn’t until then... But I’m not done yet. You always keep learning. That’s when I felt that I could create the things that I had set my mind to. It’s like the famous 10,000 hour rule. You can master anything, as long as you spend 10,000 hours doing it. I’ve probably spent 100,000 hours or more at this point... I think that’s true. Even if you’re not the best singer or musician you can still put in the hours, and find your way. That’s why I like working with a computer. Today, you can create a song incredibly fast. The threshold is really low. 20 years ago, I couldn’t even imagine this, “How does a sampler work? Where can I get one? What else do I need?” Today, a producer makes music. Historically, a producer has been a mediator between the technology and the artist. Making the artist feel comfortable with using the technology, and vice versa. You almost act as a psychologist. It’s easy to forget those things today when you work on your own. When you work with others, you have to listen to each other. Calle Dernulf There are also producers, artists and record labels who want a specific person who represents a certain sound or level of quality, and so on. But there’s also the aspect you mention, the mediator who has to convey the artist’s vision. If you work as a producer for another artist, you are not the main focus. It’s easy to forget that today when the lines are blurred. Peder Mannerfelt We learned a lot regarding that. Do I want to be an artist or a producer? Where do I place myself on this scale? Calle Dernulf And you found that being a producer is a bit tricky? Peder Mannerfelt Henrik von Sivers who I work with right now, he calls himself Van Rivers, we did this together for a few years. Then we drifted away from each other. We wanted different things musically. I’m very happy with what we created during this long process. Then I ended up at square one again. I didn’t know what to do. Should I start making commercial jingles, or get into the TV business? Where do you go from here? I just started making tons of recordings. I have children now, so I don’t have as much time as before but at that point I had tons of free time. I spent many hours on it. Now, ten years later I can open those files and have 15 perfect minutes that I can use today. I spent a long time searching for a purpose. Calle Dernulf If we go back a bit, do you have any early musical memory that you can go back to? A strong experience of any kind? Peder Mannerfelt My big brother is seven years older than me and was into hip-hop in the late ’80s. He recorded Soul Corner on P3 for me every Sunday. I was five, so I had to listen to it. We listened to the hip-hop of that time, Public Enemy and 2 Live Crew. And also Kraftwerk! That’s where it started. Calle Dernulf That’s quite modern in a way, but you still chose to pick up the guitar? Peder Mannerfelt That’s when I wanted to find my own way, when my big brother left home. Me and my friends listened to a lot of hardcore which was big in Sweden in the beginning of the ’90s, such as Refused. You know, going snowboarding and playing the guitar. Calle Dernulf Eventually you found your own type of techno by eliminating the dancefloor. Peder Mannerfelt Yes. Calle Dernulf How liberating was it to realize that you had a path to follow? Peder Mannerfelt It wasn’t a sure thing right away. At times I went overboard and just kept adding things. Songs with tons of beats and lots of additional stuff. My friend Paul from Emptyset heard some synthesizer stuff and loved it. So he wanted to make a record with four songs like that. For me they were just bits and pieces, like separate tracks from different songs. But that’s when I understood... When I started doing this that’s when the techno world started showing appreciation. Just when I stopped making techno! So I slipped in through the backdoor. Calle Dernulf By offering them something different? Peder Mannerfelt Exactly, now I’ve learned how to make techno! What was key in learning this? Simplifying things, and not overproducing. I often think that young people who have just discovered something new make the best dance music. Not just dance music, but other music as well. But if we use dance music as an example, before you know your way around a program you just add a kick, hi-hat and a synth line, and that’s enough to make you super excited. The energy is tangible. It’s the same thing with hip-hop. You get this simplicity with just a drum machine or something. Run-D.M.C. was just a drum machine and two voices. But the energy is crazy and the creative joy is there. The same thing goes for punk. It’s right in your face. I think it’s so much fun to discover new music and on my label I try to release quite a lot of new artists. I like the raw and straightforward approach. I have spent some time producing others, but I struggled with it myself. But when I scaled downand started from the beginning that’s when I found the right feeling. Punk, hip-hop and electronic music have all had their pioneering moments. The most important thing isn’t to keep the same old sound but simply that you do something, and find the joy of creating music. And then the listener gets to determine if they like it or not. Calle Dernulf But these genres are all past their initial phase where everything’s exciting. Punk goes way back in trying to find its roots, and the same thing with hip-hop. And now dance music has passed a threshold but will it be able to find its way back to a simpler and more pure spirit? Peder Mannerfelt I think so. That’s what’s so cool today, with all music history being available. If I hear an artist for the first time, the first thing I do is research them. This kind of information remained a mystery in the past. “Who is Stereolab
?” But I know that today. I can find the entire discography in an instant. So today you can get this information in an instant. I still get excited by new techno today. Like the gig we did last Monday morning. You get incredibly energized. We played eight hours. You get tired, but you also get tons of energy. Calle Dernulf Once you get off stage, do you feel like you’ve gotten ideas for other productions? Peder Mannerfelt Definitely. That’s what I mean. At first you groan about having to get up at 4 AM to go to Basel and DJ for three hours. The body objects once you’re older and have small kids. But almost every time it’s like an injection of energy that lasts for a couple of days. It’s really cool. Calle Dernulf So it’s worth it? Peder Mannerfelt Definitely! Calle Dernulf It’s evident that you’ve played the guitar and played around with pedals. Another of your projects that has released a few albums is Roll the Dice, with you and Malcolm Pardon. How would you describe your process when you started? Peder Mannerfelt We ended up in the same studio 13 years ago. He’s a few years older than me and has played in bands on a professional level during the ’90s. He’s produced artists, and worked in film and TV for the past 15 years. We ended up in the same studio... Calle Dernulf Was that Five Guys and a Dog? Peder Mannerfelt Exactly. It doesn’t have a name anymore. We became friends and wanted to do something together. One good thing is that his technical skills are basically nonexistent. He can barely update his email. No, not quite that bad... So he was in charge of the musical part and I was in charge of the sound. I had bought an analog sequencer. I added pulses that he accompanied with piano. He’s not a pianist. He just knew the basics, so that made it quite simple. It wasn’t about being a virtuoso. Even if the piano is an acoustic instrument you still use it in the same way as a computer by adding notes. We’ve made three, four albums and since then moved away from this. At first we were quite strict about only using synth and piano. But then we moved on from that. We’ve worked with orchestras and such. Our goal has been to... It’s our side project! But we want to go to strange places and end up in fun situations. We’ve been successful with that during the years. Calle Dernulf And booking strange gigs? Peder Mannerfelt Strange gigs, definitely. Our next gig this fall is at the film festival in Wroclaw. Calle Dernulf Didn’t expect that... Peder Mannerfelt We’ve moved this in various directions. Lately we’ve felt a bit tired of ourselves, so instead of making another album we decided to make single tracks with various artists. We’ve worked together for ten years, so we invited a third party. Instead of releasing another album we’ve released any finished song right away on digital format. We’ve made four, five songs like that, and a few more are on the way. Calle Dernulf I find it interesting that the techno that you’ve created is very heavy and electric. It’s very rhythmic, but also quite restrained. It describes a slow and sluggish process, which I find interesting. Peder Mannerfelt Piano is great in that way, it can be both melodic and rhythmic at once. You can strip it down and scale down. Things can play multiple parts, not just melody, but also rhythm and counterpoint rhythms. Our biggest difference is that we don’t hear the same thing at the same place. We hear different rhythms in our heads. It’s really exciting, because we can’t explain it to each other. That makes it very exciting. Calle Dernulf Do you need to have a clear idea before you get started? Peder Mannerfelt No, but it helps. Sometimes I just come up with a silly title that gets me excited. One record is called “Sissel & Bass,” on which my friend Sissel Wincent sings. It’s an old sample from my big brother’s old records, “Bass!” And then a kick at the same time. I had that stuck in my head. I don’t know where the name came from, but that became the title. Just a stupid idea... I have tons of plans that I try to complete but sometimes it comes out of nowhere. In my own productions I like finding vocal samples and then just repeating them. I’m still fascinated by doing that. Using voices in electronic music creates something really special. It works on the dancefloor as well. It’s almost like an instrument, but your mind makes something more of it. This weekend, we played at 140 BPM all night. Once you’ve played heavy techno for a longer period of time and then you suddenly introduce vocals something happens in the minds of the audience. The biggest thing in techno is that women play now too. Ten years ago, no women were allowed to DJ. Today, it’s not possible to have a club event in Europe with an all-male lineup. That has changed the energy level completely. From just having a bunch of dudes fiddling with synthesizers and computers you open up to the rest of the population which gives it a completely different energy level. I was almost fed up with techno a few years ago, but now it’s fun again. Calle Dernulf You’ve also shaken things up and made people react to things. Such as the track called “Toxic Masculinity Has [Got] To Go Away” which is an example of this club culture, but also of male behavior. Peder Mannerfelt What I mean is that it isn’t evident that I should be here. As a white, middle-aged man from the north of Europe I’m already at the top of the pyramid. Why should I take up this space? That’s what it’s all about. As an artist, you claim space. “Look at me! This is my space and territory.” There are different ways to do this. I feel compelled to invite others into this space. It’s easy to only look out for the space that I’ve created for myself. You cling to it like it’s your own fort. New things will keep on coming and they will move things forward. When that happens, instead of being scared you should open up to it. Calle Dernulf We’re going to open the floor to questions. Does anyone have a question? Audience Member Your sub basslines are always up at 60 Hz. Is there a reason for that? Peder Mannerfelt Because it sounds good? Audience Member Nice. Peder Mannerfelt I don’t know. You mean inside this room? Audience Member I’ve just thought about it in general. Peder Mannerfelt The bass is what I always struggle with most. That’s the good thing with working with Pär. He really knows how to add a kick. I’m almost there, when it comes to adding a kick. Working with sub bass is difficult. It depends on what you want to accomplish. A buzzing or something with momentum. In this song, there is something moving it forward. Bass is a genre of its own. Audience Member You mentioned that the record with Blonde Redhead failed. Question one: In what way did it fail? Peder Mannerfelt We simply got a bad review at Pitchfork. “OK, that’s it, we’re done working with this record.” Audience Member Question two: They got a boost when two songs were featured in Rick and Morty. Peder Mannerfelt Really, I didn’t know that! Audience Member I was wondering if you had noticed that? I know that that particular song has been played on Spotify 32 million times. Peder Mannerfelt Great for them! Audience Member So you hadn’t noticed...? Peder Mannerfelt I guess it’s not from the record we did? Audience Member No, I think it’s from Misery... What was the name of the record you did? Peder Mannerfelt It was called Penny Sparkle, also the name of her horse. The title song is about the horse. I love that. A band that has released six or seven albums and has been dropped by a recording company suddenly finds a new audience. That would’ve never happened before. Audience Member What’s your vision regarding the future of techno? Do you think it will become more mainstream than it is today? Will it go the same way as house music? What do you think? Peder Mannerfelt I don’t know... It depends on where you are in the world. It’s in one way in Sweden and in Germany and Holland it’s been mainstream since the ’90s. Techno is almost like dance band music. It has a function. It’s like elevator music for a club, to put it frankly. It’s not like writing a song from your heart. Instead it has a purpose, to make people dance to it. That framework is quite restricted. Techno and house are restricted to 4/4 and a BPM of about 130. The latest thing in techno is a higher BPM. We played at 140 BPM this weekend. A few years ago, you would never go over 130 BPM. In the ’90s, the level was raised to 142 BPM and then it went down again. But now it’s going up once more. There’s a lot of gabber stuff coming now. People jump to the beat. That’s one of the great things. It’s not about moving the vinyl records like you did before. It’s the same with the guitar. You just stand there and move in the same way the entire time. At that time, you had to work in a certain way when doing the mixing. “I know how to mix, I’m so awesome…” That doesn’t matter today. My mom can mix. It’s completely different, and it introduces other kinds of people. I played in Belgrade two weeks ago with a young guy from Croatia. He was just insane. He played gutted soundscape stuff, jungle at 200 BPM and then switched to hip-hop at half the speed... It was insane. That would’ve been impossible a few years back. This is thanks to the CDJs. You can play stuff at the wrong speed and mix it, and make it work. I love it, it’s great. Audience Member Regarding your workflow, do you work in a certain way? Peder Mannerfelt For a long time I worked mostly with synthesizers and hardware but that restricts you to a studio that has all the things that you need in order to make a song. So for the past five years I’ve mostly used my computer and Ableton. I work with lots of samples. I have quite a large library that I can use. Just get those samples in there and get started. Then I might edit that in various ways, but I try to make a loop quite fast and then I can make variations of it in order to turn it into a song. I have to get started quite fast in order to be able to move on. The process can vary quite a lot. But simply put, about four simple loops in Ableton. Does that answer your question? That’s the base for me, and depending on the project you can tweak it after that. I always use the computer for mixing. Using a mixing console only makes it about 2% better. It’s too much of a hassle. It doesn’t make that much of a difference. It’s like, “I have to go to the studio to mix this.” Or I can just do it right now while I’m at the computer anyway. That’s my workflow. Calle Dernulf Over there? Audience Member Maybe it’s a boring question, but I want to know about your work-life balance? Since techno used to be more underground and it involves late nights and lots of travels. When it comes to kids and financial stability, how do you make it work? Where do you make your money from? From the record label, from gigs? Peder Mannerfelt It’s difficult to make it work when you have kids and a family. It’s not just about you. I only make money from gigs. I have to do gigs to make money. Releasing music pretty much breaks even. Gigs pay my monthly salary. Other bonuses might turn up, like when I’m in a TV series. But you can’t depend on that. It’s all about the gigs when it comes to money. It’s a bit tricky to make it work. You also have to take time off during the work week in order to ground yourself. I have many friends in Berlin, and over there they live like this constantly. It’s easy to lose perspective on things. For me, things started to fall into the right place when I had my kids and when things became more structured. Before that I could spend hours making 14-minute songs, “But it’s supposed to be that long!” Today it’s down to three and a half [minutes]. Who wants to listen to a song that’s 14 minutes long? I don’t! Why should I demand that from others? The time limitation is a positive thing for me. I just have to get it done. You can’t afford to sit around contemplating your navel. Calle Dernulf A worthy finish! Great. Peder Mannerfelt You can’t afford that anymore. That’s my plan after this, however... Calle Dernulf Thank you so much, Peder Mannerfelt! Peder Mannerfelt Thank you.

Title: Mykki Blanco

Mykki Blanco
When Mykki Blanco first emerged from New York City in the early 2010s, he was part of a vanguard of artists who would go on to challenge and redefine conversations about gender, identity and politics throughout the decade. The stage name of Michael David Quattlebaum Jr., Blanco evolved out of an interest in performance art, writing and music. With the help of local label UNO NYC, Mykki Blanco became a recording artist, beginning in 2012 with the Mykki Blanco & the Mutant Angels EP. Over the following years Quattlebaum continued to refine the artistic contours of the persona he had created, collaborating with diverse artists from the worlds of music and fashion, while also bringing his private and public selves closer – in effect showing that Blanco’s evolution has also been his own, rather than mere performance. His debut album, Mykki, was released in 2016 followed a period of personal upheaval that led Quattlebaum to relocate to Europe, where he still lives today.
In this public lecture in Lisbon, Quattlebaum looked back on his first decade as a musician, from his beginnings in North Carolina to formative years in the New York City underground and onward to critical acclaim and collaborations, while also sharing insights on navigating the pitfalls of public life as someone with a fluid identity.
Hosted by Anthony Obst I have the pleasure of introducing a groundbreaking and fearless artist sitting next to me here tonight, who also has been calling Lisbon home for a couple of years now. So please join me in welcoming Mykki Blanco. [applause] So Mykki, you said you haven’t listened to that track in a while. It is from your first mixtape Cosmic Angel. It’s called “Mendocino California,” by the way. And you recorded this in 2012 in New York. Can you tell us a little bit about that place at the time, also from the perspective of you sort of being an artist trying to forge a path? Mykki Blanco So, hi guys. Good evening. Thank you. Thank you, Red Bull, for inviting me. This is cool. OK. So in 2012, I had been living in New York City since like 2008. I had dropped out of college twice, and I was basically hustling. I was interning for a lot of artists. I worked at this really cool store that was like half of a skate shop, half of a bookstore. And at the time, I was pretty much trying to figure out a way to become a successful contemporary artist. I had always imagined that I would make things, that I would make sculptures or installations. And what happened once I moved to... Because I had this romantic idea about being a visual artist. And so what happened was that, when I was in New York, I was just so poor all the time that I couldn’t really afford materials. So it’s like... And I also couldn’t afford studio space... So it was like me wanting to be this artist and never having any money to buy paint or anything. And then also, it just wasn’t working. And so I remember I was having this conversation with my mom, and my mom was just like, “You know, honey, I’m not trying to be down on you. I’m not trying to be down on your dreams.” But she was like, “You were always a much better writer than you were...” She was like, “I always liked your writing much more than any of the visual art that I’ve really seen you make. I’m just being honest with you. I’m your mom.” She was like, “You’re just... You’re a much better writer.” And I was kind of resisting that for a while, and then I just... I kind of was like, “You know, maybe I should start writing again.” And so I started writing again a lot, and it was true. Through the writing, I started to create these little narratives and just all of these kind of satellite ideas. And one day, I had the idea for a performance art piece about a girl who was a young black girl in America and she wanted to be... She was a teenager. Well, she was like 18. And she wanted to be a famous female rapper, but she was really rebellious and really radical and basically my own personality traits put into this character. And so that was the birth of Mykki Blanco. So when I started Mykki Blanco, I did not start Mykki Blanco with the intention of being a musical artist. When I would think about the projects that I was making, when I made what you just listened to, which I recorded on my laptop, that wasn’t made to be on Spotify. That was... In my head at that time, that was something that, if you had to walk into a gallery or you walked into a museum one day, you would have heard that playing. And so I just... Everything at that time that I thought of, I thought of in the context of contemporary art. And it wasn’t until I met a guy named Charlie Damga, and Charles had a record label. He was a young guy and he had a record label called UNO NYC. And he had come to some of my shows because I had started performing out as Mykki. And he had come to some of my shows, and one time he stopped me and he was like, “Would you like to have a meeting?” And I was like, “Sure. A meeting about what?” And he said, “Well, whether you know it or not, you’re actually making music.” And I was like, “Oh OK. That’s cool.” And then he was like, “Would you ever consider putting out a release?” And I was like, “A release of what?” And he was like, “Well, what you’re doing is music. You’re creating these songs.” And he was like, “What if you put all of these songs that you’re creating on one record and released it?” And I was like, “OK. That sounds like a great idea. Yeah, let’s try it.” So it was through working with Charles that I started to ever even conceive of what I was doing as music, and it was also through Charles that I started to understand that these ideas that I was having that combined theater and performance art and gender performance, that these were things that could fit under this umbrella of being a musical artist. And this was really like... This was kind of like a really breakthrough moment for me, because I started to perform shows, I started to get paid for these shows, and this was all just… I was just having this conversation with a woman that DJs with me about intention and about how, with a lot of younger artists now who have grown up with social media... How can I put this? You have like a 21-year-old, and I actually know a person who’s like this, someone who’s 21 who had their first release at 18, their second release at 19, and now at 21 they have like two agents and they’re doing it. You know what I mean? They’re literally full-on at the beginning of their career, at 21, and they’re not with a major label. They’re a completely independent artist. But that person has always had the intention of that being... That person obviously wanted to be a musician. They wanted to... Or they wanted to attain some level of fame or notoriety and they understood the blueprint to do that. And so that was their intention and they were able to manifest that. This whole entire thing, this whole entire career that I’ve had, at least in the very nucleus of it, the very beginning of it, was so organic in that I did not have these intentions, and I truthfully did not have them. I had intentions of being a successful, kind of maybe cult contemporary artist, and that was really it. I didn’t think about myself as someone who had the intentions of being a famous musician or of going on world tours or even doing music videos. So when all of this happened or really began to happen, it was... How can I put this? Not to sound weird, but I really come from an underground background, like really underground. So when all of this kind of started to happen, it really shifted my whole entire idea of what was possible for me as a human. Anthony Obst Do we want to play a video that maybe illustrates that a little bit from one of the No Fear performances? Mykki Blanco Oh OK. Yeah. So... OK. So… Anthony Obst Or do you want to say something about it first? Mykki Blanco Well, I was going to say so what you’re about to watch is... So before I had the idea for Mykki Blanco, I had this punk poetry project called No Fear. I had written all these poems and this art gallery had published my poems in this book. And I started to perform the poems with a bassist, and then I would also make these weird crunchy, noisy things. And so, yeah. So I had this project called No Fear, and this was about three years before Mykki Blanco, or two years maybe. Anthony Obst OK. Let’s watch a little bit of that. Bear with me here too... (video: No Fear – “From The Silence of Duchamp To Noise of Boys”) Mykki Blanco Really very noisy. Anthony Obst OK. So this was around 2010, No Fear. So you were performing some of the poems you had written, also as part of this performance? Mykki Blanco Yeah. Those were... What I would do is basically... I had written this poetry book, but it’s like... At the time, I was like who... I had this poetry book, I’m passionate about it, but who reads poetry? So I had the idea to put it to noise music and, yeah, I would perform a majority of the poems like that. Anthony Obst And in terms of... So from what I picked up, someone who kind of inspired you with that also in a way was Patti Smith, of her kind of putting her poems to music. I guess you can also kind of hear a little bit of a Suicide vibe on some of what you were going for. Can you talk a little bit about people who inspired you around then? Mykki Blanco Yeah. I was super... Around this time, I was very inspired by Suicide, definitely inspired by Patti Smith, but more inspired by Suicide. And Suicide were Alan Vega and Martin Rev, and they were basically two weirdos from New York City in the ’70s that started to make this kind of extremely, extremely aggressive noise music that was this comment... It was a lot of things, but really it had a lot to do with this whole anti... It was like anti-disco, anti-punk, proto-punk. They would do stuff like they would take a chain and actually whip their audience with it. You know what I mean? That kind of thing, that kind of agitator stuff. And I just... But they had this music. Their music is really hard and really noisy, but then also there’s something almost doo-wop about some of the songs, like Frankie Teardrop. Also, they used a lot of early synthesizer and stuff like that. So yeah, I was really influenced by this lineage of... The movement is called No Wave, which is these are these bands and these acts that came out of New York City that were pre-punk, pre... Pre-punk. Yeah. I would say proto-punk. Anthony Obst Proto-punk. Mykki Blanco Or no. Or post. No. Really proto. Anthony Obst That was more proto, yeah. Mykki Blanco Proto. Yeah. Anthony Obst So can you also say maybe a few words about the people who you were performing with? Because I think DJ Physical Therapy was also a part of that and maybe… Mykki Blanco Yeah. So at the time, in New York City, my friend Daniel, he was on drums and he has a record label now called Allergy Season. His artist name is DJ Physical Therapy. And then the other person that was with me is another friend of mine who’s a contemporary artist now. His name is Jeffrey Joyal, and he was on bass. And we were like a little thing for a moment. But also, during this time period... See, and this is like... You can never like... You always have to let people in on the truth, not the illusion. So at this time, my mentor was this guy Aaron Bondaroff, and he had a gallery with a guy named Al Moran. The gallery still exists. It’s called... At the time, it was called OHWOW, but now it’s just called Moran, Moran. And anyway, they were a gallery, and they were a new gallery. And they were trying to get all this respect in the art world. And so they would use this publicist in New York City, which is a really huge fashion publicist called Black Frame. And so when I came out with my book with them, it went through their publicity channel. And so if you... Before Mykki Blanco, if you ever just Google my name, Michael David Quattlebaum Jr., I started to kind of get attention as being a young writer and a poet through kind of this whole little media machine that they had going on. And so it would kind of... It would be untruthful to say that, when I began Mykki Blanco, people didn’t already kind of, in New York at least, know who I was. You know what I mean? There was a nucleus there of something happening. I didn’t just come out of nowhere. You know what I mean? These situations are very much so often about who you end up knowing or someone who ends up knowing you way back when. Anthony Obst Yeah. I think that speaks to also just kind of how those scenes were sort of connected, right, and the art forms? And so you mentioned you were doing poetry at that time. You were starting to get into performing music. Were you also still doing performance art and acting sort of around that time? Because I believe that’s sort of where you started in a way also creatively. So maybe… Mykki Blanco Oh, you mean real super, way, way back. Anthony Obst Well, maybe trace that trajectory for us, if that was something you were still kind of doing then when you got to New York. Mykki Blanco OK. So I was doing performance art, but I wasn’t really doing acting anymore. But what he’s basically talking about is... I was a child actor, but not in Hollywood or something. At the time, we lived in North Carolina. So in North Carolina, in this town called Wilmington, there used to be these film studios called Screen Gems. And what was a really big show there? OK. So one of the big TV shows that were filmed at Screen Gems was... Do you all remember hearing about a show called Dawson’s Creek? So Dawson’s Creek was filmed at Screen Gems. A couple of movies were. So there… And anyway, so I was a part of this thing in my hometown in Raleigh called Kids on Broadway. And we were basically little drama freaks, and we were doing musicals and all this stuff. And I remember one of the girls in our group ended up getting an agent and she was in a CBS movie, and I was just like, “Well, I want an agent too.” I always make jokes with my mom because usually in these situations the parents are really pushing the kids, and it was the complete opposite. I would get the newspaper like I was some 30-year-old out of work actor and I was like 12 years old. I would get the newspaper... I would search the newspaper for auditions. And then if I saw something that was for kids, I would circle it and ask my mom, “Mommy, can you take me?” And so she would. If she had the time, if she wasn’t working, if it was the weekend, she would. And so yeah, I was a kid actor. And I think one of the biggest things... One of the two biggest things I did was this off-Broadway play about Eleanor Roosevelt, and then the other thing was I was in this... I was like a... What do they call it? A stand-in. So there was this main kid who was the kid actor and I was the stand-in. But the other biggest thing I did was I was in this Oprah Winfrey television movie called The Wedding, and it starred Halle Berry and a couple of other... Lynn Whitfield, a couple of other really notable black American actors, and it was filmed in North Carolina. And... Oh, you’re about to show that. Anthony Obst I’m about to show it. Mykki Blanco About to show the photo. So this is from my child actor days. But this is... I guess it’s really telling because it’s like I did always... I have always liked performing. You know what I mean? I’ve always liked performing. And even when I was kind of on this trip about really wanting to be a contemporary artist, there was still this element of performance. I just never would have thought, though, that... Because really also, another dimension of what ended up happening with Mykki Blanco was that this idea for Mykki Blanco ended up really transforming at the time my gender identity. And I guess we can... I don’t know if we’ll segue into that, but it became so much more than just an idea. And it really... If I really want to be meditative and reflective about it, it was as if the idea really was something within my subconscious that was coming, that was being birthed that was always there. Anthony Obst So at what time did... What was that moment? Mykki Blanco So it happened... It really happened like this. Is this sounding too close or too muffled or... I’m trying to like... Is that okay? It’s okay? OK. So it really happened like this. I think when I was younger maybe people considered me okay-looking and an attractive child. And then I remember once I came out of the closet there was... As a teenager, there’s all this awkwardness about your sexuality and your looks and what people think of you and... But I kind of... I was able to... I think I had... Let me see. I had about three boyfriends as a teenager. And then I went to college and it was this weird thing where college was this very isolating experience where... For some reason, I went to college for the first time in the Midwest. And this was in 2005. And I just remember coming from California there, and people would point at me on the street. This was before you can... Honestly, this is before people were wearing skinny jeans. So if you wore skinny jeans, people would point at you and be like, “What are you...?” And people who are... I’m 33, so people who are around my age know exactly what I’m talking about. But when I was there in Chicago, people would point at me and scream at me and yell nasty things at me. And so my self-esteem went way down and I started to feel really unattractive and ugly. And so... And just really not good about myself. And so when I moved to New York, that kind of shifted again where I started to feel more comfortable. For the first time, I had a really diverse range of gay and trans and lesbian friends. And so with Mykki Blanco, Mykki Blanco really did begin as this conceptual art idea. Then, what happened was the more... Because I would... Basically, I would dress up in drag for the first time. I’d never done it before. I was 25. I would dress up in drag and I would create these videos as Mykki, rapping or almost vlogging in this kind of... In my mind, it was almost a Cindy Sherman kind of thing, but I was talking to the camera, making these diaries. And what would happen is that I would get into drag and I would... First of all, I would look dramatically different. But then I would start to feel different. But everything was happening inside the apartment. I was never leaving the house. And I started to get people having... I started to have people complimenting how I would look on the internet and being just like, “Ah, ha ha. I didn’t know you could look like this. Oh my god. You’re so pretty as a girl,” dah, dah, dah, dah. And then one day, I’ll never forget, I just was like, “I’m going to go somewhere as Mykki Blanco. I’m going to leave the house in drag for the first time.” And so I took about three hours to do my makeup and get myself together, and I left the house for the first time in drag. And I will never forget that feeling of feeling, first of all, the way that the public reacted, but then in myself this confidence and this... I don’t know. It honestly felt... Almost felt spiritual really, because it was as if I had entered another dimension. All of a sudden, without me realizing it, my mannerisms were changing. And I started to go out more and more in drag. And then it became less about it being drag, and then I was just dressing up. And no one was really... Well, I shouldn’t say no one. But my close friends weren’t really questioning me about it. People were... If anything, I was more being encouraged by my friends, but no one was really asking me, “Oh, are you transgender now?” or, “Oh, are you changing your gender?” or, “Oh...” And also, I wasn’t necessarily... I wasn’t telling people not to call me he. I wasn’t saying, “Oh, you can’t call me Michael.” It was just like, “I am now...” It was just like, “I am now fully made up, and this is how I feel comfortable.” And it also wasn’t... It was something that I was doing a lot. I would probably say probably four times out of a seven-day week I was dressing up, but I was dressing up every single day. At one point, I was dressing up every single day. But it was like, it’s like you go through your... It’s like... How can I put this? As a boy, and especially as a little black boy, you can go through life having people tell you like, “Oh Michael, he’s a handsome young guy,” or something like that. But when someone calls you pretty for the first time, and not even calls you pretty, but for the first time you feel pretty, that’s a very different feeling. It’s a very different feeling than feeling handsome. It’s a very different feeling than, I don’t know, feeling just okay. Or I don’t know. You just... There’s something that happens to you when you feel pretty. And I began to explore that feeling more. And then, yeah. And then what really happened was that Mykki became not just this performance art persona or this character. I really came full circle to realize that Mykki was always me. It was always the way more feminized side of my personality, and that really this idea for this character was really a part of myself really being birthed for the first time. Anthony Obst I’d like to play a video, one of your early videos as Mykki Blanco, “Join My Militia.” Mykki Blanco Oh OK. Yeah. And you know what? Well, you know what? I have a question. Can we play the poetry video first and then “Join My Militia?” Anthony Obst Let’s do that. Mykki Blanco Because, I want to play the poetry video first because this really shows the link between before I was rapping and when I was still just reciting poetry and when I was becoming Mykki Blanco. And the “Join My Militia” video, I want to talk about that after, because that video was a rejection of what this was, and that’s also important to talk about. So I’m not even going by Mykki Blanco here. Interesting. And also, wait. Pause it really quickly. Pause it. So this is interesting. So look at that. Look how un-PC that is, FADER calling me, “Cross-dresser poet extraordinaire.” Anyway, so also... Well, no. Well, because this is also really important, and this is really important when you talk about me because even though I stand behind a lot of the things that I’ve done that I know that people feel are radical and that I know that people may have felt are pioneering, I’m also someone who has benefited from really being and making work at the right place, at the right time, and the right context, and then going for it because the fact that this is 2011, and FADER is calling me, “Cross-dresser poet extraordinaire,” that shows you that the acceleration point for how our culture talks about queer people and the LGBT has changed so dramatically in just seven years, or six years. While I’m a part of that zeitgeist, I think people are already forgetting that all of this is still so new in the public sphere, in the public dialogue. So, let’s go. (video: Mykki Blanco – “Austin Texas”) Really, what started to happen also at this time was that... This always happens, not always, but this can happen a lot within the culture industry and especially the fashion industry, where sometimes some of the most subversive or political ideologies will get picked up by the fashion industry first just for the sheer fact that of the speed that industry moves at, and the fact that that industry always needs an aesthetic, an ideology to kind of keep itself regurgitating, like this big giant chimera. In New York, the fashion industry really kind of accepted me first before the world of music, because yeah it kind of just happened. I remember I did a video like this, and I did some other things. All of a sudden, this little black boy from North Carolina and California, I was doing, even though this is quite controversial now, at the time it wasn’t as much of, is doing photo shoots with Terry Richardson. I was doing ad campaigns. I remember I co-hosted this party with Chloë Sevigny. I was just like, “Oh my god, I guess I’m an It Girl now. I’m an It Girl.” For a few months, I guess I was an It Girl. But, this is what’s important though, I was quickly realizing that people were not understanding the context of what I was doing. It’s like you have people really not understanding that I was trans, but me also not really understanding that I was trans, and kind of not fully identifying as trans. Then you also have this lineage of drag being comedy. Before me, I think, and I’m not talking of all of history, but I’m talking about just in hip-hop, I think before me, the only person that you had rapping was this artist named Cazwell, and he’s a white guy, and the raps were really always really funny. They were really, really kind of tacky, cheesy, funny humor. That’s no offense to him. It’s true, I mean one of his most famous songs I think is, “I Saw Beyoncé at Burger King.” So, it was this kind of really, really high camp thing. That was not at all what I was doing. I remember telling my manager, Charles, because now I had a manager, I remember telling Charles, “You know what? I have to show people many different sides of Mykki Blanco, because if I keep doing this fashion stuff people are going to think that this is just another topical drag queen that just wants to be pretty all the time, and that’s what this is about. People are going to think this is a joke. People are not going to understand.” So, I created this idea of Mykki Blanco being a mutant, which was also a metaphor for being gender nonconforming. One of the first producers that I ever, and this is also... Yeah, some of this stuff sounds really mythological when I talk about it, but then I understand why people want to listen to it. One of the first producers I ever worked with was Arca when he was a freshman at NYU. I’m sorry, when she was a freshman at NYU. It’s this song that we made called “Join My Militia.” When it came time to conceptualize the video, I said, “I don’t want to do this video. No false eyelashes. No red lipstick. We’re not going to make this pretty. I want this to be horrorcore,” which horrorcore was this genre of ’90s hip-hop, that rap was like goth. It was like death and really hard stuff. I could name off the artists, but I’m not… Just Google horrorcore. Anyway… Anthony Obst The song, you already had the song at that time? It was just about the video? Or did the song come… Mykki Blanco Well, I was… Anthony Obst With that in mind as well? Mykki Blanco OK, so I was influenced by horrorcore, but really the video I think takes on that element. I remember when we were making the idea for this video, I told the director, “I want this to feel like The Simple Life entered The Blair Witch Project.” That’s kind of how this moment happened. Even the lyrics, “Mykki digital, sound wave oasis. Myk has got the itis. Hit ‘em with a basic. Make it so good a n---- wanna try and taste it. Straitjacket the beat, though it gets away in places. This right here, Joe, is Blanco voodoo. It’s black magic music. N----, blanco hoodoo. They kept me in this holding cell for close to eight days. They can keep me here forever ‘cause my story won’t change. His name Hassan Abul. Weight 170, height 6’2”. Size 12 shoe, black hair, brown eyes. The warmest smile, but so coldblooded inside. Who am I to judge him? I hate him but I love him. Insha’Allah he whispered, Ma’a Salama I whimpered. Damn. I didn’t know my man was in the Taliban. T-T-Taliban.” [applause] And so that was my very first music video, and yeah, I was like I wanted people to know that this was not what you... If you thought this was going to be some rapping drag queen to make you laugh, this is not what that’s about. You know what’s funny? It’s in the title of the song, but I forgot. The most important lines in that whole entire song is, “Nas gave me a perm. He said you’ve got the hidden gift, kid. Lead them, they’ll learn.” I remember, that had so much to do with this feeling, when I wrote this song, this feeling of, “What am I getting myself into?” People were already just so homophobic and mean to me from walking from the corner store to my apartment. So, yeah. It was, “Nas gave me a perm. He said you’ve got the hidden gift, kid. Lead them, they’ll learn.” Yeah, it kind of set the tone. Really, this video also helped things a lot. I remember Björk put this video on her website. This video freaked a lot of people out. Anthony Obst Well, I guess also the Nas reference in a sense. I mean, Nas kind of is this very sort of technical, lyrical rapper in a way, right? From that sort of standpoint, I guess it also signals your claim also in a sense to make a dope rap record. I’m wondering also in a sense, because you’re also rapping very well on one of your first rap records. I’m wondering did that sort of progression in a sense, come natural for you in terms of from writing poetry, to performing poetry over music, to performing poetry as music in the form of rap? Mykki Blanco I think so. I think I probably would not have been... If I hadn’t started with that No Fear screaming stuff, and then started doing the spoken word stuff, and then having that come after, I think that has everything to do with it. That’s why I said, when you talk about intention, I wasn’t like some kid that wanted to be a rapper, or even a teenager that wanted to be a rapper, or even a 21-year-old that wanted to be a rapper. I was already almost 26 there. I was just exploring stuff. Anthony Obst Did that, in a sense, feel like you had hit on something basically with that record, or with the mixtape, Cosmic Angel, in general? Mykki Blanco Yeah, but the moment that... I’m going to be honest. The two moments that shifted my intention from this just being this underground art thing, to oh wait a minute, maybe I could actually have aspirations of being like a Bowie or a Lou Reed… When I really started to think about myself as a musical artist, was “Wavvy” and “Haze.Boogie.Life.” “Haze.Boogie.Life” is the first time I really felt like I am a rapper. That song. That song in that moment. “Wavvy” was an interesting thing, because that song was popular on the internet for a few months, and then since all this fashion stuff, and then a woman who was a writer for Italian Vogue befriended me. Her name was Stefania Pia. We did a video together which was just her interviewing me. She was a writer for Italian Vogue. The editor, she’s passed away now, but the editor of Italian Vogue was a woman named Franca Sozzani. Franca Sozzani’s son is a man named Francesco Carrozzini. Francesco Carrozzini saw that video, heard the song. So, Francesco is a director, but at the time he was only doing fashion stuff. They come from this fashion dynasty family, but he really at that time wanted to be doing music videos for major labels. I don’t think he was able to get his foot in the door, even though he had this huge fashion background, because like most things in life, you have to have the portfolio first. So, I don’t think... He just didn’t have a music video portfolio, that was that. In a turn of events that completely transformed my entire career, Francesco met with me, heard the song. We met like two or three times, and then he was like, “I want to offer you... I want to completely direct this music video for you, for free. Completely for free for this song. This song is doing well on the internet, but I think if we do this video, it could blow you into another stratosphere.” Like I said, at the time I was folding t-shirts. Seriously, I was folding t-shirts. I had entered this weird phase where I was performing enough to where I could survive, and where I didn’t have to have a full-time job, but also where like if I wanted a full-time job I couldn’t really meet the schedule of performing. It was a very intense struggle period, where literally sometimes it would be like, “Do I have money for the subway, or money to eat?” Stuff like that. Francesco does this video for me, and I remember, I’ll never forget him saying this to me. He was like, because he did pull in a lot of favors. He was like... Oh, and this is the other thing, until this day, I don’t know how much he spent. He never told me how much he really spent on the video. But he was like, “People are going to think I spent millions on this video. This is video is going to make you a star, but I didn’t spend millions.” That was the “Wavvy” video, yeah. Anthony Obst One thing also you’ve mentioned in the past was kind of that you also weren’t necessarily looking for acceptance in the hip-hop community, whatever that sort of might mean in this day and age, but that you had kind of teenage fans on Tumblr who were getting all your references in a way, right? Can you elaborate a little bit on why that is important to you? Mykki Blanco Yeah, I can. We had an idea that there might be some haters, but when I started out there was a lot of haters. I don’t need to backpedal and name names, and name websites, and name writers, or name people now who are just like, “Oh yeah, Mykki, yay.” But back then, I remember certain people, certain websites, certain editors were afraid of posting my videos or my songs, because they felt like it would alienate their audience. I remember playing festivals where musical acts like the Flatbush Zombies were literally... I was literally on stage performing and they were on the ground calling me a faggot from the audience. Like, literally screaming at me. Yeah, I don’t like them. You know what? There was always also, always this thing of having to co-opt something. I remember I did the South by Southwest event with Ray Ban. It was all these rappers, and it was always... People would literally stop talking when I entered the room. I’m not over exaggerating. This is real sh-t. It was really nasty. I remember A-Trak invited me to do Fool’s Gold, and I nearly got booed off stage. I literally nearly got booed off stage. It was such a f---ed-up time. It’s just so funny to me because now all of these young little rappers are walking around with Louis Vuitton purses and stuff. But you know what I mean, it’s just like in that short span of time y’all, people have changed in a lot of ways as far as what they see as palatable and tolerable in this culture, in these mini cultures. What you just said is important, because if it wasn’t for social media, I think my career would have gone two ways. I think in the ’90s if I had been doing this, either I would have skyrocketed to fame because it would have been something that people had never seen before, or no one would have known who I was for my entire career and that’s how it would have been. With social media, what we weren’t realizing, and when I say “we” I mean me and just other queer artists or people that were kind of doing something different in these mid-2000s, 2011, 2012, 2013, I think that we weren’t realizing that these videos and stuff were getting re-blogged and retweeted. This was also before Instagram, so it was this thing of people were now able to feel a sense of agency and where it’s like “Oh, wait a minute, I can relate to that.” Or, “That person is using pronouns in a song that are yeah, I like a ‘her’ too, I’m a ‘her.’ I like a ‘him’ too, if I’m a ‘him.’” Social media enabled me to have a fan base in a way where a lot of people at the time, all of a sudden we didn’t really need the validation of the music industry. For me in particular, it wasn’t as if I was even seeking that validation, but this is what I told my manager. Once I understood the concept of a booking agent, and for people who may not know, when you’re a musician you have your manager who manages you. Then, the person that actually puts you on stage is your booking agent. This person takes offers from people that see you, and they’re like, “Oh, we’d like Mykki Blanco to perform here.” So, a booking agent is very important because... And this is in the last 10 years or so, what I realized is that I could make money and I could be liked, and I could have my own audience, and it didn’t matter if I was being rejected by mainstream hip-hop. It didn’t matter if I was being rejected by hip-hop at all, because if these group of kids in Pittsburgh, and these group of kids in Florida, and these people in Austin, Texas, and these kids in London, and these kids in France, if these people want me to come and play, and they write my booking agent, and they make me an offer, oh wait a minute, I can make money. Wait a minute, I don’t actually need anyone’s validation. Once I understood that... I remember I told my manager. I said, “I want a booking agent on every continent. First of all, I know that I’ll do better in Europe. I would rather not waste my energy trying to become famous in America where gay marriage hasn’t even passed. It’s like getting nearly booed off stage festivals, I was like, “F--- this.” Because I played my first show in Europe. I think it was 2011 I played my first show in Europe. The response... I was just like, “Oh sh-t, I found my people.” Do you know what I mean? Just the history of avant-garde artists being accepted in Europe goes back, as far back as people like James Baldwin, and Zora Neale Hurston, the Harlem Renaissance, and that whole lineage of... Or Josephine Baker, you know what I mean? You have people who were misunderstood, especially people of color, in the states who went to Europe and f---ing became rich and famous, and happy. I was just like, “I don’t have to do this.” This was a big deal because it enabled me to all of a sudden see a future for myself as a musician, and at this time man, it really did feel like the Wild Wild West because it was just like, “Oh sh-t, yo you may not want to recognize…” Because they were labeling me and Le1f, and Big Freedia is a bounce artist, but they were labeling all of us “queer rap.” Even that title at the time was really derogatory, not because we were not queer artists making rap, but because without even listening to what the songs were about, or what we were really trying to communicate, they were just slapping “gay” on it, “This is gay. Go on, go ahead.” Do you know what I mean? It’s really embarrassing to think about now. Just evidenced by the title, that FADER piece, cross-dresser extraordinaire, it’s like people really have to understand that the transgender tipping point, gay marriage, all of this zeitgeist, all of these conversations that used to only be had in academic circles on college campuses, that have now entered the mainstream because of these moments, this was all so alien just like six and half years ago. People were really f---ing cruel. They’re still cruel, but it’s like I was really playing with a whole different set of folks. When I say “folks” I mean society. Anthony Obst We can go back to your relationship with Europe and… Mykki Blanco Can I just have a Red Bull? Anthony Obst I’m sure someone would love to bring you one. Go back to your relationship with Europe, and also you mentioned Baldwin. We can get to that in a minute, but I also wanted to maybe play something to maybe also illustrate sort of a musical shift for you. We’re jumping ahead a little bit in time, but I think that kind of fits what you were talking about just now. Do you want to listen to a “A Moment With Kathleen?” Mykki Blanco Oh, OK. Yeah, we can listen to that. What you’re about to hear is... So, I used to... Like I said, only until my very first album, which came out in 2016, did I stop making what I would consider “concept” stuff. I’ll explain why that is to you, but basically Cosmic Angel, the first mixtape, Betty Rubble, the second mixtape, and then Gay Dog Food, the third mixtape, all were super heavily conceptual ideas. With Gay Dog Food, this mixtape that this song is from, my idea was I wanted to make a grunge rap... I wanted to make a feminist grunge rap album. One of the people that was most influential to me when I was 15 and 16 years old, is a musician, is a woman named Kathleen Hanna, who was in a famous band called Bikini Kill, then later in a band called Le Tigre. She is one of the front runners of a feminist movement of music called Riot Grrrl. It was the first genre of music where I ever even heard the word “queer”, where I ever heard songs that were talking about lesbianism, and about being gay, but in this really cool way. It wasn’t even really that literal. Anyway, I had the chance, it was like a dream of mine, to work with Kathleen. She doesn’t make that much music anymore because she has lupus, I believe. There’s a whole documentary about it. I’m not spilling any tea. She’s an amazing artist, but she doesn’t record that much anymore. Anyway, we recorded this song together, and yeah this is like me recording with one of my idols. This is someone who, when I was a teenager, I was for the first time identifying as a feminist and reading about anarchical feminism, and cyber feminism, and all of these really esoteric things that most teens, many teens nowadays, many teens did then but didn’t feel like there were that many of us. Anthony Obst OK, let’s listen to “A Moment With Kathleen.” Mykki Blanco And it’s produced by Gobi, who was my roommate, who was a really awesome electronic producer still making these… (music: Mykki Blanco ft. Kathleen Hanna – “A Moment With Kathleen” / applause) And know what’s funny? Kathleen would affect in a lot of the Bikini Kill and Le Tigre songs. Kathleen would affect this valley girl voice. I remember someone commented to me shortly after this came out, they were like, “Do you even realize that’s what you were doing at the start of the song? You literally sound like Kathleen Hanna. You’re referencing Kathleen Hanna,” and I wasn’t even realizing I was referencing Kathleen Hanna. But yeah, anyway but yeah. Yeah. Anthony Obst The reason why I also wanted to play that song here was just to also just kind of illustrate a little bit of the sort of musical trajectory that you were then embarking on, sort of maybe away from more straight-forward rap tropes than what you were doing before. I am wondering also about whether you feel yourself gravitating towards any particular sound or maybe it’s a form of delivery, or whatever it is, or whether you also find yourself gravitating towards exactly that sort of idea of shape-shifting, of not being able to be pinned down in a sense musically. Mykki Blanco In the beginning and especially after Cosmic Angel, because as much as I love my first mixtape, Cosmic Angel, it has its moments of songs. I think the whole thing has like three songs that I would consider produced well, and that are actually good songs. The rest of it is just really like [makes noise]. With Betty Rubble, things got better, but it was like Cosmic Angel was me being this messy performance artist. Honestly, my manager helping me put all these desperate parts into a mixtape. Betty Rubble: The Initiation, which was my second mixtape, was me having this idea of what would an acid house, goth, hip-hop record sound like? On that record, it’s really minimal production. It’s a lot of rap-rapping, almost in an old school way, almost in a Nas and a Tribe kind of way. Really, like Method Man... I think for that record, Ghostface, Method Man, Nas were huge aspirations. Then on the other side of it was my Thrill Kill Kult, Nine Inch Nails. Then with Gay Dog Food, like I said, this feminist grunge record. That’s what I mean. Sometimes I look back and I’m like, if I had been more careerist, maybe I... I mean, I feel like just right now I’m about to enter kind of like the Hollywood phase of my career, which is also an interesting thing that’s happening right now. I always think... I didn’t think about stuff like that. If I wanted a banger, I’d be like, “I want to make a banger.” But, it was always from this angle of, “Oh, I have this idea. I should do this.” I think that’s what I mean. I think the confidence from that, yes it was me being punk, and me having these ideas and just wanting to explore them, but after I started to do these shows around the world and make money, it was like, “Well I don’t have to make a commercial-sounding song that has to somehow end up on the radio to f---ing buy f---ing designer shoes if I want.” I mean, this is my thinking at the time. It’s like, “Oh wait a minute, I can actually do what the f--- I want and get paid.” That’s a really empowering feeling, when you really feel that for the first time. I think yeah, it’s like... I mean, most of us know what it feels like to all of a sudden have a moment where we’re like, “OK. I may not be rich, but I can take care of myself.” It’s such a grounding moment, and it’s such a... That moment alone, of some kind of security, should let fireworks off in your head or should allow you to feel as if like, “OK. Let’s keep going for it,” or whatever you’re doing that works. I was like, “OK. Me being myself is working. Let me just continue to do whatever the hell I want creatively.” I was also... Come on, I wasn’t like mature at all. There was no maturity there. I was literally like running wild. But I think that’s really cool, because I often think like, “Wow. Even though I’m pretty okay with myself, what if I was younger now and there was Instagram, and all of a sudden I could look at this many different people doing things?” It’s like, “Would I be a little succubus?” Not even little succubus, but it’s like, “Would it be harder to find my own identity, because there are so many attractive identities to choose from?” That’s, I think, one of the downfalls, sadly, of social media generation is where a lot of people can identify with something, and they can find their tribe. Also a lot of this is just psychologically natural to being young. You’re going to try on different things. You’re going to try on different phases. But creatively, it is this thing of just like, “Well, look at this person. Look how attractive they’re doing this thing. What if I just sprinkled a little bit of that on me?” I’m so glad that I didn’t start this with that being something that I could do... You know what I mean? In that way. Anthony Obst Not too long after Gay Dog Food, though, so Gay Dog Food came out in 2014. In 2015 you, for a brief moment, announced that you were going to be quitting music. Can you tell us a little bit about that time in your life? Mykki Blanco I can. Around the time that “Wavvy” came out, I found out that I was HIV positive. I was like, “Holy sh-t. I just have this crazy music video that came out. They’re giving me all this praise. I’m actually about to start having a musical career.” And then you... How can I put this? I was always someone who... Yeah, it’s true. I used to get tested a lot. It was almost like a neurosis. I mean, I was having sex. I was being like, young gay boy in New York City, but I used to get tested a lot. I think, also, it was like this fear. So one day I went to go get tested, and I was positive. I was just like, “Holy sh-t,” so I was like, “OK. Well, this can’t become public knowledge.” So it became something that was kept very dear with close friends. It was really interesting. I actually, when I was negative, like months before, dated, and this person is not the person that I contracted HIV from. But I tell this story because it’s, honestly, a really spiritual thing. Months before I became positive, I actually dated a person who was positive when I was negative, who was like really close to my age. That experience alone, I think, saved my life. Because I remember knowing, and I remember being educated enough in where the whole conversation around HIV was at. I knew that if you got HIV... What was this, 2011, that you would be okay, that you weren’t going to die. I mean, I didn’t know about specific medications or this or that, but I knew you weren’t going to die. I’m, obviously, not going to say his name, but when me and this guy started dating, that’s one of the first things that he told me, and I was just like, “Oh, wow. How did this happen to you? You’re so young.” He had his own story. We dated for like six months. It was like he was super healthy. I watched him take his medication every day. It’s like that did not have... And I remember him telling me... Because I was one of the first people that he dated after he had become positive. And I remember him saying to me, “The way that you treat me so normally.” I mean, tears, obviously. He’s just like, “I just never thought that someone would treat me this way knowing this about me.” So fast forward to my situation, and I’m just like, “Oh, my god.” I mean, obviously, way more tears. I tell him. I tell my mom. My god, it was just like... Obviously, parents, they just want to protect you. She’s like, “Well, no one can know.” So it had been something that was just in my private life. Thinking about it and thinking about celebrity culture and this and that and, honestly, just humanity, I guess really if I had not wanted to not tell the public ever, I guess that would have been my right, right? That would have been okay, right? That would have been my right. I mean, I’m sure we have a lot of people, especially some people that were maybe famous in the ’70s and ’80s, who are positive, and we don’t know, and it’s their privacy. They’re of a different generation, and that’s fine. But for me, what was starting to happen was that I’d make out with a guy, and then I’d be like, “Oh, yeah. I’m positive. Please don’t tell anyone.” Or a hookup would happen, and there would have to be that conversation before we hookup where I’m like, “I’m positive. Please don’t tell anyone.” Now this had been going on for a while. This like, “Please don’t tell anyone. Please don’t tell anyone. Please don’t tell anyone. Please don’t tell anyone.” Friends come over. I’m putting my medication in the hamper, hiding my medication behind the pasta in the back of the kitchen. So what happens when a person starts to behave like this? It almost becomes like a shadow self. At the time, I also had this logic, “Well, if I’m positive, then I should only probably date or be with other positive people.” One of the only ways I remember that I could meet other guys not being out about being positive was through like a hookup app like Grindr. Anyone who is gay or identifies as gay or anyone who really actually even... You don’t have to be gay... But who uses Grindr knows that that app is full of f---ing drugs. That app is kind of full of some dark sh-t if you get into it. So it’s like I was meeting... And this also goes back to this whole... I mean, we can have a whole other lecture about homosexuality, and stigma, and shame, and why people do things in the dark, and why people only meet up at three in the morning. We could have a whole entire whole lecture about that. But I was living a shadow life, and I was like... And you know what was happening also? I wasn’t stupid. I would go to San Francisco. I was in New York. I knew that there were men that were positive that were healthy. Men that were in normal relationships. Men that were walking down the street and wrapped up in a cardigan, drinking cocoa, that were positive, with their golden retriever. So I knew that these things existed. I knew that it wasn’t a death sentence. I knew that I could have this lifestyle. I didn’t think I could have it and be famous. I didn’t think I could have it and have a career in the industry. So that post... Well, no. That post where I was like, “I’m going to stop doing music. I’m going to become an investigative journalist,” was, first of all, I was always interested in investigative journalism. Then, two, because I really thought, “You know what? If I’m going to be open about being positive, there’s no way I can have a career in music. I will be completely rejected. There’s no way I can be an artist anymore, and I have to make plans for myself.” That’s another thing. I’ve always been really... You know how they say some people live in the past, and it’s not good? One of the things about my personality, which I always have to center myself, is I live a lot in the future. I think a lot about the future. My boyfriend and I are always talking about this. Anyway. So I was like, “OK. I can’t be an artist anymore.” That post, I was in such a depression, and I was in such a self-hatred. I made that post, and then a few months later, the next post that I made on Facebook... I forget. You can Google it. On Facebook, I’ll never forget, a friend of mine... His name is Shawn, but his artist name is Yves Tumor. Before he was Yves Tumor, he was Teams. We were in Los Angeles, and he was throwing this... He was always really good at throwing these crazy cool parties. So he was throwing this party, and I was supposed to be arranging the afterparty. I had been touring, and I used to spend my money in really, really, really not good ways. Well, actually, that’s debatable. I had gotten this hotel suite at the Chateau Marmont, which is this like celebrity chi-chi hotel in LA. This is where we were going to have the afters. I remember, actually, I was so invested in this whole entire thing that I didn’t even go to the party. I was like decorating this f---ing suite. Because I like hosting dinner parties, and stuff, whatever... Anyway. People were supposed to come over, and my medication was there, and I forgot or something. I forgot or, honestly, maybe I was drunk. I had forgotten the medication was somewhere out. People were literally like... When I discovered that the medication was there, like out, people were like walking or maybe they were outside and couldn’t get in or in the lobby. I like panicked and didn’t know where to put the medication. I think I put it under the mattress or something like that. But it was like this heightened sense of panic of like, “Where am I going to put the medication?” I remember after they left. I remember I took out the medication. I remember thinking like, “You can’t live like this?” You know what I mean? Like, “This isn’t a life. And it’s so unreflective of who you are 22 hours out of most days.” So I got on Facebook, and I was just like, “I have been HIV positive since 2011, my entire career.” And actually I don’t even know what the rest of the quote was, but I just put it on Facebook, and boy, that took off. You want to talk about likes. That post, Time magazine wrote about it. Time magazine hasn’t written about me since, and they hadn’t written about me before, but they wrote about that. What I didn’t realize is, I didn’t realize that I’m one of the first people to ever do that in that way with my platform. I also realize that I think I’m one of the only slight musicians... Besides like Eazy-E who died in the hospital and who never actually came out about it. We found out, I think, after he died. Or maybe he did on his deathbed. I don’t want to misconstrue that story. RIP Eazy-E. But, basically, I realized that the way in which I did that sh-t hadn’t been done in that way, and I wasn’t even thinking about it like that. I was thinking that I was going to wake up on Monday morning, and my manager and everybody is going to be like, “Oh, we can’t really work with you.” I mean, what example did I have? I had Magic [Johnson]... Everyone that I knew that had publicly come out as being HIV positive was publicly shunned. I mean, and we all know this is also true. So it’s like what example did I have of anyone being positive? And even though I knew people were happy and healthy in the real world, these weren’t the celebrities that we enjoy and whose work that we digest, you know? Anthony Obst Exactly. So in a sense, we were... You were talking about that you also wanted to quit music at that time. In 2016, you released your album Mykki. I would like to play a video from that album, because I think it also illustrates, maybe, a new way for you to incorporate also more sort of political messages also into your work. Mykki Blanco Well, before, because... OK. Before you show that video, I just want to quickly say that... Basically after I came out like I was positive, I thought like, “Oh, my god. The world’s going to be over.” So there was probably like a seven- or eight-month long media cycle where every time someone would write about me, they would f---ing write about me being positive. I was just like, “OK. Well, my career’s not over, but just like f---. I mean, how many times are they going to always include like...” So it went from being queer rapper or gay rapper to HIV positive rapper, Mykki Blanco. I think I made some post that was like, “You writers that are doing that, do you realize that every time you do that, you’re just re-stigmatizing me? Do you realize that every time you do that, you’re just basically reinforcing the stereotype of otherness? So if someone reads an article about me, if you’re going to put that as the first line they’re reading, the person’s going to already have some idea in their head before they even know what the f--- the song or the video is about.” So just really quickly, that moment was important, because I thought everything was over. Everything wasn’t over. I never realized that people could be so compassionate, that people could really kind of lift me back up. One of the people that lifted me back up was the producer Woodkid. He was just like, “You’re not going to quit music. You’re going to come to Paris, and we’re going to work on music together.” That moment is what led to the nucleus of my first album. Also, right after I announced, I started working with this electronic label called !K7, because my career had entered this weird phase where it wasn’t stalling. But before I had come out as HIV positive, I had had a meeting with XL Records, and they were like, “Oh, we love what you’re doing. But you’re already pretty much a developed artist, and we can’t really develop you.” I had had a meeting with Capitol Records that was just like, “Oh, you’re doing really cool stuff. Send us more music.” So it was time for me to kind of align myself and a way to get larger exposure, but it just wasn’t happening. Then this relationship with !K7 happened, and they were super supportive. They allowed me to start Dogfood Music, which is my own label. Yeah. Yeah. Then we had the album, which is kind of the first time I ever made music that was not conceptual. When I made my album, the first album, Mykki, that was out in 2016, I was like, “For the first time, this isn’t going to be a concept. You’re going to make songs about you. You’re going to make songs about your lived experience. This isn’t going to be through the guise of anything other than who you are and what you’ve done, and all that stuff.” Anthony Obst OK. Let’s watch “High School Never Ends,” a video from that. Mykki Blanco And this was directed by Matt Lambert. Just really quickly, whenever I do a video, I always think to myself a lot of things. But one of the things that I think is, “As a queer person, what have I never seen other queer people do?” So the idea for this video was initially born out of this idea that I had with Matt, which is, “I’ve never seen a queer anarchist. Let’s make a video about queer anarchists.” So that’s always where my brain goes at first. Yeah, we can watch the video. (video: Mykki Blanco – “High School Never Ends” / applause) Anthony Obst Can you tell us a little bit about what that video represents to you? Also, in a sense, what it meant for you as an artist when you were making that? Mykki Blanco Yeah. So at the end of it, at the very end scene, I remember there’s this thing that you can use that they can induce tears. It’s called a tear stick, and it’s like this mentholated stick. I remember telling Matt, the director, I was like, “Matt, I don’t think I need a tear stick. I think I could really do it,” and I started crying. It’s one thing to be in the moment, but I remember thinking about... I get emotional now, but I remember thinking about there’s... You think about all of those times where you... Because you start this, and you may start it not wanting to be some big celebrity, or something, but once you see your potential or once you see like, “OK. Perhaps this could really be... My dream could come true,” you want it. You start to yearn for it. I think that what this video, to me, represents so much of is it’s like when I was 19 and dropping out of college, it’s like I was living in queer punk houses, you know what I mean? Where we would f--king take acid and drink brass monkeys. It was a really romantic period in my life, and I think about all of those times where I wanted to be so much more, but I just didn’t know what I wanted to be yet. You know what I mean? Or where I saw something, where I had a goal, or even like I said, when I thought my whole entire world was going to crash in on me when I admitted that I had been HIV positive and that I was living healthily with HIV. It’s this feeling of like, there’s just this feeling of every time you transcend something, every time you have transcended something, and you continue to transcend something, it’s every time you think the sky is about to fall down on you, it doesn’t. You know what I mean? It’s like you also realize there’s, actually, many worse things that could happen then losing a career or losing this. You know what I mean? For me, if I were to lose my sight, that would break my heart more than anything I’ve experienced living with HIV or, I don’t know, having a close family member die, or all kinds of traumas that can happen. I think that, oftentimes... And it’s natural. We all do this. I still do this, but sometimes you can get so attached to a trauma that you can then allow that trauma to define you. Then when that trauma defines you, you build a story about yourself and about your life. Unfortunately, sometimes it can be a victim story. When you start to believe that victim story, that victim story can start to create behaviors or you can make excuses, or, “I am this way because of my trauma,” and, “You have to accept me being rude,” or, “You have to accept that I’m flaky,” or, “You have to accept that I can’t get to work on time, or that I crumble every time I watch this commercial, or that my f---ed up relationship with my father has to characterize every single aspect of my life.” But you become a prisoner of yourself when those things happen. And it’s really natural. It’s a really human thing to do. But when you can catch it, and when you can transcend it, and that transcendence can then become a reminder. It’s like every time you can, even in the most minutia of your thoughts ... It’s like this year, I decided to delay my album. I decided to delay my album, and I was like, “You know what? I should probably focus on my sobriety more and certain things that I felt like were starting to get really shaky again.” I got depressed for a while, because I thought to myself, “Why can’t I be different? Why can’t I be better? Why can’t I be one of these people to not have these problems and just have my life go forward?” But it’s like, “No.” It’s like, “You know what? This is something that I need to transcend and that probably will be something I continually have to transcend, and that’s okay.” So for me to see this video I think, overall, for me... It’s like this video, for me and a lot of the overarching things and what I do, is it’s just like from the very beginning, people really second-guessed me. It didn’t matter if I was super talented. It didn’t matter what I had done. Because it was so taboo, there was always this thing of being second-guessed, and I transcended that, and I’m still transcending that. Like I said, even to be doing this talk, I haven’t had a lifetime retrospective, you know? I’ve made a lot of stuff, but it’s not like I’m a Genesis P-Orridge or someone who’s had a lifetime body of work. The fact that people are interested enough in what has happened in this trajectory thus far, I’m really, really grateful for, and I just want to keep transcending sh-t. Anthony Obst Yeah. I find it, also, just very beautiful that, in that video... I mean, we’ve talked about poetry. We talked about acting. We talked about music where all of this, in a sense, also comes together and for you to, in a sense, kind of come back with that kind of statement where it really... I mean, this also comes into play with political aspects, political messages, into your music. So I think it’s really powerful that, also, everything comes together in that video. You’re mentioning your new album. Maybe... Mykki Blanco Yeah. Are we ready? Let’s wrap this up. Anthony Obst Yeah. You brought some tracks. Mykki Blanco Oh, god, yeah. Your butts are probably ready to get up, aren’t you? Anthony Obst I mean, I... Mykki Blanco I don’t know. Anthony Obst You mentioned it now, so we can go there. Maybe we find other things to talk about, and we’ll open it up to the audience also in a few minutes. Mykki Blanco OK. Yeah. Anthony Obst You said you wanted to play us something from your new album. Mykki Blanco Yeah. Since I found out that this is not... Like the music won’t be online, I’m going to just play you guys maybe one or two, if you want to hear the second one, of the new songs from the album that’s not going to come out... Well, the first single will be out in October. Let’s go. Anthony Obst Just briefly, before we take a few questions from the audience, what is important for you in a collaboration? Mykki Blanco I mean, I almost can never work just off the internet. I always have to be in the room with the person. You know what I mean? I think, if anything, the most important thing with me in a collaboration is that we just both kind of like are vibing on the composition. I’m not like a dictator in the studio. I’m working with this artist, because this artist can bring something that I don’t have... Or that I can learn from. So I just think it’s this give and take of like, honestly, letting them do their thing. Obviously, I’m going to go and edit and end up cleaning up what I think is appropriate for the track. But it’s that freedom of like... You know what I mean? I’m going to be honest, I’ve been a Saul Williams and a Devendra Banhart fan since I was damn near fricking learning how to masturbate. You know what I mean? It’s just like, to have a song where Devendra Banhart’s doing the intro to my f---ing track, I’m just like... Then to have a track where I’m literally spinning like poems with Saul Williams, it’s just like that’s, for me, like life-changing sh-t, you know? Anthony Obst Yeah. That’s awesome. Well, thank you for playing those tracks, Mykki, and thank you very much for this conversation. Please, everybody, give a warm round of applause to Mykki Blanco. Mykki Blanco Thank you all. [applause]

Title: Linn Da Quebrada

Linn Da Quebrada
Singer and multimedia artist Lina Pereira found a vessel for expression via the alias of Linn Da Quebrada. Emerging from the favelas of São Paulo in 2015, Pereira took inspiration from her friend Lineker, who fronts the soul band Liniker E Os Caramelows, and merged early experience in theater with baile funk. The result has been a blistering sound and live performances that aims to confront established notions of race, gender and sexuality by speaking directly to the political embedded in everyday life and actions. In 2018, Linn Da Quebrada released her debut album Pajubá and starred in the documentary Bixa Travesty, both of which explore her background, search for love and the desire to kill the man inside of her in order to be free.
In this public lecture in Lisbon, Linn Da Quebrada spoke at length about her personal philosophies, the socio-political importance of her work and the need for continued challenge of the status quo to achieve true change.
Hosted by Rui Miguel Abreu Today, I have next to me a very special person. One of those artists that I think has the strength to change the world. The topics we’ll be talking about in the next… I don’t want to limit time because we never know where conversations will lead us. Please give your applause to Linn da Quebrada. [applause] Welcome. Let’s start by trying to understand what is, in the end, a gender terrorist. Can you explain it? Linn Da Quebrada I’m going to try. Good evening everyone. It’s so good to see you again. Some of you I’ve seen other times here, in my comings and goings. I’m Lina Pereira, for those who don’t know me, also known as Linn da Quebrada, one of the parts which makes me. Well, in the beginning of my trajectory I talked much more about gender terrorism, right? But I keep believing, as a strategy, in terror and violence. Mainly because bodies as mine, and bodies as some of ours, are used to being treated with violence for all their trajectory. They are bodies where violence is almost the rule. For this reason, I think that I started realizing and knowing that Brazil is a country where we were taught, raised, persuaded and programed to be polite and to receive too, with so much cordiality, violence, right? To give the other cheek when we get a blow. I think that when I started questioning my behavior in this respect, I started understanding that violence could also be a weapon and that my body could be that weapon of war. That my body could serve not only as a battlefield but also as a kamikaze. By placing myself under scrutiny and at risk, since I was already in that risky position. So, I put not only myself at risk but also all this system, as I place under scrutiny the entire structure, right? And then I think that I point the gun to my own head, I risk my own existence, but I scrutinize this failed structure. This failed structure, this expired structure, and this structure which is in ruins. Because I feel that my body, in a certain way, gives testimony to these failed contours. Contours that don’t say… Didn’t predict my existence. They not only didn’t want for us to be alive but also didn’t expect we resisted for so long. This is exactly why I’m the gun pointed to my own head, pointed to each of us and to the whole system. This is what I understand by acting through terror. And now, this time, pointing terror to the system’s face, so to speak. Rui Miguel Abreu Wow. Linn Da Quebrada It’s what I try to do. I’m not saying that it is what necessarily happens. It is what I would like to do. Making them feel afraid. Since they made us feel fear for so long, now I would like to see them trembling. To see their shortness of breath as they feel we are getting closer. Rui Miguel Abreu You used the word fear and the question I was thinking about, and I’m already deviating from the script, while listening to you is, only those who are conscious about their own fear manifest courage, right? Otherwise it is not courage, it is solely madness. What are you afraid of? Linn Da Quebrada Look, honestly nowadays I think fear is a luxury. I cannot give myself the luxury of feeling fear. I feel anger. I feel a lot of anger. And I think that, in a certain way, anger brings us together, equips us and it makes us immune. Once I heard a transvestite, in Santo André, saying that we cannot give ourselves the luxury of feeling afraid. That we can have worries but not fear. Because if we were afraid we would not be risking ourselves this way. If I was afraid, I would have given up on myself a long time ago. And at the same time, I feel that it is precisely fear, right? The fear of death, that makes me fight so fervently for my own life. Rui Miguel Abreu Well, let’s change a little bit, but only slightly, the conversation. Before you were making the distinction between fear and worries which is a clever way to use words to say things that are, in fact, are being felt. It isn’t fear, it’s worry. And words have been an important vehicle for your message. A way to express your message through music. So, let’s talk a bit about music. When did you realize, and, Linda, you did theater, other things, right? When did you realize that music could be an effective vehicle to deliver that message to whom needed to receive it? Linn Da Quebrada I think that… My body has always been my main raw material in what concerns work. I think that it has always been the only thing that I had. The only way I had to communicate and also in what concerns my own solitude and my space in the world. I only had myself. And I think that music was a surprise. I never expected to be a singer. I think that I don’t necessarily have what is considered a good voice or a beautiful voice. I think that I even have a slightly sexy voice, right? But not necessarily what is expected to sing, to be a singer. And I found in music a possibility of being heard. I was living with Liniker. And when I saw her singing for the first time and when I saw what she could do with people around her, I said, “I want to do that too.” And not necessarily in the same frequency as she, but I realized that she was able to gain access to people through music but through a different path. Because Liniker she can say, sing, anything that she will be able to get to us. Due to a type of voice and frequency that crosses us. And I not necessarily have that frequency to be able to get to people but I knew that what I was saying, at least for me, was very important. So, I realized that music could be an access path. And I then started writing not for other people and this might seem a bit egoistical but I only did this for myself. I only started doing this because I needed to listen to those things. And more than needing it, I needed to be able to say those things. I needed to be able to say that repeatedly so I would believe in my own discourse. To make my music magic, a spell and in a way that the spell would turn against the sorcerer. Rui Miguel Abreu Interesting. But then there’s an aesthetic choice, right? It could have been samba, jazz, it could have been lyrical music. Why this music? How does one get to this music? Linn Da Quebrada I think that precisely by understanding what I needed to listen to, I realized that people talk about love exhaustively. That exhaustively there is a type of narrative construction that programs us, builds us, builds our affections, and builds our desires, in the same way. Music and arts in general are responsible, the way I see it, not only for the reproduction of the world as it is. For me art is not a mirror. Or maybe it is too in a certain way. But for me, I wanted to make art which could be a hammer. I wanted to make art that would break precisely the image I saw reflected in the mirror but that I did not recognize. I think that exactly then was when I realized that the things we sing about, the things we talk about repeatedly, make them feel that way. I think that from listening to love songs so much I was eager to love, I expected even more, much more, to be loved. And my anger, for realizing that my body did not have a space in this territory, made me want to make music that would destroy love and this sacred and profane territory. I think, then, that my aesthetical choice comes not necessarily as a form but as… Content. Content, I see, is not separated from the form but in its effect. I think that I kind of knew what I wanted to make as an effect. But I wanted to make inside myself. Because I knew I had a desire. Mainly a desire… Honestly, it was all because of love. It was all because I wanted to love and be loved. It was. It was more because of love than sexual drive. Precisely because of that I felt angry by desiring the same type of bodies and wanting to be desired by those bodies. My anger was, “Why don’t you desire me? After all, I think I’m not that bad, right?” But I think this made me want to deviate my desire. A question that stuck with me for a while was, a river if we image a river and realize that our desires are like a river. And a river has a current. It flows. So much that it can be very dangerous, right? There are rivers where you make a mistake and they are much deeper than what you imagined and the current can be much stronger even for someone who knows how to swim, right? So, if our desires are like a river and they flow in a natural way, my question to you is, is it possible to deviate the course of a river? Rui Miguel Abreu Science says so. Linn Da Quebrada [to audience] What do you think? What is that? It is possible but you can’t be sure. Because it depends on the soil conditions, it depends on the work that we are willing to make. Whether it is a sandy ground, an arid ground, if the river goes through a city… There are several things involved. If we can or not build new creeks and new creeks of affections so that we can think about irrigating affective zones that so far were desert, dry. I was dry and needed to be wet. Honestly, it was that. I make my music as a detour of this river and this affective creek, affective sex and, in a certain way, humorous. Rui Miguel Abreu Please allow me to use an expression you just used. What kind of music made you feel wet? What music inspired you? What music made you restless? Linn Da Quebrada There wasn’t any. Rui Miguel Abreu What were your references? Didn’t you collect references? Linn Da Quebrada I had references. Especially about what I didn’t want to make. Those were my main references, including, forgive my sister, I love Liniker, but that was not what I wanted to do. Because it wasn’t about that kind of love I wanted to sing but, honestly, that was what I wanted to feel. And that appalled me. That revolted me deeply and precisely because of that, for not having a reference on what I would like to listen to, I started writing the things I wanted to listen to. I started trying to make the things I would like to sing and listen to. Rui Miguel Abreu Even so, and after a lot of insistence from me, when I asked Linda to choose a song outside her direct sphere it was Liniker that she chose, right? One word about that artist? Linn Da Quebrada Intimacy. I think Liniker was responsible for… She was a person who taught me a lot and to whom I was able to teach a lot too. We shared a lot of things and we survived the São Paulo jungle together. We served as support, we built an affective, financial, material, economic concrete net. What we built was something real. A psychological net. We needed each other to be alive, really. So… Rui Miguel Abreu “Intimidade” by Liniker. (music: Liniker – “Intimidade”) Let’s talk about music and resistance, activism, about that never-ending fight against prejudice. If a live show, a concert, is a performance, and masks are always important in performance, my question is, don’t you fear that your message might be misunderstood. Or, on the contrary, if you feel that the stage is like a magnifying glass that amplifies everything that you say. Do you ever feel that what you are communicating while holding a microphone on stage gets lost? Linn Da Quebrada Before that I want to talk about something before, in my view. For example, it always bothers me when there is talk about our work as only activism or resistance. Why? Yes, I certainly think my work is an activist work, it’s a work of resistance. But if we conceive an activist work as linked to activity, and resistance linked to action, why don’t we consider all other musical and artistic productions also as an activity of resistance against conservatism, against resisting to changes, resisting to transformations. All work is political, all songs and artistic pieces have a fundamental role in the construction of the present, in the construction of what we have been building during this and other historical moments. All songs have this role. Those which talk about love can make, or not, things stay as they have always been. Rui Miguel Abreu True. Linn Da Quebrada And I believe… That my work or my performance materializes on stage. Because I think it’s a matter of vocabulary. I remember when I was trying to explain to my mother what I was. And when I was trying to explain to her what I was, I was trying to explain it to myself as well. I was trying, through the materialization of words, to make her understand. That was when I understood that to make her understand I needed to access her vocabulary. The words she had as reference and what those words meant to her, and from there to transform that vocabulary or transform that meaning. Those words, right? I feel that most people, when listening to my songs at home they get the words I use through their own references of those words. But, still, this is reconstructed through a context. Rui Miguel Abreu So there is no wrong way of understanding music? Linn Da Quebrada No. No because this is it. Our vocabulary, our references, we are talking about referentiality. What I am doing is to dispute, don’t fool yourselves. This is not a show. Maybe it is a show masked as dispute. This, here, is dispute. For many of us, it might look like, in these game of lights, more scenic or more cynical. More iconic or not. But this here, for me, is a power dispute. It is a language dispute and it is a sex dispute. It is a dispute for my own body. On stage I think that I take on this role in an even more evident and transparent way. Because there I transform, more than transform, I give my body to my songs. I give voice to my words and I transform them in substance. From that, I think I’m able to create a more transparent, physical dialogue through my own references. I think that during my performances I’m able to translate my songs better. But still, I’m totally aware, and that is exactly why it is so important to me the choice of every word. I sing exactly everything I would like to sing. Each word I chose is exactly the work I wanted to say even though gay, transvestite, woman, [these words] have so many distinct meanings for us, and for others who are not in this room they might have different meanings. Because if I say “woman” what picture comes to your minds? When I say “home,” when I say “man,” when I say “territory,” when I say “chair.” An image comes to our mind. That image has color, format. That woman has a size, she has hair or not, she has a color on her skin, she has an economic status. And this is what builds our references in such a diverse… Because there are women, and there is womanhood, there are bodies and corporality. Different and with different effects and affections over us. Because of that I believe that when I make a song it ceases to be my song and it becomes ours, in a certain manner. Each one of us builds the meaning of these songs in accordance with their references. But when I make a show, a performance, and when I establish my dispute territory there I’m able to give my meaning. More than my meaning, I can set my position in front of all those people standing there and I try to build a common meaning. Because we are all very different, even only in this room we can see that. There are Brazilians, there are queer people, there are women, there are lesbians. Where are the transvestite inside this room? Where are the trans men and so many other trans-corporalities which exist? And all these make up a referential of different worlds, right? I think that in my show I’m able, or I try, to, even though we are so different, build a common ground. A starting point. Not our final objective but a place where we start from. Someone once said that masks are what we wear all day long and that the stage is where we take off our masks. Or not, right? It is where we assume even more our masks. I don’t think masks are a problem. There are more expensive masks, there are less expensive masks, there are masks which easily break when they fall. Many masks fall and it is important that that is so. It is important that we put on other masks. I have many masks because sometimes I don’t know if I recognize myself in the mask that I have been using. And I cannot promise you for how long I’ll keep recognizing myself as Linn Da Quebrada. I cannot promise you that I’ll remain still. I cannot promise you that I’ll think and have this exact opinion in a few years, in a few days, or right after I leave this room. I grant myself the right to doubt, the right to transit, the right to life. For that I need to be present and I need to take on my own limitations. I grow, I diminish, I shrink in certain places. During a show, on stage, I’m very brave. Now, in certain places I’m not. I’m not Linn da Quebrada all the time. I don’t have courage all the time. I don’t have courage all the time. I try to convince myself so I’m not afraid but sometimes I am. I’m afraid of dying, I’m afraid of not being loved. I’m afraid of all this admiration which was build around Linn Da Quebrada. And I’m afraid that Linn Da Quebrada erases Lina Pereira. I’m afraid that Linn Da Quebrada becomes so strong that few people know Lina Pereira, with all her fragilities, all her limitations, who was responsible for the birth of Linn Da Quebrada. Linn Da Quebrada was born only from my fragilities, from my limits, from everything that I wanted to be and I was not. And for that I needed to take on Linn Da Quebrada’s mask. Rui Miguel Abreu Just now, I found it intriguing that when you referred to your mother you used the past tense. “I was trying to explain my mother, in her own words, who I was.” Not who you are now? I thought. That transformation is continuous and it does not stop. It’s a continuous task of finding a path, is that it? Linn Da Quebrada I believe so. I change my mind a lot. Man, I change my mind a lot. I don’t know already if I agree with all these things that I just said. But yes, I think that I’m in transit, I’m in trance with myself. I see myself in the mirror, and I constantly ask myself “who am I?”. I really am always asking myself. All this changes. I don’t know. This is all very new. I don’t know if you have an idea. I do what I do for a long time. I exist for a very long time. I doubt myself for a long time, right? But Linn Da Quebrada she was born in 2015. Four years ago. came to Europe for the first time last year. Until then I had barely left São Paulo state. Each of these places, these territories and the people I crossed paths with, transformed me. It is impossible to remain the same after encounters like this one. It is impossible to remain the same after a tour, a trans-tour, without being transformed. I prefer to, I want to be transformed. I want that disruption because I want to become many things. I want to change my mind much more times. But yes, that is a continuous task. It is arduous work. All this makes me feel things differently. There was a time, I never expected this… I think I’m living. I never dreamed of this, to be honest, I never even dreamed. I never dreamed about Linn Da Quebrada. I never dreamed about being a singer. I wanted to be a dancer. When I started I wanted to dance. I wanted to have the right to my own body. Music was a surprise, I never expected any of this and as these things started to happen I came to realize that they were completely different from all that I could have imagined. I didn’t dream. I made things. I don’t dream. Man, I don’t even sleep. If I’m being honest, I don’t have time to sleep. So instead of sleeping, I make things happen. And I don’t do these things alone. They are completely different from anything that I could have imagined. They make me rethink if this is really the place where I would like to be. I think it is important that we give ourselves this right to doubt and that we ask this to ourselves. Because most times I think these places for being a diva are harmful as they are so close to spaces for gods. These spaces for icons that we built in a 2D picture. Still pictures. I’m not like that. I think that this creates and replicates a social imaginary of the world which is already worn out. The idolatry, idols, our way of worshiping, our way of cultivating culture,
all that we cultivate, is old, has expired. In most of the times it is not so good for us. That sacred representation is very important because many of us did not have role models who represented us. I didn’t have one. I have Linn Da Quebrada. Nowadays I even think that she’s too much, right? I think these spaces for representation are dangerous. Because these spaces they place us like this. Structurally like this. Distant. And this says so much about ourselves. Because this separates us and makes us feel more comfortable because now, now I have someone who represents me. Now I have someone who is doing something for me. “Go, kill it, my icon. Without flaws. Never making a mistake.” And in this way, we build images which are far from us and that put the responsibility in other people. Honestly, I cannot carry this responsibility alone. And I don’t want to carry this responsibility. It would be unfair on my side to impair the responsibility each of you has in this historical moment we are building. People, this is very important. I think that everyone can understand that we are living a critical moment. A very important moment. We are living in a crisis moment. Beyond what is disseminated through the media and social networks, underneath the makeup and all the editing we use in our media outlets, we are living in a very important critical moment. I love crisis. I have lived in crisis. I made myself in crisis. And it is exactly because of this that I know that it is during a crisis that we have the possibility of transforming everything. Maybe you came here for any other reason, to meet Linn Da Quebrada, to see how courageous she is, to feel inspired, but I’m here to tell you that you are responsible for everything that we are doing. Don’t be distracted with Linn Da Quebrada. Don’t be distracted with Linn Da Quebrada. This is very important. I’m not here to distract anyone. At the most I’m here to destroy. Rui Miguel Abreu I think that deserves an applause, am I right? [applause] Linn Da Quebrada Applause are this failed structure. We don’t need applause. Boo me. I want to be booed. Please everyone. [boos] Rui Miguel Abreu It’s the same thing. Do you know something, Lina? I love the pauses you take. When you go looking for the next word because you always want to say the right thing. I think that is an incredible luxury. Changing topics, I’ve learned almost everything that I don’t know about Brazil, a little bit on the school books that I’ve already forgotten, through records. And a little bit in the soap operas my mother had permanently on. Linn Da Quebrada You learned everything wrong. Rui Miguel Abreu Yes, exactly. But at least in the records, in Jorge Ben’s, Tim Maia’s, in the Black Rio movement, I built an apparently wrong idea, listening to you speaking, certainly wrong of Brazil like a case of successful integration, a case of unusual harmony between what was white and what was black. It isn’t really like it, isn’t it? Have I been mistaken all this time? Linn Da Quebrada I believe so. I also believe that Brazil is so many things. On this talk there are Brazilians who can tell me that. Brazil is so plural. Brazil is so diverse, mainly I think because of having so much people, right? There is so much people in a small territory. If we think of Portugal. How many inhabitants has Portugal? Rui Miguel Abreu Tenmillion. Linn Da Quebrada Ten million inhabitants. How many has São Paulo, one city? 20 million. Do you realize? It is a lot of people. And at the same time, there are few people thinking and building thoughts for so many people. This is exactly where the risk lies. There are people thinking for so many others. There are few people thinking collectively. That’s dangerous. If these people were acting collectively, in person, on their own time, things would be very different. Or not. You can’t be sure. Once more, here my utopian side comes out. Brazil is much more than samba. Brazil is much more than funk. It is these things too but it is something beyond that. It is beyond funk. It is beyond samba. It is beyond soap operas. It is beyond songs. It is beyond the history written in books. It was precisely for that, for not seeing myself… Honestly people, now I’m going to tell you something that I just remembered. Jupi always told me in the beginning, because she knew why I was doing all that, you want to know the truth? I did not allow myself to think all the things I was thinking and for those things not to be spread. I did not allow my history to be deleted. I’m very close to myself. Really, I am. I think this, in fact, isn’t bad. That we are connected to our history. Maybe the majority of you can see yourselves in the books. Maybe you know where you came from. I never knew. And when I knew, look at where we are, that you discovered Brazil. Look at that! Portugal, Pedro Álvares Cabral? That’s it, right? The one who discovered Brazil. And today, coincidentally, we have a show with MC Carol that tells us in a transparent way that, don’t take me wrong, but who discovered Brazil was not Cabral. And Portugal is even one of those responsible for our historical construction of invasion and violence which makes our history one to be deleted and disguised. It is exactly because of that that me, by occupying this space, is something so important. Because this here is not a favor, this is a settling of scores. I came to take what is mine. I came to take what is ours. And applauses are not necessary. They are not necessary. This is not what this is about. It’s about thinking that many times applauses distract us and prevent us from receiving the cruelty of what I’m saying. This is cruel. This has effects until today. It has not passed. Our history continues to be built and you need to take responsibility. You have an historical debt towards me. For that reason I’m here. To charge and to leave this noted. I demand what is mine and ours back. I don’t know if I answered the question but… [laughs] Rui Miguel Abreu In what a way. There are many references, including some which were already given here today, to the idea or maybe to the reality of the body in its art. Today, thinking about this, I thought about a thinker, a man who was important, a communication philosopher, one of those who formed or deformed me in university, Marshall McLuhan who, in the ’60s when we started to discuss all these computers, TV and radio, said that the medium was the message. In your case, the body is the message itself? I said I love the pause. Linn Da Quebrada I love it too. I think it will even be nice in the video. Me thinking, looking up, taking advantage of this light on my face. I believe so. I believe that the body is my message. My voice is my body. My discourse tells the course I want to build. The course of these rivers and creeks. I think that my thoughts are a body. Our thoughts are body. Maybe our notion of body is outdated and in ruins. Because we build an idea of body more and more individualistic and isolated. We see ourselves more and more as independents. I think this idea of independence is total bullshit. I think that what we experience is a co-dependency. Even when we’re talking about affective relationships and others, we create an idea that we have to be independent, that we have to have an affective independence. For me, I don’t know about you, this is impossible. I wouldn’t do anything of what I’m currently doing if I was completely independent. I am completely dependent on the people who work with me. I’m entirely dependent on the people who buy my work. I’m completely dependent on the media, be it mainstream media or the underground media we’ve been creating. I think that, inside all this, we created an idea about the bodies as independents which isolates us from the world and strips out our commotional side. I’ve been talking more and more about commotion. If my body is my discourse, my discourse is constructed collectively with bodies that agree with what I say and those who disagree with it. What I’m doing, what I’m building as a discourse isn’t fiction. I’m inventing, I’m creating? Yes, I love to invent fashion, but what I do isn’t fictional work. What I do and build is frictional work.
It’s work build through friction. Friction between our bodies, between our stories, between our points of view. It is precisely on this that I realize that while we conceive our corporality as an independent thing, we are losing the possibility of becoming moved. Especially those who live or lived in São Paulo, they understand this. We are increasingly insensitive but for me it’s not even that, it’s about this other sensitivity which is built. We don’t feel touched, we aren’t moved with what is next to us. Those who live here don’t have this idea of having a social death marker so explicitly in front of them, of seeing people living with absolutely nothing and not feeling moved whatsoever. For me, to be moved is to act collectively. This is to be moved. It’s our ability to act collectively. And for us, in this idea of isolation, while the problem does not directly affect us, our body, our discourses, it will not move me. Something only moves me if it affects me as an individual or a group. If something doesn’t affect me or my people, I will not be moved by it. I think this is where I’ve been trying to reconstruct my idea of corporality and discourse. Because I’m no longer the body I used to be. Today the risks I face are different. The needs and the limits I now have are different. Thanks to Linn Da Quebrada. Linn Da Quebrada moved me. She moved me and many others like me. But this made me stop being moved for other reasons. I no longer go through those situations. Do you understand what I’m saying or am I just tripping? Rui Miguel Abreu You’re tripping but we are alongside you. Linn Da Quebrada I think this is the way. Got it? That’s it. [laughter] Rui Miguel Abreu Let’s hear the song. (music: Unknown) In some of the interviews that I checked out before this talk, you said that in your fight, or maybe I should use a word that was highlighted here today, your dispute is for the conquest of a place in the society’s imagination. Just now you mentioned that all this is very new. In 2015, 2016 you start taking your first steps. What have you conquered so far? Do you feel that you are in a different place comparing to where you were when you started this dispute, this path? Linn Da Quebrada Totally. Rui Miguel Abreu A lot has changed already? Linn Da Quebrada A lot has changed. I feel that a lot has changed for me, economically, materially. Specifically, in what concerns my relationships, affectively, psychologically. All that has changed. People say that our cells… I always share this information but I never checked if it’s true but I’ll share it again. People say our cells, all our body cells, they renew every seven years. And even though less than seven years have passed, I already feel that all my body cells have transformed. I don’t know if there is a single thing from before that still remains in my body. I think that if I use a sponge there will only be dead cells. And something completely new was born. Why? Because economically we’ve been creating other opportunities to survive. For those who live here in Portugal for a long time, things are really different, am I right? It’s really different. In Brazil, we worked and still work, and many of us who aren’t me, work without earning money. Let’s talk proper Portuguese. Without earning money. They work because they really need to do that. I remember when I started doing my performances for 50 Reals. Let convert it, how many euros is that? Ten euros, right? Ten little euros for performing all night long. And I thought I was making a profit because I could buy my two-way ticket and have a few drinks during the night. I thought that that was enough for me. In fact, I didn’t think it was enough but I was going by with that and I was satisfied with that. Economically everything changed. Not for all of us. You see, I’m in a privileged position. Not the position where I think we deserve to be. I think that we should be occupying other economic territories. We are not sufficiently valued for the importance of our work. And it bothers me when they place us as militants, as activists, because this seem to be social work which doesn’t deserve compensation. On this issue, I get really pissed. I get extremely nervous because all this work is political and social. In a certain way it is for the system. Why do the jobs which reiterate the system exactly as it already is deserve compensation and we, that do social work for a new system, a new construction, don’t deserve to be compensated, right? We are in an economic transformation but there’s a long way to go. In terms of affections, I feel I’ve been occupying other territories. I’ve been feeling other things. This is something I wanted to live because I was tired of always feeling the exact same thing. I got to the conclusion that… Not that there will be a point in time in which no one will have problems, it’s not that, but it’s time we experience other problems. We’ve been living the same problems for so long. We’ve been feeling the same things for so long. For so many generations. In different ways but problems get reinstalled and we realize everything is cyclical. Coming back, why did I realize we’re living such a critical and important moment? It is always in crisis. If we look at history it seems that we’re living in an eternal déjà vu because all this has happened in different proportions. Others like us had already been through it. I’m not a pioneer. I’m just using the words of others. I’m just updating our vocabulary. We had Marsha P. Johnson, we had Dzi Croquettes, Claudio, we had the Black Panthers, we had innumerous movements who stirred their times and built their present. But every time these groups gained territory, the conservative group, as a spoiled little boy who was used to win everything, sees someone taking his presents and rebels because he is losing territory. The white colonist male, foreman, the landowner, who thinks he is always ahead but lives backwards. He rebels and fights for his territory, for the right to his own territory. This has happened many times before. It is precisely on this that they try and they use an old strategy, the fear strategy. They try to make us feel afraid, they try to make us doubt of our won strength and ability to revolt. Once more, in that situation, music is, I feel, largely responsible for social anesthesia. And love is one of the main ingredients that keep us distracted in our little bourgeois problems. In this case, instead of understanding what has happened to us socially, I’m very worried about love. I’m worried with my own relationships within my home and within my private environment. This distracts us and destroys our collective ability to understand what is happening in our society. I forgot the question already. What was it? Rui Miguel Abreu We were talking about the societal imaginary, the space in our minds. Linn Da Quebrada That’s it. Everything I said, right? Rui Miguel Abreu Right. Let’s talk about Pajubá. What is it? How was it born? What ideas did you have in its starting point? How was it to execute that vision? Linn Da Quebrada I’ll continue talking about the same thing I’ve been talking about but disguised as Pajubá, alright? Rui Miguel Abreu As politicians do. Linn Da Quebrada Exactly. As we do as political beings. So, in disguise, let’s talk about Pajubá. I did all this, for me all is connected. I did it because I wanted to be loved. I did it for sexual desire. I wanted to have a relationship because I was alone, I was tired of my solitude and I realized that I was alone but not lonely. Things are more complex than that. But I was alone because I kept looking for the same bodies, I wanted to be recognized as a body capable of being loved. By him, the almighty. Male, magnanimous. I wanted him to notice me. I wanted to occupy love’s territory because I was told that what makes us human is love. You can have nothing in life. You can be poor for your entire life. Movies told me so. Music told me that. Everything we need is love. What makes us human and what makes us have a valid experience during life is living love. I wanted so much to love and be loved. Pajubá was born from this but with a different purpose. I realized that love is one of the main tools for maintaining the current system. Love builds ties, bonds, affections which generate effects, which construct families that live in houses, that divide money, that create a social and economic net in which people help their loved ones. First of all, I’ll help those I love. Only then I’ll look at the rest of the world. Once more, our problems. Small and bourgeois. And there’s a line which isn’t weak, it’s very strong, between the bodies which were made and raised to be loved and the bodies which won’t enter this kingdom. If we understand and closely look at this, we will realize that men were made and raised to be loved. Women, womanhood was made and raised to love men. Movies show us this. What is the drama or great adventure of a female body in a movie? The great adventure, the great conquest of a woman in almost all movies is her attaining what? Getting the guy. She spends the entire movie trying to be loved while most of the male characters conquer the world, gain money, conquer land, fight, make war. This builds our affections, right? I realized that love is this tool for the maintenance of the system, that if we were made in God’s image and God is love, then it is necessary to destroy love. If it is necessary to destroy love and God is love. God, this beautiful word. God. I love God. God is a word built from the self. Then maybe, not maybe, for sure, it’s necessary to have courage to kill in you what constantly perpetuates things as they have always been. To have the courage to kill and to die. That you kill and die. Kill and die. Kill and die. Kill the white colonizer, landowner, foreman male within you. He who thinks he lives always ahead but lives backwards. Kill and die. Kill and die. Kill and die and that you feel the strength of my ancestors. And this how I made Pajubá. Killing and dying. Killing inside myself. And I keep killing. Continuously. Sometimes, yes, we hesitate to kill something that we believe makes us what we are. It is almost as we had a third leg, a third leg which makes us a stable tripod. A third leg that gives us stability and security. We see and find ourselves with this third leg. But this third leg also keeps us still. It keeps us as a stable tripod that doesn’t move. Sometimes, it is necessary to have the courage to cut off this third leg that gives us so much security and stability and that makes us what we already are, so that we can acquire the ability to move again. The big question is that with the same speed that we cut off this third leg, others are born right away. It’s a continuous motion of cutting off these third legs. Some of them are already old and necrotic and we leave them there because it’s easier for us. Sometimes they aren’t even useful. They give us effects and affections which we have no use for. Nothing. But it takes courage to cut them off. I’m still in this continuous process. Song after song, trying to understand which is the third leg I have to cut off. Which legs am I attached to. If this is the third leg I have to cut off or if this is the new leg that I have to keep. It’s a self-analysis and continuous process. Pajubá was this. It was this action of looking at the mirror and kill inside myself. I didn’t point the gun to others, as people think. People see my interviews where I say that I built my music as a weapon. But it’s a weapon pointed to my own head. I wanted to kill inside myself the desire for a male. I wanted to kill my racist desire. I needed to see inside myself what was already rotten. I needed to see inside myself my collateral affections so that I could wipe them out. Rui Miguel Abreu Is there more people with that same consciousness? In what point of the Brazilian contemporary musical map are you? Are you alone, are you an island? Are you an archipelago? Are there other voices looking for the same and pointing guns to their own heads to? Maybe tonight there’s another Brazilian artist in a stage very close by. Are there other artists with whom you feel this connection at this point? Linn Da Quebrada For sure. And not necessarily only musicians. There are a lot of ways to deconstruct collective thought. What interests me is that this encounter here is a way of building collective thoughts and that we realize that my body is political but the body of each of us here today is as political as mine. Rui Miguel Abreu Why? Linn Da Quebrada Art, for me, is not about being here. I could be there with you, in the same territory because I feel we’re together. It was nothing to do with these lights pointed out to my face. For me, to be an artist is about having the possibility to create something about our own existence. The possibility of creating something about our relationships. All of us have this possibility. The first time I realized this was through my performances, I was still doing theater and I was experimenting a lot in the rehearsal room. I started to realize that there is where Linn Da Quebrada sometime has a certain level of hysteria not for herself bur for the structure of relationships. On stage, most times, this is allowed. Mainly because of what? The majority of you, I hope, like Linn Da Quebrada, right? Who likes Linn Da Quebrada? If you say no… You don’t like her? Jesus! Who then likes Linn Da Quebrada? But would you like Linn Da Quebrada if she wasn’t an artist? If she wasn’t the singer? Would you have interest in Lina Pereira? They’re the same person. They are the same body. But is it, then, that what makes you get closer to a transvestite black body is only the fact that it’s in the allowed space and, in a certain way, slightly more aseptic, the stage? How many of you know a transvestite? Who knows them from being friends, from actually knowing their problems and issues? From kissing them in the face? From really having a profound bond with them. I’m not talking about knowing them because you saw them in a certain place, on the street. “Sometimes I pass by them and I even wave them.” With how many trans people, black people, do you really have a relationship? With how many transvestite and black people do you work? This isn’t a rhetorical question. No one? Zero. One. Works more or less, right? So, I think it’s about this. People, I’m talking about concrete things. My work, my performance is concrete. It’s material. It’s symbolic, it’s extremely symbolic, but it’s concrete. Understand your relationships, and there’s where courage is needed, and when you play the colonizer male role. Kill the male in you. Kill the white person in you. Kill the colonizer in you and in your relationships. Sexual, affective, material, economical. Understand where you act politically and reiterate things as they have always been and are. Once more, I got lost. Rui Miguel Abreu You didn’t get lost, Linn Da, I think that your speech is a bomb that is making a lot of things explode. My head’s on fire. Let’s hear your bomb, Linn Da Quebrada “Bomba.” (music: Linn Da Quebrada – “Bomba Pra Caralho”) It blew up. Linn Da Quebrada Several times makes more sense, right? Rui Miguel Abreu Shortly you’ll have the opportunity to ask questions to Linn Da, but before that, one last thing from me. In the middle of that dispute, that path, that way, is there a place for hope, I wonder? Can you, considering the point where you started that trajectory and where you stand now, glimpse any light for the future? More harmony, more peace, a more blended world, more tolerant, more open. Is there a space for that? Or this is something that will never happen? Linn Da Quebrada No. There’s no space for hope. Hope keeps us waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Peace is white. All these are tools for keeping us waiting, right? Of keeping us in the same exact spots, believing that maybe in another life, after we die, we’ll be compensated. Because it is necessary the we have hope, that we believe in peace, that we give the other cheek so that they can also hit us. This is how they manipulate, program and control us. I don’t have time for love. I don’t have time for hope. I don’t have time for peace. I don’t even have the possibility of glimpsing a better future. What I have is anger to stir the present. I think that anger is an engine and something that unites us. If we pay attention, we’ll realize that all of us feel angry and that at every moment, for a long time, everyone tries to make us ignore our anger and free space for love. Love is so cute, right? I don’t have time for that and I think we need to organize our anger. We need to position us and take on a place in the present. No longer waiting that in the future things will change. Logically, things are built. Maybe, unfortunately, it won’t be now that I’ll experience all the things I would like to experience together with my people. This hurts. I tell you, I get nervous. I wanted to be calm but I see that we’ll have to do a lot, for much longer and without seeing where all this goes but knowing that we are doing it now. What is the role you’re taking on now in the construction of this historical moment? You. You. You. What is the role? What is your political action? Do you have hope? Rui Miguel Abreu She asked you the question, now it’s up to you to answer. There’s a mic which can circulate in the room. You only have to raise your arm and the mic will magically materialize in your hand. audience member Hello, good evening, Lina, Linn Da. Talking about hope and political movement, without wanting to verbalize concretely what we all know, I want to ask if you think that your music, in the exact moment your anger wants to change, can make something for Brazil which we all love but that now is going through moments that aren’t that hopeful for all of us. Linn Da Quebrada If I’m not doing that already please let me know, people. Because for me, I’m already doing it that. Once more, I think that this moment is important, is necessary. For how much longer will we keep unclogging the blockage, preventing an explosion? Causing it to have little water but we’ll find a way and thing will keep working. In a fragile way but they’ll keep working. For how much longer will we continue waiting for things to happen and not allowing the blockage to explode? And that everyone feels the effects so that things change? I think that Brazil and the world, I don’t know the entire world but I’ve been travelling and I’ve been realizing that this has been happening globally. Portugal, and now Spain, have been some of the only countries where there’s still a leftist government or one which is not from the right wing. The rest of the world has experienced an advance, it’s not even an advance it’s a setback, of conservatism. This is because they’re afraid. Because they have access to the media, they can manipulate our thoughts, the construction of our thoughts. This, in a certain way, is clandestine. Not everyone has access to this type of information but you have, I have. It is my obligation, it is our duty to contaminate, in any way, other people with the virus of doubt, do you see? It’s my responsibility to do this with my music? Yes. I’m doing it. I think I’m doing it. I’m travelling the whole world with a movie, doing a thousand things, with a show, with my music. I’m trying to communicate in every possible way my point of view. I’m not saying I’m right. I never wanted to be right. But I’m looking for other thoughts, other world projects. I’m looking for other word projects and a thought construction that give us action paths. For that, I feel that we’re living in an enabling moment. More enabling than this moment… People, everything is happening and I have been doing all this. Together with me there are so many people acting with thoughts that are corrosive against the system. I’m not alone. If I would be alone I wouldn’t be here. But don’t you think it’s very interesting that, even though tradition is establishing itself with so much strength, there is so much contradiction at the same time? Isn’t it curious that this happens? I think it’s useful that we take this moment. audience member Linn, I study performative arts and creativity and it’s weird to say this now but you are the subject of my case study for my thesis. Linn Da Quebrada From abject to object, right people? See? Changes. audience member I’m studying language as a performance and I want to know if you have any special remark on that. I’m focusing specifically on the word queer as a term which comprises all identities. Do you have an opinion about this word? There are many critics and alternatives to the word queer because it’s an Anglo-Saxon word that comes from US liberal theory. So, what do you think about the word? I saw interviews where you said you have some reservations about these words which intend to encompass everything. Linn Da Quebrada No, I don’t like the word queer. Especially in what concerns my body. I’m not queer. I’m black, I’m transvestite. I make up the terms which reflect me. I realize that queer is a very academic term. It tries to diagnose the bodies that, most of the times, aren’t in academia. The bodies which lie in the margins. These bodies, as you said, leave an abject field to enter an object field of research. I’m the object of my own research and my own experience. I’m the subject of myself. I think that for these and other reasons I don’t get in the queer boat. In Brazil, as far as I know the word queer isn’t used. There’s the word crazy though, right? Rui Miguel Abreu One more? audience member Hi Linn, hi everyone. I just want to say that I’m a huge fan. I was in São Paulo in 2016 and I saw the show you gave in Virada Cultural. I think it’s great to see you again three years after that. You’re more and more inspiring. This is not even a question. Linn Da Quebrada Thank you. Thank you so much. Don’t make questions about your TCC. I’ll credit you on my TCC. audience member I saw in past interviews you talking about the importance of creating an affective, psychological, material, economical support net, about resistance as a way and in the trajectory to that you call on your people. I wanted to better understand what this means for you in practice. How do you do this on a daily basis? Linn Da Quebrada Look, that’s a very good question. I try to work with these people, I try to have affective relationships with these people, sexually even if they want to be part of my network too. Jokes aside, I really try to get closer and make something concrete. Since the time I was doing theater, I work with people who I believe share my thoughts and with whom I also have disagreements. Working with people with whom we don’t necessarily agree about everything. I try to create a net so that we can survive. There’s Jupi who works with me a lot. There’s Tiago from my theater times. There’s a lot of people. I’ve been trying to understand my relationships, be it sexual or emotional, and to whom do I give my availability, my interest. Because, honestly, it’s a privilege to be by my side. It’s a privilege to be part of it. I can’t let anyone have this privilege and drain it, you know? That’s why it is so important for me to choose the people who are and will continue to be part of my life. With whom I’ll share thoughts. And not only for them but also because these people also influence me. I need to have by my side people who contribute to my process. I frequently bring together people to work with me. Those people are still part of my life. They are people who change my way of thinking and connecting. This is concrete for me. It’s not only at the level of people I study and admire. I work with the people I admire. I love the people I admire. I climb with them. Not with all of them because they don’t want it, if they want to I could also do it. Rui Miguel Abreu One more. audience member Hello, I was stuck on something that you said when you spoke about your mother When you said that when you told your mother who you were you were careful and used words that she understood and maybe you filtered the way you were speaking so that she could understand. I think that on stage you don’t have any filters. Linn Da Quebrada I do. They’re different filters. audience member Or that, they’re different filters. I wanted to understand what you do in your daily life if someone who’s different from you talks with you and, out of mere curiosity, wants to know you better. How do you balance who you are and all that’s yours while trying to speak more like the other person so that he also understands? Linn Da Quebrada Alterity, right? Academically, they call it that. Who saw my movie Bixa Travesty? Who saw it understands the way I speak with my mother. It’s not that I have a filter or I’m careful. On the contrary, most people say I’m not careful. I don’t underestimate my mother. I think this is the thing. It was very important to me. Our processes build us, right? I didn’t grow up with my mother. We were abandoned by my father, as most women and mothers in Brazil. Like a reproduction of the Holy Mary, Mother of God mythology. Virgins who have children from the Holy Spirit, absent fathers. I’m one of these fruits. Pleased to meet you. I’m not Jesus but I’m the new Eve. I only went to live with my mother when I was 12 years old because she had to work as she works until today as a maiden and I had to live with my aunt. Out of necessity and I’m not saying this so you pity me, we don’t need the pity of any of you, we’re alive by our own merit. Precisely because of that, before seeing my mother as a mother, I saw her as a woman. I didn’t receive affection from my mother, I didn’t have any of that. Maybe seeing the movie there’s much more things that now make sense. For example, a scene with my mom where I was looking for rituals and things that would bring us closer. Because I didn’t have it naturally. That made me saw her as a woman, black, northeastern, fighter, warrior, hard worker. I understood my mother as a woman and I realized the burden that being a mother meant to her. I demystified all this. Because of this I speak with her as my mother but mostly as a woman. For that, I try to say things in a way she understands and if she doesn’t understand I’ll try to build a vocabulary and a dialogue she can understand. Since the narratives that were given to her made her believe that being black isn’t something bad. What is not the same as saying that being black is something easy. I had to build a dialogue so that she could understand it, so that she could understand that the way she talks about poverty and about all that we’ve been through was for us to appreciate money. This is a romanticized idea that makes us cling and conform to our situation. Hopeful that things change. I tell her this in a way that I know she can understand. I know this takes time. I think that until today my mother doesn’t understand how I earn money. I don’t know if she understands but she has been to shows, I called her on stage. The son of her boss made her an Instagram account and she sees all my stories, all that I say, all that I do I don’t filter it but from the things she sees and doesn’t understand, I try to build a dialogue so she can feel included in what I’m saying. About sex, sexuality, a lot of things. One thing I came to realize is how many people disguise the violence they go through so that they are less painful. My mother went through a lot of violence. Women from my family went through a lot of violence. But she would talk about it while laughing, kind of like I do, laughing about my own trajectory so that I can accept it, so it is less painful. And I learned that with my mother too. But somethings I feel that… I don’t… I don’t mislead her, I don’t underestimate her so that she doesn’t understand the violence, but I build these narratives in a fair way for her now that she is 66 years old, you know? Being the northeastern that she is, having been through all that she went through. So that she can understand, for example, why she is lonely, why she’s alone as a woman now, why she feels helpless. So I think this is it, I’m honest. I’m sincere and cruel with my mom. Rui Miguel Abreu Linn Da Quebrada. [applause]
